disappointed This product was so disappointing that I discarded the entire box after trying one bar There are much better raw food bars on the market in terms of both nutrition and taste 
No food item returns to Amazon Sickly weak queasy stomach feeling after eating the bar for 4 hours or more Sickly weak queasy stomach after eating the bar for 4 hours or more I havent felt so yuky and sickly in a long time You cannot return these or any food items to Amazon The Coconut was moist and tender yet no good flavor Taste smells of cheap food grade oil The Spirulina is too try and chalky too much dried Spirulina in one bar Again bad taste no good alive flavor Spirulina and Cashew Coconut Agave Nectar Elisha elishachristian earthlink ne 
very misleading name Silly me I assumed that these bars would taste like spirulina and cashews but the only ingredient you can taste in them or any of their other flavors is DATES If you really love dates go for it Otherwise forget it 
slim jims no good I agree with the person who said it s hard to chew and here is why Disect your slim jim length ways there do you see the hair It is allegedly all made of cow hair gross That is the beef part I guess Trans fat partially hydrogenated veg oil and some really long word chemicals to make mechanically separated beef and chicken what looks like hair taste good no thanks glad I did not buy 100 My dog really likes it but then again she eats other dog s p p EEWWW 
How the heck do you chew Slim Jims Slim Jims may taste ok but that s because they are so greasy That s what helps the flavor I can t figure out why anyone would like these as I can t seem to chew them to a point where I feel comfortable to swallow It s like eating a really really tough piece of gristle meat The amount of fat cholesterol etc is also higher than beef jerky I d rather eat beef jerky than this stuff At least I can chew the beef jerky

Will not repurchase Flavor is just passable The cracker is too thick have not found a topping that will soften it 
Odd tasting miso soup I had bought instant miso soup in the past and the taste was very similar with what you get at your usual sushi restaurant so I ordered this one and I shouldn t have ordered without trying because the taste is very strange not pleasant now we re stuck with 12x4 of something we don t like hopefully someone else can avoid our mistake 
Disappointing Wow I use Pacific Foods beef and chicken stock all the time I guess I expected more Convenience isn t worth it if the soup is super salty and tastes processed Hardly any barley or beef I cooked up one bag I m throwing the rest out 
Disappointing Quality Scant vegetables and beef Surprisingly little barley Gloppy texture Much too salty Does not taste fresh Needed addition of fresh vegetables to be edible Hard to believe but Campbell s is better 
Other organic is better I really enjoy organic foods so when I came upon this item I was thrilled they were making organic popcorn especially Newman s Own a brand I ve liked in the past I have to agree with the other poster the flavor is bland and almost flavorless There are other brands of organic popcorn that I ve found more recently that are far better Don t waste your money on so many of them 
SunStrike This popcorn is rather bland I purchased it because generally I like Newman s own brand and I liked the idea of Organic popcorn but it is flavorless I would not buy again 
Good product horrible Amazon service I ordered a 12 pack of this broth and so far I ve received a total of 3 bottles 1 original order and 2 replacements Amazon still hasn t sent me the 12 pack and now instead of correcting my order they want to cancel it and refund my money I ve been on and off of hold for over 20 minutes and they still haven t helped me I strongly recommend you find somewhere else to buy this product 
Salty Purchased these for my sons lunch box and can t do it they are too salty He s always been happy with Veggy booty and that is what he ll continue to get 
A Little Stale The Jerky seemed to be old and hard and was too tough to chew It also was a little Bland for me I did like the peppered Jerky much better 
Wrong order We ordered the Favorite Assortment Pack but that is not what we received When we questioned our order we were told they were out of stock on our original order and we could not return the order we received We won t order again 
quantity not as advertised only recieved one instead of 12 boxes and amazon not able to fix still waiting for remainder of orde 
Not Impressed I tried it also as a less expensive alternative and won t be ordering again The flavor just tasted off to me kinda like old coffee that s been sitting in pot for a couple of hours didn t have that freshly brewed taste 
A Million Little Pieces an Unnecessary Portable Variation of the Old Pop Tart Call me a traditionalist but I prefer the original jam filled Pop Tarts with none of the overly sweet frosting on top As a child I liked it right out of the toaster and would take it with me on the way to school This portable variation seems to me like a misstep from the outset The moment I ripped open the flimsy packaging the Go Tart bar crumbled out of my hand and onto the floor Apparently the manufacturers at Kellogg s decided to use the same bread like consistency they use for their standard Pop Tarts on this bar Especially with the shipping aspect introduced by Amazon I think this is a mistake since I assume the whole idea behind this iteration of the snack is the portability aspect On top of the bar is the same execrable sprinkle laden white frosting I avoided once it was introduced as an enhancement so many years ago Without the ability of toasting the bar I find little point to the frosting except as a purposeless sugar rush Consequently I cannot agree with its description as a ready to eat bar One bar a little over an ounce is 140 calories thirty of which are fat Even though there are more fattening bars you could eat it still has an excessive sounding 140 mg of sodium I only tried the Frosted Strawberry variation because it was part of a free promotional package I received from Amazon to promote their new non perishable grocery line I think I ll just stick with a granola bar if I get the kind of munchies this bar is targeted to satisfy 
Just what the doctor ordered B L A N D Because of tummy troubles my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet Well this stuff is JUST what the doctor ordered as it is almost completely tasteless I can t give it a one star which qualifies as hating it as I can t hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients but it is not good It makes Kraft Mac and Cheese seem very exciting I would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from Annie s This would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it 
Peanut Butter Balls Fall Flat The balls were squeezed into the box and flattened The taste is not very peanutty I m disappointed 
Stale I bought both the Ahi Tuna Jerky and Salmon Jerky Both were dried out and brittle Absolutely the worst Incredibly the Salmon Jerky was worse i e drier harder than the Ahi Tuna Jerky 
Awful Most of the strip were either hard and brittle or so tough they could barely be chewed They put no expiration date on the bags so I don t even know if I was given old product or they allowed the salmon to leave the processing plant this way On top of this they were too spicy My dog seemed to enjoy it though The Ahi tuna on the other hand was great 
Terrible This salmon jerky is so unbelievably tough it is pretty much inedible And when you do painstakingly gnaw on it it doesn t release much flavor but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks in your mouth I had the misfortune of ordering this and 7 of the 8 bags are still untouched and I m not sure what to do with them I even tried soaking the jerky and tried boiling it with some macaroni and NOTHING seems to soften this stuff up What a waste of money Go for some beef jerky instead and if you need salmon eat it fresh or canned This product is a joke 
Not compatible with Senseo machines Melitta coffee is certainly one of the better brands and I really like that each pod is individually wrapped I bought this because the Senseo Hazelnut was not in stock at the time Caution Senseo coffee maker users The Melitta pod does not fit well in the Senseo pod holders The single pod holder is too small for the Melitta pod and the double pod holder is too big for one Melitta pod too small for two Melitta pods I found the coffee to be just a bit on the weak side but this may only be because I used it in a Senseo machine 
They might work for you but not for me Maybe I m daft but I can t make a decent espresso with these pods in my machine I ve tried tamping them which doesn t work well and I ve tried just placing them in the filter In both cases I get watery dribble but no espresso As with other European products think IKEA there are no printed instructions in English just line art drawings Perhaps I m just doing something wrong I like the concept of pods but I ll stick to beans instead 
Not What I Expected I was very disappointed in the taste of this item Not at all what I expected from Splenda It is much too overpowering strong and when added to your beverage that is all you can taste For instance if added to coffee you will not detect ANY coffee flavor only the Splenda flavor Much too strong I prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this Splenda product without question 
HARD AS ROCKS AND STUCK TOGETHER We ve enjoyed these cookies for months as they were available for purchase at our local Costco Warehouse Just purchased them in bulk here at Amazon and were terribly disappointed to find that they arrived hard as rocks and stuck together They don t expire until July 2007 so we re guessing that something happened to them in storage We opened several packages and they re all the same The reason I am even taking the time to write this review is to say that Amazon s online policy states that grocery and gourmet foods ARE NOT RETURNABLE Are you kidding I have a case of 30 cookies that are simply not fit for prime time snacking I ve e mailed customer service regarding my delivery It s doubtful I ll order grocery items again as I assumed the return policy for defective goods would be the same Just not worth the hassle Update Amazon shipped us a replacement order Unfortunately again all twelve packages are hard Each package has three rows of cookies each row is stuck together and each cookie must be pried from the next Actually it s a mute point doing this as the cookies are simply inedible as they are hard hard hard The date on the package is 11 Jul 07 X I suggest a problem exists with this batch either from storage or from the manufacturer 
STICKY MESS Taste great but the cap on the bottle doesn t seal very well so when it is shipped they leak You can not take it with you without putting it in another container 
A real Review Really strange cardboard mushy texture Flavor can be sickening at times but you get used to it I won t buy this again I am not sure this is even beef has a strange taste Not sure where the other reviews came from 
I agree with the reviewer above who said that the texture of this product is somewhat strange I love beef jerky especially peppered and hot spicy varieties But this jerky lacks the chewy ness that I expect in a quality beef jerky This stuff kind of breaks down a little too easily and takes on a mushy grainy consistency The flavor isn t bad but after reluctantly finishing the first bag I can t bring myself to open the second one Perhaps I wasn t paying proper attention but I was somewhat surprised to learn that this product originated in Brazil I would not have purchased it if I had known this 
This is not Cappuccino Although this is a good coffee I was expecting something that tasted like a cappuccino This coffee tastes nothing like it it doesn t even have a hint of cinnimon flavor as the package suggests If you want regular coffee then this is the coffee to buy but if you re looking for cappuccino save your money 
Yuck I was excited to try this product as I love Oreos but don t like all the garbage that goes into them We tried Newman O s Originals my wife went first and the look on her face said it all Still I had to see for myself We both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as Oreo cookies For some reason others seem to think they taste great Just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large 
Not the best of the Pirate s Booty line I picked up a bag of these at my local health food store a few months ago after hearing that Pirate s Booty was a great product These tasted rather odd to me and I wound up getting rid of the bag as quickly as possible Puffed corn and a chocolate type of taste just don t go well together in my opinion It might have been ok if the cocoa was all you could taste but that was not the case here 
Pods with quality coffee inside taste MUCH better After searching high and low I found a site for Nossa Familia Coffee that carries a coffee that is imported directly from a farm in Brazil I guess this family has won the cup of excellence competition and they put their top coffees in the senseo compatible pods The site is www familyroast com and I highly recommend i 
falls apart This mix was very sour and because of the way the fruits are dried there were a LOT of crumbs inside the packets 
Empty Calories I am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 Iron and no other vitamins With childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would ANYONE feed their children all of these empty calories It is like giving them Coke or Pepsi for BREAKFAST OK ORGANIC Coke but still Coke I am sad because I have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species But they are not thinking about their target consumer CHILDREN 
Terrible Tasting Coffee I want to let you know that I received my order in today s mail Im unhappy to say this but the taste of this coffee is terrible I would have been better off if I had thrown my 37 00 out my car window These coffee selections should be pulled off from your web site I know you guys can not refund my money on this order but I am going to write to the products manufactorer and let them know how I feel about their coffee products The taste of the coffee makes you sick to your stomach If I were you I would post this commit under your customer s reveiws to let other buyers beware of this terrible tasting coffee 
If you like generic coffee then this isn t for you Horrible after bite that gives it a unique flavor that I definately don t care for not to say that you will not however If you are in search of a generic oriented flavored coffee this isn t the one to try 
HOORIBLE I WANT MY MONEY BACK I bought these pods on Amazon because they were a dollar cheaper than at the local grocery store Now I know why When I opened the package the Senseo Watermark was faint or hardly visable and it took me 3x the amount of pods to make a decent cup of coffee Buyer beware I am back to buying pods at the grocery store 
Amazon keeps on sending me the wrong item Be cautioned when ordering this product What happened was I ordered this product a month ago and was sent the flatbread version instead of the clear tub of bite size version I called Amazon explained my problem they promised to fix it by sending me a replacement Well the replacement came last week and it was still the flatbread I m not going to bother to call Amazon again because I know it will just result in them sending me the flatbread once again The flatbread itself was tasty and crunchy I think the seeds really helped to put more complexity into the flavor You can eat just the flatbread as snacks or maybe put a bit peanut butter or jam on top It tastes very different than wheat and I like the taste of spelt quite a bit So please be prepared to receive the flatbread version when you order You may as well just order the flatbread version to start with and save yourself couple of bucks as well as having to call Amazon to straighten things out 
Dry Cookie Bits and Bits and More Bits These cookies were ok just ok I may have been inclined to give them three stars had they arrived as whole cookies every last cookies was broken I understand this is probably due to poor packaging The consistency was a bit grainy and dry though And milk did not help Next time I ll purchase a chewy brand or Mrs Fields 
Tea chest I received this tea chest as a gift and am just now getting around to trying the teas The chest is beatiful and will be great for future use however I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the tea Although the bags are highly aromatic the tea is very bland as if the bags were old I am sure Bentley teas are usually fresh and tasty just not the box I received 
Tea box Liked the idea of the box but the tea tasted smelled like glue or paint or both Once I removed the tea from the box it was OK 
Faulty cups caused grounds in my coffee I had trouble getting the cups to function properly without getting grounds in my coffee At first I thought it was my coffee maker but the other brand of coffee I use worked fine Sometimes it took 3 4 cup changes to finally find a cup that would work correctly without getting grounds in my coffee Most of the time I would just give up Again the other brand of coffee I use NEVER does this Not getting this coffee anymore I would comment on the taste but I never got to really taste it with the grounds and all Donna Marylan 
Weak coffee with so so flavor I ve tried this coffee with all size settings It is too weak for my taste even at the smallest brew size And if it was stronger I still don t think I would care for the flavor It just doesn t taste like good Colombian coffees that I ve had not even close This is definitely one I would not purchase again 
Weak This is very weak coffee Do not buy unless you like it that way 
Misleading Labeling I thought this product had reasonably good taste but I have two major issues with it First they describe this as a Kettle Corn It is not Kettle Corn not even close This is a caramel corn with a thick sweet coating Real Kettle Corn is a slightly sweet slightly salty popcorn Second each very small bag has 1 5 servings in it When was the last time you opened a small bag of snack food and only ate 2 3 s of it They purposely made the serving size unrealistic to make it look healthier The whole point of paying for individual size bags is that it limits you to a set portion Remember when a can of Coke had 1 5 servings in it The FDA made them change the label If you eat the whole bag you are eating 200 calories of popcorn No better that a bag of potato chips or a few cookies so this is not a lesser evil it s just the same old junk food with a new name I won t buy this product again It s the same stuff you can get anywhere 
Good nutrition product but bad quality After extensive research on grains and nutrition our family added Amaranth to our staple diet There s not a wide range of suppliers for Amaranth and we started purchasing Bob s Red Mill Amaranth Well to be honest our experience with this product is that it s been of pretty poor quality Out of 8 packages we ve bought so far we ve had to return 3 to the outlet we purchased them from due to the amaranth being mouldy And I mean open the package and you can smell that it s off right away mouldy In addition one of the packages didn t smell mouldy but after we d cooked it and added it to the baby food we were making the mouldy smell of the cooked amaranth was very noticeable Not good particularly as we re using the amaranth for making baby food for our toddler and mouldy grain is not really something you want to include in the ankle biter s diet In addition we found we have to hand pick stones grit and dirt from each package very very carefully Seems that they are included as a bonus Note that as the grain itself is very small the stones dirt and grit are very small too but big enough to damage teeth if they slip through the cleaning process particularly toddler teeth This cleaning and sorting process involves a lot of work which we wouldn t mind so much if the amaranth was consistently good quality but it hasn t been I have to say that while after our research we d recommend inclusion of amaranth in anyone s diet Bob s Red Mill Amaranth Grain is NOT a product we would recommend If you have no choice but this be very careful about cleaning it and hand picking stone dirt grit out before you use it and make sure you check very carefully for evidence of mould both before and after cooking In addition I d recommend checking with the retailer that they will refund you the purchase price if the product you bought is off So far we ve been sucessful in getting our money refunded when we had the receipt we didn t once and we didn t get the money back that time but that was the first time and after that we were poorer but wiser 
Husband described the first forkful as an abomination Great idea poorly executed with an extremely unappetizing presentation This is from someone who makes flavored rice a few times a week That being said this is the worst review I have ever given anywhere so bear with me You know how sometimes the rice sticks to the bottom of the pan if you overcook and you have to boil it out and it turns oddly clear but covered in carbon water Yeah Like that The rice came out sticky not it the palatable uniform Japanese steamed rice way and was an almost alien kind of translucent brown that was nothing like the picture Nothing If you look closely you might be able to tell it had once been rice Yes I followed the instructions My husband who wanted to try having fresh rice at work described it as an abomination which was a relief to me because when it was cooking it stenched up the house with a horrifying yet familiar odor that when I put my finger on it smelled exactly EXACTLY like Onondaga Lake in Syracuse NY is the summer back when it was the most polluted lake in the world and people were warned never to eat the fish they caught assuming there were any alive in there and kids weren t allowed to wade in it It smells like raw sewage dead fish rotting feathers and chicken soup It was 45F out and I opened the window Sometimes you buy a case of something and it turns out to be something you don t care for maybe it has too much onion or whatever but you know someone else will like it Normally I donate these things to a needy family I think in this case it would be cruel I can t imagine anyone who has made rice on their own mistaking this for rice Do yourself a favor and just drop a boullion cube in a pot with your stovetop rice That s what they re trying to do here and failing at miserably I can t sell the rest on an auction site because I m afraid that even if I am completely honest about the smell I will get a bad rating The only thing I can think of to use them for is to smoke out people in the breakroom with the odor next April Fool s Day 
don t do it I opened one packet which was quite large for a serving and shared it with 3 others in my office We all took one spoonful and in unison said it was terrible No one could continue eating it and I sent back 8 of the 9 packets Not edible in our humble opinion Sorry 
Much better Kona coffee out there This coffee doesn t have anything special about it I like good Kona coffee and I think 2 stars really tells it all 
weak a total rip off save your money and buy folger s this coffee assuming it is kona as advertised is a lame example of the variety awfu 
Empty Calories I am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 Iron and no other vitamins With childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would ANYONE feed their children all of these empty calories It is like giving them Coke or Pepsi for BREAKFAST OK ORGANIC Coke but still Coke I am sad because I have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species But they are not thinking about their target consumer CHILDREN 
The tea is better than the box which is not saying much First of all the Tea Chest is disappointing to say the least The chest is made of cheep compressed sawdust and then coated with a plastic like finish which makes the box look like it was constructed from cardboard and plastic The tea its self is alright sadly nothing special This item arrived a good 6 weeks after it was ordered all of the tea packets were wrinkled and crushed and the box broke after I opened it a few dozen times Needles to say this product way disappointing all around 
Shipment was expired by 2 years I was really looking forward to these pods based on the reviews Starbucks is good but I prefer bolder taste imagine my surprise when I ordered 2 boxes both were expired One expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes I admit that Amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping but geez 2 years expired I m hoping to find local San Diego area shoppe that carries pods so that I can try something different than starbucks 
Didn t care for them They are kindof on the bland side and I d rather spend my calories elsewhere But they are on the low carb side 150 calories 7g total fat 2g saturated 8g sugar 5g fiber 1g sugar alcohol 10g protein 
Not really a coffee pro but My sister worked at Starbucks so I used to get their unground espresso beans for free on occasion I have a pump espresso machine but only a cheap blade grinder which should tell you that I m only about mid range on the coffee snobbery scale That said I prefer the starbucks espresso to this in spite of the drastic difference in price when I buy it retail Again though I m not one of those people who examines this stuff overly much I only know what I like the taste of In fact I only drink it in lattes 4 shot lattes but lattes none the less 
Terrible This coffee had an off sour taste It s almost as if it went bad as in Milk that s past the date I only made one cup before throwing out the rest of the bag I certainly won t be ordering this brand again 
English Muffins These are not the greatest Thought they would be great to have on hand when guest come Not so They were not what I had expected 
Eeew Snails in tea I brought this tea thinking it was a great deal Then while steeping my tea I noticed something in the bag At first I thought it was a rock but it looked like a garden snail I cut the bag open and it was a garden snail YUCK I checked several bags and approx 50 of them had snails in them This is the worst tea experience I ve had 
Expiration date 11 06 but still stale I was very disappointed in this product I wanted to use them for snacks and pie crusts but they are too stale to use They are NOT crunchy as advertised since moisture has definitely entered through the packaging Unfortunately Amazon will not let me return them so I m out 20 I was going to try some other products by this brand but now I will not 
Save your money I tried this once You can get the same thing by buying some popping corn in your local grocery popping it pouring it into a bowl and adding milk This made me reluctant to try other Kashi products Frankly I don t see why people continue to pay an outrageous price for what amounts to popcorn PS Amazon should add a zero star rating 
Horrible The box arrived opened and although the packages were individually wrapped I opted not to eat them They also looked very oily and not fresh I got a refund after some time and numerous emails 
Strange Taste I absolutely agree with the two other reviewers I had very high hopes too as I use McCann s Brown Bread mix ALL THE TIME I don t think I could live without it so I was very disappointed with the Fruit Scones Mix There is a very weird taste to me it seems like soapy or something but definitely not a pleasure to eat I ve got tons of bags left of this mix which I will have to throw away I would definitely NOT RECOMMEND this product sorry 
Scones Really dry and just not as good as could be A disappointment after using this companys other products 
Sorry to say they re awful We are huge scone lovers and were absolutely disappointed with the taste of these scones The mix was easy enough to assemble and bake but the scones have a decidely odd smell and very caustic after taste My husband who will eat just about anything threw the whole batch in the trash after trying his first one We had high hopes but sadly this product just didn t deliver 
No Go For Senseo I bought about a million of these pods for my single serving senseo machine They don t fit One is too big for the single brewing well and two are too big for the double Your only option is one pod in the double brewing well and the coffee comes out very weak Just like this product 
Product changed used to be much better We have been buying the Melita Buzzworthy Dark Roast pods for over two years and were quite satisfied Recently they increased the diameter of the pods to enable them to fit other machines I also understand thet they have increased the diameter of the pod holder in the new machines they are selling At the time Melita made these changes I believe they also reduced the quality of the coffee in their new pods because it just does not taste nearly as good Accordingly I rated the old pods with 4 stars but the new pods deserve only 2 stars We are now sampling pods from other companies to find a good dark roast coffee 
YUCK When I think dark roast I think full bodied and DARK Melitta pods are the worst I ve tried I ve tried Senseo pods too which are only mediocre I did find the Target brand Archer Farms pods to be the BEST The French Roast really does rival Starbucks home brewed Its cheap too 3 99 for 18 pods If you like a full bodied rich dark and strong cup of cofee don t do Melitta I found Senseo and Archer Farms pods fit in my Melitta pod brewer just fine 
Old Coffee This coffee was over three years old and was not drinkable Very stale Personally I can t believe Amazon would sell a grocery product this old Amazon did give me my money back 
Limited shelf life Date on bottom of can shows an expiration of June 2007 I would expect a longer shelf life Also the label shows mechanically extracted chicken meat This generally equates to bone fragments I m not confident with this product 
Disappointing Mushroom soup is one of my favorites so I was very disappointed in this version I agree totally with the first reviewer This is one bland and tasteless soup I m only giving it any stars at all because it is organic and the attempt is appreciated 
THE COMPANY SUCKS ORDERED A MELITTA 10 CUP COFFEE MAKER AND ON THE SAME PAGE WAS AN AD FOR THE MELITTA FILTERS THEY WERE VERY EXPENSIVE AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY WERE NOT FOR A 10 CUP MELITTA I ADVISED THE COMPANY BUT MY COMPLAINT WENT TO DEAD EARS BUY YOUR FILTERS AT THE LOCAL STORE THEY ARE CHEAPER 
Wretched Highest quality wholesome ingredients my Aunt Ida Seriously HOW do companies get away with this nonsense The first ingredient is corn syrup followed closely by sugar That the Harmony line would even consider masquerading as a healthier foods company and then try to pawn off this rubbish it s revolting I say don t buy from them just on principle Yours The Food Zealo 
Low quality gummi bears I bought a case of these from Amazon because someone on some candy forum claimed these were of excellent quality and that they were comparable to premium brands like Haribro Don t believe it These are cheapo gummi bears no better than whatever cheapo junk your local drugstore supermarket bigbox sells Pretty squishy not very chewy and a variety of bland flavors that all taste mostly like sweet There s no point in buying these 
Tasty but Burnt and Salty OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty but these are a tad too salty They also have a burnt flavor You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first instead of buying 12 bags Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon 
Only one bag As another reviewer pointed out I received only ONE pack of coffee pods I was sent a replacement order with guess what only one pack of coffee pods again I am getting a refund I would not recommend purchasing this one 
Terrible STAY AWAY Amazon sent me 1 bag of coffee pods 18 pods in total NOT pack of 12 like advertised Unless you want to pay 30+ on 18 generic coffee pods STAY AWAY I will be returning my product ASAP 
Not what we hoped for Overall the nuts were soft and lacked the flavor we had hoped for For the price we could have done better 
Revue of Orville Redenbacher Natural Light Popcorn I love this popcorn Unfortunately you didn t send me what I ordered You sent me Natural not Natural Light 
do not buy this variety pack i have been buying Stoneridge Orchards products for a long time so i decided to try the variety pack for quick snacks not only the product seems inferior to their regular packages but also the pouches were half open in the box what a rip of 
Don t be fooled this isn t ALL NATURAL While you could do a lot worse with other snacks much of the health benefit of eating fruit in this product are outweighed by the chemical additives High Fructose Corn Syrup and Dextrose are in many many grocery products but they are not Natural as this manufacturer claims Both are chemicals manufactured in labs and are not easily digested by the body HFC as it is called has been linked in high quantities to escalating the onset of diabetes I have not tried this product so I can t comment on the taste I would like to try a dried fruit product one which is truly natural and not laden with chemical additives 
Yogi Rejuvenation tea is better I ve tried many of the Yogi teas and I really don t like the taste of this one I recommend the Rejuvination tea it is a green tea that also fights free radicals and aging but it has a much smoother taste 
yummy beef gross cheese I had bought this before as a snack at the store and i love the combination of the beef and the white cheddar I figure i would try to buy it bulk instead of paying 2 a pack at the store However I m not sure if it was stored too long in the warehouse or if it was too hot in the warehouse but the cheese was disgusting it was dry and crumbly and had this awful taste I even opened a second and third pack to see if it was a fluke but all of the packages were like this The beef stick was good however if i had to order again i d order the product without the cheese It just was not fresh and yes i did check the expiration date and it wasn t expired 
Not very appealing I was really disappointed with this item especially as it s nutrition info is really amazing It s very gritty and strong tasting and did not blend well It s also dark green which isn t a big deal for a lot of items but can turn things a very weird color depending on what you blend it with I am returning them as there are better tasting and equally nutritious protein powders available 
Not the best tasting hemp portein I had tried almost all the hemp protein products out there and love eating the powder raw But Nutiva s product does not taste good at all compared to the other products it tastes like dirt and its not milled to a fine powder its very coarse so it will be crunchy if you decide to blend it with anything The only thing going for this product is that it packs in more fiber than other brands If your looking for a good tasting hemp protein go with Living Harvest Manitoba Harvest or Ruth s Hemp Protein I eat hemp religiously so trust me take my advice and avoid this one Bottoms Up Hemp powder is the most complete source of protein out there and easy to digest 
Dry and bland I found these to be very dry and just taste like dates I like the Raw Revolution bars a lot better 
I wish it could be ZERO stars Anyone who really loves a gourmet cup of coffee will HATE this It s burnt bitter weak battery acid And as consequence those coffee lovers may begin to hate their new Senseo but take heart Many online coffee shops now offer decent to delectable coffees at prices that rival this cheap swill I don t specifically want to endorse any one product or online retailer but do a google search for senseo compatible pods and you ll find several on the first page Also please note that while these may initially seem pricier most third party pods work with JUST ONE to make an 8 ounce cup instead of the two pods that Senseo brand products demand You do the math and it works out to be a comparable costing cup of joe 
Meh not bad not great Pretty OK coffee Nothing special but I suppose its a fair deal for the price We picked up the pack of 3 as an emergency stash and it has worked well for that but its not my caffeine deliver system of choice Of course my coffee of choice is over three times the cost of this stuff so the comparison is not very fair 
Yeesh I m not sure what I was expecting but this wasn t it Just tastes bad don t know how else to describe it Sorry but I couldn t even get through one bag Oh well 
Name of product is misleading Okay yes I know the brand is Dr Kracker and maybe that should have been a clue as to the texture of this product However I have had flatbreads made by other companies that were actually the texture of a pita These are VERY crunchy and don t have a whole lot of flavor Additionally they were shipped and arrived expired If you are shopping for a super healthy cracker this may be it If you are looking for a whole grain flatbread with the texture of a pita keep shopping this is not it My next venture for this product is to grind it up and use as bread crumbs on top of broiled tilapia 
Very Disappointed I purchased these the other day I received them on the 11th of Jan 2007 I ordered some other ones before 100ct box slim jims which were very good but unfortunately they kept revising my order from Dec 19th until Jan 10th so I canceled the order because it was taking way too long I thought these would be just as good 15 dollars more than the 100ct box But just as good there s 180 of them instead of 100 WRONG These are really bad They were all dried out hard as rocks and to top it off They expire on the 24th of Feb Less then a month from now I ve never had this problem with Amazon before Usually their stuff is fresh You will not be able to return them either Once they are opened you are stuck with them I contacted Amazon about this problem they gave me a little of my money back I will not be buying these in the future Amazon must have had these for quite some time for them to be so bad 
wrong product I did not get what I ordered in this case I got licorice but it was not the salt type I ordered 
Ummmm No thanks This snack lol tastes like cheese that had been baked in the oven for about a month Kinda looks like it too Make sure you have a beverage near by when you try them very very dry 
Like eating sawdust I thought this might taste like parmeson crisps you get in restaurants I was wrong They taste burnt and are hard to swallow even when chewed thouroughly Also Still had quite a bit of sodium 
Empty Calories I am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 Iron and no other vitamins With childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would ANYONE feed their children all of these empty calories It is like giving them Coke or Pepsi for BREAKFAST OK ORGANIC Coke but still Coke I am sad because I have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species But they are not thinking about their target consumer CHILDREN 
Excellent taste This is the best coffee I ve ever had Very smooth with rich flavor 
THIS CHOICE WAS A MISTAKE Peculiar unpleasant taste with an unnatural texture After trying one package It was so bad that I had to throw out the rest of the case A waste of money 
Stale I bought both the Ahi Tuna Jerky and Salmon Jerky Both were dried out and brittle Absolutely the worst 
Horrible Cookies Do NOT buy this product I donated my entire box to the local food bank Cream filling has some peculiar smell such that you will not feel like eating these cookies Seriously stay away for this produc 
too salty This product is way too salty I didn t like it at all and neither did any of my family you can t get the taste out your mouth either after tasting one 
Offensive smell and not appealing to kids While I personally love and eat tons of organic and natural foods I have to say the 30 I spent on this case of cookies was a waster Neither of my children will eat them nor will I They have a smell that once you get in your nose hinders any attempt at enjoying the very small bit of flavor they have Nature s Path makes great cereal and energy bars but fall short with these cookies Stick with the chocolate or peanut butter and you are okay The honey grahams will sit in your cupboard until trash day 
Shipment was expired by 2 years I was really looking forward to these pods based on the reviews Starbucks is good but I prefer bolder taste imagine my surprise when I ordered 2 boxes both were expired One expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes I admit that Amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping but geez 2 years expired I m hoping to find local San Diego area shoppe that carries pods so that I can try something different than starbucks 
Loaded with carbs juice is not lemon but grape No sweeteners on the can yet the first ingredient listed after carbonated water is White grape juice concentrate which might not be sucrose but since when is that not sugar Each small 8 4 oz can has 170 calories and 41 carbs I was so excited to find a healthy fun drink but this is not it The flavor A lot like Mountain Dew Mostly sugar yes there s some lemon in it but it s hard to tell it s Meyer lemon as opposed to some other type Another example of food manufacturers slipping a very unhealthy drink into the market as 100 juice no preservatives no sweeteners all natural Better they should say drink this to make SURE you get fat and type 2 diabetes 
Don t Expect 350 I ordered these and received less than 300 Some of the packages had holes in them and melted bags I contacted the supplier and they did nothing to resolve the issue I would not order from them again 
Too Mild and sweet I have been an avid senseo fan for about a year However I was getting a bit bored drinking the same Dark Roast every morning I found the other flavors too mild So I was very happy when I saw the new flavors Sumatra Colombia Kenya and Brazil Sumatra and Columbia are the two that I liked I found the Kenya blend to be mild and sweet Even my wife who previously used Hazelnut did not like it too much 
Crawly things in the raisins I had to throw out almost all of these raisins because they contained crawly things and or what looks like the droppings of crawly things I must say I generally love Newman s products and I was willing to give these raisins the benefit of the doubt With natural products sometimes bugs get in them That s part of the territory with organic matter But I found white grubs and little brown dots that weren t a part of the raisins in box after shrink wrapped box Some boxes were fine and I ate the raisins in them but the majority were tainted I ll need to be assured there s been an improvement in quality control before I try Newman s snack pack organic raisins again 
Not Gluten Free Good tasting but false advertising I am sensitive to wheat Gluten and I swear this product has gluten Everytime I eat a bowl of it I get sick I bought tons of this Cereal because it does taste good but now I don t know what to do with it because I can t eat it I think they must process this stuff on the same equipment as other wheat cerel Somehow it is getting contaminated I wish I could send it back It is too bad because it is a good product it s just not gluten free 
Empty Calories I am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 Iron and no other vitamins With childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would ANYONE feed their children all of these empty calories It is like giving them Coke or Pepsi for BREAKFAST OK ORGANIC Coke but still Coke I am sad because I have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species But they are not thinking about their target consumer CHILDREN 
Fava beans and beetles Great looking beans Unfortunately the packages are also full of drug store beetles a common pantry pest I could see them as soon as I opened the box Why did they not catch this at Bob s Red Mill 
So so Beef Steak Stew The product has way too much liquid Good for in a pinch 
Disappointed I expected this flavor to be as good as their Lemonada and Tangerine Strawberry but it didn t even come close 
A Disappointment I had thought this would be full of dried fruits and nuts in other words healthful but it s really just sugar laddened bits of hard fruits and only flavorless peanut pieces I have given the local food bank all but the one package I opened which made me feel so unwell that it s now in the rubbish I am truly very disappointed in this product It s description belies it s reality If sugar is contraindicated in your diet steer clear of this product It s low in salt and low in fat but so over sugared as to be actually nauseating It s too bad because it sounded delicious and so nutritious All I can say is YUK I suggest you leave this product alone unless you think high sugar is good for you 
Watch your cupper I didn t like this at all I found it chemical and not nicely redolent of the ginger I O so love I just gave it away cute little tin and all I am adventurous so I do happen on things I feel aren t what I expected from time to time This was certainly one of them I m sure some of you will like like it don t let me stop you from trying out your own personal tastebuds Mine said This tea is not a real peach either 
Love all there other Sensible Fruit Products but not this one I have tried all there fruit products and absolutely love them all However this Sweet Corn is all but Sweet I would say it should be called Salty Corn I think they would have a Great Product if they did away with the Salt also or change the Name to Salty Corn Cause if this was the first product someone tried from this company I dont think they would give the other products a try from there line My Favorite is Cherry Berry and Orchard Blend 
Salt I can hardly eat this for all of the salt it leaves you thirsty it s so bad The ingredients list reads literally 100 organic sweet corn sea salt and nothing else They need to make it 100 organic sweet corn and nothing else and they d probably have something really great As it is I m stuck with 23 1 2 bags of salty corn that I ll have to give away 
won t ship to hawaii won t ship to hawaii hawaii is a state in the united states some seem to think it is a forign country damn fools 
Easy to make and very dry You just throw this in the microwave and it s ready in 60 seconds The drawback is that it is dry and essentially without much taste Also the consistency is very slightly rubbery 
Item was stale All of the bags were stale however Amazon s customer service quickly corrected the issue by giving me a refund I think the whole batch was stale 
I beat it for 45 minutes with a Kitchenaid mixer and it still didn t rise It s easier to make one from scratch AND you electricity bill won t skyrocket 
Don t waste your money Horrible product I beat this mix longer than the 10 minutes suggested and it was still too runny to even stay in my angelfood cake pan It baked flat a disgusting rubbery texture and was completely inedible When I very nicely wrote about my concerns and to request a product refund the Customer Service person said they could not give me a refund and said thank you for your understanding huh I ll never purchase any more of their products 
Angel Cake disaster I purchased a case of angelfood cake and the first three I baked didn t turn out very well I ended up giving the other three boxes away 
POOR This cake mix was like water when I baked it it was like a cake of paste Itdid not bake well at all flat raw 
too spicy There isn t much of a blend its just I think plain too spicy for a normal taste bud extremely hot for those of you who like it I like hot stuff but this is just too hot 
Bentley s Finest Teas Wood Grain Tea Chest Variety Pack of 6 Flavors Tea Bags 120 Count Box The tea was good But I was looking for a box to keep around for a while and the felt lining hardly hides the fact that it s a cheap particle board box 
It may be good if I could get the lumps out I have been disappointed with this product We have always enjoyed Annie s products have never had a problem until now The cheese was so solidly clumped that I was unable to make a sauce without lumps I have used 3 different packages from my order have had the problem with all of them I am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse Either way beware 
Not best for espresso beverages The roast is a light medium Tried various grinds with my WEGA espresso machine Does not have the body and character to make a good espresso beverage Look for a darker roast Makes a pretty good drip 
Poor Pods These pods perform poorly in my espresso machine while ground beans perform very well It could be the filter for the pods but the espresso comes out uneven from the spouts and the flavor is not very strong 
Dry aftertaste dulls appreciation I was really excited about ordering this set and thrilled when it came I have noticed something unexpected about the teas however With the teas I have tried from this set I have noticed an unpleasant dry aftertaste Another taster noticed the same thing without my mentioning it I really like the glass tea pot It is very nice to watch the tea fill the glass orb with color and flavor Whether the flowers are beautiful or look more like sea urchins will be a matter of personal taste I had high hopes for the Starlight Rose Tea white tea leaves with rosebud and found it far inferior to Rose Petal Black Blended Tea by The Republic of Tea which is excellent On the other hand Numi s Moroccan Mint is one of the finest teas I have ever tasted superior to an old favorite of mine Stash Tea Moroccan Mint After tasting this tea I am surprised by the number of reviews rating the tea that comes with the set as quite good Maybe I got a bad batch or have strange taste buds but there it is The bamboo box is quite charming 
Just does not taste like it should I ordered the Corn on the Cobb popcorn since I could not find it in Phoenix anymore It tasted just like regular buttered popcorn In the past the popcorn literally tasted like Corn on the Cobb My family fought over it Not anymore 
Nothing like corn on the cob This tastes nothing like buttered corn on the cob In fact it tastes exactly like regular salted white popcorn with no butter On the positive side it s not greasy but don t expect anything exciting from the taste 
Should have stayed in the 1970 s Flavored peanut butter was a short lived and quirky product line from 30+ years ago It was a bad idea that was buoyed along for a few years by a cute name a catchy jingle a generation of sugar addicted children and adolescents with the munchies Now PB Max is trying this idea again As far as i can tell there s no good use for nor nutritional value to this product It has a phony overly sweet flavor that doesn t taste like Snickers or peanut butter and is not good on any kind of bread unless you have really weird cravings Come on would you take a real Snickers bar and make a sandwich out of it with peanut butter If so you might find this product a convenient if inferior tasting alternative This doesn t melt evenly so trying to use it as a sauce will prove frustrating It gets oily and separates and doesn t work well for dipping Yes you could spread it on apple slices or eat it straight up if you are so inclined I ll go for a real Snickers bar or plain apple slices thank you very much You could also get this for your kids to eat but please try to be better parents than that Note that you are buying 6 jars of this at once so even if you do find a niche use for it you ll have quite a bit of it to use up I m betting that you ll get tired of it long before it s gone 
Rancid Taste I bought a whole box of these and they tasted really rancid They were several months from their expiration date so that wasn t the problem Maybe I just got a bad batch but I d be unlikely to ever try them again 
1 star taste with a pretty bad smell I bought these simply because I wanted an easy snack and the reviews were pretty good I took two bites and stopped The second bite was because I really couldn t believe that I disliked something that much The odor is pretty bad too These smell very medicinal almost like a commercial disenfectant Next time you re at a doctor s office try licking the counter it s like that Not that I ve ever done that but I can t describe it any other way Please try one of these locally if you can I wouldn t suggest buying them if you can t 
Good if you want to scent your bath I got this as a gift and as a person who appreciates fine teas this is undrinkable In fact it s unsmellable I opened the tin and the smell was overpowering and clearly not natural Smelled and tasted like handcream Yes I actually tasted it Furthermore the tea was practically a powder and the teabags were cheesy the quality you d find in a no name tea from the dollar store The tab simply said Ceylon tea It looks like Bentley got stuck with a load of crappy teabag seconds sprayed them with jasmine perfume and stuck them in a fancy tin I gave it one star for the tin If you have even the tiniest discrimination when it comes to tea don t buy this one 
World Kitchens Jerky This is the second batch I ordered I have had to contact representatives at BrucePac both times to complain about the quality of the product and they have kindly send me replacement jerky I have enjoyed the same World Kitchen Jerky from other vendors so I cannot understand why the order from Amazon has been such a disappointment 
Try other flavors first I ordered Teriyaki Original and Black pepper flavored ones The other two flovors are quite good but this one teriyaki is really sub standard It has sandy texture and quality is very uneven compared to the others 
Grit like the meat might be road kill When you have dirt in your food you have to wonder about what you are really eating Otherwise the flavor wasn t bad I just can t eat the dirt It s bad for the teeth 
Too sweet for its own good Way too sweet for beef jerky It was similar to drinking a soda 
Brittle Thick and uneven cuts and slices Ok I bought their 4 bag combo special which feature all their flavors back when their site was taking orders direct This jerky is not very good In fact I threw away about half of it because some of the pieces where very thick and hard Kind of like eating leather and plastic mixed in together Trust me when people say this there is MUCH BETTER jerky out there I even e mailed the company and told them that I was very unsasfied with thier jerky They offered me a refund and I should of taken it but I decided not to 
not good at all I tossed it out The texture is aweful and brittle Only a few pieces were over 2 inches long and there was some sand like grit making it completely unedible GROSS you get what you pay for 
Canned actually does taste better It s not terrible but it s not very good For the price you can go to your grocery store and get one that is just as good if not better I sent 8 of the 9 packets back 
These are not Vegan I have never eaten these because well they re not vegan They are in amazon s vegan section however Whey is not vegan it is the very first ingredient 
Broken most of the time I LOVE the flavor of this sauce but it rarely arrives undamaged Packaging needs to contain a little TLC then it would be 5 stars Don t order if you need this for a certain dinner it may not arrive usable 
good product but don t order online I ve purchased this locally and it was delicious so I was happy to see a deal offered by Amazon Unfortunately it never made it to my door UPS reported that the sauce was leaking out of the box and returned the package to Amazon This seems to match what many other reviewers said 
Poor cheap Plastic Jars broken very acidic first quality tomato products should never be packed in plastic The high acidity may cause the plastic to leech into the food Then these are pooly packed by Amazon 2 orders both arrived cracked open as Amazon just throws them in a box so they crack and make a nasty mess As for the sauce well it tastes fine but i think it is not well balanced very acidic we feel horrible after eating it for hours Simple good ingredients so i m not sure what it making us feel sick 
I had high hopes but I may never know I ordered this item on October 27 When a shipment finally arrived there was only one container of this inside I ordered a four pack I m sure So Amazon offered to try again sending the item but it s now November 30th The item has been in stock the whole time so I m not sure what has caused the delay I m just thankful I ordered it just to try it out and that I didn t actually need it by any certain date 
I ve ordered this twice and still have yet to taste any I ve ordered this item twice from Amazon and both times all of the plastic jars were smashed inside the packing box 
Rancid Chemical Laced Nuts While the flavor is unique three of the five packets of nuts were rancid To say I am disappointed is an understatement Unfortunately this is not the first time I have had problems with the freshness of food products purchased from Amazon Now one to the two non rancid packets I got through one in a few days and I was working on the other them I realized I had a major head fog you know like a hangover but without having had anything to drink I gave up the nuts it went away For me that s a tell tale sign of additives in food Not a good choice for someone with chemical sensitivities I purchased this on a SD recommendation But it was a complete utter waste of money for me 
Maybe it s just me I din t love these at all The flavor combinations struck me as off there was no improvement in the pistachio taste by adding harissa Also the texture was unpleasant somewhat soggy I like the healthy aspect but if you aren t enjoying the experience why eat at all 
never received this item Hello I have not received this item Please send me the delivery receipt details 
Senseo coffees Got a deal on the machine and love the concept But every senseo coffee I have tasted has been absolutely horrible I ve tried 4 oz with one pod way too bitter so 8 oz with 1 pod still the most awful coffee I ve ever had Normally I drink Gevalia but I use Folgers sometimes or Millstone I don t think I could drink this stuff on a regular basis if someone paid me Of all the purchases I ve made at Amazon this has been the first time I ve ever felt compelled to give feedback That in itself speaks volumes 
Great Cookies But close to expiration date I ordered the Chocolate Mint variety Amazon had them for a great price and shipped them quickly However I ordered the cookies in early November and they arrived with a Best When Used By date of December 4 2006 They will expire less than a month after they arrived I m not sure if this is Amazon s fault or not The cookies are shipped in the manufacturer s Back to Nature box so it could be the company is unloading older cases of merchandise on Amazon com 
Tastes good but should have a warning label CAUSES GAS Ok these tasted good although they were much tougher than the sugared brand I ate about a serving and a half and so did my husband right after we got them That evening we both had bloating and terrible flatulence It was the holidays so I didn t immediately attribute it to the vines I brought some to work to satisfy my afternoon sugar cravings and ate another serving sitting at my desk Later that afternoon I was in an important meeting bloated beyond belief and trying not to embarrass myself I have since thrown out all my other bags these things create at best a very embarrassing and uncomfortable several hours and at worse a terrible health problem I think they should be taken off the market or at least labelled with a warning may cause significant distress to your digestive track and embarrassing flatulence 
PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED I have to second the other reviewer s comments about the Partially Hydrogenated oil that Kellog s is using in KID cereal It is the year 2006 time to start making these cereals HEALTHY and withOUT trans fat ridden CHEAP oils 
Trans fats I was going to buy these until I saw that they contained trans fats partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in Cocoa Crispies Fruit Loops and Corn Pops Who wants to send their kids off to school loaded up with deadly trans fats 
Not so good I thought they had a stale texture and they didn t have enough salt Ener G does make a type of sesame pretzel that is incredible but these aren t it Hope this helps all the gluten free people like me 
I m sure it works if you can stomach it I m sorry to give this a poor review but tea has to taste good in order for me to drink it I often drink a large variety of bedtime teas and have never tasted any tea this awful I can t speak for how well it works because I couldn t drink the whole cup even though I attempted to force myself Yogi makes some good teas but this I just couldn t stomach 
Too close to sell by date The sell by date on a package was less than a month So that they would not go bad I felt like I needed to personally eat more than I would have I have a retail store and I need a bit more time on new products This was a costly mistake Also the wholesale price from the business itself was the same as Amazon s price except Amazon gave free shipping AND a discount coupon worth ten bucks Cool deal beans Amazon As a retailer I would think that I would be able to get a better deal from Betty Lou s or get a reasonable sell by date Very tasty and addicting 
Too Green For My Taste You have to really like Spirulina to enjoy these The entire center is green Too strong for my taste Try the Almond Butter balls they are delicious 
Horribly fake and waxy Terribly waxy chocolate pieces that all sunk to the bottom of the bowl while the flakes floated on top The flakes seem to have a chocolate flavoring added to enhance the experience but those disgusting chocolate pieces made me gag and I wondered what I was eating Alone they were nearly tasteless and I ll never purchase again Yuck 
Not All It Is Cracked Up to Be I am a huge Special K fan Especially Red Berry but at heart I am a chocoholic I was so excited to hear they had a chocolate version and I ran right out to try it It is your average Special K flakes but with the addition of Chocolate Pieces The problem is they leave a horrible waxy coating in your mouth because of the poor quality chocolate I am sure this is because it has to stay healthy but I would rather have a Fat Free Chocolate Jello 100 calorie pack then deal with the feeling it leaves in your mouth So back to red berry for me 
STRONG This is a STRONG blend When I want a cup of decaf I usually want a milder blend And after a cup or two of this blend I still seem to get jittery I question whether or not it is TRULY decaffeinated 
False and Misleading Listing Home and Beyond and True Value offers this 12 pack of coffee filters with 40 in each pack I ordered two 12 packs of 40 coffee filters each and Home and Beyond only sent two packs of 40 Not the 24 packs I ordered and paid for My advice is do not do business with Home and Beyond or True Value when buying these coffee filters because they do not ship what the listing says Until Amazon starts enforcing Home and Beyond and True Value to honor what they list in their offerings IMHO then the buyers need to go somewhere else Weight says 4 20 pounds Are they trying to say one tiny pack of 40 paper coffee filters weighs 4 20 pounds 
Deceptive Description Pricing and Shipping But I got a Refund The product is fine But the description is misleading Each package contains 40 count that is 40 filters But this is not a Pack of 12 as you would think from the description from the price reduction from 23 88 to 1 93 and from the shipping weight 4 20 lbs It s just one box of 40 filters And you ll pay as I did 11 for FedEx to bring you this one box Soon after I submitted this feedback I was issued a partial refund of 7 Product description still needs correcting but at least customer service was responsive 
McCann s Instant Irish Oatmeal The oatmeal tastes okay but the purchaser should be aware that this IS NOT an instant version of McCann s Irish Steel Cut Oatmeal the oatmeal it is famous for I thought McCann s only sold steel cut oatmeal but it also apparently sells the regular type of instant oatmeal that is flavored I would not buy this again since the steel cut oatmeal is what I prefer and is much better for you 
WARNING Item can not be returned Contains Splenda In Amazon s ultimate wisdom they will NOT return or exchange items from their grocery store even though it is in Beta status I ordered the Apple Cinnamon in good faith as they appeared to be the normal packaging but be warned that these contain Splenda and so may not be suitable for everyone I d avoid the Amazon grocery store at all costs going forwards 
NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT BASED ON THE OTHER REVIEW These were horrible I thought I d try raw foods and I amde a big mistake 
Falls apart Isn t very tasty Falls apart when taking a bite Not recommended 
Love the bunny on the label That s all however I tried really hard to like this stuff You know organic and all that The elbow macaroni is fine but the sauce is gummy pasty and tastes like Cheez Whiz If you like Cheez Whiz you will love this mac cheez If not pass it by I d have given it to Mikey but he doesn t live at our house anymore My recommendation is to make your own from scratch It s not that difficult and it s so much better 
STAY AWAY There are bugs in the tea bags Now these aren t the organic bugs you find in your garden when you plant veggies These are the bugs that dig into expired produce There are about 4 5 bugs in each bag If you want some protein boost while relaxing before you go to bed this is the product to buy Also the tea bags aren t made from organdy It s some sort of plastic polyester I burnt a bag and it melted turned black and glued onto itself Horrible unethical company 
A Bit Stinky Reminds me of the Fruit Bars from my childhood that first came out around the time Fruit Roll Ups did They seem to have some kind of strong odor to them but if you can get past that they don t taste so bad 
Fancy name boring coffee I ve found Timothy s K cups to be consistently good better than the Green Mountain varieties I tried I haven t found a Green Mountain that I like yet But Parisian Night is the first Timothy s offering that didn t impress me I bought two boxes of it from Amazon and have tried using different brew strengths but it always tastes bland It s bold and strong as advertised but plebeian To someone who s just bought a Keurig and had this blend as their first cup it might taste pretty good but compared with all the other better K cup varieties that are available this one is better off skipped I think it s just a fancy name for a boring blend that has nothing distinctive about it at all Their Midnight dark roast is definitely more tasty and even better than that are their Columbian and Italian K cups which are very smooth I think Timothy s has the best Columbian K cups on the market But Parisian Night well let s just say that everybody makes mistakes 
Spirals depress me Yeah so I really do not like this one bit The cheese is horrid dose not taste like real cheese The noodles are ok a little soggy but ok And it leaves a nice layer of starch in your mouth As Rachal Ray would say yumO Anyway I hate it And spirals depress me 
review of Kraft Macaroni Cheese Spiral 5 5 Ounce Boxes This type of Mac Cheese pasta doesn t produce as much as the elbow mac cheese Other than that it tastes the same Good stuff 
Ugh Last time I order this sort of thing online I realize that raisins was the first ingredient but they weren t even good raisins and the raisins outnumber everything else by a good margin It s basically raisin and banana with a few other things thrown in The coconut is an afterthought and completely tasteless The sunflower seeds settled to the bottom It s edible but it doesn t taste especially good and tropical is definitely misleading 
not what I expected I was a bit disappointed in these They crumble very easily and have an unusual texture My son 6 does not like them 
Not natural and even expensive Go to Trader Joe s for real natural peanut butter at 1 69 per pound Yes you ll need to stir it and that might seem strange at first if you have grown up like we all did on commercial junk That junk that they add which always contains heart clogging partially hydrogenated oils read heart clogging turns the nutritional value of your peanut butter to garbage You might as just well eat a snickers bar if you re going to eat skippy or peter pan or jiffy or whatever Your local health food store may have a peanut butter grinder and butter stock peanuts which would be uber natural and fresh doubly delicious AND cheaper From THE ADA American Diabetes Association Are some fats better than others Yes Monounsaturated fats are the healthiest for your body Nuts like almonds cashews hazelnuts and peanuts and avocados contain this type of fat Choose olive or canola oil for cooking Polyunsaturated fat is the next healthiest fat This is found in corn oil safflower oil soybean oil and mayonnaise Use small amounts of foods that contain saturated fats like butter lard and meat fat bacon and shortening There are lower fat versions of foods that contain saturated fats like sour cream and cream cheese A healthy diet includes less than 30 of calories from fat with less than 10 of these from saturated fat 
Peanut Butter This peanut butter tastes even worse than regular creamy Skippy A lack of flavor and dry texture makes me wonder if by palm oil they meant to write socks Thoroughly disappointing I only finished the one jar I bought because peanut butter is a staple in my diet and I wasn t about to waste it Buy the real all natural peanut butters or even the cheap store brand which contains Fully Hydrogenated oils which are fine for you unlike Partially Hydrogenated ones 
PALM OIL Tastes just like regular skippy i e unnatural texture because it contains PALM OIL 
Bait and switch Skippy pulls the worst kind of nonsense with this product claiming it s all natural which is technically true but also implying that since it s natural it s healthy which is false for this product sice they ruined it Real peanut butter contains one ingredient peanuts and maybe a dash of salt Nothing else Real peanut butter is very good for you Skippy adds palm oil a tropical oil which while it s slightlybetter than soem other tropical oils still contains saturated fats and is completely unnecessary to this spread Why So the poor widdle you doesn t have to spend a whole four seconds stirring it Of course this would all be a lot more clear if amazon actually had the nutrtion labels available but they don t nor do they carry ANY kind of actual all natural peanut butter Skip this skip all the so called peanut butters carreied here and go to yoru local store to get soem real natural peanut butter Look at the label if it has any other ingredient than peanuts and salt put it back on the shelf Nothing else is necessary 
Misleading This is not a natural peanut butter The listed ingredients are peanuts sugar palm oil and salt Natural peanut butter such as Smucker s and Whole Foods contain only peanuts and salt Palm oil is not a healty oil and is not recommended for cholesterol patients 
misslabeled terrible customer support I ordered the loose tea in tins and received 6 boxes of tea bags The only labeling on the box was a barcode sticker with for tea in tins which was incorrect When calling customer service I had only two options return the tea bags or keep them and be overcharged There was no follow up so there was no way to know if I would receive the correct product if I ordered again The price had gone up 20 in the mean time Rather than be without tea I can t buy that brand where I live I kept it You can t get your money back if you are over charged and you can t complain about it to anyone who cares I will never use Amazon Grocery again if I can help it and I suggest you do the same 
not the best tasting I drink all types of teas but this is one of the worst tasting teas in my opinion 
Be Careful Please be careful I did not read the product description so I do not know if they mentioned this but kava can cause SEVERE LIVER TOXICITY even without prior liver damage please consult your physician before taking this or any other supplement Thanks 
not too tasty I bought this tea because my job was stressing me out and causing a lot of anxiety indigestion etc and I use and love the other flavors of Yogi tea Unfortunately I can t handle the taste of this one It s just too strong almost burns your tongue because it is so spicy I normally like ginger but this is too much 
Wouldn t even feed it to the squirrels I ve only been on a gluten free diet for four months so maybe my palate has not yet become accustomed to things that taste horrid The worst part is that Amazon has left me stuck with six loaves of this I d put it out for the squirrels but I m not sure they d eat it If you re expecting something that tastes anything like bread you re in for a shock 
TOO SWEET This bar would be great if it wasn t so full of sugar It gives me a sugar headache 
Disgustingly sweet I wanted to like this bar because it s high in protein and fiber but it is also unfortunately high in added sugars 31g It s much too sweet If they took away some of the sugar it might be edible 
Little o s made of concrete My wife and two year old like this cereal however I find them to be extremely crunchy and unpleasant to eat I prefer the Purely O s just wish they came in an eco pack 
Avoid using in Shakes Drinks Although the product claims to be a viable additive for shakes drinks our experience is it won t dissolve without a blender Simply put it clumps The taste is fine actually good so my recommendation is to look elsewhere for a drink supplement 
Too much added sugar without any sulfites preservatives hydrogenated oils artificial colors or flavors but not without a great deal of sugar and high fructose corn sweetener Like the previous reviewer I bought these at Costco Brought them back due to the sickly sweet taste There was so much added sugar it was getting a little difficult to taste the berries If you prefer berries au naturel or with just a little extra sweetness watch the ingredient list on these Sugar is the second ingredient by weight and corn syrup is the fourth 
Not so good The quality of this tea is not very good especially compared to other superb teas by Two Leaves and a Bud Mostly powder inside the bag and has a very strong grassy smell and somewhat bitter aftertaste On top of that it took 2 weeks for Amazon to deliver it 
Well it was worth a shot Sadly this is pretty crummy tea For decent Orange Pekoe I remain sold on Typhoo 
Yuck I was excited to try this product as I love Oreos but don t like all the garbage that goes into them We tried Newman O s Originals my wife went first and the look on her face said it all Still I had to see for myself We both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as Oreo cookies For some reason others seem to think they taste great Just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large 
Not as good as I d hoped they d be I didn t like them too sweet and sticky My dog likes them though These just didn t do it for me 
do not buy it Donot buy it I got the stuff even past the expiration day 
Rancid and past due Amazon shipped me a replacement for this order which was 7 months past the sell by date on the package The replacement was EIGHT months past due Yuck I won t even bother calling them on it I just won t buy any food product from Amazon Hey guys these things AREN T BOOKS They go bad 
Not So Smart Ingredients High Fructose Corn Syrup and Hydrogenated Oil Do a search and see what you think I won t touch this stuff 
There is NOTHING smart about Smart Start I was so very disappointed with this cereal It s taste is very sweet If you look at the ingredients it s filled with sugar corn syrup and and more sugar I counted 12 ingredients that were really just forms of sugar It is also loaded with salt I would give this ZERO stars if I could because it has more sugar than most sweet cereals Why mislead the public into thinking they are making a healthy choice when all you are doing is serving sugar with a new label and adding a little bit of soy to the package Absolutely ridiculous 
Read ALL ingredients As another viewer pointed out this product contains CORN SYRUP not at all organic In fact the only organic thing in this product is the Fig For those of us trying to maintain a healthy organic eating lifestyle you MUST read the list of ingredients before assuming the front label is accurate This goes for all products not at all an attack against Paul Newman products which my family does consume we enjoy their products that are truly organic 
Tasty Disappointing Organic Junk Food Contrary to the maker s claims this product is not made with whole grain flour Instead the first listed ingredient is organic unbleached wheat flour an unhealthful refined carbohydrate The product is sweetened with common refined cane sugar and corn syrup All things considered this product is nutritionally equivalent to common grocery store fig newtons except for the claim that it s organic Snacks like this could be made with healthful nutritious ingredients unfortunately this one is not I would not choose to buy it again Instead of this junk snack I would choose Barbara s Whole Wheat Fig Bars which are made with real whole grains and sweetened with fruit juices 
stale stale stale Bought dozens of different varieties of these all arrived way past expiration date and were terribly stale Don t chance it I m not the only customer who has had this problems with these products 
Don t be fooled by the word Espresso t may be expresso grind but if you are expecting lovely dark aromatic coffee for your espresso maker think again Bitter when drunk on own Marginally better when combined with milk in cappuchino I shoulda known betta 
Not What I Expected I was very disappointed in the taste of this item Not at all what I expected from Splenda It is much too overpowering strong and when added to your beverage that is all you can taste For instance if added to coffee you will not detect ANY coffee flavor only the Splenda flavor Much too strong I prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this Splenda product without question 
The Hazelnut Flavor is AWFUL I really like Splenda but this Hazelnut flavor has a distinctly over chemicaled taste and just doesn t have much nuttiness to it Perhaps the other flavors are better 
I have to disagree I m afraid I disagree with the other two reviews I thought this pasta was extremely bland and not very close to what wheat pasta tastes like It does take longer to cook and you have to add oil to the water and stir it quite frequently or it clumps and sticks together terribly It s an OK substitute but there are much better gluten free pastas out there Although the Glutino is cheaper I personally like Orgran pasta 100 times better 
No Wonder They re Sold in Combination The almonds are slightly seasoned with a barbecue kind of flavoring which is subtle but nice The cashews on the other hand are hard to believe The taste conjures up images for me of them being stored in semi pervious containers in the paint and finishing room of my high school industrial arts class They are REALLY awful and any lover of cashews will be appalled 
powdery and short shelf life I wouldn t describe this jerky as shredded but instead as powdered It s not something you can tap into your hand and eat like a snack The best use we found was to pour one of the little tubes onto a salad for added protein Still it had a fairly short shelf life for jerky the unopened tubes had gone bad mold or something ick within about 3 months 
Not good I ve tried this twice now and both times it had an off taste A bit rancid like it had been stored for too long at too high a temperature I d guess that Amazon s transport or storage has a problem they need to work out 
Special K I normally buy Special K cereal I found these boxes to be stale 
CAVEAT EMPTOR TEA LACKS FULL FLAVOR It s not the regular strong Earl Grey Twinings I come to love This version lacks strength and flavor two teabags are needed for regular strength tea It s even states on the box Light Flavour Strenght 2 leaves out of five Beware 
Earl Grey Tea My tea came after three weeks and it was only one pack instead of six I called and complained and the following week got another one pack instead of six That is all I ever received and my money was refunded Don t really know what happened never got an explanation from the distributor 
DO NOT BUY THIS TEA It is not the Wonderful Twinings Earl Grey you have come to know and love They have pulled a new coke blunder and now the best Earl Grey tea ever is available no more This tea is weak and tasteless I hate stupidity especially from corporate marketers 
WARINING New Twinings Earl Grey Tea is very weak The newly re packaged Twinings Earl Grey tea has the word CLASSICS on the package is much much weaker than the previous Twinings Earl Grey tea If you used and like to the old teas then you won t like the new version I wonder if they have weakened the Britsh version of Twinings Earl Grey Tea 
bad soup I did not enjoy this soup I will try a different brand next time 
too artificial tasting I love most Jack Links jerky products however I was disappointed with this product though it had all the heat the flavor was lacking true pepper taste It tasted like a bunch of powdered old HOT spices not a true fresh pepper cure I think the mistake most people make with hot peppers is not removing the seeds before using as this can give a bitter as well as hot taste I have not given up on Jack Links just ordered their turkey jerky 
regretful I was very disappointed with this product I was sure I had tried cherries from this company but these had an off flavor were EXTREMELY sweet I gave away the 4 bags I bought 
candied fruit I bought this item thinking I was getting a healthy snack The fruit is soaked in high fructose corn syrup and it is extremely sweet Not healthy 
Highly disappointed The cherries are listed as natural on the packaging There is NOTHING natural about high fructose corn syrup I am returning them 
yuck I thought these would be slightly sour like dried cherries I have enjoyed in the past No HFCS is High Fructose Corn Syrup so these taste strangely sweet like weird raisins They are OK if I cook them in oatmeal or if I m really hungry but I wouldn t buy them again If you are looking for tart dried cherries look elsewhere 
Way Too Sweet Not Good At All This Biscotti is just awful too sweet and too hard La Tempesta is a real Biscotti 
Disappointing compared to Nana s brownie mint peanut butter cookies Although I love the Nana s brownie mint and peanut butter flavor cookies I found the ginger cookie disappointing It was too spicy to be enjoyable and more crumbly than the other cookie flavors The crumbliness is due to the gluten free rice flour Also the ginger cookies are more fattening than the other flavors I ve had 360 calories per cookie compared to the peanut butter at 316 per serving and the chocolate mint at 300 calories Note that Nana s cookies lists the calorie count as 180 per serving but they count a serving size as half a cookie 
Still caking problem I purchased two of these packages in mid Jan 2007 I have only finished one box of four and am finding about 1 out of 4 packets have caked Due apparently to a small air leak in the packet so moisture can get in only my personal theory I just pound on the packet with a knife handle to break it up and use it anyway but it is a problem And they have known about it now for a long time seems like they would have solved the problem 
Buy at Trader Joe s Amazon doesn t store this product correctly 5 Stars for the Stevia product natural delicious 0 Stars for Amazon s inability to correctly store this item in their warehouses I experienced the same trouble as other reviewers packets showing up hard and useless When purchased in the store I have never had one hard or brittle packet Don t bother purchasing from Amazon instead head to your local Trader Joe s where you can purchase 100 packets for 5 99 Not the fiber supplement type but doesn t clump and more per packet Amazon really shouldn t even bother selling this product if the Stevia shows up ruined 
No stars I ordered enough Stevia packets to last me for 1 year Most of the packets have the sugar hardened Every so often I am finding one that is powder as it should be The others must have gotten some kind of moisture to them because they are hard I will never buy Stevia from the company I purchased from again I don t have the receipt or I would have returned them asking for a refund I have been upset about the way they came 
Not what I expected from Lavazza I drink Lavazza coffee nearly every morning at a local restuarant When I saw this on Amazon I assumed it would be great but it isn t Even though this is sold as drip grind coffee the grind is way too coarse for a drip coffee maker The result is that you need to use nearly twice as much coffee to get a decent cup And decent is as good as it gets not great not even very good just decent Illy s admittedly much more expensive drip grind delivers a much nicer smoother cup using 1 2 as much coffee so mabye it s not all that much more expensive in the long run 
Very Disappointed I should have known that there was something fishy when the product details said that the product dimensions are 13 x 10 5 x 2 5 inches and 3 8 pounds when the shipping weight said 2 15 pounds In actuality it is 12 X 10 X 2 5 and comes in a CHEAP do not even know if it IS wood box AND it weighs 1 14 pounds on my postal scale However to be fair I have not taken the plastic wrapper off because it is a gift so it could be very VERY thin wood In addition the container opens like a box rather than a chest There are no hinges on the back I am very disappointed with this tea chest AND it s price 
Great Crackers But You ll Regret Buying Them From Amazon These are excellent graham crackers We love em and the kids do too and it s not often that we agree But you ll be sorry if you order graham crackers or any other food that can be damaged in shipping from Amazon Our recent order arrived in the original box from the factory containing 12 boxes of New Morning Honey Grahams That was it No packing material Nothing to shield the crackers from the drops and shocks of being shipped to us So we didn t get graham crackers We got graham crumbs and a few graham cracker fragments By all means order these crackers Just don t order them from Amazon Instead find a retailer that knows how to do it right or buy them from your local grocery Unless you really want graham cracker crumbs 
Broken Complete Mess I ve purchased this sauce at a retail bakery and it was fabulous I ve ordered it several times here and it NEVER arrives usable Jars are always smashed Guess I ll have to continue to buy it at a store Very dissappointed 
It was rancid It arrived rancid with mold in all 4 jars not so great I have purchased there other products and enjoyed but not this Pretty Gross overall 
Too sweet tasted like candy gummy bears I bought this thinking it was going to be a good healthy snack of raspberries I was surely mistaken The raspberries are coated with sugar and other syrupy stuff and it tastes like you are eating gummy bears GROSS 
pretty poor selling received shipment early January of 2007 to find out the expiration date was in 2006 BUYER BEWAR 
Not worth any calories I recently tried this cookie and the Ginger flavor They were both disgusting The texture was similar to a protein bar The flavor of the chocolate one was very weak contrary to the label which states that it has a rich chocolate flavor The other one was very spicy with no sweetness to cut the spice Not a pleasant experience I didn t finish either of them 
Tastes Great Bad Filling This stuff tastes great but after doing some research it s got a bunch of fats that are not considered healthy The first item on the list which means that it is the highest mass ingredient is partially hydrogenated oils If you have any problems with cholesterol I suggest talking to your doctor Or maybe you might want to be like many Americans and just increase your Lipitor dosage so we can enjoy these tasty but potentially unhealthy creamers Godspeed 
17 00 For Dehydrated Dingleberries I Don t Think So My wife bought these for me and I was just putting them on my morning Cheerios like a madman and I said Hey these are good where did you get em Oh from Amazon can you believe they were only 17 00 Silence I just looked at her Are you nuckin futs Gimme those things I m going to put them into our safety deposit box with our bonds our living trusts and my favorite Hot Wheels Blueberries are good for you and I would suggest to eat them on a regular basis but the price for these things is simply absurd Do I look like I m wearing my shirt that says STUPID I don t think so I m sure you can get frozen blueberries for less and hey fresh is always good and if you can t get frozen or fresh get a Hostess Blueberry Pie Sure it s sugary and will feel like you ve got a leadweight in your stomach after eating it but the pie is only 50 cents these little blue suckers are 17 00 That s more than my whole wedding cost Just kidding I m not that cheap Actually I m not cheap at all but I do like money and I refuse to pay 17 for some humiliated looking berries Geesh 
Never got item Amazon never sent the correct order I spend 2 hours on the phone trying to get them to send the right item I eventually had to decline the order on the 3rd time not getting the correct amount of pop tarts They kept sending once box when i was supposed to get 12 
too small to get out of bottle Like the idea of getting some samples but once you refrig these it is tough to get the sauce out of the small bottles Do not buy 
Sham2 Wish I would have paid attention to this one the the previous review The cost for what you get is OUTRAGEOUS Only reason I gave it one star is because there was no place to give is ZERO starts Don t waste your money like I did FIND A MORE ECONOMICAL PRODUCT plenty more choices on Amazon BTW 
Sham The price for this and all other 100 calorie packs is for one box This means you are paying almost two dollars per ounce This is the most ridiculous sham I have ever encountered The difference in price between this item on Amazon and this item in a grocery store is outrageous THIS COSTS OVER TEN DOLLARS MORE HERE THAN AT THE GROCERY STORE 
I didnt like the flavor Sorry guys I don t know if I wasn t tasting REAL Miso Soup at my local restaurant but the thing is I didn t like this one bit and I still have lots of packages left haha I gave it a chance because I love the soup from the Japanese restaurant I visited and I wanted to taste this soup whenever I wanted at home But I didn t like the flavor don t know if I m missing something but better buy one ONE a see for yourself 
Back to wrong product again I had the exact same experience as Heather shown below They sent me the less expensive NON ORGANIC version of this product TWICE and then informed me that they couldn t guarantee when the problem would be fixed Remember that strawberries and cherries are on every list for crops containing the most pesticide Now add that freeze dried snacks are concentrated Finally take these concentrated levels and place them in a small child or toddler s body and their pesticide exosure goes through the roof Do the math Note to Amazon This is a great product with fruit and nothing else in its ingredients Please retain it and get it right to benefit the scores of us that enjoy providing healthy treats for our kids 
Wrong Item I was looking forward to this item but I was sent the cheaper non organic version twice Amazon informed me that they couldn t guarantee when the problem would be fixed If someone orders this and gets the organic version please post I d love to buy these in the future 
would rather eat broccoli These things are just plain disgusting If you are ever in need of emegency rope get these but otherwise I doubt they are fit for human consumption It feels and tastes like eating soft plastic and I would hate to think what they do to your insides I have battled to even give some of these away so they ended up in the trash can where they rightfully belong 
ARE YOU KIDDING ME I m sorry but WHAT on God s Green Earth are these people talking about when they say the highest quality wholesome ingredients The first ingredient listed is corn syrup followed closely by sugar God I m livid Corn is a subsidized crop in this country and corn syrup is a MAJOR culprit in the obesity epidemic Spare yourself Eat a damn piece of fruit Many Thanks The Food Zealo 
white tea order arrive in good time the tea is not flavored enough with the vanilla Can not taste or smell the vannilla 
You Call This Soup I don t recommend any of Baxter s Soups These are terrible A waste of money Will not buy again Amazon I m beginning to see why item s are on sale You want to get rid of them Zero Stars 
Don t waste your time or money This purchase was done by my husband Need I say more ladies This soup if you can even call it that was a waste of money There was hardly any seafood in it at all and what little there was it was in small pieces It was more like cream in a can My son and husband are both big soup eaters and love chowder Let s just say that he bought a case of the stuff and 10 cans are still sitting in the pantry awaiting the next garbage day I will admit that I didn t try it it didn t smell or look appealing But if my husband the human garbage can says it s awful stuff I take his word for it and so should you 
blah kind of fishy tasting with a few potatoes floating in it along with a few green herbs not worth the price its not awful but not great eithe 
Not real impressed It almost seems like I received a different soup based on the other 5 star reviews The broth is thin mostly cubed potatoes and very fishy smelling Don t get me wrong it was edible but I won t be ordering another case of this flavor I m still waiting to receive the mushroom and blue cheese flavors 
OK Edited Review My first order came with leaking jars Amazon replaced and the second order arrived in good condition The one star which I can t seem to change reflected that fact My updated review is three stars I was mildy disappointed in this topping Out of the jar the black olives and the artichokes provide a flavor that has definate sour notes The texture of the ingrediants was pasty as opposed to chunky I would have given this only two stars if this was supposed to be a pasta sauce However I followed the directions on the jar to create their version of Bruschetta It is acceptable Since this is billed as a topping I am willing to give it three stars since in that capacity to performs at a pleasurable level The Vodka sauce is much more to my liking 
Very Disappointing Although the product is very easy to use and the rice sticks together perfectly to make a sushi roll the rice is tasteless because it has neither mirin vinegar nor sugar nor salt in it commonly called sushi vinegar the nori wrappers are too small to make any decent sized roll and too thin to withstand any handling I have had better sushi rolls at the worst japanese restaurant the soy sauce is OK but without wasabi mustard you cannot achieve the taste of real sush 
A little mealy These are a little mealy or grainy but are OK Pretty high in carbs though 
Much too sweet tasting and contains splenda If you really like Chinese food you might like this chicken stew However it was much too sweet tasting for my tastes The main reason that I give it 2 stars is that it contains the artificial sweetner Splenda see sucralose in the ingredients but that is not advertised anywhere on the package besides the small print in the ingredient list I personally don t eat or drink products that contain artificial sweetners for various reasons and had I known the product contained Splenda I wouldn t have purchased it honestly It has the typical Splenda after taste 
Fruit filling was better I too like the old smucker s filled strawberry better aka fruit wheats this is OK but fruit filling is better They probably switched because it got to expensive to make unless they starting making in china thus you now have this nestle quick artificial strawberry tasting stuff 
Liked the previous version better I wish that Kellogg s would return to the previous style of these the Strawberry Filled Mini Wheats the raisin filled and the blueberry filled were much better than these frosted varieties 
Unappetizing Pink Biscuits Torpedo This Odd Variant on Shredded Wheat It s not quite as bad as I expected but the Strawberry Delight flavor of the Frosted Mini Wheats suffer most from how it looks the unnatural pink color dyed into the wheat biscuits in such a way as to make them wholly unappetizing Otherwise it offers a sweetened taste that barely reminds me of real strawberries at least to the point where you wonder what the point is to this variation from Kellogg s One 42 gram serving a mini box equals a higher than average 140 calories but only five are from fat The other good news is that there is no measurable sodium and cholesterol to the cereal I would think adding real strawberries or even dried berry variations would be preferable to this cereal so I think I ll leave this as a pass 
Expensive mistake Bob s Red Mill Roasted Oregon Hazelnuts Bob s Red Mill Roasted Oregon Hazelnuts tasted stale and over cooked This is not a quality product and not good value for the money Don t waste your money on this item 
Bad buisness My product should have been delivered a month ago This is very bad buisness to think that you can ship something whenever you feel like it I am a paying customer that should have been reinbursed in some way for the mistake that your copany made 
Good but gritty I bought two flavors of Gloria Jeans k cups I loved the price The coffee is wonderful but I hate getting grounds in my coffee I ve had about 1 in 5 cups that have coffee grounds under the filter so when the coffee brews they end up in my cup about a 1 2 teaspoon per cup Lower price = poorer manufacturing standards 
sticky mess These were a sticky mess in the bag the fruit juice leaked from the lollypops and leaked out of the plastic wrap They were also soft and seemed stale Great ingredients but the final product was disappointing 
Tastes ok some tough bits I was trying these as a change of pace from the Turkey Jerky I normally eat They taste ok nothing special but several of the medallions in at least 3 bags so far had crunchy bits in them I suspect it was gristle or possibly small bone fragments Not pleasant to eat I may have just gotten a bad batch other than the crunchy bits I d give these a 4 star rating 
disappointed I had tried this tea before purchasing a large quantity from Amazon What I received was disappointing I suspect old stock that was no longer fresh I will not purchase tea from Amazon again since you were not willing to accept a return 
Too sweet That about says it all This cereal is just too sweet Their Flax cereal is better 
They don t taste too good Not only is the popcorn incredibly salty but they do not taste very crispy Quite stale Overall disappointing I sent my stuff overseas with delivery within 4 days after receiving them so it is not that I kept them too long Too bad they are too far to return Overall a disappointing experience 
this flavor too salty try chipotle I first bought Chipotle flavor and love that one That is my favorite flavor The Gouda flavor is much too salty for my taste so I will not buy this flavor again The quality of the popcorn and amount you get in this product is excellent I will be trying other flavors in future just not this one 
Good but very pricey I bought this just to try something new I love peach and mango flavors and this sounded very good I do think it s a good drink but whether or not I am able to think better because of it is up for debate I doubt I ll buy these again if only because they are quite pricey 12 small cans the liquid volume is only a smidgeon over one cup for over twenty dollars It s close enough to 2 a can to make it not cost effective to get vitamins and minerals this way The taste is good but I have had lots of other healthy drinks that taste just as good for less than a third of the cost But now I know this drink is not for me If you like good tasting nutritious drinks that cost a LOT of money this one s for you 
Dry granola Granola was very dry and not too sweet Need milk I prefer Costco s granola it taste much better I would not recommend the purchase of this product Now I got to find way to get rid of the other 5 packages Also bought the fruit and nut one Hope that s better 
Where are the BLUEBERRIES These are fine if they weren t supposed to have blueberries There are essentially none Most pouches of the 24 don t even contain a piece of blueberry when you do find one it s a very nice taste with the peanut but sadly that s very rare Avoid this variety 
Styrofoam in a box These were the absolute worst crackers I have ever tasted If Styrofoam could be served in a box it would taste like these Save your money 
Nature thins are great this box EXPIRES in 30 days I bought a CASE they expire in one month They taste great But SHAME on AMAZON I also bough Butter Rounds they expired LAST YEAR 
Not a Winner It is odd that my taste buds reported to me the opposite of the reviews here I m disappointed by that as I paid this premium price based on the 5 star reviews I m old enough to remember old time licorice that was sold for 1 cent even 5 for a penny and that is the flavor and consistancy that I was looking forward to when I purchased this licorice I have some anise spice in my cupboard for baking and I just tasted it to make sure that I didn t have my spices mixed up Based on that comparison My verdict is that this licorice tastes strongly of anise NOT licorice I thought it was much too soft There was no chew to it It was mushy The only thing I can think to compare it with is a soft cheese such as Havarti It is even softer than a mild chedder Sorry only 2 stars from me 
Good for a Gravy The main ingredient should be SALT 750mg per serving and there are 2 servings per can Come on we usually sweat or need more salt in the Summer but we tend to eat more soup in the Winter My first impression was boy this is salty It would be great as a gravy but so is a much cheaper Cambell s cream of mushroom 
Watch the expiration dates This pack of mac and cheese had an expiration date of 10 31 06 Not that we re talking about the most nutritious food to start out with anyway but I hate paying for items at near their expiration date I expected some reasonable amount of shelf life 
Not a very good cheesecake taste This Jello cheesecake mix is not nearly as tasty as their Sugar Free Banana Cream mix that one tastes like real banana cream This mix does not have the flavour of cheesecake and also has a vague chemically taste 
Not like vanilla extract I was disappointed with this powder I thought it would give food a taste similar to using vanilla extract but it doesn t When used in liquid it tends to sink to the bottom as it does not stay evenly mixed I won t buy it again I prefer using vanilla extract 
Very very bland Pro No trans fat Con No flavor Basically tastes like cardboard My children won t eat it 
Don t waste your money Although I like to consider myself open to cultural cuisine I found myself spitting this stuff out after paying about 6 for it at a international marketplace My significant other did the same I like salty stuff and I love licorice but this was just plain nasty Not only was it too salty but it had a terrible rubbing alcohol type flavor that went up to my nose and made me wonder if perhaps the candy had been tampered with or manufactured incorrectly I went online and read some other reviews other people have had similar experiences I guess it s one of those acquired tastes that has to be developed early Oh those Dutch I love em but hate this candy 
Why Pay 3 00 for an 18 oz jar When you can buy a 40 oz jar at the local grocery store for 4 59 
Very Disappointed I gave it one star for the concept I m a fan of Dave s hot sauces His combination of smoky barbeque flavors and straight heat always gets my saliva going But this spray had disappointing heat In fact there s nearly none that I could even discern It also had poor flavor It tastes like bad watery vinegar So why buy the stuff if it doesn t taste good or get your endorphins pumping The oleo resin from the habaneros which are supposed to give the spray heat like to come out of solution and pool up at the top of the bottle So instead of a homogeneous red color you get a blood red color floating on top of a pale yellow color and you have to shake furiously to get the spray looking normal again I called Dave s about it and they told me that s typical behavior I was excited about this sauce because I always wanted a way to evenly disperse sauce onto pizzas but all I got were over priced spray bottles filled with something I really can t describe as edible I d fill it with another sauce but it d probably just clog the nozzle It s also intended for use as a natural pest repellant Dave s suggest spritzing some on your garden to keep the rabbits at bay I ve never tried so I wouldn t know if it works as claimed I hope it does or there d be no need for this product to exist at all 
Get the Honey Nut version instead I ordered both this and Honey Nut version I wish I had paid more attention to the Low Fat part of this version This version is hard and too cinnamon sugary which seems to happen w some low fat cereals They compensate for the low fat by sugaring it up and end up w a hard less tasty and less filling product However the Honey Nut version is very good It has good crunch but is not too hard and has tasty almond slivers in it It s sweet but not overly for granola and no cinnamon taste at all I understand many products w raisins add cinnamon and I typically like cinnamon but this version is too much and the raisins too dried out and hard The package is very convenient though I now have to mix in the regular version w this product to help me get rid of the Low Fat stuff Some label info Low Fat w Raisin LF has 180 calories per 1 2 cup while Honey Nut HN has only 20 more at 200 There are 12 1 2 cup servings in the HN while the LF only has 10 Product weight is HN 24 oz and LF 20 5 oz Finally sugars are HN 11g while the LF has 15g 
CANNED pecan halves I would LOVE to have the above item Actually really wanted it so much that I called about it twice BOTH times i was sent 6 oz PACKAGES of pecans that I could have but probably would not have bought in any store My husband is extremely fond of the CANNED pecans and was very excited when i told him i had located them on line I don t have to tell you the disappointment when we were sent the others Sorry but i ll have to really research the product before i order again Ms Judie Cardwel 
Planters Pecan Halves 6 oz BAG This product came to me packed in bags not cans Disappointed 
disappointed I ordered this Mocha Java because the Green Mountain brand was not available There is no comparison I am very disappointed in the flavor of this coffe 
Make your own muffins I thought these muffins tasted like white rice bread which isn t very tasty I ve made my own muffins mixing brown rice flour tapioca flour and potato starch flour and they are a million times better Won t buy these again I expected these to be as close to the real thing as the Glutino crackers are to regular crackers not the tomato basil but the plain ones but they weren t 
Wrong title this is 5 gram packets not 5 ounce packets The title is wrong this item contains twelve 5 Grams 0 0175 ounce packets not twelve 5 Ounce packets 
didn t like it I wouldn t buy it again I like to try to new things and I had never had this before but it wasn t that good Yes my crew ate it they eat almost anything this isn t moving 
Not for us I am always looking for quality nutricious treats for my teens I bought the samplers to see if anyone had a favorite Sorry to say that we just did not like any of these A little too spicy and we were looking for crunch and got chewy 
Don t Give These to the Teacher I should have listened to the reviews This is not a good product and will not buy again 
candied fruit I bought this item thinking I was getting a healthy snack The fruit is soaked in high fructose corn syrup and it is extremely sweet Not health 
Strange taste These apples are coated in sugar and other gunk like sunflower oil which gives them a strange taste I was very disappointed when I tried them I was wanting nice dried apples that taste like apples instead of oil sugar and preservatives Now I m stuck with two bags of a product that is not very good I also got stuck with the dried strawberries which are even worse I will not be trying any more Stoneridge Orchard products BE AWARE these products cannot be returned to Amazon so be sure before you order 
Good Tasting bars but near expired from amazon Soft chewy a little grainy but a good flavor Mine were expired a week after I bought a whole 12 pack Don t expect whole berries Basically everything is ground together Odwalla bar is much better Definitely try the spirelina balls though a little bit of a green flavor the energy ginsing one is well worth the cost here And NOT almost expired 
Tastes like paste These may be healthy but you ll have to force yourself to eat it It tastes like paste with some fruit I would give them one star but I give them some credit for trying to make something healthy 
Find check dates I purchased Diamond pecans in their shells in December 06 note not these already shelled ones and discovered AFTER the kids were eating them that they were all rancid Be sure and check the dates if you can there weren t any on the in shell nuts because there s not much worse than ruining whatever you re trying to make with rancid nuts I have learned to only purchase pecans from places with dates on the package or where I can smell and taste them 
Metal packaging effects taste Perhaps it was just my microwave or cooking it too long but the two different types of this soup I have tried Chicken with noodles and chicken with rice have both left a nasty metallic taste in my mouth that is very hard to get rid of I would have thrown it out except it was the only thing I brought for lunch I do NOT recommend this soup 
Betty Lou s Chocolate walnut balls I could not believe how disgusting this product was I do not think it should be given a star at all I most certainly will not buy any of these products again I also bought the coconut balls This was such a waste of my money 
the taste really is lacking here I do agree that the quality is nothing to sneeze at These fill me up I know that they re pretty good for you and I like the nutty essence too I guess that I really was disappointed in the taste though The chocolate was slightly bitter tasting and took me by surprise I love the other flavors but this one is my leat favorite I would recommend the almond butter balls before this one they re soft and a little more on the sweet side 
Not Sweet or Chocolatey at all I eat pretty healthy and I m always looking for new healthy snacks especially sweet ones But this purchase was a real disappointment The quality and quantity were fine but the taste was totally lacking If you ve ever had Dr Fuhrman s Date Nut Pop ems this product is nothing like those I would say the primary taste is ground flax seed not a bad taste kind of mild but certainly doesn t satisfy a sweet tooth 
is it really healthy I read in a review that if you are on a blood thinner that this tea is not good for you What does it do that makes it unhealthy thin the blood more It didn t seem to affect my protime but I m concerned 
Chock full of MSG and other Additives I bought these because they are described as 100 all natural dry roasted almonds Now I read the label states that these contain maltodextrin modified potato starch sugar MSG autolyzed yeast extract modified corn syrup solids modified corn starch salt 
Disappointing I was disappointed with this product I love dried fruit but this product is overly sweet and does not have much strawberry taste They have a strange smell but not a nice strawberry smell They are very dark in color and moist from sunflower oil Simple dried fruit without the oil and fructose additions would be much nicer You should also know that this food product cannot be returned I would have sent it back in a flash if I could have 
Tasty but Burnt and Salty OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty but these are a tad too salty They also have a burnt flavor You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first instead of buying 12 bags Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon 
Takes too long I think that this mix does not taste as good or prepare as quickly as the Liptun Cajun Rice and Beans 6 4 oz Not at all 
SmartMonkey Evaluation This is a terrible tasting bar I have tried many raw bars and this one is by far the worst I ve ever tasted It leaves an after taste 
Nutrition Bar Evaluation Worst tasting nutrition bar I have ever had And I ve probably tried over 100 different kinds This one tastes like soap 
Not very tasty strange texture I thought these Gummi Bears tasted funny like there was perfume in them I have eaten other brands of Gummi Bears or Gummi Bear wannabes and these did not taste anything like those The flavors were not very distinct or fruity The texture was also very different and not very palatable I know that these are vegan Gummi Bears and do not contain gelatin and I assume that is why the texture is so different However I have eaten another brand Sunny Bears of gelatin free Gummi Bears and their texture was very different more like jelly candy I would buy the regular Gummi Bears but I am allergic to dyes and I can t find any that are dye free except these and the Sunny Bears After I wrote to Amazon customer service about the product and explained to them that I could not stand to eat any more and wanted to return them they immediately refunded my money no questions asked even though the product is not eligible for return because it is a grocery item I was impressed 
Sour espresso This type of machine just cannot make good espresso Espresso must be made with a fine grind of beans correct temperature of water and high water pressure to extract the right amount of flavor from the beans for the right amount of time With a quick no fuss machine like the Tassimo some of these ingredients are missing from this machine s process so the espresso turns out rather sour Adding the latte milk covers up the worst of it but it s not a great latte either Stick with regular coffee in the Tassimo and although it s not wonderful either it might get you through the morning 
Save your money I suppose everyone who does gluten free baking is always searching for the holy grail that would make GF products have the same texture as non GF products This gluten substitute is not worth the effort save your money 
warning Robusta contains 50 percent more caffeine than other gourmet coffees This is because it is not arabica beans which are the beans of quality coffee brewing It is Rubusta the cheap mostly vietnamese filler coffee mostly found ihn supermarket blends such as Folgers Maxwell House etc The flavor of burnt twigs but you get more caffeine That s pretty much Robusta I guess it s ok since most people who go into starbucks ask for vanilla caramel almond suger drinks rather than caring about the coffee or is it because they ve never been told that there is big flavor a difference between arabica and robusta and they incorrectly believe that if they order without all of the suger flavoring they d taste Folgers Or Shock If you like coffee good coffee stick to arabicas If you like good coffee flavor and also lke more caffeine then just find a lighter roast of arabicas If all you want is caffeine you ll look smarter if you avoid the markeing silliness of Shock and buy NoDoze 
Not a good Amazon purchase Two of the six packages were beginning to mold but not even close to the expiration date One other package was visibly torn I was curious to see if any of the packs were still sealed air tight so I placed them in water Five of the packs were exposed to air with small opening around the seal I imagine that they burst somewhere in their travels from changes in altitude pressure I cannot vouch for the actually taste of the product as I did not eat them The silver lining Amazon has GREAT customer service 
Be Wary of the Go Tart Do not be fooled by this sugar coated seemingly delectable pastry I have been a long time fan of the original Pop Tart and the Go Tart just seemed like the natural progression of things so I went along with the newest technology in mass produced baked goods The Go Tart offers you a Pop Tart on the go because everyone knows this is the 21st century and we are on the move I m venturing to guess that Go gurt was a success so why not make a Go Tart Well there are a number of reasons Actually just one You can already eat a Pop Tart on the go It s too bad the Go Tart ruined everything I loved about the Pop Tart The greatest hope I had for this flop of a product was that the frosting or what you d like to call that sugary stuff on the top would reach the corners of the tart unlike the original Pop Tart Though the sugar covers the corners there is barely any frosting at all on this tart It is but a thin line of the sugary goodness we would all expect from a normal Pop Tart The filling has a gooey consistency and worst of all the breading part crumbled in my hand I had to eat my Go Tart in pieces This is clearly not on the go This is worse than a Pop tart and is probably more fattening than one Save your money boycott the Go Tart 
Product description inaccurate The online product description lists the only ingredient as 100 natural cherries I ordered the product and discovered that it also contains sugar and sunflower oil Buyer beware A better cherry choice is Melissa s dried cherries they do not contain any added sugar or oil 
NOT All Natural My own fault for not reading the ingredients but the marketing info on this product is extremely misleading Basically it s a 10 bag of blueberry candy High Fructose Corn Syrup is the second ingredient oil and flavoring also added I don t have anything against candy but this stuff left my teeth tingling for hours after I ate it I actually had to brush my teeth twice This product should not be in the natural and organic category don t waste your money 
Warning Sugar Added I love blueberries both fresh and dried but these have sugar added which makes them far too sweet for my taste Dried fruit is always naturally sweet added sweeteners just turn them into pure candy instead of a naturally healthy snack Thumbs down for this one 
too sweet I was excited to get these but did not read the ingrediants before purchasing Big mistake To me they are far too sweet and almost sappy tasting I dont feel like im eating something healthy rather some of those chewy snakcs they make for kids The high fructose is insane and really i feel they would be better off with a fraction of what they add 
This Just is un Just Beyond the glaring fact that most of their products aren t tomatoes this one is a blight on the Just Tomatoes ethos Just But it has two ingredients It s not just anything if it includes both bananas strawberries They don t call Cracker Jack Just Peanuts Popcorn and High Fructose Corn Syrup Nor is it just something when it comes in a package of 2 They don t call a variety pack of cereal Just Grains and High Fructose Corn Syrup The Just Tomatoes folks deserve credit for their aspirations to purity but this just goes beyond it It goes against the mimalist and reductive concept to the absolutely roccoco It s just not right 
Well it works There is no doubt that this tea does it s job but the smell of it is awful I normally don t have any problems eating or drinking mildly offensive things but I have such an aversion to the smell of this tea It has a top note of moldy dank earth with a base note of acrid peppers gone bad The box says that it contains delicious sasparilla I don t taste anything like sasparilla or rootbeer in it at all If you can bear the smell and aftertaste then go for it 
What was shipped was not what was promised First let me say that Ahmad tea is great tea for the price This is not quite the same thing as great tea but given the price performance of Ahmad tea I should rightly rate it four or even five stars So why only two stars Amazon claims you ll get the following six teas in each pack Ceylon Orange Pekoe English Breakfast Earl Grey Darjeeling English No 1 Jasmine Green But instead of Jasmine Green I got English Afternoon tea What you might not realize is that Ahmad s English Afternoon and English Tea No 1 contain Bergamot This is a citrus oil used to make Earl Grey which is also included English Afternoon and English Tea No 1 are both Earl Greys The bergamot might be slightly weaker than in a traditional Earl Grey but it s still obviously there So half of this package is Earl Grey I don t really like Earl Grey tea If you really like Earl Grey teas you might enjoy this Otherwise stay far away 
Unusual disappointment for Ener G I ve tried several brands of gluten free pizza crusts I bought the Ener G as my latest product exploration Being a huge fan of many of Ener G products I thought this one would be a slam dunk hit How wrong I was The Ener G pizza crusts are too thin dense and heavy with very little taste You would think thin and heavy would be contradictory but that s what I really mean to say By contrast the Kinnikinnick pizza crusts are light and fluffy with such an outstanding declicious flavor I would strongly suggest buying a single package of the Ener G pizza crusts from your local health food store first I made a mistake trusting Ener G on this product before I bought a whole case of it It was an expensive lesson But nonetheless a huge thanks to Amazon for offering so many gluten free products Here in the US we are just starting to become familiar with how many people are affected by gluten 
Way too hard I tried one bite of this cracker and had to throw it away for fear of cracking my teeth Buy the Wasa 7 Grain instead the 7 grain is light and crispy 
TOO SWEET This bar would be great if it wasn t so full of sugar It gives me a sugar headache 
Disgustingly sweet I wanted to like this bar because it s high in protein and fiber but it is also unfortunately high in added sugars 31g It s much too sweet If they took away some of the sugar it might be edible 
pretty average coffee Not great coffee Rocamojo and PuraVida which amazon also sells is so much better and those aren t great just good This is cheap coffee and tastes like it I can t complain much at about 3 a pound but it s just ok drinkable but wouldn t buy again 
Too Sweet I made the mistake of purchasing this 12 pack without testing it at the stores first due to glowing reviews on this site I have a sweet tooth but these were so sweet that it was nauseating I couldn t taste any caramel or other flavor just straight sugar If you are considering this product and haven t tasted it before I highly recommend you purchase a small bag first so you don t waste your money 
Not what i expected I thought i was getting a mix of some sort this is just an expensive condiment 
Disappointing The quality of this tea is far below that of other matcha s I have tried The packaging alone is careless and does not bespeak of the tender care that is typically given to green tea particularly the fine powder I would not purchase this product again The quantity that I do have I will cut with other better tea rather than waste it If you do try this product use care opening the package because the tea is inside without any barrier to keep it from spilling 
Lousy tea This so called treasure is not a treasure at all a big disappointment 
I can t agree I m sorry but these just weren t for me they have somewhat of a stale taste I recommend buying a single bag before buying a case if you are at all hesitant 
eh I accidently picked these I really wanted the hot fries These just are not as good I guess if you like cheddar they are okay 
Back to cans for me This is just like Cup Noodles without the noodles Eek 
salty very sad to say that this is salty no I mean SALTY Will try something else for my son Annie please make these less salty and I will try them again 
Nice texture but wayyyy too salty Too salty for me there is a better brand out there 
This Stuff is Terrible This stuff tastes absolutely Terrible Steer Clear and don t be mislead by the texture review below Yup the texture is great but it the taste makes you gag it definately isn t worth it 
Yuck I was excited to try this product as I love Oreos but don t like all the garbage that goes into them We tried Newman O s Originals my wife went first and the look on her face said it all Still I had to see for myself We both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as Oreo cookies For some reason others seem to think they taste great Just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large 
too sugary They sounded good but aren t tart enough for my taste and are prepared with too much sugar 
To sweet These dried cherries are more like candy than dried fruit I was expecting a chewy tart treat and got an instant sugar high instead I will use the rest of the cherries in salads or on cereal but I won t buy them again 
Disappointed I was very disappointed when I received the dried cherries I did not realize that they included sugar and sunflower oil When I opened the package you could feel the oil on the cherries I had to rinse them in hot water before I could use them This information is not included anywhere in the description 
WARNING These boxes contain Splenda In Amazon s ultimate wisdom they will NOT return or exchange items from their grocery store even though it is in Beta status I ordered these in good faith as they appeared to be the normal packaging but be warned that these contain Splenda and so may not be suitable for everyone I d avoid the Amazon grocery store at all costs going forwards 
Misleading Labeling I thought this product had reasonably good taste but I have two major issues with it First they describe this as a Kettle Corn It is not Kettle Corn not even close This is a caramel corn with a thick sweet coating Real Kettle Corn is a slightly sweet slightly salty popcorn Second each very small bag has 1 5 servings in it When was the last time you opened a small bag of snack food and only ate 2 3 s of it They purposely made the serving size unrealistic to make it look healthier The whole point of paying for individual size bags is that it limits you to a set portion Remember when a can of Coke had 1 5 servings in it The FDA made them change the label If you eat the whole bag you are eating 200 calories of popcorn No better that a bag of potato chips or a few cookies so this is not a lesser evil it s just the same old junk food with a new name I won t buy this product again It s the same stuff you can get anywhere 
Not tasty I thought this would be a great tasting healthy snack after reading the reviews Mine arrived safely and crunchy unlike the other reviewer who got a bad batch However they were not sweet and tasty My sister described it as tasting like cardboard Now I have 5 whole bags I don t know what to do with Maybe I ll put in a recipe and hope it turns out better If you can I d recommend try before you buy 
NOT CRUNCHY Do not buy Crunchies products in the Hot summer months They are heat sensitive As the packaging states IMPORTANT STORE IN COOL DRY AREA The two cases I purchased arrived chewy and clumped together They probably cooked during shipping and are not a Raw Food and not as Nutritious anymore Two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened Amazon com does not accept grocery returns It was a waste of 40 
Good but gritty I bought two flavors of Gloria Jeans k cups I loved the price The coffee is good but I hate getting grounds in my coffee I ve had about 1 in 5 cups that have coffee grounds under the filter so when the coffee brews they end up in my cup about a 1 2 teaspoon per cup Lower price = poorer manufacturing standards 
Coconut Why did they have to add coconut to these snack bars They would have been great without the coconut And now I find out I can t return them and I m stuck with them If you want them let me know I ll trade you for some decent granola bars 
hard rasins Not tneir Best not my favorite of their products The rasins are Hard and sometimes Burnt it takes to long to soften 
Gritty and tasteless I ordered this brand because it had the least amount of sugar The cherries were gritty dirty sand and did not have the tart taste of locally purchased dried cherries Now I m stuck with a whole box of them that no one in my family wants to eat 
Salty soggy and not too nice It is a quick meal when you need it but hopefully you won t need it too often I guess you can t expect too much from a two minute meal but it would be nice if you could expect more than this It is an easy kosher meal when you don t have a kosher microwave 
I was very disappointed I purchased these candies hoping for a good tasting soft licorice candy Ummm no on both accounts Taste was miles away from any of the licorices Ive had and these things were hard as rock Oh well at least I tried them 
fantastically refreshing I bought the natural flavour Didn t find it very palatable the first time But the next time was much better and now I am hooked on to it An acquired taste indeed The 11 ounce is difficult to down in one go though 
Mango is really mango e If you dont like mangos you will not like this drink It does not taste like an organic mango but rather it tastes more like the essence of mango you would smell from an air freshener This does mix pretty well with cold rum I would suggest you find this brand locally to try it before you buy it This water does not taste like the water you would get from the Asian countries I cant really explain why either 
Tried the Sampler Pack Excellent One of the few food items I ve found on here that I think I ll buy again Remember that it s best chilled ice cold if you re ever gonna sample it Not so good when not so cold great when actually cold Very refreshing feel either way though after you ve had a drink 
Awesome Zico Coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut If you never had coconut water before I would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12 Some people may say it s an aquire taste but I think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised I started drinking coconut water ever since I was a baby It s very healthy and low in sugar Currently I give it to my son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices 
The Best This is the best snack bar we have tried It has the highest quality raw organic ingredients and they are blended into a delicious bar We have tried a few of their flavors and this and Rasberry Chocolate are our favorites 
It s a Meal This is unlike any other bar I ve tried I like that it s gooey green I m tired of the drier oat like bars It s satisfying tasty May not be for everyone though I only wish more ingredient percentages would be listed on the Amazon descriptions most of these things are pretty high fat Ok for a meal on the run 
Excellent Product Read ingredients if you have diet problems These are by far the best tasting Spirulina bars in the market The whole line is more desert like in concept so of course they are sweet chewy People with IBS probably should not eat finely chopped raw nuts and should read ingredients before buying The food is safe for celiac and most food allergens AGAIN READ THE LABEL BASED ON YOUR DIETARY SITUATION The bars travel very well and although they may bend and mush because they are naturally moist and chewey melting Never All the bars in this line travel great and can sit for months in hot or cold These are particularly good for athletes and people on the run Oh and the price come on there is nothing else that even comes close for the size and quality 
Healthy delicious snack I received it quickly and was happy with the delicious alternative to plain granola It s a healthy snack that s great on yogurt and a good alternative to other cereals 
A great way to start or end your day Absolutely scrumptious granola that is good for you low fat high fiber a delicious alternative to the bland tasteless granolas produced by the major American cereal makers I ve tried virtually all of the Back to Nature products and each and every one is sensational Do yourself a favor and try this product Highly recommended 
Great Healthy Snack Back to Nature Apple Strawberry Granola are an excellent product for a healthy breakfast or snack Each flavor of the Back to Nature Granola is tasty I would be careful before ordering this product in bulk My order of 6 bags came in this week and they are due to expire on September 15th I did not realize before ordering that this product was getting ready to expire and would not have placed the order had I known this As this is a food product it is not eligible for return So while this is an excellent product I would not recommend ordering this from Amazon Grocery unless you are prepared to have a bulk order of food that is getting ready to expire 
Happy Chocolate I have been using the Navitas Natural Organic Raw Cacao Nibs for four months now and it gives me a feeling of happiness well being and energy for the day We add it to our fruit smoothie in the morning I don t eat chocolate with dairy and sugar as it gives me pimples However I can tolerate the nibs 
Great on ice cream These nibs are great on ice cream or with cool whip Not good alone but paired with a sweet they are great I am going to try cookies next week I have already bought more 
Good for the body You have to use this product a special way to appreciate all it does for you It is very good for the body I tried to eat some right out of the bag but decided it is best to put it in other food items like homemade cookies or my applesause Good stuff 
BITTER BITTER BITTER These little nibs are very bitter I wouldn t recomend poppin them straight from the bag They were fabulous melted in a pan with some sweetner dip with chunked fruit lay on tray covered with wax paper and refridgerate for 20 min The chocolate hardens Raspberries are my families favorite but any fruit works Also very good sprinkled in warm milk for a homemade hot chocolate This is a great product for experimental food people Straight out of the bag disappointing 
tasty little treat I have become rabid about avoiding trans fats and any product with partially hydrogenated oils that calim to have zero trans fat This led to me shopping in health food stores Whole Foods for anything in the cracker cookie snack category I once searched for graham crackers and vanilla wafers with no partially hydrogenated oils in 3 4 supermarkets and couldn t find any so I went to Whole Foods near my job I saw these crackers and bought the Cheddar flavor and loved them I have since bought the wheat and ranch flavors Who doesn t love a snack with a serving size of 50 bunnies 
Bunnies Trounce Goldfish I have enjoyed Goldfish and other cheese based snack crackers since I was a child but no more I tried these Cheddar Bunnies as I have enjoyed other products by Annie s and have now found my all time favorite snack cracker From a nutritional standpoint they are better than many competing products as they have no hydrogenated oils or artificial flavors and are made from organic ingredients including real Wisconsin cheddar cheese The packaging does an excellent job of preserving freshness the taste is natural and very refreshing for a snack food and the price is comparable to other non organic products I am completely satisfied with these crackers the are a good value they compare favorably in the nutritional realm with competitors although they really don t qualify as health food of course they taste fantastic and last but not least they re fun 
Great snack These cheddar bunnies are now a favorite in our house Better tasting and cuter than goldfish crackers these are a good snack to give to your kids or eat yourself I was very pleased with this purchase 
Tasty Breakfast Snack or Dessert Good Fuel Food Bear Naked All Natural Granola Apple Cinnamon is a delicious and nutritious way to start or add a little treat to your day As a breakfast cereal it also is sold in larger 12 oz packages of 6 you ll be scraping the bottom of the bowl to get just that last little bit more It s sweet enough so you do not have to add sugar Just use with low fat milk soy or Lactaid another great product for those who are lactose intolerant for a low calorie high energy starter Nice chunk size pieces that are both chewy and crunchy and don t get all soggy You can really taste the apple cinnamon in this one The ingredients which are Bearly Processed and Utterly Naked are whole grain oats good carbs wildflower honey expeller pressed canola oil walnuts smart fats apples coconut almonds oat bran crisp rice rice an barley malt natural flavors whole grain flax sesame seeds and cinnamon There are 7 gr fat 1 5 sat fat no trans fat no cholesterol no sodium 17gr carbs 3 grms dietary fiber 5 gr sugar probably from the fruit and honey and 3 gr protein 140 total calories per serving 1 4 cup which I think is a little small for breakfast of course that is before you add the milk so don t forget to add that in if you are counting calories Makes a great pick me up snack or dessert too Eat em right out of the bag There are plenty of good size chunky bits The only problem is that no matter how much you shake it up after the chunks are gone there is only crumbs which are hard to eat as a snack could get a little messy But You can always add those crumbs to a carton of Yogurt or a topping for frozen Yogurt for a little extra flavor This 12 pack of 2 oz bags is a really good deal price wise compared to the grocery store There are a good variety of different tastes and flavors We also liked the banana nut quite a bit but found the peak protein package bland I only wish that there was a variety pack for purchasing them in these bulk deals Click on the Bear Naked Link to see other products The package has a zip lock to maintain freshness and prevent spills Throw em in your car purse backpack or gym bag Remember to breathe eat healthy and enjoy Laurie

Great alternative to sugary drinks This product is great Very refreshing It tastes just like you are drinking it straight from a young coconut It doesn t have any added sugar it s only 60 calories a serving I just wish it were cheaper 
Tried the Sampler Pack Excellent One of the few food items I ve found on here that I think I ll buy again Remember that it s best chilled ice cold if you re ever gonna sample it Not so good when not so cold great when actually cold Very refreshing feel either way though after you ve had a drink

Relieves leg cramps If you have ever had trouble with leg cramps be sure to drink Zico It will relieve your cramps almost instantly probably because it is so high in potassium I have recommended it to others and it always works Pat Rampolla 
Best of the best Bear Naked is my favorite granola and Fruit and Nut is by far my favorite flavor I came across Bear Naked because one of my favorite breakfast s is granola mixed with banana and yogurt When I went off of refined sugar I was having the hardest time finding a granola without sugar added Bear Naked uses all natural sugars like pear juice and maple syrup My favorite part of this flavor is the dried cranberries and the coconut plus the almonds add crunch to an overall chewy texture I recommend this brand to all lovers of granola and to anyone looking for a healthy treat 
The best darn granola on the planet Bear Naked Granola is just fabulous I ve tried every granola around and Bear Naked strikes the right balance between crunchy sweet and ostensibly good for you And Amazon s price certainly beats what you d pay at the store 
cheaper than one by one at the store Good low sodium low sugar granola that I feel I can t afford at the onesie price in the traditional shopping venues 
Not bad I hesitate to write a review about a food because well one man s meat is another man s poison I like the not too sweet and minimally processed taste of this brand the Banana flavour is our favourite The Fruit and Nut flavour lacks a little oomph and the fruit inside is too tangy for my taste buds so maybe TOO minimally processed Also remember that All Natural is NOT organic even if you find this in the health food section of your grocery store Our local Target also carries this brand of granola and has the best price for it 
Being Naked Is Good I love granola and cereal in general but I have to say that this is the very best granola I have ever had The people at Bear Naked have a philosophy that I love and which is on the back of every bag we believe food should be hand made from wholesome and natural ingredients you can actually pronounce Although I do eat processed food I appreciate the appeal of the more traditionally prepared foods and this granola tops the list for nutrition and taste Like most granola it is high in calories and fat but take note that the fat comes largely from the nuts contained it also contains expeller pressed canola oil and it has no trans fat and only 1 5g of saturated fat per serving This cereal is softer than most granola though not soft enough for me to consider it chewy It does have large chunks of nuts and also contains cranberries and flax seed for optimal nutritional and digestive health The six pack sold on Amazon makes the price per package reasonable the ingredients are quite expensive so as a value proposition I think this is not only a great product but a great buy Delicious and nutritious a great combination that I recommend highly 
Mom of 4 We love this granola Bear Naked makes wonderfully nutritious and delicious granola We love eating the Banana flavor by the handfuls and the Peak Protein flavor mixed in with our yogurt Amazon sells it for a great price too 
You Lucky Dog This is the second time I ve bought these for my dog Although they are not dog treats my dog loves them She is very special to me so I get her the best This is a great price for these slim jims If I buy them in the store I pay alot more for them I ve tried them also their very good They come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time Just like the ones they sell in the stores If you buy them one at a time at 25C a piece you pay 25 00 dollars for them I think this is a great value 
Great Snack These individually wrapped Slim Jims make great snacks for hungry kids Toss a few in your purse and you have a portable filling treat while you re out with the kids My kids love them and ask for them over fruit snacks or candy 
fantastically refreshing I bought the natural flavour Didn t find it very palatable the first time But the next time was much better and now I am hooked on to it An acquired taste indeed The 11 ounce is difficult to down in one go though

Great for trips I personally like the taste of this product but I can see that others may not The taste is unusual with natural tones I definitely like the packaging Standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time but a box of Zico survived a 2 week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine 
The Best This is the best snack bar we have tried It has the highest quality raw organic ingredients and they are blended into a delicious bar We have tried a few of their flavors and this and Rasberry Chocolate are our favorites 
LOVED IT MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE BEEN OFF SUGAR FOR SEVERAL YEARS WE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THESE SPIRULINA BARS SURE THEY ARE GREEN YET THAT IS THE COLOR OF SPIRULINA MY HUSBAND HAS PASSED THESE BARS OUT TO A NEIGHBOR AND OUR CHIROPRACTOR AND THEY LOVE THE BAR ALSO MY HUSBAND TRAVELS ALOT FROM WORK SITE TO WORK SITE AND THIS SPIRULINA BAR HELPS HIM WITH HIS HUNGER PAIN IN A NUTRITIOUS WAY 
A little sour but overall filling and good I ve been wanting to try Spirulina the superfood that everyone in the health world swears by and figured this would be as good an opportunity as any to do so The bar is a medium sized green rectangle It smells interesting and is very moist and chewy I m not a big fan of sour foods so I didn t like that it tasted a bit sour My brother however LOVED this bar more than all the others we tried Has a lot of cashew and is very sweet and packed with good fats VERY FILLING Overall if you like sour and sweet this bar is for you 
Great Granola This granola is great tasting and healthy Other brands of granola have unhealthy oils in them but this granola does not Apple blueberry is my family s favorite flavor 
Navitas naturals Organic Raw Cacao Nibs Couldn t find this item in any stores in my town so I went to Amazon naturally and found it The item was delivered on time too Thanks Amazon 
raw cacao nibs These were exactly what i wanted and tasted great in my home made mint cocoa nib ice cream where the bitterness didn t turn you off from the product 
The kids love these great for school snacks My kids love these snacks and now they are in a handy bag for school snacks It makes me feel good that I ve sent my children off with a healthy snack Will buy them again good price 
tasty little treat I have become rabid about avoiding trans fats and any product with partially hydrogenated oils that calim to have zero trans fat This led to me shopping in health food stores Whole Foods for anything in the cracker cookie snack category I once searched for graham crackers and vanilla wafers with no partially hydrogenated oils in 3 4 supermarkets and couldn t find any so I went to Whole Foods near my job I saw these crackers and bought the Cheddar flavor and loved them I have since bought the wheat and ranch flavors Who doesn t love a snack with a serving size of 50 bunnies 
My daughter LOVES them My daughter is addicted to Chedder Bunnies LOL Which is fine because they are not made with any hydrogenated oils They are her favorite snack and she asks for them everyday We are always stocked with a box or two 
My 17 month old loves them Just the right size snack pack for my 17 month old Healthier alternative to other packaged crackers without sacrificing taste 
great for kids and adults These are just delicious and I like having the controlled portions in the bags a very satisfying snack for 150 calories 
Bunnies Trounce Goldfish I have enjoyed Goldfish and other cheese based snack crackers since I was a child but no more I tried these Cheddar Bunnies as I have enjoyed other products by Annie s and have now found my all time favorite snack cracker From a nutritional standpoint they are better than many competing products as they have no hydrogenated oils or artificial flavors and are made from organic ingredients including real Wisconsin cheddar cheese The packaging does an excellent job of preserving freshness the taste is natural and very refreshing for a snack food and the price is comparable to other non organic products I am completely satisfied with these crackers the are a good value they compare favorably in the nutritional realm with competitors although they really don t qualify as health food of course they taste fantastic and last but not least they re fun 
Great snack These cheddar bunnies are now a favorite in our house Better tasting and cuter than goldfish crackers these are a good snack to give to your kids or eat yourself I was very pleased with this purchase

Awesome Zico Coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut If you never had coconut water before I would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12 Some people may say it s an aquire taste but I think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised I started drinking coconut water ever since I was a baby It s very healthy and low in sugar Currently I give it to my son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices 
yumminess so good i love bear naked i think the fruit and nut is the best out of their varieties 
You Lucky Dog This is the second time I ve bought these for my dog Although they are not dog treats my dog loves them She is very special to me so I get her the best This is a great price for these slim jims If I buy them in the store I pay alot more for them I ve tried them also their very good They come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time Just like the ones they sell in the stores If you buy them one at a time at 25C a piece you pay 25 00 dollars for them I think this is a great value 
Great Snack These individually wrapped Slim Jims make great snacks for hungry kids Toss a few in your purse and you have a portable filling treat while you re out with the kids My kids love them and ask for them over fruit snacks or candy 
Still a Great Treat I have to say that this 100 count box is a great deal for your money Although this isn t a full size Slim Jim but rather a shorter one it s the perfect size for a lunch box surprise or a mid afternoon pick me up Slim Jim has managed after all these years to still provide the same taste of slightly spicy slightly salty goodness and you won t go wrong with the 100 count box 
Taste Great My whole family love these crackers It s nice that they are organic with no artifical ingredients or hydrogenated oils The only thing I wish is that they were whole grain 
Mom of 4 All 4 of mine love these They are great for a quick snack on the go or to pack in lunches when in a hurry 
Great Tasting Crackers Perfect for busy families These crackers are an excellent quality snack food The classic cracker is a crispy Ritz like buttery cracker with peanut butter inside as described I bought a box at our local supermarket before committing to the 4 boxes and the kids husband loved them To save money I bought them on Amazon Each packet has 4 cracker sandwiches in them so if you are like me you d like to know that your kids will eat the entire package Most of the other brands have 6 in a pkg so sometimes kids will toss what they can t finish during lunchtime The cost is about 0 62 each and convenient I also purchased Back to Nature Mini Classic Creme Grab Go and they are 0 52 each pkg We eat ORGANIC and natural also and the food lookslike other kids at school but without the chemicals GMO s and hydrogenated fats yuk Eat healthy in 2007 
Forget the goldfish go for bunnies and BIG These crackers are great for the natural health conscious family as well as anyone else who loves goldfish or other cheese crackers They taste great and are all natural with organic wheat Nothing weird you can actually understand what every ingredient is how refreshing Plus I love this new BIG box 12 oz instead of regular 7 5 oz Not only does it save packaging and cabinet space but it s a better price per ounce Great for us because we go through them so fast Now that these are available here I also don t have to go to the store some of my local stores don t carry the big size anyway 
YUMMY with COFFEE The ONLY way I drink this stuff is mixed with a cup of coffee makes a very nice late afternoon treat without a ton calories 
Dr Kracker Flatbread Pumpkin seed cheese 7oz I love these crackers and was suprised to find them on amazon com I first found them in Reading Pa and here in florida could not find them High fiber is important to me and these have more than most 
super good These are really expensive at the leading national overpriced healthy food supermarket and they are worth even the higher price Don t worry about buying too many with the six pack I was a little concerned about that when I bought here a few months ago but my wife and I ate all of them easily I m not even the biggest fan of pumpkin seeds by themselves but in these Euro style flatbread crackers they add something really good to the flavor 
Yummy Crackers I am a South Beach Diet follower and these crackers are a perfect choice to fit the guidelines of the diet and they are delicious They are quite expensive in stores so I m very excited to see Amazon offering them at such a great price 
Healthy and Soothing I m a vegetarian and although my husband isn t he enjoys this soup just as much The tofu in the mix creates a creamy texture If you re expecting a potato au gratin flavor you will be disappointed However if you ve made homemade miso soup from scratch and like the taste this product makes an excellent time saving substitute The tofu serves a source of protein and the seaweed provides medicinal minerals This soup is excellent to drink when sick and remarkably soothes a sour stomach My local health food store charges 5 30 per box of 4 packets Amazon sells it for 2 66 a box Substantial Savings 
Instant restaurant meal in a minute What could be better than this just read the label of what is in it and check your fridge do you have the items to make it in about a minute 
Brazil Blend Muito Delicioso We spent 5 years in Brasil and Senseo has captured the essence of the premium cafe taste from some of the better Fazendas Well done particularly for a Dutch company 
Great Coffee for Senseo I am enjoying my Senseo even more with the addition of the new varities I like the Brazil Blend as well as the Sumatra 
brazilian blend coffe pods I find this coffee to be very rich in flavor yest strong enough for my taste 
GREAT TASTING COFFEE If you like strong coffess go with this its wonderful Definitely worth it 
The best Can t rave about this enough If you like sardines this is the way to go Just plain delicious 
Great Mild medium flavored coffee My wife and I have slightly different tasates in coffee I like mine darker and she like a milder coffee This one however is just right for both of us I drink it daily without cream or sugar which I only do when I actually enjoy the flavor of the coffee And we are on our second 5 pound bag I wish we had found this coffee sooner it is great 
LOVE this product For anyone who needs a shelf stable quick lunch option this is the one The soup is delicious and the prep couldn t be easier plus I love that you can prepare and eat it right in the bowl I always make sure I have a few of these in my desk drawer at work so I never have an I forgot my lunch issue and the portion is big enough to actually constitute a full meal for lunch anyway I love the Udon flavor and my husband swears by the Miso 
AUTHENIC thick Udon Noodles Biodegradable bowl Authenic but a little bland for me I add Ponzu sauce to taste and make sure it gets really HOT in the micriwave If steaming when you take it out it tastes better Pre Rinsing the noodles as directed is nonsense Just cover them with good clean water I never use TAP stir in the sauce and toppings and nuke it about 90 seconds uncovered Stir and serve It had everyone in MY OFFICE drooling with questions Best price is on Amazon just order 2 so you don t pay shipping 
It s unreal how good the Kimchi soup is I ve tried several of the Annie Chun flavors and I liked most of them but the Kimchi soup is just unbelievably delicious This is the BEST packaged soup product of any kind that I have ever tried and I usually dislike canned or packaged soup products This is even better than my favorite canned Brunswick Stew that I have loved for so long It is moderately spicy but if you don t mind a bit if spice this one is just too good to pass up I could practically live off of this stuff Thank you Annie Chun for making a packaged meal worth eating 
So simple and delicious This Annie Chun s udon soup is very easy to prepare I don t think the first step is necessary either Just add the water to the noodles and dried vegetables cover it with the lid and microwave it for about 3 1 2 minutes Add the sauce packet The noodles loosen up after you stir it If you what a more filling soup add meat vegetables My kids and I really love this soup I just purchased more from Amazon because it s a better buy here than at the grocery store 
Hot and Sour Soup I have purchased this item several times It is good and can be expanded by adding more vegetables or chicken It comes packaged well and is easy to prepare It is also in an environment friendly bowl which is important to me 
Great Coffee at a great price I moved from Northern California to the Ozark Mountains of northern Arkansas I can get Starbucks at the nearby grocery stores or more expensive gourmet coffees but that s about it I have been on the lookout for robust full flavored whole bean coffees at reasonable prices I tried Pete s espresso blend and liked it but it wasn t available the last time I checked So I tried this Fogbuster and I like it even more Good thing since it comes in a 5 lb bag If you like Starbucks French Roast this compares quite favorably 
A true convenience First found this concentrate a few years ago in Kroger and took it camping because of its small size Small size big on flavor and not too salty Was glad to find it online as I can t get it in stores nearby anymore 
awesome sparkling apple juice This sparkling juice really holds up to the description It has the perfect amount of carbonation not too much not too little is crisp to the taste and is very refreshing The 8 oz cans sounded pretty weak but it turns out that one can is the perfect amount for a sitting Since first tasting Martinelli s sparkling apple cider at a New Year s celebration over a decade ago I ve been a huge fan of carbonated apple drinks but none have been just right Naturally I ve tasted the types that I ve come across over the years including Martinelli s sparking cider which is kind of sweet tasting and not generally bottled for everyday consumption Martinelli s sparkling apple juice a bit under carbonated Apple Beer non alcoholic good but has a slightly odd taste Appletiser UK only good but UK only and a few other local organic brands All of the aforementioned beverages are good on occasion but seriously none compare to essn s Sparkling Fuji Apple Juice Yeah it is a little pricey but its worth it 
Mac Cheese bulk Amazon grocery was fast and easy as usual and the mac cheese is great we can t get our five year old to stop eating it price wise its a fairly good deal in comparison to the grocery store 
Healthy alternative to cheese curls These cheese sticks are irresistible In fact for a substitute they taste far better than the original My kids love them and 1 ounce pack fits perfectly into a lunchbox 
Delicious healthy and minimal mercury Check the company s website They select cook their tuna differently and that s what makes their tuna the best It has the lowest possible mercury same as salmon and much lower than regular tuna plus they cook it only once after it s canned so all the healthy vitamins and omega 3 fatty acids are still there in the can Plus Amazon has it for a great price 
Top Shelf Tuna This is just what I ve been needing for a power lifting diet or optimal health in general The flavor of the meat is not masked by salt Yet the aroma is not as overpouring as other brands Great stuff Four stars only because it is 3 75 per can 
Best Jerky Ever I bought this jerky at a Xmas lot a couple of years ago and everyone raved about it This year they were sold out but I was lucky to find it on Amazon even less expensive This is the best you can find the ones in the market to do not even compare Believe me it does not last long in our house Would definetly recommend the original and other flavors they are all great 
Surprising My packaged arrived much quicker than I had anticipated Since living in the Midwest the last 5 yrs I ve had limited access to beef jerky I accidentally ran into Oberto beef jerky which was fine just extremely salty and overly seasoned World Kitchens beef jerky tasted very natural and delicious I purchased it based on reviews and cravings and I would definitely purchase again Superb beef quality texture and flavor Thank you 
Fantastic taste and texture I don t think that it is possible to get better beef jerky for the price My wife and two kids also find it to be delicious 
Great Value Good Taste Ordered 2lbs based upon the positive reviews I am happy with the quality of the jerky and taste of the product I will buy again My kids love the stuff not a bad snack 
beef jerky at it s best Better beef jerky is not to be found anywhere Shipping was good and it made alot of people happy at Christmas time 
Works well in nearly any recipe I ve used this product for recipes such as chicken pot pie and shepherds pie To get height I whip the batter in my stand mixer to ensure lots of air bubbles are trapped to support the mix as it cooks They ve turned out great and you can t tell it s gluten free I ve had less luck making biscuits out of it came out hard but that seems to be a hazard in any gluten free flour mix 
Great for a Gluten Free Biscuit mix They were thick like Bisquick biscuits They tasted great Would be WONDERFUL in Chicken Dumplings The only thing I did wrong when making them was using Bob s Red Mill sAll purpose gluten free flour to roll the biscuit dough in It made the outside of our biscuits taste like raw beans yuck I used White Rice flour and they tasted great For a buttery flavor put butter or if you are GFCF a non casien containing margarine spread on the top for a taste similar to KFC Taste great with jelly in the middle too I froze the unbaked left over biscuits and they turned out well 2 months later 
Great for college students Easy convenient and tasty snack or breakfast Particularly good for college students 
They re pretty good I take these to work along with little minature milks I pick up at the convenient store They re quite filling and get me through to lunch just fine And they re not too bad for you either Considering they re all the sugary cereals your Mom complained about when you were a kid In fact the one with the highest calorie count 280 is the Rasin Bran and that s something that would actually be considered healthy All the rest fall into the 160 220 range 
Fresh crunchy salty nuts My spouse is on South Beach Diet and loves these I portion them out in ziplock bags 15 nuts each and they are grab and go Lots of protein some fat and very little carbs Fresh and tasty 
Good but almost all almonds These are good nuts very lightly salted just the way we like them But they are almost all almonds A little disappointed with that I was hoping they would be an equal mix of all the three variety of nuts 
Fast meal These are just wonderful when You want something quick for dinner just add chicken beef or seafood and any bottled sauce You like My favorite is alfredo sauce and some mushrooms Family loves it 
Gala Dutch Coffee I tried this coffee on a whim My husband and I really enjoy our single serve coffee maker We easily use up an 18 pak in 2 to 3 days between the grown children and us This coffee has very smooth taste and mildly strong in flavor It is a very nice coffee that can be enjoyed daily 
Very Tasty I like Pop Tarts as does my family and I was thrilled to see Go Tarts and even more thrilled when we tasted them You do not need to put these little guys in the toaster they are ready to dance about in your mouth without any heating and this is a good feature I often look for little snacks that I can take with me on long or short trips Sometimes a nibble keeps mouths occupied and stress down just when you need a little quiet in the car these are great for that or any other time you want a quick snack I tasted the Frosted Strawberry and it is very good Give them a try great for a quick snack at home or on the go 
Ready to eat and oh so good Man these things are good I used to eat Pop Tarts all the time but it eventually got to the point that a I got tired of Pop Tarts and b they seemingly just stopped making them like they used to Instead of being good and soft like they re supposed to be Pop Tarts morphed into hard pastries that felt and tasted like they had been left out in the air for a couple of days These new Go Tarts at least the frosted strawberry ones are just right soft pastries with just the right amount of strawberry inside them to give you that elusive strawberry twang taste some of you may know what I m talking about here These things are ready to eat right out of the pack so ready to eat in fact that there s a message on each package stating that you should not put them in a toaster or microwave If you re the daredevil sort and insist on breaking Kellogg s prescribed rules I can t stop you but don t blame me if your microwave explodes or something Of course one little 1 2 oz bar isn t enough for anyone bigger than a Chihuahua puppy so volume is an important factor here which is where these multi pack boxes come in so handy With 140 calories per bar I don t guess these things will be making any of Jenny Craig s diet plans any time soon but I say life s too short eat all you want And with these individually wrapped bars you won t face the classic Pop Tart dilemma of having to choose between eating two pastries now or putting one back in the box knowing that it will taste even more stale later because you ve already freed it from its freshness preserving little tinfoil wrapper thingy 
M Winter Willoughby Ohio Love Bob s Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed and will purchuse it again it is one of the best product on the market in my opinion I use Flaxseed every day I start my morning with a Oatmeal flax seed muffen that I came up with I also use it in a lot of my recipies Good Product Thanks Bob s Red Mill 
using more than I ever thought I would I was going to just put this on my cereal in the morning Now I add it to my protein shake suppliments and I ve started cooking with it by using it as a breading for fish chicken or pretty much anything It s fantastic I m going to end up ordering more soon 
Golden flax meal is the better one This is a great product The golden flax is slightly better tasting than the brown Its good enough to put in muffins and for us toppings such as apple bake where you can taste it We actually do consume enough to justify buying it buy the box We also consume it in shakes but its best when baked works great in cornbread too We also get stone ground flours and cornmeals and these three make up a lot of value in this department Flax oil of course is very high in short chain Omega 3 s Fish oils are better but if you have the other nutrients and enzymes in your body you can make the long ones from the ones in flax hence this product fulfills this need very well flax is very concentrated in short chain 3 s Did I mention it actually tastes great in baked goods Bob s Red mill is a quality product 
E L I X I R O F L I F E Yet One More Testamonial I have tried to lose weight for a long l o n g time Also for a long l o n g time I have seen newpaper advertizements for this tea It seemed ridiculous to me at first I mean lose weight by DRINKING TEA This idea had just about as much credibility to me as some of those sauna belts which can help you lose weight for a full 24 hours after which time it comes back again Well last year I was getting pretty desperate I had somehow managed to lose 40 pounds by drinking only regular tea instant coffee and home made lemonade and eating only Bird s Eye Vegetables and turkey In fact I have invented the Turkey Diet It s very simple Eat Turkey Fall Asleep from the tryptophan and if you fall asleep you can t eat you see A variation I guess on the Hollywood Diet which can be used only on weekends because most people need to stay awake during the week to go to work Anyway this diet worked for me but it was pretty boring took most of my free time away and turkey is expernsive I gradually stopped this diet and gradually got back 20 of those 40 pounds I looked desperately for another way to lose weight but drinking tea to do it just didn t logical However no other method presented itself that was as inexpensive as drinking tea and after all that expensive but delicious turkey it seemd a good way to go Now this particular tea itself IS quite expensive 43 for 4 ounces on sale ouch but the 4 ounces of lose tea would make at least 60 6 ounce cups 360 ounces and I d of course be adding my own water and sweetener so I figured why not Well because of the possible bad taste that s why not I ve tried herbal teas in the past and with the delicious exception of Jasmine Tea thoroughly disliked each one But even so I decided to risk it I ve tasted far worse things than herbal tea after all So about a year ago I sent away for it When the Wu Long tea arrived in a lovely little transparent green plastic bag lined with aluminum foil giving the impression of a crushed green diamond I made it and drank it Hmmm or rather Mmmm Not bad tasting at all It tasted like the best black tea the kind other than Jasmine that I like the best But as the tea was SO expensive I decided not to drink it too often As the owner of a healthy refrigerator one LOADED with vitamins which I take only in emergencies because I can t afford to keep buying them I now had this healthy tea which I put in the refrigerator to keep it fresh to sort of keep the vitamins company I did throughly read the literature that came with the tea however and noticed that many people had praised the MEDICINAL qualities of this tea along with it s weight loss abilities Hmmm I decided that I had happily gotten more than I bargained for a weight loss tea AND one which helpoed with other health problems Nice to get such a bargain but at 43 for 4 ounces of lose tea it was still quite expensive And so after that first cup I restrained myself from drinking it for quite some time Actually I didn t drink another cup until about two weeks ago I was beginning to feel as if the minor cut I had gotten the week before had somehow let an infection in though the cut itself didn t look infected Anyway I was beginning to feel very Very VERY w e a k Two years ago in fact I was hospitalized with an infection the very same infection that killed my mother the month before My mother in the hospital had said that she felt like a vegetable and having gotten the same infection I knew how accurate that description really was I was SO weak then in fact I had had trouble raising my arms above my head And now I felt it was starting to happen again My first thought was to call 911 But my second thought was strangely concentrated on those glowing testimonials I had read from other customers who had used Wu Long tea I figured I d try to make myself a cup if the tea didn t work I could always call 911 After all though I felt very weak I didn t feel totally paralzyed yet anyway But I knew I had to make and drink that tea fast before total weakness engulfed me Did I feel up to doing so Yes I F took my time I F I was very careful and I F I stayed very near the telephone as I made the tea just in case I managed to make myself the cup of tea to wait for it to cool down a bit and to drink it Within an hour the feeling of weakness had left me And as of this writing taking place a full two weeks later the weakness and presumably the infection have not come back OH IF ONLY I HAD HAD THE COURAGE TO BUY THIS TEA T W O YEARS AGO AND GIVE IT TO MY WONDERFUL MOTHER Now I m not saying this tea will work miracles for everyone and in every circumstance The tea did NOT transform my looks to those of Princess Grace whom I consider the most beautiful woman of all time and have NOT cured me of a very slight case of Myasthenia Gravis a neuro muscular ailment which I have had since the age of four I DOUBT very much that it has made me immortal and I know for a fact that it has NOT granted me super powers or the ability to fly or to transcend time No one has ever accused me of not having a good imagination HOWEVER UPON DRINKING THAT TEA MY FEELINGS OF INFECTION a feeling of weakness quite different from that of Myasthenia Gravis DID GO AWAY I don t remember what the other testimonals for this tea were but I m sure now that at least 98 of them are true Perhaps there is no real fountain of youth But this tea which seems to cure many ailments and most probably helps one lose weight as well if taken often enough seems a very close second Ponce de Leon would have been happy with it I m sure I don t know if it will help everyone but I do know it helped me and probably the other people who gave testimonials too And that second cup of tea even the whole 4 ounces of lose tea are certainly less expensive than going to the hospital For those on a budget like me Wu Long tea is it seems destined to be used as a luxury and or in an emergency But I really feel it belongs in every home just like aspirin does And for emergency use PLEASE take the same precautions I did 1 Be sure you do have the energy to actually make and drink the tea and 2 Be near a telephone so you can call 911 in case the tea doesn t work for you The tea did work for me in the above circumstance anyway An elixir of life Perhaps and perhaps not depending on the person and the circumstances All I know is that for me and under the circumstances described above it certainly seems to have saved mine 
Lifesaver For people with who need to eat something between meals to keep their blood sugar levels up these Peanut Butter Balls are a godsend Many s the time I ve felt the familiar lightheadness and oncoming headache from low blood sugar and been saved by these things I always carry one in my pocket or purse and keep one in the glove compartment 
Excellent This snack is superb in several ways First it is very good tasting The flavor is very much like a soft peanut butter cookie Nutritionally it has quite a bit of protein very very low in simple carbohydrates or sugars and is high in fiber I carry these with me to work and eat one in the morning and one in the afternoon to help me keep away from junk foods and excessive caffeine These would be excellent to carry with you on a hiking trip 
Peanut Butter Balls Faster than expected shipping Great Tasting Product and Good for you too 
You may not be able to stop eating this Wow this beef jerky is so good it should come with a label Warning Highly Addictive Hands down the best beef jerky we ve ever eaten Moist yet chewy very satisfying Not too salty Lots of flavor Think maybe I ll go eat some now 
Too tough Hey it s jerky Although I was a little put off by a prior review that indicated this product was nearly inedible we had purchased this salmon jerky at Trader Joe s in smaller packets and really liked it so we decided to purchase here at Amazon much less expensively Yes this product is very dry but it also has none of the preservatives included in some of the more moist jerky products out there My family liked it and we are placing a second order That other reviewer should send her inedible seven extra packages our way 
Good healthy snack Serves well as an in between meals snack Got a good deal on Amazon 
Great price easy breakfast on the go Even though I know it s important to eat breakfast I seldom do it I d rather sleep a little longer These breakfast bars are a nice easy way to solve the problem I keep a box in the car and munch on them on the way to work in the morning they re whole grain nice and filling and taste good to boot They re also a nice treat on the way home The Oats and Honey are my favorite but the variety pack provides a nice change All of the flavors are tasty peanut butter cinnamon maple sugar all yummy 
Excellent green decaf tea Excellent green decaf tea at a great price We love this tea It has a strong delightful green tea taste and its decaf too By comparison many other green teas are too dry tasting for me And I like the convenience of the 40 tea bag size boxes as we drink a lot of this tea Its great hot and good iced too 
Tastes as good as any other albacore tuna but with less calories Add Mayonaise to anything and I love it That is espcially true of this white albacore tuna Being packed in water lowers the calories and it s fat free but it needs something to moisten it like mayo It s delicious and totally clear of any dark tuna meat if you abhor even the slightest amount of dark tuna meat in your salad The tuna are supposedly wild caught in dolphin safe nets so are therefore hopefully lower in Mercury content Plus there is nothing added to the product so it s truly all natural I happen to like dark as well as white tuna but if you only like the white like so many of my family and friends then this is the brand to buy 
Strawberry Sensation I love eating a lot of cereal in the morning Like anybody I really don t choose a cereal that is just good for you I really choose it for taste I loved Special K before when it was plain flakes but I absolutely love it even more with the addition of red strawberries This cereal tastes even better with each morsel and bite with the addition of strawberries I like how delightful the strawberries taste after I add the milk into the cereal This is a great buy for anybody who loves Special K cereal or for anyone who just hasn t considered that special challenge Price B+ Taste A Overal B 
A Matter Of Preference I like sardines much to my wife s dismay I can eat them right out of the can However skinless and boneless they have to be and that is becoming an expensive variety How nice it was then to find that Amazon is selling the Reese brand at very attractive prices I ve tried both the 3 75 and 4 375 oz cans in olive oil of course purchase 30 or 40 cans at a time and have been quite well pleased I prefer the larger can In my experience the 4 375 is packed with smaller sardines that tend to have a more delicate taste At least that was my opinion respecting those that are netted and packed in Morocco as most sardines that I have been buying are That brings me to the single problem I encountered in a recent purchase of the 4 375 oz Reese product While the web page for it called it out as a product of Morocco what arrived was a product of Portugal The box graphics as shown on the website was different too and the sardines were larger and firmer than those of Morocco Although still tasteful and a great value too I prefer the Moroccan variety It s that more delicate taste that I seek For most and for me as well the product source is certainly a minor point but I did call the issue to Amazon s attention Amazon is great when it comes to feedback and actually seeks it but I do not know how my comments were ultimately dealt with The website still shows the product as Moroccan and package graphics different than the packaging that I received Of course the website includes info and pictures that Reese provides Reese probably shipped the Portuguese variety without advising Amazon of the change It could be that I will not know what is actually being shipped until I make my next purchase 
Easy economical For a working mom these are the best Quick easy heck my four year old can make them Price wise I m a cheapskate and only bought these when they were on sale for 1 a bag Amazon offers them for less The garlic cheddar biscuits BTW are the closest things I ve found to the Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuits and SO EASY 
Like this product alot I did receive the Splenda flavor packs and enjoy them alot 
AT LAST Flavored coffee creamers have been a guilty pleasure of mine for a long time now but even if you buy the sugar free kind you re ingesting a whopping 1 gram of fat per tablespoon of creamer As if that weren t bad enough it s partially HYDROGENATED Splenda Flavor Blends is a wonderful alternative if you re like me and just can t face black coffee Please note that this is not a creamer It sweetens flavors coffee If you find you just have to have creamer to tame down your coffee you can add a Splenda Flavor blend and a splash of skim milk or if you like things more creamy buy some powdered non fat milk and add that along with the Splenda Flavor blends Lots of times I find products with Splenda already in them to be too sweet but I didn t think that was the case with this All three of the available flavors hazelnut mocha vanilla taste great without being overpowering Finally now I can kick that fatty creamer bad habit 
FINALLY Finally a flavored sugar Splenda is awesome does not create sugar imbalance in your body which is the 1 weight gainer The mocha is absolutely the best of the three offered and I am a French Vanilla fan usually The French Vanilla is a close second and the Hazelnut is a distant third One packet of flavored and one plain packet is perfect for one travel sz mug 14oz No need to use two flavored packets as one packs a pretty good punch which is good since they are a little pricey The only con is that they are difficult to open since there is no small start tear on the top You have to open it with your teeth and they are the tall plastic packets Vs regular sugar size paper ones A stupid con I know but nothing can be perfect can it 
Splend Coffee Flavor Blends Tastes great Less Calories Amazon s pricing is cheaper than my local grocery store so I stocked up 
Love this stuff best of the brands I ve tried Of the several brands of agave nectar that I have tried this one is by far the best It has the least taste to it it is just sweet very similar to simple syrup that you would make with sugar and water 
Great alertnative to sugar I ve been using Agave in my tea coffee cooking and on pancakes for over a year I m a type 2 diabetic and need something with a low glycemic index This product is the best and it tastes wonderful My kids don t miss honey on their pancakes any more and this keeps everyone from having sugar highs and crashes Highly recommend 
Good Natural Sugar Replacement Works great in coffee and tea and can be used in baking as well 
A MOUTH FUL OF CRUNCHY GOODNESS THERE IS ONE OTHER CEREAL ON THE MARKET THAT IS VERY SIMILAR IN CRUNCHY TASTEFUL CEREAL I HAD BOTH IN MY PANTRY AND TRIED EACH INDEPENDENTLY AND THEN TOGETHER THIS THE ONE CEREAL THAT IS GOOD ON ANY OUTING FOR BREAKFAST WITH MILK CAN OF CREAM OR JUST PLAIN WATER ON A CAMPING OUTING OUTFIT YOUR BACKPACK WITH HEALTHY GOODIES NO SPOILAGE EITHER I WAS HIKING FOR FOUR DAYS WITH KASHI DRIED FRUIT SEVERAL CANS OF JUICES IT IS JUST THE BEST APPROACH FOR HIKING WITH THE MINNIMUM LAGER ON BOARD 
great bar always soft and semi sweet real apples tastes kinda like a muffin without any air in i 
Best I ve found I tried Pure Bars after seeing them reviewed on a health website The site waxed poetic about the flavor as well as the extremely high quality ingredients but I figured right these bars all end up tasting like dates no matter what flavor they are Well I stand corrected the flavor on these bars is excellent and is by far the best I ve tasted and I ve tasted quite a few That s a real bonus considering the fact that the ingredients are completely raw and organic and the whole bar is relatively low on the glycemic index To those unfamiliar with raw food bars take note if you re expecting any of them to taste like granola bars or candy bars you ll be disappointed Think fruit sweet instead and your expectations will be met I can also vouch for the fact that my 2 5 year old daughter loves them On to the chocolate next 
very good very good tea weak but nice aroma mild good flavor excellect for the price 
Best ever Oolong tea First tried this tea from a specialty store in Buffalo NY where it sold for close to 60 lb Love it even though it was only 2 oz Search the net for this tea and found it Amazon It s a light delicate flavorful tea that can be brewed 2 to 3 times by refreshing it with more hot water It is non acidic like some other teas It need no addition of cream or sweetner I m currently drinking 5 to 6 cups per day as it is so delicious and light It s not exactly a green tea when brewed but a light amber color with the hint of a flora or fruity taste The added plus at Amazon is the price and very quick shipping I would strongly recommend getting this tea for any tea lover and I m sure they would be pleased if they enjoy a good quality chinese tea 
My favorite tea I got into various oolong teas from a great New York importer They really know their teas But this year the Numi Ti Kuan Yin is available at quality and price that bests the experienced importer I dunno maybe they got lucky at an auction or somthing But we ve been enjoying this tea You can spend 3 times as much and get better tea But then it s too expensive to drink every day Buy this 
Worlds Best Jerky I ordered both the Brown Sugar Jerky and the Peppered and both were absolutely fanstastic This jerky has a slightly tender consistency which makes it easy to chew The flavor is sublime not too salty just the right amount of sweetness a real taste treat I am on my second 2lb order I am totally hooked 
Incredible Jerky This is truly great jerky and a fantastic price Don t let the price fool you this is first class jerky I order for the whole office and every person raves My last order was for 36 bags of World Kitchens some of all 5 flavors 
Excellent Product A great product at a very good price We are repeat customers so that says it all 
Beef Jerky This is one of the best beef jerkys I have purchased moist tender with a great flavor I have tried the others that are like orginial dry and tough to chew leaves your jaws tired also a great price best I have found Will order agai 
Love them After all the great reviews we didn t think we could go wrong These are really good but not as satisfying as maybe a protein bar Then again didn t really expect them to be 
Excellent Take Along Snack for Those with Food Allergies My 2 1 2 year old is allergic to foods very common in traditional granola type bars wheat soy nuts We have tried various bars that were safe for her to eat and this has been by far her favorite I m happy that they re organic she loves the taste Great all around They are individually packaged which makes them great for when we are on the go 
Delicious These are very tasty Not too sweet like some bars but plenty sweet enough Nice fruity flavor my favorite of the three EnviroKidz bars Even if I didn t need to eat gluten free these would be a favorite snack 
Delicious What else do I need say for coffee for my favorite coffee maker The only thing else I need is some latt 
FLAVOR I love the flavor It s in a world of it s own It has great taste and textur 
You bought MEAT on Amazon The wife looked incredulous but I had the last laugh as I pasted a beefy juicy kiss of sugary goodness on her cheek last night just as she was dozing off to bed Seeing the drooly goo drip off onto the pillow made the night on the couch all worth while Thank you World Kitchens for two pounds of steer delight 
Greatest Jerky ever This jerky is not just an excellent value it is by far the best jerky we have eaten I buy it every year as Christmas gifts and ofcourse save one pkg for us and everyone raves about it My family always looks forward to Christmas because they know jerky will be there for the holidays You can t beat the price and the jerky is actual strips of lean beef that is flavorful The brown sugar has just a hint of heat with the sweetness I would highly recommend this product Value and quality can t be beat A+++ Thanks 
Almost too good This is quality jerky probably the best I have found so far 
Great Jerky Man Awesome Jerky Some pieces are tender some are tough Had to knock off a star for the gas I can clear a stadium after eating a few pieces of this stuff 
Newman O s Fantastic My husband and I like the Newman O s better than Oreo s and our 3 year old son loves them As we did as a child he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling just like an oreo Also the Newman O s do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have 
Dip them in chocolate and wow your friends These cookies are superb all by themselves Far superior to that other sandwich cookie in every way But if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence melt some Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Chips in your double boiler and dip these cookies then remove to a rack to dry Your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store and beg you for more Keep out of reach of children 
Great cookies at a great price Everyone in my family from 3 to 64 years old loves these organic cookies I purchased these cookies at several local stores before I discovered that Amazon had them I sent a package to my grandson who is in the Army in Iraq and he raved about them Newman s has another big winner 
Try the Ginger O s I do not like store bought cookies especially Oreos too dry and greasy for me But upon the recommendation of several people I tried the Ginger O s and was pleasantly surprised They have excellent flavor and the cream does not have that greasiness to it If you like ginger cookies don t hesitate to try these 
So Much Better than those O s My children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream These are a bit softer than the O s we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat = We purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too YUMMY 
Original is great Wheat dairy free is a bit tough I love the Original Vanilla Creme Newman s O s so when I saw the Wheat Free Dairy Free on sale one day I picked one up I figured it would basically be the same as the Original The chocolate and vanilla tastes are great but I found the cookies themselves to be rock hard So unless you have an issue with wheat or dairy products I would recommend the Original Vanilla Creme and not the Wheat Free Dairy Free variety 
Del Monte Starkist Tuna Creations Fresh tuna Great price I would recommend this product 
I love this coffee My order arrived before I could blink I am buying my coffee here from now on 
Best coffee ever The variety blend coffee pods are simply the best coffee I ve had in a long time I drink up to three cups of coffee a day but the one I look forward to the most is the cup I make in the morning on my Senseo machine The origins pods are the best of the best These pods have a rich full bodied flavor that surpasses the other medium and dark roast pods that are available Get the variety pack and try them all They are all wonderful 
Great crackers We first bought these crackers in a local store and loved them Nutritionwise they are really good and have a great flavor and are oh so crunchy Never attempt a conversation while partaking you ll never hear the other person After our first purchase we bought directly from Dr Kracker Then they told us of the great deal we d get buying them thru Amazon And that s what we ve been doing ever since Aways good for an in between meals snack with butter or peanut butter Then we ll have something more substantial on them for our lunch from time to time 
Best Tasting Nutrional Cracker I ve Ever Tasted I saw this bread in my local health food store and it looked so good I decided to try it I must say it taste just as good as it looks This is by far the besting tasting cracker I ve ever tasted Made completely from certified organic ingrediants this product is an excellent choice for the health conscious And the price here at Amazon is a great buy in comparison to any local retailer I m looking forward to this replacing the breads I usually use 
a great snack i tried this about two months ago and really loved it i love the crunch and natural sweetness i also made corn chowder with their corn product i recommend this for any one who loves healthy natural snacks 
Great snack This is a very tasty nutritious snack No fat sweet crunchy a great alternative to running out to the vending machine at work 
Yummy I really enjoy these as a light snack They are only 85 calories a bag so it is easy to fit it in your diet 
Excellent Product Strong Disagreement with 1 star Rating The title pretty much says it all I reserve 5 stars for what I consider the best of the best I wanted a gluten free cereal that was different from the few I ve been eating over the years This is definitely NOT like the usual crispy rice It s much more substantial not 90 air has a nice though not too strong cocoa flavor and doesn t get soggy in the first two minutes after milk or other drink product is poured on it Another rater talked about empty calories I ll be generous and assume that reviewer is not particularly familiar with reading and comparing nutrition labels If a high quality rice is also considered empty calories that review would be valid But comparing the Koala Crisp nutrition label to the nutrition label on a high quality rice reveals almost identical nutritional values perhaps because Koala Crisp IS a high quality rice Just as rice has never been claimed to be a fully balanced meal neither is Koala Crisp What it is is a high quality product made with high quality ingredients none of the artificial vitamins and minerals added to grocery store cereals to make them look better And it s designed to be used as part of a balanced diet With that out of the way It s just plain good I buy it by the case and eat it several times per week for breakfast I like it that much And no I have no connection with the company at all I just love their products many of them not just this one Now if they d just add this one to their line of Eco pak cereals large bulk bags I d be even happier 
Smooth When I searched the net for pods there were lots of warnings that the senseo brand wasn t so good Granted I am not an avid coffee drinker however I really look forward to a good morning cup of coffee that won t burn a hole in my stomach I usually run one senseo pod through twice and have a perfect cup If anything needs a little more of the flavor i e hazlenut vanilla added to it But still very good 
Senseo Pods are packed with flavor These pods are excellent Same taste as your favorite coffee shop at a fraction of the price 
Great Value This is great granola and at such a great price I usually make my own but for this price it s not worth the effort Thanks for the great value 
Kind of Nutty Good quality granola not too sweet would give it 5 stars but it doesn t have enough nuts Super Nutty it is not It is worth the price though My wife would give it 4 5 stars She is mildly gluten intolerant and can eat this because it contains no wheat 
very good the munch ems were certainly a good buy they taste great and easy to pack best of all they are good for you too 
SunStrike These were very good cookies I loved the texture and flavor a nice surprise from a packaged cookie I would buy again 
Bentley s Teas Woodgrain Tea Chest I had purchased a few of the tea chests as Christmas gifts for my neighbors I thought it was so beautifully made that I purchased another for myself The wood chest is really pretty and the tea variety inside is great I put it out every time I entertain 
Tea Box Very nice wooden tea box Will make a nice present I have not tried the teas though 
The best crackers I have ever eaten Dr Krackers are fantastic They are different from any other cracker I have tried They are very crispy which is what I love about them They are delicious plain or with cheese and dips Because of their crispiness they hold up great for dips I cannot say enough about these crackers They come in several flavors while classic 3 seed is my favorite they are all very good 
Great Snack Best snack I ve found in years I keep these in my desk at work for a mid afternoon appetite curb Highly recommended by all my family and friends 
amazing I am addicted to these They are delicious not dry at all and there are lots of crackers in each container Yum 
Delicious Cup of Coffee This coffe is so delicious It is bold and smooth There s no bitter taste even when brewed strong If you re looking for a great coffee with a smooth flavor and nothing bitter you won t be dissappointed with Timithy s Colombian La Vereda 
awesome coffee I use K cups all the time at work at home etc There are a handful of good k cup brands out there This is one of the best Both decaf and regular Timothy s Columbian are smooth and rich in flavor Add some creamer and sweetener and goodbye to any other coffee You won t be disappointed Believe it or not the home brewing K cup machine Keurig gives a better cup of coffee versus the commercial K cup machine also Keurig because the hot water does not blast too quickly through it FYI 
Illy Espresso has smooth taste We love the taste of Illy coffees when brewed in our espresso machine smooth never bitter And the vacuum packed canister has a unique reusable design 
Delic I have tried EVERYTHING for our francis francis espresso machine and had an extremely difficult time to make it taste wonderful I found this espresso and the first time I tried it I was absolutely HOOKED Try it you ll love it 
Top notch espresso at great price Illy rules My favorite espresso roast Great price Excellent 
Superb Overall Coffee I really feel like this is the best overall coffee that I have tasted As the name suggests it is intended for espresso but it makes an excellent cup of regular coffee I love this roast for my lattes because it is so easy smooth yet full flavored If you are in the midst of a decision for what bean to purchase make this your choice You shall not be disappointed 
best smooked oysters The South Korean oysters are the only ones I will eat nice size tender flavorful Avoid any from China 
delicious and convenient I ve always loved smoked oysters but most brands come packed in cottonseed oil which is vile to say the least The Crown Prince oysters are packed in olive oil a huge step up in health and taste They are convenient little bundles of protein that can be packed in a lunch etc They taste wonderful added to soup or stew Great for last minute entertaining Last but not least I like to have a case on hand in my disaster supplies 
Much better than Ritz Bits So these are basically Ritz Bits but with three differences 1 The crackers are better they taste more buttery and flavorful 2 The cheese is better it actually tastes like something that s met cheese in passing and maybe even shaken its hand 3 They re all organic n stuff so make you feel ever so slightly virtuous and less like a slave to Big Food If you re packing lunches for kids or snacks for yourself these are great 
Great for bread and noodles Some people can tolerate spelt but not wheat and if you are one of those spelt flour makes a great bread It substitutes well but be aware that spelt requires less kneading it has a shorter gluten fiber and breaks down if kneaded too long We knead bread about three minutes Spelt also makes lovely noodles and is fine in cakes It seems easier to digest It does have gluten and is a relative of wheat so if you are gluten sensitive this is probably not an alternative 
Cinna Raisin Crunch Great We love Cinna Raisin Crunch for breakfast The clusters are larger than average and hold up well in milk The cinnamon and raison flavor is right for me Given few minutes to digest and it keeps me comfortably sated for hours If you prefer small bites or smooth textures in your breakfast cereal the usual cluster size in this cereal might not be right for you 
Delicious Tasting Prunes These prunes are delicious to eat Since we started eating Newmans Organic Prunes the store bought ones do not compare We notice a difference and feel healthier for eating these Amazon is a place to shop in which we feel good buying organic products from them Thanks Amazon 
Tasty drier than other brands These 6 oz packs of organic California prunes have more flavor than the non organic brands They are also drier and firmer which I wasn t sure I liked at first I quickly grew used to it and now I prefer them this way They are sweet and chewy The freshness date is 16 months in the future so these would make a good addition to any emergency preparedness stock one might have You can t go wrong at this price for 12 bags This is one brand you can trust 
very good Very tasty coffee cake probably doesn t cost much more than to buy all the ingredients to make it and easier nice weekend treat Make sure there s lots of people around to eat it so you don t eat it all yourself 
Great buy crunchier than bread crumbs Read about Panko in several cookbooks This was definitely the best buy out there although I have enough to last me several years Would recommend this product 
Yum My family and I absolutly loved the SiNamon flavor of LesserEvil popcorn great flavor and the box was enough for a movie with the family Was it healthy Well it was better than movie theatre popcorn for sure but it is called Lesserevil not completely wholesome and good for you Good stuff overall and Amazon s price is great just make sure you like the flavor first because you hav e to buy a cas 
15 for cheddar fix These are not that cheddary I imagine that this is what the dried congealed waste water from making cheddar tastes like It s good enough 
It tastes good It s really taste good and let you feel good too It s a easy way to get calcium Only concern is the price is little expensive and can t affort to have it often 
MaCann s Quick Brown Bread Really great Irish Brown bread tastes just like the bread in Ireland Very easy to make I make it 3 times a week my husband is Irish 
Yummy This is my favorite side dish It is so versatile and so very easy to make It tastes great with any and every kind of sausage I ve ever tried I love to make it when I whip up a batch of hot wings 
Healthy morning meal I find it easy to use at breakfast when added to my muesli honey and yogurt mix Powerful healthy morning treat For the price you can t beat it as a health food 
Great for your heart I got a few packages of these used some for my daughter for the Omega 3 fatty acids as they help with brain function she is speech impaired and for my grandpa who has high blood pressure had a stroke You simply add a few spoonfuls to your oatmeal my grandpa s cholesterol went down 50 points in one month None of his medication had been able to do that My 5 y o daughter didn t notice this in her oatmeal I tried it and there is no added taste just health benefits Great product We always have it at our house 
Way better than the college cafeteria My wife and I have adjoining offices and we keep a variety of soups and snacks on hand so we can eat in together when we don t both have time to eat out This soup is one of our favorites We like the flavor and the texture creamy with nice chunks of potato lots of corn kernels pieces of carrot and bell pepper I keep a bottle of hot pepper on hand to spice it up but my wife prefers it as it is We microwave it in the envelope and then pour it into two mugs There s just the right amount in one evelope for the two of us when I have a sandwich to go with it Without the sandwich I find one envelope about right for me This isn t the healthiest of the Pacific Foods soups that we ve tried in terms of fat protein carbohydrate content The beef stew is better in that regard but we don t like the beef stew without considerable extra seasoning and it s very thin for a stew and we like the creaminess of this chowder We eat a balanced diet so that really isn t an issue This is very satisfying and it s the one office food item we order again and again 
deLISH This is awesome soup I was a little iffy about it about any soup coming from a can or bag but ordered it anyway it sounded so good My hubby toddler and I love it and could eat it every week if we had more money to buy it We took some on a camping trip and shared with all of our friends that we were with and everyone agreed how great it was Not as good as home made but really really good I m not sure about the taste buds of the reviewer that gave it 1 star but we all thought it was worth getting again 
pretty darn good These bars are filling which is what I look for in my snacks breakfast foods They re nice and sweet won t fall apart on you like granola bars yet don t require too much jaw pressure to take a bite it s the perfect consistancy A great way to get some portable protien if you don t want to carry around a bag of nuts seeds with you 
Convenient and delicious I have a Briel espresso maker and these pods have made using the machine more convenient than my stovetop pot I have used the expensive pods and these taste as good and have fabulous crema Enjoy 
Makes excellent espresso The espresso pod is easy to use easy to clean and makes very good espresso I am very happy with it and just ordered another box 
great coffee About to order my fourth box this year It makes a smooth brew ideal for my latt 
Great coffee no mess We use these pods for a youth group fundraiser at our church We consistently get comments on how great the coffee tastes I like how easy they are to use No mess no tamping I am able to make drink after drink quickly and easily 
great I use this cereal for not only cereal but also to make rice crispy treats Yum 
Yummy gluten free cereal It evens says snap crackle pop Not only is it delicious but it is very filling It satisfies my urge to crunch and eliminates my problem with gluten products I highly recommend this cereal 
simple delicious My favorite things are often the most simple A healthy alternative to Kellog s Rice Krispies with the benefits of organic ingredients rice syrup instead of cane sugar and an incredible company behind it all to boot and this tastes even better Also rice syrup won t give you the spike and crash of conventional sugar and in fact supplies a steady stream of energy 
YUMMY These are the best They remind me of rice crispy treats They re so chewy and delicious I recommend these to anyone who loves peanut butter products 
Absolutely Delicious If you love the taste of peanut butter then you will love the taste of these granola bars They are chewy and do not break into pieces while eating them A healthy delicious and quick snack 
Delicious goodness I really like these as they are a lot less sweet than other brands 
Low in sugar average in flavor They went over well in our house THe sugar content is semi low and the peanut butter has good protein 
So So So good Delicious and very filling They can easily be used as a meal replacement 
Yum Corn Free I bought these because I have a corn allergy and wanted to substitute them for the LA Weightloss bars that list corn syrup as the first ingredient I was pleasantly surprised that they were pretty tasty My favorites are actually the Fudgie Filberts that taste similar to a Little Debbie brownie if Little Debbie s were diet Following that I would say Almond and Coconut are tied for second Third is the Peanut Butter which is the highest in protein but not as good as the others My husband didn t like any of them but could tolerate the one I liked least Peanut Butter Over all I think these are great as a healthy snack for people with food allergies or other dietary restrictions I think I would have picked a different name than Betty Lou s Nut Butter Balls Nut Butter Balls doesn t sound as appetizing as what they actually are Nut Butter Balls Mmmmmm 
The most convienent way to store and drink goats milk We have been using Meyenberg s powdered goat milk for several years We used to buy their milk in cartons at Walmart and it was good The only problem was that we live so far from a Walmart store that we would run out of goat s milk between trips We decided to try the powdered and found that it mixes and stays mixed very well and tastes exactly like the liquid milk in the cartons Of course it stores easily and indefinitely and we highly recommend it to anyone who wants or has to drink goats milk 
Great alternative to cow s milk for toddlers I started using goat milk when my daughter was 1 because she did not digest cow s milk that well This product is great has equal or more nutrition than cow s milk has a good flavor just slightly different than cow s milk is easy to digest and best of all the powder form is great if you are on the go I don t have to worry about it spoiling I just mix and give it to my daughter 
Is A ok fine I prefer this powdered milk to the condensed form that Meyerberg sells The condensed has a more sour flavor to it One has to realize that goat s milk is not cow s milk in that it is richer or creamier in flavor so it does startle one until your palate get s used to something which tastes different When it is warm it honestly tastes about as close to what a milk product should taste Cold it has a slight powdered milk processed flavor I actually made ice cream from this powdered milk and it turned out pretty good It is like ice milk as this is milk but it was different and enjoyable but quite sweet The recipe was 1 quart milk 8 scoops of powdered milk made warm and allowed to chill 1 cup white sugar 1 tsp vanilla flavoring you can try other flavorings like banana 1 8 tsp salt My electric freezer will freeze this in 20 minutes I like the powdered for it s ease and it keeps well I can make up a quart and it will keep 2 weeks so it is on hand and not wasting or forcing someone who has limited use to drink a gallon of milk Granted one is used to cow s milk but this is something one can get used to if they have allergies and I am glad it comes in a nice metal can with a plastic lid to reseal after you pop the top and a plastic measuring scoop to get it right One can will make 3 quarts of milk 
Meyenberg Powdered Goat Milk Good for Puppies I used Meyenberg Powdered Goat Milk with my first litter of pups five years ago and was very pleased with it so made sure to stock up before my second litter was born I supplement the mother s food with it and mix it with ground puppy food to make a puppy gruel to transition the pups to puppy food The pups and their mother seem to love it and have suffered no digestive problems at all It dissolves quickly in warm water and is convenient and easy to store I recommend it as a nutritional supplement for nursing mothers and pups both 
Excellent coffee for your money I use these beans in a Jura Capresso SuperAutomatic Everyone in our house likes the coffee because it has a refined taste Many coffees sold taste rather muddy so if you like a clear tasting coffee with delicate notes give this one a try Also has excellent crema 
Nice value for daily espresso The roast is more smooth and mellow than Starbucks I prefer it to Illy Produces ample crema It s a good value After trying the first bag I ordered several more The Lavazza has become my daily espresso bean at least until the 8 8 pounds runs out FWIW I grind with a Rancilio Rocky burr grinder and my espresso machine is a Rancilio Miss Silvia 
Full vs Medium Roast Espresso Beans Espresso beans can be roasted in different ways Lavazza and Illy represent the best of two different approaches to roasting beans for Italian espresso Illy roasts their beans for a longer time but at a lower temperature than Lavazza As a result of its higher roasting temperature the Lavazza is darker and according to some people more robust than Illy is At its best when properly ground tamped and brewed Lavazza espresso is a bit stronger tasting and also a little bit more bitter than Illy The Lavazza espresso also has a very pure black color once brewed and when it is done properly it has a hint of licorice in the aftertaste Personally though I prefer the Illy approach which is why I am giving this coffee four rather than five stars But even so I certainly recognize the high quality of Lavazza In my opinion Lavazza represents the very best of the widely available dark as opposed to medium like Illy Italian Espresso roasts 
Espresso fantastico This is a terrific espresso I got hooked on Lavazza in Italy and haven t found any other espresso blends to knock it off it s throne This is my first time purchasing Lavazza whole beans and I think I ll continue to buy the whole beans for the freshness factor Would highly recommend 
Fantastic awesome taste and texture Great taste very creamy espresso with a natural sweet aroma does not need any other cream or sugar to ruin such a rich taste The reason why your to the previous reviewer coffee tasted sour is because you failed to use a decent and suitable home espresso machine If you had used the right method and machine it would have been nearly impossible for you not to enjoy the great taste this coffee can offer These are very high quality espresso beans with a taste so full and rich that you would want to keep going back to it after tasting other coffees 
Works Fine I spend a lot of time in my van while out shooting wildlife photos I buy a case of bottled water and keep some of these individual packets of drink mix Open a bottle of water and put in a packet of this drink mix and you have an instant refreshing drink Very easy 
Out of the ordinary tidy well packaged soda for guests Lots of bang for your buck if you are a discerning hostess who enjoys offering guests a slightly off beat non alcoholic beverage Really like the packaging Like the taste too kind of like Mountain Dew with ginseng 
excellent I will never make home made gumbo again this is so easy and good 30 minutes and you have great gumbo 
Great Flavor awesome juice This is my favorite of essn s juices It is unique and has a beautiful color which you see when using it as a mixer in cocktails Also a HUGE hit with kids Can t beat 100 juice Worth every penny 
The Very Best I didn t know tuna could taste this good And low mercury relieves worry about eating too much fish I love shopping Amazon I experiment a lot and am never unhappy but this tuna is really wonderful 
Great Tuna This was the first time I have bought this and am very pleased with it When you open the can the tuna is in one solid piece and not all sloppy like other brands It tastes pretty good too Will buy again 
Great tuna taste I thought tuna in olive oil tasted good but this is better This is the tuna for salad nicoise maybe use the other for mixing tuna salad 
Makes Great Pudding Am always looking for new ways to get whole grains into our diet The pudding recipe on the back of the package is very good Even DH with incredible sweet tooth liked it 
lemonade sugar free This is the same Crystal Light lemonade that comes in the round containers but with the Quanity buy much cheaper Great taste 
Absolutely wonderful comfort food I discovered this in our local QFC grocery store which is the only place I ve ever seen it and Amazon s price is much better as I paid 8 for one package Growing up my mom used to make us bowls of pastina as comfort food I call this whole wheat orzo my adult pastina Cooks up really quickly and is versatile in recipes and tastes wonderful I highly recommend it 
Good buy I d been looking for whole wheat orzo for awhile and it s almost impossible to find in any grocery stores This is a very great pasta at a reasonable price I ve been very pleased with this pasta 
Great alternative to white pasta This is a very good source of fiber with good taste and texture that even picky eaters enjoy 
Great Breakfast Cereal While I like all of the Kashi products I ve tried this one has to be my favorite With a little fresh fruit how much more healthy can you get Great taste with seven grains and sesame Perhaps the other reviewer threw away the cereal and ate the box 
Good pods slightly large The pods are great They taste great and brew great coffee although in my two different pod machines they brew coffee that tastes very different The one thing to be aware of is that the pods are slightly thicker than many other brands and they may not fit right in some machines The problem only occured with the double pod configuration for a bigger cup of coffee 
One Wonderful Cup This coffee rivals the name brand coffee house and right in my own kitchen I am the only coffee drinker in my home so I make one or two cups each morning and the no muss no fuss delivery of this system is unbeatable If guests want a cup of coffee I am not brewing a pot just a cup as needed 
Pretty Good Great flavor light and fluffy and good texture Only down side is that the bread tends to dissolve with to much moisture and has a tendency to be a little dry but great for sandwiches Unlike other gluten free breads that tend to be so heavy that they over power anything you put in the middle 
Very nice cup of coffee I ordered this for the mocha flavor but really cannot say that I found it I will say however that this does make a very nice smooth cup of coffee so much so that although I ordered this for after dinner coffee I have been making it for breakfast 
Mocha Java k cups Mocha Java is one of the smoothest cups you will ever have with a full bodied taste It is so mellow it is almost buttery I love it 
one of the best Mocha Java is almost as good as going to Starbucks for a cup of coffee I recommend it to anyone who likes the Mocha flavor of coffee 
Timothy s coffee We have a new Keurig coffee maker and just love Timothy s coffees any flavor but especially the German Chocolate Great price too 
quick energy on the run my family all enjoys this product the taste is good very little aftertaste the product is healthy and excellent for a quick snack 
try try again I ordered a case of sardines through Amazon Grocery last month and they didn t travel well the box arrived soaked in oil 4 cans had popped open and seeped fishy oil all over the rest of my order Upon inspection I could see that the design of the seals on the cans and the way that they were packed in their box made it a simple matter to pop the seals and any bump in transit could do it Sardines are not returnable items Imagine the mess of shipping them back Amazon handled my complaint in excellent fashion regardless So I thought that I had better try it again I ordered a totally different kind same brand These sardines are not quite as tasty as the others but they are quite acceptable My cats like them and most essential they arrived in perfect condition That being said if you don t have Amazon Prime shipping you might consider getting it It pays for itself quite quickly and it is SO darned convenient I live in the country and I work at home It s a pain to go to town to shop for groceries books music whatever Amazon provides so many products I need Amazon Prime gets them to me quickly and usually painlessly those leaky sardines were my only problem among dozens of shipments Amazon does a tremendous job I m one happy customer 
These Sardines are delicious I have been buying this brand of boneless and skinless sardines for years and still love to just open a can and eat them for a snack I know that being boneless and skinless lowers the calcium level but I ve never liked the crunch or taste of eating a whole sardine right from the sea And they are packed in olive oil which is loaded with Omega 3 s too so it s as good for you as are the sardines However I am not so sure about their actual mercury levels Buying them from Amazon with their 10 off sale on 49 purchases is a great price I ve even found that many of the local grocery stores as well as Costco and BJ s NO longer carry this product Or their price has skyrocketed It s great to be able to stock pile them from Amazon If you like sardines you ll love these And they are just so nutritious for us all 
Best cereal EVER The title pretty much sums it up Not too sweet and just absolutely delicious Every time I have a different cereal I wish I was eating this instead I don t even know why I bother with the other kinds now that I ve found this stuff and it s good for you too Can life get any better I submit that it cannot 
Best Blueberry Cereal This is the best blueberry cereal I ve tried Not sickeningly sweet excellent flavor and texture stays crunchy even mixed with yogurt 
Wonderful This is a great Crystal Light product I like that you get Vitamin C from it It is a great way to get extra vitamin c with out popping a pill or taking in extra calories Tastes good too 
coffee The coffee was very good I just wish they had more items to select in the variety pack I m still looking for that one flavor that says this is it I had a superb coffee in a local restaraunt and I ve been trying to duplicate that taste for a couple of years now 
Great coffee Great generocity Great cause We have served this coffee at our Sunday morning church services for 8 years it is wonderful to know that we are not lining the pockets of some mega corporation when we buy from Pura Vida but helping children and families I heard one visitor who moved out of state and had not been in services for over 3 years say I knew I would get a great cup of coffee this morning we love this coffee 
Don t let the organic healthy image scare you Though resembling nothing like the common graham crackers found in most grocer s cookie aisle these small squares are quite delectable and relatively guilt free 
The Cinnamon Grahams are great I have ordered these twice now they taste so good I also tried the chocolate wheat free ones they were awful I would not order them again but have been waiting several weeks for the grahams to be stocked 
Great CHOCOLATE cookies Newman s Own Organics Alphabet cookies are very chocolatey and very crunchy The first time I tried them I was hooked My two children also think they are fantastic If you are have not tried organic cookies before these cookies are a good starting point 
Coffee review This coffee has a rich bold flavor dark color and nice aroma Very enjoyable drinking Comparable with Starbucks bold coffees 
My Favorite Cereal I love this cereal I eat it every morning with maple syrup or honey raisins and walnuts It is never pasty for me as it is for the other reviewer unless I let it cook way too long or let it sit to cool too long I cook it for five minutes turn off the heat and let it thicken a couple of minutes more as I add my raisins and walnuts and maple syrup Then I stir in rice milk until I get it to the consistency I like Though I don t like rice milk by itself or on any other cereal it does taste really good on this rice cereal with the added benefit of making the whole thing easier to digest Rice cereal is the easiest cereal to digest anyway but adding rice milk instead of cow s milk makes it even more easier 
Amazing Forget the white tea at Starbucks Clipper is the real deal Quick to make requires just 30 seconds to steep I do it with non dairy creamer and a couple of tsp of sugar but this is pretty sweet by itself But bmake sure you get the six boxes advertised here or get them for pretty much the same price at Whole Foods 
best ever I bought one box of this and my entire family tried it It has since become a staple in each of our three homes Great taste with or without sugar 
Excellent but Pros Very tasty Natural no preservatives Cons Difficult to che 
The Best Gluten Free Cookie I love these The only thing good about being on a gluten free diet is discovering these cookies I m hooked I love the coffee flavor mixed with chocolate And for a dessert all the ingredients are pretty good 
Tasty These are quite good tasting Even though you have to buy several boxes rather than just one at a time the individual boxes are manageable enough for use over a period of time It would be nice as with most things if they were a bit less expensive and also didn t have to be bought in bulk but overall they re very good especially compared to some other organic offerings 
My fave of wheat free cookies Summary Peanut butter plain A bit rubbery I cooked them a little longer in microwave and added chips ^ Peanut butter choc chip Crispy crunchy crumbly rich and VERY addictive Yes they always arrive broken up somewhat but you won t care Like other chip one only 5 oz box Swirl shortbread Too heavy and buttery for me Nice texture Choc Chip shortbread If you like shortbread this will taste decadent Rich choc chips Crispy and yes also addictive Note only 5 oz instead of 7 oz box Butter shortbread Couldn t really eat these Too heavy and buttery Least favorite Haven t tried others yet I have a wheat allergy and never tasted shortbread again until I found these wonderful delights at the store in the health food section The shortbread choc chip I tried first has not only the unique taste of shortbread but has chocolate chunks also They are crunchy and light In comparison they weigh less than some other Pamela products They are not as buttery as the Butter Shortbread or Swirl a good thing in my opinion I love the pecans also Recommend to any wheat allergy sufferer or gluten intolerant person ^ 
Good nutrition pretty good taste I tried Betty Lou s Spirulina Ginseng Balls because I read the nutrition information and you get 40 of your daily requirement for vitamin A in one serving At this point in my quest to eat healthier I ve read lots and lots of nutrition labels finding this much vitamin A in a snack is rare Finding something deep green in color that actually tastes pretty good is rare If you re looking for a yummy sugery snack this is not for you If you are looking for a healthier snack to replace grabbing for that cookie this snack is worth checking out 
LOVE THESE I can t believe how great these are I bought these about 9 months ago and they were going to expire so I decided to try one I feel amazing I had lots of extra energy without the side effects of caffeine It tasted pretty good 
Why buy granolia bars These are a great substitute for granolia bars and much better for you They are not based on grains but on greens instead Taste is a tad bit green but if you eat whole foods at all then you ll love these Plus they give a good energy boost throughout the day 
Not much for taste but effect is very good I tried this item just because it s a a ginseng snack I found it to be not particularly tasty but the overall effect of increased stamina is true I m not sure about spirulina in general but one ball per day does the trick for me when it comes to increased stamina lasting several days 
Filters In I definitely love a cup of freshly brewed coffee Now that so many choose to have coffee numerous different ways there are just those who need the right filters Melita knows that with their coffee filters They are convient and stronger in hold than any other filters on the market They work great with 2 coffeemakers and especially are convient for those who ve purchased the individual ground coffeemaker Melita s Perfect Brew and Perfect Start coffee filter cups where all you have to do is just boil water and pour and you will get a convient cup of coffee I really recommend Melita a whole lot they are worth the price Price B+ Strength A Overall B 
Great after school snack Some days after the kids leave the classroom I find myself reaching for the nearest available chocolate Not any more This is a great healthy snack that satisfies the cravings and keeps me going for a few more hours And there are no hidden ingredients that set off my food allergies which I really appreciate They are maintaining their freshness well I bought them for the price but am now going to try the other items in Betty Lou s kitchen 
Yummy Gummy I have these and the worms I LOVE them because they are soft I highly recommend them 
Great Crackers I would buy this product from amazon anytime It has always been grea 
Yum Dr Kracker s are these are irresistible I originally found these Flatbread crackers while traveling After returning home I longed for them so Amazon came to the rescue with a source of these great flatbreads 
OUTSTANDING This Kracker is just the absolute best Eating it alone when you need something crunchy or with Healthy Choice Peanut Butter or low fat cream cheese it just is an awesome product and I buy it in bulk cause I never want to be without it I d love to see a variety pack kind of a sampling of all the Dr Kracker goodies available 
Very good cracker I bought these crackers because I love cheese and seeds nuts and am a low carb dieter They are very good and I would have given them 5 stars except I actually liked the crackers without the cheese better These are great for an occasional cruncy crispy treat and I would purchase them again They have a less sweet taste than the regular crackers and the cheese flavor is mild not artificial or too salty I highly recommend them 
Not bad for decaf I bought this product because it was a cheaper alternative to the Senseo coffee pods I ve been buying I don t have much to compare with but overall this decaff tases fine 
The Best Pretzels Around no Contest I love Pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds these are The BEST The taste great are REALLY crunchy a key requirement for me and have just the right amount of salt The Newman s Rounds are just as good maybe even better And as an added bonus Paul Newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity an unbeatable combination in my book 
All Gone Everyone loved these pretzels Very flavorful not too salty I plan on buying more from Amazon best price I ve found on this brand 
Great Pretzels and I love pretzels These Pretzels are great I needed an alternative to wheat and found these spelt pretzels I had them prior to ordering them on Amazon so I knew to expect they d be awesome Several family and friends have tasted them and can t tell any difference to pretzels made with wheat However I like these spelt pretzels better than your average wheat pretzel I don t like too much salt and I found these pretzels average on the salt factor Like every other bag of pretzels the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me The only thing I don t like is that in the ingredients list they say made with Organic Spelt and also Spelt While they meet the standard to label their product organic they should use ALL Organic Spelt 
Protein and Fiber and Taste Really Good I was attracted to these because they have more fiber than most along with more protein I think they taste great 
great buy my daughters love this tasty PB natural snack typically in the stores around here one box is close to 5 but this bulk buy makes it about 2 70 a real bargain already one day they ve finished off one box 
Delicious I happen to love pecans and this product is loaded with them It s too bad the cans are so small 
Good Healthy Cereal I was really impressed by the taste of this cereal I was expecting the flavor to be like cardboard or something like this but instead it was really good It was sweet but not sugar sweet and crunchy I ll definitely buy this again If the price went down I d buy it more 
I love this cereal I love this cereal I like the slightly sweet wheaty taste and the fact that it holds its crunch in milk for a long time I also snack on it dry It stays with me for a long time keeping me from eating junk 
Absolutely WONDERFUL My FAV out of all Nature s Path cereals And trust me I KNOW Nature s Path cereals Calorie count = PERFECT Nutrition = PERFECT Everything is great about this 
Good for you and tastes good too We initially discovered this cereal at one of the big warehouse stores but they do not consistently stock it We enjoy the flavor the fact that it is made from organically grown grain and the health benefits of flax seed and high fiber At the time of purchase we found the Amazon price to be over a dollar cheaper per box than in our local grocery store We bought two cases 
Great discovery This is an excellent quality product nice clean filets packed in olive oil instead of who knows what I really like having little glass jars instead of a tin that can t be reclosed if you don t use all the filets at once My first food purchase from Amazon was an excellent start 
I love anchovies Ever since I returned from Spain I have been looking for some decent anchovies to eat as tapas These are just the right amount for a snack and the flavor is wonderful If you have never eaten anchovies except on a pizza you are missing a great treat I highly recommend these and even if you only eat them occasionally they will remain fresh in the glass jars 
Smooth Excellent taste Didn t expect much with the price being this low but it s now a family favorite Can t tell the difference between this and Jeremiah s Kona blend but they are both have smooth rich tastes It s one of our family favorites now 
Gotta Have it Natural Having moved from a state where this popcorn was always available we were aghast that no one carried it in our new area It appears that very few here like this wonderfully natural tasting lightly salted lower calorie popcorn but preferred those that heavily tasted of thick butter with lots of salt and coats the mouth with film This popcorn pops fully leaving no kernels unpopped and doesn t need any additives Ease of ordering and prompt shipment make this a wonderful way for those of us who just have to have it Thank you 
Veggie soup without lots of work Great flavored soup that you don t have to start from scratch Very healthy choice 
Excellent I am a firm believer in the health benefits of Hemp This product is the best I ve found The delivery was very prompt and efficient 
Nutiva Hempseeds Bulk If you like hempseeds like I do This is your best buy Amazon has the best price The seeds came fast fresh and are terrific To me they smell and taste even more fresh then the retail packages The 5 lb bag comes vacuum sealed I took 5 mason jars packed them in and put them in the freezer I have a big bag in the refrigerator I toss these seeds all over my salads 
Yogi Tea good for me I drink this stuff religiously It tastes great with very little bitterness coming through even when over steeped The Yogi quotes are fun too 
YUMMY I am a huge fan of tea I have been drinking this one for years I am astonished at the price such a great deal Anyway if you must buy tea in a box this is one to purchase I love the subtle flavors of this tea I always feel better after drinking a cup It s even better if you add a little fresh organic lemon juice 
Rejuvenating and healthy Other than the Republic of Tea The People s Green Tea I really like Yogi Tea Healing Formula Not only is it 80 organic but the refreshing subtle taste of lemon grass with powerful antioxidant ingredient like grapeseed extract protect cells from free radical damage and also promotes healthy circulation should make one incorporate tea drinking in one s daily life Other health benefits of green tea are for symptoms like headaches body aches and pains digestion depression immune enhancement detoxification as an energizer and to prolong life The only side effect is insomnia and I m suffering from it but I know my immune system is thanking me for 6 cups of green tea each day 
great flavors at yogi teas this is a nice smooth green tea actually I have tried many flavors of Yogi tea and they are all lovely bedtime tea really does put me gently off to sleep egyptian licorice has a nice little bite to it and the women s formulas help with hormonal issues I have not found a bad flavor 
Splenda is an excellent sugar substitute I just began baking with Splenda when we found out my dad has pre diabetes For Easter I prepared a sugarless ricotta tart with Splenda and it worked beautifully Everyone agreed that it didn t taste sugar free and my dad really enjoyed it 
My husband can t tell the difference I think Splenda is great but I grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is is to let a sugar addict try it My husband happens to be one and he cannot tell the difference between Splenda and sugar in his tea As with other artificial sweeteners you get an unpleasant after taste with the Splenda there is none You can use this to cook with too It s a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar 
Always hits the spot I love Splenda and I love getting it in a big bag As a good ole Oklahoma girl I live for my iced tea And my tea MUST be sweet but sugar isn t an option So SPLENDA to the rescue We use it in everything and are learning new ways to use it every day because my Daddy has developed diabetes The big bags are often out at our local grocery store so finding them at Amazon with our Amazon PRIME takes care of that problem 
Splenda I have found that Splenda is a great sugar subsitute for a diabetic to use It is great alone on food and also for cooking with Leaves no after taste like other sugar subsitutes do 
Good value great taste There is juvenile diabetes in our family and we have no other choice but to bake with Splenda After couple tries I found excellent Splenda recipes and even guests could not tell Splenda cookies from sugar ones If you still feel Splenda cookies are not the same add a teasp of molasses in choc chip or oatmeal raisin and they taste exactly the same 
Sweetness I m a diabetic so I can t have sugar In my opinion Splenda tastes alot better than sugar and has no carbs from it So if you re a new found diabetic and you think life is over cause everything food wise sucks just sub some Splenda in the recipe and you ll be good to go 
Tastes like real pasta The Glutino Penne Pasta actually tastes like the real thing I ve had a few bad experiences with rice pasta but this stuff is pretty good I don t notice a major difference when microwaving leftovers so this deserves 5 star 
taste just like regular pasta You can t tell this is rice nooles It tast just like regular pasta My celiac husband loves it and he doens t feel like his missng out 
These are awesome These are fresh and have just the right amount of licorice flavor They are much softer than most black licorice and are easy to chew This is the BEST licorice I have ever had bar none The bag is huge Haribo really knows how to make candy 
Cheap but superb pepper Tellicherry Pepper at this price is remarkable The product is excellent if a little difficult to pour from the large mouth into a small grinder Otherwise great 
Agave Experience Agave nectar makes an exellant sweetner for cooking as well as for teas Agave is better for your health than refined sugars and other manufactured sweeteners on the market today My only wish is that will soon be available in larger containers for bulk sales and use Thanks E 
Light Agave Sweetener This product is the best No aftertaste it s organic and has a low glycemic value I use it in beverages It s lighter than honey In this bottle it squirts out easily I seem to require a less amount than honey or raw sugar to gain the same sweetness This is for the light Easy storage and does not change consistency over time The regular might be heavier and could require even less for same sweetness 
Love it Since going on the candida diet I ve had to find sugar substitutes for most things and this agave has been a fantastic replacement We ve even used it instead of sugar in some baking and it s worked out great 
Deliciously better than honey or sugar I adore this light version of the Madhava agave because it is so versatile I use it in hot and cold drinks to sweeten without any sort of aftertaste It mixes easily into both It is the perfect compliment to tea or coffee especially yummy in a vanilla rooibos I also use it in place of sugar in various recipes especially any dressings I prefer it to honey because it does not crystallize and it has a very low gycemic index When you eat honey it is like injecting sugar straight into your bloodstream but agave while high in fructose is slowly released into the bloodstream so you don t have that after sugar crash Use the amber variety in place of maple syrup but use this light version for any other type of sweetening From one sweet tooth to another agave will satisfy I m off to make some tea 
Hemp Protein I like the Nutiva Hemp protein A great protein source that is easier to digest than whey and also provides half of the daily required amount of fiber Can t beat that It won t leave you feeling heavy and bloated like whey sometimes can I like the taste and texture too Mixes great with cranberry juice cranberries stevia ice and water I add some Berry Green for extra energy and nutrients It s my morning breakfast 
Protein Punch I ve been using Nutiva products for years now and the protein powder is wonderful I add it to a smoothie in the morning and it keeps me going for hours It s a staple in my diet so I usually have one or two jars on hand I highly recommend it 
Tastes Great I love the taste of this hemp protein Powder I love to mush up bananas with a fork add some dried figs with raisins and pour this hemp protein all over it with the Nutiva Hemp seeds It tastes great and satisfies me on every level I also sensed there was much more fiber in the powder compared to other brands I couldn t believe when I saw that there was 14 grams per serving Considering that 90 of Americans are lacking in fiber this Protein Powder can be a great service to millions 
Good substitute for soy protein I mix this with orange juice berries and a banana in the blender and it tastes great It took some time to get used to the grainy texture but it is much better than soy or whey protein 
This cereal is the best We recently ordered a case of this cereal from Amazon and are down to our last box now My husband and daughter have Celiac and I don t but I eat more of it than they do It s really that good 
The best cereal My kids have tried I think all the gluten wheat free ones and by far this is their favorite They stay hard in milk and I an adult even like them 
You have to try this cereal My son loves this cereal I always had to buy it at a health food store where it is usually almost 5 per box so when it was on sale I would stock up I finally started buying another peanut butter cereal that also did not have gluten ingredients He said he didn t like it as well but I thought he was just imagining the difference Well I decided we would do a blindfolded taste test to prove he couldn t really tell the difference He was able to identify the Panda Puffs as his favorite every time no matter how we switched them around He has even asked for a case of this cereal for Christmas Guess that convinced me that there must be something to this cereal to make him like it so well When I received a 50 gift certificate through the Kidzeyes program as a prize I used it for some gluten free grocery items from Amazon I liked the items we tried so much I started an astore to promote the great tasting gluten free foods that are available at reasonable prices from Amazon com In fact that s the name of my astore Great Tasting and Gluten Free Here is the link I have several items listed including EnviroKidz Panda Puffs with personal reviews of each We have five people in our family eating gluten free and quality is very important to us All the items I have on my page are personal favorites Now I order gluten free items from Amazon about once a week for my family Sure beats going to the health food store over an hour away and paying much more for less selection 
yummy cereal I love this cereal It is crunch and filling as well as great tasting Was very upset when stores stopped carrying it So I was very happy that amazon carries it Many of my friends buy this also 
Smart Money packs in the flavor Smart Monkey is my favorite brand of raw food bars They have so much flavor compared to the brands you find in the grocery store Well done to whomever came up with the recipe you ARE a smart monkey 
senseo coffee pods Rather mild but pleasant tasting coffee typically consistent brewing 
Simply Delicious Thanks for carrying this coffee Our local stores only carry the Medium Roast Cappuccino It s nice that you carry such a variety 
Better tasting than the Dark Roast pods I loved the idea and ease of the Senseo but I was never that crazy about the way the coffee tasted The grocery stores do not offer much in the way of variety so I decided to take a chance and order the Columbia Blend from Amazon I have been very happy with the flavor of it compared to what I had been getting If you are up for a change and want a smoother flavor but still a strong tasting coffee Give it a try I will note that the bag only comes with 16 pods vs 18 in the regular bags 
Nice taste Blends well in smoothies Taste is to me neutral which is a plus for whey Difficult to find plain whey from Sports sources and when I have the taste is not pleasant The others do contain whey isolate which is supposed to be superior so perhaps that is the difference Elderly relative was drinking bottled nutritional mixes Ensure etc when she felt bad or had trouble keeping food down They helped but smoothies are better Make them with whey egg whites Deb El Just Whites here on Amazon sells whites in smaller packages natural chocolate Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Cacao Powder bananas and other fruit She loves them The whey and eggs whites give her all the protein she needs in a day in one drink the egg whites lighten up the drink too but aren t really necessary unless you really want a protein boost On bad days when she can t eat solid food I toss in a few tablespoons of Deb El powdered whole eggs to add fat and boost her caloric intake 
Fair trade organic and delicious I am a coffee afficionado I m a pickey coffee drinker and only use a french press to make my coffee from the freshest beans I can find I keep my coffee beans in the refrigerator and grind them fresh moments before making my daily cup of coffee This coffee was great and I have tried a million different brands Organic and fair trade is important to me Thanks for the extra effort I wish the big guys would make this kind of effort 
His fave My husband s favorite jerky Used to buy single bag much higher price for special treat for him Just wish he would not go through eight bags so quickly 
Very unusual junk food These snacks are crunchy and mildly peppery The taste resembles that of cottage cheese A little under salted for my taste but still great Watch out for blobs of undissolved jalape�o mix you probably do not want to bite into those 
THE BEST COLD COFFEE I VE HAD I ve tried a lot of cold coffee drinks and this one wins on all counts even over Frappacino I have to have one every afternoon for a pick me up treat You will LOVE this I m on my 2nd case 
GREAT If you need a BOOST its here tastes great and gives immediant energy I love it 
Heart healthy food I like it My doctor ordered me to eat heart healthy food saying that raisin bran is one of the best for bulk count He said it s a good idea to not only eat it for breakfast but to also eat a small bowl before dinner especially for those over the age of fifty who might tend towards constipation It sure beats the prunes of my mother s day I have always liked raisin bran and this packet of 70 individual boxes will last me a little over a month if I follow my doctor s advice I also enjoy the convenience of Amazon s new store for staple groceries The only drawback I see is finding the extra storage space if I order everything to last a month 
A great tea chest for the money I bought this tea chest for my father He loves it and it s a good deal for the money It s the perfect storage solution and a pleasant way to select your morning teabag too Recommended 
Gluten Free Pantry Spice Cake Gingerbread Mix This cake mix is absolutely awesome Very easy to prepare and is OHHH so good For those of us who have to avoid glutens in our diet sometimes baked goods just aren t at all tasty but this one is so good my husband who is not gluten sensitive eats it and says he can t tell any difference from the regular spice cake mixes Will definitely be buying more of these 
Good Product but past sell by date I have bought these krackers before at our local health food store and was delighted to see that they could be delivered to my door I received my shipment of these delicious spelt flatbread krackers this week However the sell by date on each package is a week old They seem to be fresh enough now but I am wondering about how long they will keep past the sell by date It also makes me wonder about other Amazon orders and the sell by dates on them I will be wary of ordering other items with a short shelf life 
Aw nuts Hazelnuts are tasty A 4 pack is twice as many as you d expect as part of a single package 
David Pumpkin Seeds Great way to pass the day at work Fresh and tasty 
David s Pumpkin Seeds Rock These are as good as the ones you buy in the store I was concerned about the quality but was happy to see that they are the same as those purchased locally Great price with discounts Most stores carry them for 1 99 for a 5 oz packet 
Lovely seeds for your cereal baking or yogurt In Europe you find a bowl of dark flaxseeds to the side of the muesli set out on a breakfast buffet A great source of Omega 3 oil you can improve your health by eating these tasty nutty seeds They are good for the gut and good for the heart The golden seeds are an attractive alternative to the nut brown seeds They look nice in baked goods like lighter breads They taste the same as the dark seeds Ground they don t show up in white bread so you can bust some up in the blender and throw then into your standard bread recipe and add needed nutrients and fiber We like them sprinkled on oatmeal muesli or yogurt 
The Real Salt This is a good price for this amount of quality licorice This is the traditional Dutch concoction containing a strong salt taste and smell Not for everyone the taste of this product is less sweet but more long lasting than the licorice candies we are used to eating in America If you know you like this strongly flavored licorice this is a bargain 
It s very Dutch Double salt licorice is a very scary flavor for the uninitiated People don t like it the first time then start to crave it if they stay with the taste If one doesn t like this licorice it s great to serve to unwanted guests 
Just like the big brand but so much better My kids like these just as much and I feel better giving them organic products The chemicals and pesticide herbicide residues in non organic foods make me nervous Why take a chance when organics aren t that much more expensive anymore Yes the cereal isn t artificially fortified with vitamins minerals but my kids get a high quality multi vitamin every day so there s really no worry Add a serving of fruit to increase the nutrition I also add a little protein powder to the milk since getting a protein boost in the morning is very important for sustained physical and mental energy 
Fantastic Snacks This is a wonderful and healthful snack Crispy and tasty and low in calories Each bag equals 1 2 cup of fresh fruit and the dried crunchiness of these seems to intensify the flavor of the fruits There is also enough substance to meet the munchies moments I highly recommend these 
Nice flavor It s a great new at least for me Crystal light flavor My husband loves it 
Very good but don t buy from Amazon I tried to order this here but was sent Tang instead When I informed them of the problem they resent the order and again I got Tang Their system seems confused by the TANGerine description or they re just not very bright at the warehouse I ve had this flavor before and it is good not too sweet and a bit tart Refreshing 
weighing the cost of a moot situation The stores near my house charge over 2 a box for the organic type Half of me thinks it s great to have it avail on demand through Amazon for cheaper the other half is ashamed to waste the fossil fuel on a special trip to my house I think Annie s should be able to make their product a little cheaper by now it s pretty dang popular Oh Well the Alfredo variety isn t avail thru Amazon right now anyway so I m stuck again watching for sales and stocking up which makes the formerly ashamed half of me happy 
Great for those who need Gluten Free I bought this for my wife who has many food allergies She cannot have wheat or items containg gluten This is one of the best products I have found Its crunchy and tastes great It seems that most things we buy for her lack one thing or another this product has it all I even like it She absoultely loved it and I am out of the dog house for as long as it lasts 
better than starbucks espresso I have been drinking starbucks espresso but decided to give this a try I am so glad i did This is by far the best espresso i ever had and yea even better than starbucks 
Great espresso Best Price Once I tried Illy everything else tasted just OK Truly an excellent coffee flavor smooth not bitter of overly strong And the price is lower than any store I ve check and even better than ordering directly from Illy At a price of 13 per can I was ordering five cans at a time to get free shipping I love that I only have to order two at a time and it s delivered to my door 
Very Fast to Prepare These instant potatoes are very tasty and so simple and fast to make A nice buttery flavor and all you need is water Will be buying more 
Sooo easy My kids love mashed potatoes These are sooo easy No melting butter just add hot water We love to have these as a midnight snack Just add shredded cheese and some sliced green onion and ummmmmm good Would have given them 5 stars but they re not quite as creamy as hoped 
great product Great product what else can I say While I lived in the caribbean I ordered food since it was too expensive to buy good quality food there 
Ahi better than most Good texture good taste on the Ahi tuna Almost as good as beef jerky Avoid the salmon jerky Most of the strips were hard and brittle Some were so tough they were barely edible more fit for my dog Also the salmon was too spicy 
Can t go wrong I eat these right out of the package They are easy to put in my lunch box The flavor is great I never warm them up but they would probably be even better if you did I really like the sauce they are in No Complaints I just like em great taste don t take up much space But very filling Highly recommend 
The best green tea you can get in a bag and I ve tried quite a few I tried over 30 varieties of green tea bags searching for a good cup and this one takes the crumpet The flavor is strong but mild the color golden brown and the aroma is light I threw out all the others or rather I gave them to my father in law who also like tea when I found this one and I bought a case of it 
Wonderful substitute This is a great change from the canola oil and shortening When I first got it I pan fried some fish in it and it was really delicious Doesn t add a lot of extra taste that you might think Also think it s not as stinky when frying as other oils Then I had to try it on my popcorn Oh that is really wonderful Only problem I had is in delivery The oil wasn t sealed well enough and it got warm enough during delivery to become somewhat liquid Some of the liquid leaked out in the box Just a warning if you live in a warm climate area 
Best Deal on the Internet I wont go into the quality of this product or the nutritional benefits as I think the 4 5 stars and the customer reviews speak for themselves However I think you will find the 54 oz for 20 bucks is the best deal on the Internet especially when you buy two and choose the super saver shipping option I would challenge anybody to find a better deal for pure coconut oil of the same quality 
Nutiva is a great company they give 1 of all profit off the top to charity and activism Truly awesome company 
Nutritional Super Food This is 100 organic unrefined coconut oil Yes it tastes like coconut but it is supose to A food should taste like what it is The nutritional value of this food is outstanding It contains a lot of lauric acid which is also found in mothers milk and is both antifungal and antimicrobial It is stable at room temperature and does not become rancid quickly like other popular cooking oils It requires very high heat to release free radicals I do prefer red palm oil for high heat cooking options because it does not release free radicals at all My Suggested Uses smoothies slow cooked baked goods sauteed foods mixed with maple syrup over popcorn homemade cosmetics and as an occasional conditioner for dry ends of long hair 
Nutiva organic coconut oil Love this Great substitute for shortening Keeps baked goods moister and is excellent for cooking eggs and vegetables 
Good for canned chicken I was pleasantly surprised that this product had pop top lids The chicken is packed in water but not soupy It was a pretty good buy because I also bought another product and got a 10 discount on my 49 purchase I actually bought this chicken to mix with my dogs dry food from time to time I was buying canned dog food but it stank and I was finding shards of chicken bone in it After reading about dog food ingredients on Paul Newman s Newman s Own website I switched to his dry food I have to mail order it so I don t buy his canned food Despite the fact I bought it for the dogs I did try a can of this myself It was better than I expected I was afraid it would have a funny taste to it from the can but it didn t It has an expiration date of 9 months from my purchase date The cats liked it too so I m sure I ll be buying it again 
delicious I first had these in Alaska and when I returned my taste buds couldn t stop thinking about them They are a great alternative to fast foods 
Pure Rasberry Taste These are really great They are very sour when eaten alone but amazingly good in cereal or oatmeal A great fruit to have on hand especially when they are out of season 
Love it I love the way the fruit rehydrates in the milk in my breakfast cereal Absolutely delicious 
Tasty and organic I ve been eating gluten free for 5 or 6 years and mostly made my own bread cookies and crackers because GF food was hard to find and about as tasty as cardboard Thank goodness for Nature s Path their corn flakes are tasty but don t make a good coating in recipes that call for regular cornflakes sadly I love the Panda Puffs and Koala Crisp yes I m a grown up and I eat these cereals the kids love the Gorilla Munch the Organic Crispy Rice Bars with peanut butter are a favorite and these vanilla animal crackers don t last long in my house even the non celiacs love them I haven t tried the other flavors but these have a pleasant smell a crunchy texture like a real animal cracker are not crumbly or gritty and have a nice cinnamon y aftertaste I buy these by the case 
delicious These are truly good gluten free cookies We have recently made the switch over to a casein free milk free gluten free diet for the sake of my son He is already a picky eater so I was worried about the transition These cookies provided him with a yummy replacement snack for snack time that competes with the snacks that are being served ie in church school etc He is particularly enamored with them because they have kid friendly animal imprints Being gluten free they do tend to break more which can be upsetting for young kids but they taste so good he has been able to overcome this fault and is even willing to eat the broken pieces 
Great coffee no mess We use these pods for a youth group fundraiser at our church We consistently get comments on how great the coffee tastes I like how easy they are to use No mess no tamping I am able to make drink after drink quickly and easily 
Yes I ate one whole box as one serving 8 cookies over the course of one day while at my work desk As other reviewers noted they are light buttery and delicious I m using the second box for homemade sorta ice crem sandwiches They are so tasty they really are fine plain Now I wished I had ordered several cases when they were on sale for 12 but maybe then I d eat too many 
The Swedish Chef Would Be Proud Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of all things swedish from Lingonberries to salt cod to Lutefisk to those yummy red candy fish When I saw that Jules Destrooper had invented yet another Swedish delectable I could not wait for my package to arrive After assaulting the UPS driver and absconding with my butter waffles which are more like cookies I went into my kitchen and sat down in my breakfast nook to eat them A hearty glass of milk was all I needed to drench the entire box and consume it In reality I ended up saturating the cardboard box and must have eaten that as well because when I was done there was nothing left save for some soggy nuggets stuck to my ceiling I assume they are from my delicious waffles and not from my earlier experiment of stuffing a cornish game hen with popping corn to make its own stuffing I am still picking bits of hen from my bushy inappropriately dark eyebrows Also some recipe ideas for these waffles include topping them with olives tuna salad anchovy and pretzel an old Slavic favorite and peanut butter Sometimes I give these to the neighbor children when they behave themselves and actually I have only given one out to one neighbor child My neighbor s kids are usually misbehaving and absolutely do not deserve any of my tasty cookies Anyway it turns out the one kid I gave it to was actually a lawn jockey statue which makes sense because my neighbors the Davenports have very light skin They are actually quite pasty and I am waiting for the day when one of them develops melanoma because they are always out in the sun in their pool having a heck of a time under the sun s deadly rays oblivious to the cellular damage they are inflicting on themselves I prefer to stay inside during the daytime and nighttime hours usually venturing from my house every fortnight to collect my mail However when I know a delivery of Jules Destrooper Butter waffles are arriving I am on high alert and spring from my rascal mobility scooter whenever I hear a car door close Overall I LOVE these waffles Buy them and If you don t love them too send them off to me 
Delicious These butter waffles are very tasty very light yet rich and buttery They re hard to resist couldn t help but eat a whole box Only downside is that it uses vanillin rather than real vanilla However it goes great with ice cream and fruits 
Experiencing a Wonderful Taste Journey From where I should start From the amazing taste the nice smell or the natural ingredients Do you know try it and tell me your opinion 
Minty Chamomile for Sweet Dreams Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves lemon grass hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general This could be due to getting a good night s sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect Valerian is a very effective herb if you can t get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia Unlike sleeping pills you won t feel groggy the next morning Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea The Rebecca Review 
LOVE THIS STUFF This product is a great evening tea to help you relax and gently eases you too sleep Before this I was taking harsh medicines like Tylenol PM s and such and always woke up feeling worse than before I went to bed Not with the tea Let me clarify it will not knock you out but just help to relax you 
Delicious Meyer Lemon flavor in the juice We ve enjoyed this Sparkling Meyer Lemon juice enough that we ve reordered it We love the Sparkling Blood Orange and Cranberry juice combo but it s nice to have some variety The Meyer lemon flavor comes through very clearly and is quite refreshing We also like the light sparkling quality of the juice This juice makes an excellent mixer for drinks 
The best mixer ever I tried this drink with some friends and everybody loved it The Meyer Lemon is very distinct and has a great taste essn Meyer Lemon makes the best lemon drop ever I would highly recommend essn for your next event or party 
Makes a great lemon drop Nice clean Meyer lemon flavor These lemons are just a tad bitter and have more sweetness than any other lemon Chefs LOVE using these lemons in recipes This flavor also makes a great lemon drop 
Delicious This is my favorite cereal ever Since I started eating only organic I picked this up one day and I love it I eat it every morning for breakfast 
The portable and edible Oreo One reviewer writes that these are Oreo crackers without the creme and they are right These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you re on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion They also make for snacking anytime of the day or night and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free hooray There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories too Excellent These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy This makes them even more portable for both children and adults Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre measured to contain only 100 calories This way you can t accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and or cholesterol Buy some and enjoy them today SMILES 
Coffee for Life makes an excellent cup of coffee with eye opening aroma and better yet profits from this fair trade company are invested in an orphanage in the community where the beans are grown So drink a whole pot 
As good as Senseo pods and cheaper Having tried Senseo pods Millstone etc I was surprised that good old Folgers is just as good and in some cases better than Senseo s newer flavors While made for the Home Cafe these fit Senseo coffee makers and give you a good cup for a lot less than the more upscale brands 
A treat for normally deprived celiacs These are great and taste just like the real thing 
Excellent Never guess these are wheat free Whole family loves them Will continue to purchase 
Excellent coffee Product arrived when it was supposed and exactly as in the ad I m glad I ordered item 
Safe for adults and children of all ages If you have a small child who is hard to get to bed at night put them in a routine Make them some sleepytime before bed you can add splenda or honey to make the tea sweeter This will calm thier nerves and make for a restfull night of sleep This has also shown to me to prevent a fight from a child who does not want to go to bed With a cup or two of this tea they should be off to sleepyland This tea does have a distinct taste which can be hard for some to get used to I add honey or splenda to my tea to calm the bitter taste down This tea is like chammomile with little to no taste So you ll need to add lemon juice or honey to make this tea taste good This tea can also calm you after a hard days of work if you ve been over worked or stressed out I give this tea to friends and loved ones who are going through stress or issues to remind them to relax 
Real coffee taste This Kenya blend is a mild but very tasteful coffee No burned taste at all and it has become my favorite 
coffee could be stronger taste is good Good servive faor price this coffee could be a bit stronger to my tast 
Great gentle coffee I don t know a whole lot about coffee but I do know that I really like the taste of this Some of the Senseo coffees I have tried have been chemically and harsh specifically some of the flavored ones and required a lot of cream and sugar to become palatable This however requires just a drop of cream and less than a single pack of sugar The flavor is a little bit weaker when it first hits your tongue as a result but it strengthens over the next 5 10 seconds It never gets overpowering but it is very pleasant If you need a quick boost of caffeine then you can drink it fast without killing your tongue If you want to sip it then you might want to make it a little bit stronger than they recommend but it is still very good 
Organic California Raisins As with all Newman s Own products you find great quality with what you ve purchased and also good value Paul Newman has given over 150 million in thousands of charaties worldwide since the establishing of the Newman s Own line One box of these raisins is 130 calories with zero fat cholestrol It s a good healthy snack to have around and enjoy from time to time 
My kids LOVE them My kids love these lollipops So does my husband The flavors are great and they are the perfect size not too big and not too small They taste better than the other artificial ones you find at the grocery stores 
AMAZING LOLLIPOPS These are the best tasting lollipops you will ever have Because of my 2 year olds food allergies I discovered these and now her doctors office is purchasing them even the hospital my husband works at These are allergy free and amazing 
Turkey Perfect makes the best turkey you ll ever taste I ve been making holiday turkeys for over 30 years This year for the first time I used Turkey Perfect and without a doubt this was the best moistest most flavorful turkey I ve ever done I told a friend about this product she called me to rave about her absolutely delicious turkey Even relatives who don t really like turkey went back for seconds and thirds For the first time ever we had NO turkey leftovers this year 
YUM This soup is delicious Unfortunately it makes a bit much for one person but it is a good leftover Very tasty 
Yummy We really like these The lemon flavor is heavenly The cookies are crisp and light VERY VERY good 
Crown Prince Skinless Boneless Sardines I was introduced to these when I bought a can at a Big Lots store and found that they were so good that I went on line and bought a case I highly recommend this brand to anyone liking sardines Stan Re 
Probably buy them again Small no sugar a bit harsh tasting might end up better diluted a bit with club soda This is pretty well true of the four I have tried But in some ways the harsh tasting is good the 12 pack can be doled out at one per day per person Does act as herbal medicine I have no idea But it s very nice to have a treat that I don t really want to consume all of in one sitting Like for instance Gummy Bears 
Very tasty and a change from the ordinary We bought these because there was an online coupon for them My children ages 11 and 14 take lunches to school and I was looking for something beyond the usual chip choices The price was right and with the free shipping when going over 25 it was hard to resist The fries are light and airy like a thin cheeto but with a more delicate flavor They are a nice change and we re really enjoying them 
Nice 3 point snack I love these things Amazon is the only place I found to order these Cheddar Fries The 1 oz bag is the perfect snack size especially for those on WW Each 1 oz bag is 3 points Not bad for a junk food snack Awesome price and fast delivery 
This is my dd s favorite cereal This is a really delicious natural alternative to other frosted flake types of cereal and you cannot beat the Amazon price 
Gluten free and tasty The other review was strictly from a nutritional standpoint and did not address taste Where I agree nutrition is very important when you have a child with celiac disease or food allergies finding something that they will like to eat is a huge challenge This cereal is excellent for taste consistancy and it is gluten free If you need something for breakfast before school give them this and a multivitamin 
a good granola for once This is a good granola I like that it has lots of seeds with the grainy things and a few nuts tossed in Nice taste Thanks to Amazon for carrying so many gluten free items Makes like so much easier 
The best gluten free granola I ve found This granola is delicious Being that it s gluten free is a bonus since it s so hard to find acceptable healthy foods within that diet But my family can eat whatever they want and they couldn t stop eating it The cranberries bring a wonderful touch of sweetness to the nuts and crunchies This is a great treat to keep with you when you want a more substantial snack 
Excellent and Healthy I feel better serving this mac cheese than all the others out there no artificial colors or flavors and it tastes great Cheese sauce is on the salty side so i throw a bit of my own pasta in with the shells to cut sodium content 
Great taste and Wonderful alternative I would have never bought this stuff but a friend was making it one day and I tried some It was sooo good I had always just made Craft before this stuff but now I d say I eat this just as much It s a great way to change up the normal macaroni taste And did I mention it s really good too It s kinda salty tasting with a creamy white cheddar texture My favorite is when you get a noodle full of undistributed cheese MMMMM I also love it because it s organic With each day of my life I d say i m eating smarter and this product was the next step in my plan I can t wait to try out the other flavors and different products I d like to see this being sold in Ralphs market soon As of now I can only find it in Vons Safeway 
Good quality product Tastes very good in my oppinion and in the oppionons of two of my friends who tried this product too Not exceptionally great hence the 4 stars but good enough to enjoy eating Big pieces of meat and plenty of it Plus it s all natural including the beef which was not from hormone fed cows which is also important in my oppinion Would buy again 
Tasty but dry I loved the taste but the beef was quite dry It s very easy to heat up and probably would be great for a college student as an emergency meal 
Nuts to That If it were not for the fact that these nuts were not packaged properly they would be rated at least a 5 I called the manufacturer and they told me it must have been at the factory They were not full cans None were full to the top but two of the cans were not even half full The manufacturer sent me two coupons for the two cans that were about half full I felt the whole order should have been replaced but two cans is better than none As I said the product was excellent but I would not spend the money again to possibly get the quantity I got Well all I can say is nuts to that Gail Napolitan 
Yum I love orange pineapple Had these before getting more from Amazon These are great as expected 
Best Flavor in the Crystal Light line Orange Pineapple has been my favorite flavor for years When it s out of stock at my local supermarket I go out and look for it It s the best 
Rich Robust The beautiful cobalt blue package contains deep dark shiny coffee beans that release a rich and robust flavor ideal for the real coffee lover The price can t be beat for organic coffee of this quality I will continue to buy it from Amazon com 
Great bold coffee I had read other s reviews about how great this coffee was but I was using another coffee that I thought was really wonderful I tried this one and now I am hooked It is wonderful if you like bold coffee which I do I also like the fact that it is Organic I don t drink a lot of coffee each day but the cup or two I have I want to be great Just wish they had a decaf for my evening coffee 
More than a little impressed This coffee is awesome The aroma and taste are like a little bit of heaven for a french roast aficionado like me The price is great and the shipping is quick I am really glad to see that it is organic as well This sure leaves that pricey brand in the dust 
best trail mix on the market None of that super sugared candied dried fruit or flat tasting candy e g chocolate chips to mess up a yummy but healthy snack Don t get me wrong I LOVE chocolate the darker the better but what they put in trail mixes is worse than nothing If I want candy I ll buy the good stuff Thanks Amazon My local market no longer carries it 
PMS Relief This has the perfect blend of sweet and salty combination without the guilt 
NOT SALTY I don t normally review items but I had to write something on this because all of these it s too salty comments are driving me crazy These are hardly salty at all There is far more salt in potatoe chips or popcorn or basically any other snack food My bag says its only 8 of your daily sodium which is much lower than you would think from the comments people are leaving I m a man so I personally think these could use MORE salt 
Yum I used to love Just Corn but I like this brand even better I agree they could cut the salt a bit but I think some salt is a nice compliment to the corn 
I M SO EMBARASSED This is my new obsession I am a voracious snacker I love corn on the cob This tastes JUST like it Only 70 calories per package I never thought I d be writing a review about corn but I like it I am going to try the other varities of this line 
Yummy Delicious and crunchy with a slightly sweet blueberry flavor Healthy ingredients no added refined sugar and no wheat Great product 
Tasty Healthy and 1 Minute to make These only take 1 minute to make the noodles are already expanded as in NOT DRY They taste great and I dont feel like I just ate fast food when I finish one of them or two 
So simple and delicious This Annie Chun s udon soup is very easy to prepare I don t think the first step is necessary either Just add the water to the noodles and dried vegetables cover it with the lid and microwave it for about 3 1 2 minutes Add the sauce packet The noodles loosen up after you stir it If you what a more filling soup add meat vegetables My kids and I really love this soup I just purchased more from Amazon because it s a better buy here than at the grocery store 
wow love at 1st bite I started to love Annie Chun s udon soup in March 2007 Although it was on my AMAZON GROCERY LIST for many months cause i read a very bad review from a guy that did not know what is great I just ordered many A Chun s soup noodle bowls And i will order more again in future Annie Chun is a cute and talented woman and she is the 1st Asian female that i admired and read her story about her soup noodle for second time on Amazon com 
Tasty AND Healthy Snack Ever feel like you want that little something with your tea or coffee but you abstain because you re on a diet That was a problem for me at least I ve been trying to avoid white sugar and white flour in an effort to lose weight Well just when I d about given up finding a suitably healthy alternative along came Dr Kracker spelt muesli crackers They are all natural contain no white flour or sugar DO have some dried fruit for that right amount of sweetness that makes them satisfying as an accompaniment for coffee or tea Highly recommended 
Dr Kracker Muesli Flavor Was visiting my daughter and found these wonderful habit forming crunchy with a hint of sweet crackers I don t want to eat anything else now Hope I can get them where I live in NY soon 
Basic Brown Everyone of us usually loves to make a fresh cup of coffee in the morning Nevertheless getting the best quality filters are definitely the biggest hastle for your coffeemaker These Melita Cone 2 coffee filter are one of the best made filters around They are woven tight and completely seperate the ground coffee from spilling into your carafe or your mug if you use Melita s Perfect Brew mug coffee makers I like these a whole lot because they really help make the best coffee around If you want to make a great cup of coffee than you ll definitely want to get some of the best filters available I definitely suggest you buy these 2 Coffee Filters It is a definite buy so drink up Price B+ Quality A Overall B+ 
Rice in a pinch This is decent rice with a lemony herb flavor that is pleasant It s a bit heavier than fresh cooked or frozen rice but works great in a rushed day 
My Son Loves these He did not know if he would but he loves them Great for a quick snack or a snack to go Please don t quit selling these Glad we bought them and will buy more 
Good stuff These are yummy vegan treats but they are kinda small for 120 calories and 4 5 grams of fat But they are a good snack 
LOVE LOVE LOVE EM They taste so great I had to limit how many my kids could eat each day 
Would Will Buy Again Having to get a mindset and change eating habits due to health issues has proved to be a challenge but with so many snacks that can be had that are actually good for you and that taste good it has been pretty easy This item for one we LOVE What they are not Airy super sweet empty calories What they are Please read the nutritonal chart so I don t have to type it all out the sodium level is a good choice for those that have to limit salt intake Calories are not outrageous They have a slight taste of caramel that comes from the rice syrup peanut butter They were not overly gooey They are a bit more weighty than the others but it s because there is some substance here We have learned to eat and enjoy our food at a slower pace so one will suffice vs 2 3 of the others we use to scarf down in one sitting I give 5 stars as product was in date tasted fresh has a GOOD taste nutrition worthy packaged conveniently 
Like yummy gooey RiceKrispie treats but HEALTHY Just like all the other Betty Lou s products I ve tried and become hooked on these are delicious Individually wrapped they are a convenient and nutritious treat to take anywhere So good 
Better than Campbells Even non celiac people should switch over Here s an amazing gravy for chicken or pork chops Try it next time and serve next to mashed potatoes 2c water and 1 2c mix Bring to gentle boil over high heat Remove from heat immediately Stir in 1 4c sour cream Pour over meat browned in a skillet Simmer on lowest heat until meat is cooked through turning and stirring often to prevent skorching Hmmmm I m getting hungry 
Best gf soup mix I ve been gluten free for 5 years due to my son 1 1 2 personally I always had trouble duplicating my favorite casseroles because of them needing cream of mushroom soup concentrated With this mix I mix double the amount to the water so each container makes 3 instead of 6 and it tastes just as good as the gluten variety I haven t tried it as just a soup but it s the only thing I ll use in casseroles 
Yummy Angel Food I have used this cake mix many many times The first time my daughter made it for me for my birthday She said she thought it would be difficult to make it with a hand mixer but was a snap with my large stand mixer I have since made it many times and it is a favorite for birthday parties in our office even though I am the only gluten free person I add fresh orange juice and peel instead of the vanilla and serve it with strawberries or fresh fruit and whip cream yummy 
Everyone at work and home loves this cake great with stawberries I HATE to bake but this cake is so easy to make I didn t have the problems the others did and I followed the directions on the box However I have a very old and POWERFUL stand mixer I beat it on the highest setting and this cake comes out great I feel horrible that the others didn t get this cake to work it really is incredible I frost it with a light frosting and serve it with strawberries Everyone loves it I am the only person in my house on the gluten free diet and the others husband and 4 children think it is the best The only difference I have noticed is that it isn t as high as a betty crocker cake mix but it is light and fluffy You really need a stand mixer to make this but it is QUICK easy and tasty My stove is also older and the temp is a little hot For gluten free baking I turn it down 25 degrees and bake everything a little longer But my mom uses this mix and hasn t had any mishaps She has a newer stove and follows the cooking temp and time on the box By all means if it is not at the right stage soft peak if I remember correctly beat it longer than the box instructs 
Crystal Light Ruby Red Grapefruit drink mix This stuff is great and we can t find it in our grocery store in Galveston Co Texas Now I don t have to wait until we fly to the Northwest Very cool 
Very true lemonade taste Love this stuff Great for adding invisible fiber supplements to as well No after taste at all 
Better thank Starbucks These are great Very smooth and yummy The only thing is I think they are a little to sweet for me I just add a little more coffee and a tad of milk then they re perfect I ll buy them again for sure 
Better than Red Bull I am a big fan of Coffee Other than water it s all I drink So when I found this I had to run with it It s cheaper than red Bull has more power than it It s better for you than red bull and it has a nice flavor that does not leave an aftertaste My frig is stocked with as I type 
Very Tasty Jerky Both bags that I received were quite tender and had great flavor Not too sweet and not too spicy I will definately be ordering some more My dog Mr Doodles also loves it 
Is tender jerky an oxy moron This was a very tender jerky It s not the kind that wrenches at your teeth If you re looking for hard core jerky look elsewhere Back in my youth I used to love that sort of thing But with the sensitive teeth I have now I need to show a little discretion This jerky was great It was tasty It had a little heat which I appreciated The only drawback were the spice There s something really hard in the spice mix that nearly broke my teeth on more than one occasion There s 2 bags but it went fast It was that good 
Bentley s Teas Gift Box After reading that Bentley s has the finest Ceylon teas in the world I decided to give this as a Christmas gift to my husband He says it is the best tea he s ever had and since he is somewhat of a tea connoisseur I would consider that a compliment The box is beautiful and it makes a lovely presentation 
Tastes Great This drink mix is really good It tastes just like other drink mixes but is only five calories It is definately a good choice They also have other flavors such as Lemonade Peach Tea Raspberry Ice Pink Lemonade and more 
Yummy This Mac Cheese is really creamy without tasting processed and it has the right amount of salt Very good product overall 
Real Italian espresso This is real Italian espresso the best you can find on the market If you have an espresso machine and know how to use it then you got it made Rich flavor and sweet at the same time I ve known this product all my life growing in italy Excellent The very best 
convenient and tasty I love the pod idea makes cleaning so much easier This is perfect for a quick shot of espresso after dinner Excellent 
most elegant teas Wow no wonder you can t get this anymore They probably can t make them fast enough This is such an unusual gift set The pot is so cute as well as being a nifty display item The teas are all individually packaged and ones that you wouldn t find anywhere else Makes you want to drink tea all day The box that it comes in as well as the individual tea box is reuseable and so pretty I hope that this item is offered for sale again soon as I would buy a dozen of these to keep on hand for gifts and maybe one for myself 
What a wonderful gift set 5 Stars PLUS This is a great way to try the teas before you buy them in any type of quantity The pot brews about 3 cups of tea I don t drink the tea often I prefer to have it as an infrequent treat to keep the experience special I will update my review as I try the different teas The dragon lily tasted wonderful but the flower was really ugly However I did buy a box of this tea and when I brewed it the flower was more colorful and appealing I was able to steep this flower 4 times for 12 cups Although I admit that the last three cups didn t have as strong a flavor Starlight rose was disappointing The flower never changed appearace just got bigger The flavor was strong and left my mouth feeling pasty Flower Jewel Lavender Dream Emerald Sun Jade Fortune Jasmine Pearls unwind to become long thin leaves The scent is heavenly The taste is not quite as dramatic but still good I used approximately 1 pearl for each cup of tea to brew it 3 pearls per pot Black Beauty Midnight Peony 
a treat This is an incredible set for tea and some incredible tea At more than half the price it is a nice organic store you might find it at no offense to organic stores but a 200 mark up is a little much this tea is the best ive ever had great for a gift as well id get one for yourself and a couple for birthdays and whatever comin up 
Pretty appreciated gift but tastes pretty crummy Great for Novelty gifts But don t give it to true tea lovers Different kinds of flowering Tea look great very entertaining to watch bloom but taste pretty crummy I would say most of them taste somewhere between stale and tasteless Nevertheless it s a nice gift because of the experience and the cool box glass pot you get to keep 
Good Snack Treat A great alternative to the junk filled mainstream variety I am hoping they come out with a regular flavor as well as the chocolate 
A staple in Lunch Box Central When my kids started kindergarten they needed to pack a lunch everyday My wife realized that this was a teaching opportunity about nutrition making the right choices and responsibility Each day the kids pack their own lunches from Lunch Box Central Each lunch must contain a protein usually yogurt a grain some form of cracker or grain filled bar and a fruit apple banana or fruit cup EnviroKidz Organic Crispy Rice Bars are a staple in Lunch Box Central They re convenient the kids enjoy them and they re a reasonably healthy choice The kids are happy they re learning and they re eating well My wife is pretty smart 
Great Flavor Great taste and value It taste best with a high quality honey A must for tea drinkers 
A spot on spot of tea Certainly there are more expensive teas but I ve yet to have a better cup than Twinings Earl Grey which is a perfect blend of comfort and spice It works brilliantly as a Good morning how do you do or a Rest well sweet dreams sort of a beverage Many other Earl Greys on the market struggle with the proper blending of the bergamot oil which can be quite overwhelming if overdone but it is what makes Earl Grey unique so one does want to be able to taste it Too many other tea companies cannot seem to grasp this delicate balance but Twinings has always gotten it just right The tea can be enjoyed au naturel or with a slight dash of cream not too much because you don t want to drown out the enjoyable lively flavor of the bergamot For me when it comes to a cup of hot tea this is simply the best 
Awsome I love this popcorn and this was such a bargin price compared to store price Thanks Amazon 
Wish I could find it locally I love this popcorn but can t find it locally Thank goodness I found it online so I can still get it 
Excellent Popcorn It is so good to taste popcorn that tastes as if it were taken right out of a pot of boiling water buttered and salted to taste The smell of corn on the cob runs throughout the house Great summer smell all year long 
Too good This spread is way too good My husband and I have both tried spreading it on toast but it really stands alone I like to eat it just straight out of the jar The spread is a perfect blend of flavors If you have a sweet tooth and don t always have other sweets on hand a spoon of this stuff will satisfy all your cravings Unfortunately this spread has no nutritional value to speak of so I doubt I will order it again 6 jars is plenty for us You have to order it at least once though 
Quite nice Very good not a rich dessert by any means but a healthy filling snack My kids really like them and while they aren t low calorie or really low fat it isn t full of sugar and it contains healthy fat The 5 grams of protein per serving really help with making you feel full 
Exactly what I have been looking for I love the iced jasmine tea at our local Vietnamese restaurant In fact every Vietnamese restaurant seems to serve the same wonderful tea I have tried many different brands tyring to find one like the one served in Vietnames restaurants light in color a light tea taste and a strong jasmine taste and scent I finally found my brand 
Very soothing and great tasting I disagree with the other review that this tea has an unbearable scent I would say that the jasmine scent is strong but not overpoweringly so If you brew it according to the producer s recommendation steep it for 60 90 seconds the result is good to great The tea is very soothing and the jasmine taste is very comforting The only knock is perhaps it leaves a little bit of an aftertaste especially when the tea is cold I do not understand about the other reviewer s fascination with packaging a bag of tea is a bag of tea is a bag of tea Who really cares what is printed on the tab Anyways I have been drinking this tea daily and I am ready to shop for another can when this one runs out Recommended to People looking for decent tasting white tea Not recommended to people particularly sensitive to the scent and taste of jasmine 
Golden Nut Crunch is the best I just bought some of this Golden Nut Crunch from Planter s last week and I snack on it at work it is really one of the best trail mixes I have had before I love it It lasts a while also it lasted me about 4 days at work just snacking on it periodically I would definitely recommend this snack It s healthy too 
I Love These I Love These Bars I highly recommend these for a quick breakfast on the way to work 
quality x price = good Considering you get at least twice as much jerky per dollar than the other brands out there this is a good pick I didn t find any grit in it It might have a few pieces that are tougher but not really even that tough This is a good deal 
Yummy Our family loves these balls They are very similar in taste and texture to the cheddar Pirate booty maybe a little crunchier They re by no means healthy for you but you feel a little less guilty no fake orange coloring etc 
Absolutely Delicious These cookies do not taste like they ever saw the inside of a box They taste like real butter and fresh ingredients And they just about melt in your mouth I ll be buying these again 
Super I ve tried the Andy Capp HOT FRIES REG CHEDDAR and WHITE CHEDDAR These HOT FRIES are the best They re the best of the 3 products and best all on their own I m getting addicted to them ordered a second carton before finishing the first Definitely nicely HOT that s part of the addictive quality And an enjoyable to eat with the good underlying corn flavor and non greasy crispness that I like about the Andy Capp products 
Ohhhh yummy This seller shipping was very quick and the product was perfect I highly recommend this seller 
Saves Money Saves Time My wife hates hot food but for some reason loves hot fries If her salsa has the tiniest spice she won t eat it yet these mouth burning beasts are her favorite snack They are sometimes hard to find having them by the case helps solve that problem The size offered here is the size that you will normally find around here at least printed with the 99c price so you can also figure the price savings somewhere around what 40 Wow 
Perfect Lunch for Work Pacific Foods Beef Stew is wonderful for hot lunches at work inexpensively the all organic ingredients make the Pacific Foods very tasty and filling Way to g 
my new favorite snack These things are so satisfying on many levels Chewy crunchy sweet but not too just the right size with whey protein for energy which is the best source there is All that and organic peanut butter and organic agave syrup too I am so happy I have a whole tub of them 
Great gluten free snack for on the go These peanut butter balls not only taste great but they are good for you My daughter has celiac disease so foods like these are really blessings in our life I have eaten these when I did not have time for lunch They are filling and energizing and taste delicious You can t ask for more than that 
HOW I LOVE THESE PEANUT BUTTER BALLS Let me count the ways They re great for a quick energizing snack breakfast healthy dessert and tonight I even had one for dinner They are delicious and you feel good about eating them because they re good for you Plus you get a lot of bang for a deceptively tiny ball they re very filling and only about 200 calories GENIUS 
excellent sauce high quality refined balance and intriguing flavor two thumbs up form people who like to cook 
Tasty I thought this was great but it just wasn t as competitively priced as I would have hoped for buying a case from Amazon So delicious though When I make it for people they can t believe it s a mix 
Yummy This frosting is GREAT It tastes good and has a wonderful consistency IF you use room temp margerine and mix for a little longer than stated It actually tastes almost fluffy The vanilla is good but the chocolate is the best I ve every had HANDS DOWN and I have no allergies This product is a easy and convient for those of us who have children with food allergies and all his friends enjoyed it at school 
Unusual but great I thought these were amazing My favorite is the Socorro blend A review said they were soggy but I m not sure what they mean They are very crisp with nice and chewy fruit Despite the fruit they aren t sweet but the sweet in the fruit really balances out the hotness of the other seasoning As for the price these are expensive nuts and high quality ingredients The flavors are unusual but perfect I am defiantly going to order more 
Excellent Unusual and fresh tasting I really really enjoyed these nut blends I will definitely order them again 
Extra good but pricey Sahale snacks were a pleasant surprise They re not over sweet nor over hot and they ve got a lot of flavor and texture Over all I d say they re among the best snacks you can buy not only in terms of taste and freshness but because they re far healthier than a lot of the stuff you find on the grocery shelves However the price is pretty high for the amount you get Even at the substantially reduced price of the variety pack it s a little high However for the occasional treat it s well worth the price It s just not the sort of snack you can dump into a bowl and pass around while watching movies 
WONDERFUL ASSORTMENT OF TOP QUALITY NUTS FRUIT I am ordering more of these goodies They are not only delicious and top quality they are the most interesting assortment I have ever had and are great for my sensitive stomach too VERY EXCELLENT PRICE AS WELL 
Inspired snacking I m placing my second order for the variety pack because I liked every flavor and appreciated the variety All have a sensational blend of flavors spicy sweet salty without being overpowering Truly delicious and healthy munchables I m so glad I decided to try out a package in my supermarket 
KILLARNEY Indeed What a deal Great tasting treat at a good price I will definetly be ordering other flavors and Killarney again too 
Good value taste Arrived in 4 days Best price I ve found Flavorful coffee 
Each to his own I guess but we love Senseo coffee As a very frugal spender I had observed this new design of coffee making in the stores and thought the process made sense so I was ecstatic to receive an email of a promotion one day I drove many miles to save some bucks and continue to be pleased beyond belief with every new kind of coffee we try We didn t like the competing cheaper brands but we find Douwe Egbert s Senseo brands consistently delicious The flavors are subtle enough that we don t feel we re drinking a cup of chemicals If you like strong coffee then stick to the 4 oz per pod suggestion If that seems strong or bitter we find we can get 2 or 3 more ounces from the pod and be very pleased For the first time in my 30 year marriage my husband doesn t make a point of commenting on the delicious coffee everytime we eat out finally we have predictable great coffee at home Being able to serve guests their choice of tea flavors or caffeine and have everyone enjoy the first cup out is a wonderful benefit 
DJ If you are looking for a healthy high fiber cereal that tastes good and doesn t have too much sugar this is it I love this stuff 
filling but bland for the calories The product is pretty good but is only 10 calories less that the Optimum Power which has blueberries in it It is a healthy and fairly satisfying cereal but not my favorite 
Fast food favorite Great nutrition profile for the calories involved The different textures make for a healthy ORGANIC snack 
Got Milk The Back to Nature Graham Sticks Honey are delicious They are a great tasty snack There s no way you can eat em without a cup of milk Not because they re rich but they re a little on the dry side I still like them so much that I quit buying them at the supermarket started buying them in bulk 
Better than Oreos These are wonderful cookies However the reason I couldn t give a full 5 stars was because so many of the boxes in the case had a lot of crumbled cookies The boxes were not damaged in any way so I am guessing they could have been packaged that way Not cool Otherwise they are much better tasting than oreos in my opinion I ll never go back to those 
Case of cookies These cookies are great My kids love them I saved a bundle by ordering the case Beware though I also ordered the peanut butter flavor in July06 and when they arrived at the end of July the expiration date on the case was Aug06 I didn t have any problems with the classic The expiration date was Nov or Dec I can t remember off hand 
Great sweetener My family prefers the blue agave to the lighter colored and sweeter agaves We use it to make raw truffles sooo good and on top of pancakes and waffles cereal rice pudding etc We had no problems with shipments leaking so far 
THE BEST SWEETENER OUT THERE By far the best no after tastes and will not spike your blood surgar levels worth every penny 
A great substitute for sugar Because of health problems I ve had to give up sugar The agave organic sweetener in my morning cup of coffee has been a perfect substitute I also use it with cereals and any other food or drink where I used to use sugar Thank you Blue Agave 
I LOVE IT This is a great product for a mother of five It made my mornings and some snack times wonderful Thanks 
Good selection My kids and I love the variety of cereals this assorted package has Comes with a bowl ready to eat in plus you can recycle the bowl 
Great for Kids I bought this to simplify our morning routines and save them from pouring large bowls and throwing it away The kids loved the choices The only downside was the portions were extremely small even for my 4 year old On average they ate two a day 
Variety This case offers a great variety of favorite cereals for everyone but this is not for 2 people The cereal went stale before we could eat it but this would be great for a large family 
Simply the best I recently have become more health conscious and am trying to eat more organic foods staying away from hydrogenated oils corn syrup etc You know all the stuff that makes you fat This jerky is a great healthy LowFat snack It tastes so amazing you ll never go back to any previously bought brand of jerky again I LOVE Jerky and have tried many different brands this jerky is well worth every penny and I ll keep coming back for more thanks AMAZON for making it affordable 
Unusual delicate yet flavorful I began developing cravings for it This is the perfect tea for breakfast or any time of the day Numi s Yunnan Black tea has a distinctive aroma with a strong apricot top note fortified by a nice oaky grassy base The brewed tea flavor is clean and yet complex slightly rich There is a an very slight edge of tannin which perfectly contrasts the subtle woodsy and floral flavors Excellent with a dash of cream Unfortunately Numi does not list the amount of caffeine it contains on the box It appears to have less caffeine than the usual English breakfast from its effect on this taster Numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging The boxes containing their tea is made from 100 recycled paperboard from 100 post consumer waste they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2 040 trees reduce landfill by 131 200 and prevent 184 000 greenhouse emissions Numi uses only 100 natural ingredients without added oils or natural flavorings 
Best Frosting EVER This is the best frosting I have ever had and I don t have food allergies I used it on the gluten free Cherrybrook cupcakes and my son s teacher pulled me aside to tell me how wonderful they were She also send people to me for the recipe I love all the Cherrybrook products but this is my favorite 
Excellent Choice Full flavored and smooth Lingering winey aftertastes never bitter Tolerates higher concentrations very well actually enhancing body and complexity of flavors Those who are unfamiliar with bean coffee should be reminded to use about 1 3 more by volume to get the same amount by weight as with pre ground coffees 
Nutrition in a yummy little package These might appease your sweet tooth while providing excellent nutrition in a 200 calorie natural food bar They are not overly chocolately like those chocolate covered protein bars the bar has delicious chocolate throughout with a terrific crunch of sesame flax and sunflower seeds I m hypoglycemic and they are perfect to keep in the car for the quick pick up to prevent the need for glucose and a true crisis I highly recommend Oh I have ordered both from Nutiva and from Amazon Amazon is less expensive and faster delivery 
Subtle Lovely Bedtime Tea This Bedtime Tea from Yogi Tea is an caffeine free herbal tea that is relaxing and a natural sleep aid Bedtime Tea is made from organic licorice root organic spearmint leaf organic chamomile flower organic skullcap leaf organic cardamom seed organic cinnamon bark organic St John s Wort leaf flower organic rose hips natural orange flavor valerian root extract organic raspberry leaf organic English lavender flower stevia leaf and passion flower extract The taste is mild delicious herb y and very slightly sweet It is subtle and lovely I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general Bedtime Tea comes with an expiration date a good thing because it s not full of preservatives plus you can tell if it is fresh Yogi Tea seems to be another company like Numi Aspen Traditional Medicinals that values sustainable and healthy practices Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed with info about each tea they make There is a warning on the box that this tea is not to be used during pregnancy or while nursing If you are taking MAO inhibitors or other prescription drugs you should consult your physician or health care professional before use There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease Best of all it works I love drinking it before bed to relax and drift off into blissful sleep This is a great tea that I highly recommend 
Works Tastey and straong for a bag tea It really works as a sleep aid It does have ingredents that may aggravate sensitive people 
Very effective sleep aid I highly recomend this product to those who are able to use herbal treatments It helped me greatly in getting a more sound sleep 
Truly tasty There are all kinds of things that I will eat for health s sake but my husband is more taste oriented There are a lot of energy bars etc that he won t eat but he loves these 
Totally surprised by great taste My family and my healthfood store lady all say this is one of the best of Betty Lou s Nut Butter Balls I do not have any problems at all with the taste in fact it beats the heck out of the coconut ones which are extremely sweet Yes they look green in the middle but we found the taste rather clean and refreshing not overbearing You will also enjoy the lift in your energy level these spirulina ginseng balls provide Now that I know about these little guys I am getting ready to buy TONS for Christmas gifts We would not be without them anymore 
good use of chocolate This cereal taste delicious the chocolate pieces are not supper sweet and the chocolate is rather dark which goes well with the cereal 
Decaf We enjoyed this coffee However decaf may still contain some caffeine I was watching a news report about disturbed sleep studies and the medical staff at the center stated that not all caffeine is eliminated in decaf Good to know if you have trouble sleeping or with the jitters 
Gluten Free Orgran Macaroni This is an excellant product Cooks up very well great with any sauces mac n cheese and also makes a fantastic macaroni salad The price from Amazon was really a bargain as all gluten free foods are so very very expensive I just wish we didn t have to buy so many packages as storage becomes a problem 
Aromatic and very tasty Nothing like this in the usual grocery stores Splenda sweetened to help keep the calories down Great texture and just plain good I want to try the other flavors soon 
DELICIOUS THE CEREAL IS DELICIOUS I PUT HALF OF A BANANA IN IT IT IS FULLING FOR ME IT IS LOW IN CARBS AND NO SUGAR I AM PRE DIABETIC MY SUGAR COUNT IS VERY GOOD WITH THIS I WILL NEED THEM AGAIN SOON 
Au Natural at its BEST Don t think I m weird but essentially the only thing I have at all to eat regardless of what time is Nature s Path cereal the Heritage collection is my favorite Wholesome filling crunchy PERFECT 
Great tasting cereal Good price Hearty great tasting cereal Has a whole grain flavor Originally looked at it because of lower carbs than other cereals which is better for my reduced carb diet But it has quickly become a favorite cereal and buying six boxes at a time through Amazon com nets out at a lower cost per box than buying it at local grocery stores 
Yum This is one of my favorite cereals It appears to be nutritionally superior to the Heritage O s and less crunchy The only downside to this cereal is that it doesn t keep me full for long I feel like an hour later I m hungry again I ve combated this by adding banana slices or blueberries to add some bulk to my bowl in hopes of more lasting power An upside to the downside is that this makes a terrific between meals snack I have no problem with polishing off all six boxes in a timely manne 
happy i m happy with the product and the swiftness of the delivery for sure i will be ordering again very soo 
TASTE GREAT These are my most favorite of all the Smart Monkey Bars and raw bars in general The best part is they are not dehydrated so they still have the live water content Try to stay away from too much dehydrated food I m an avid raw foodist I absolutely love these I can eat three in a row 
Spicey Goodness It is hard to believe all you do is add water and then enjoy the best mustard 
THE BEST MUSTARD EVER This is the best mustard I have ever had in my life Prepared mustard you buy in the store doesn t even come CLOSE to this mustard when you make it according to the directions on the container Strong hint of horseradish caught me off guard at first but I love horseradish so this mustard is the best I will never buy prepared mustard from the staore again Thank you 
Great healthy mac and cheese This is THE best mac and cheese on the market Just try it Its rich and creamy and all organic and as healthy cheese and pasta can possibly be Amazon also has a very reasonable price on this to stock your pantry 
Two year old loves these My son literally shakes with delight when I offer him this snack Its also a healthy alternative to other fruit snacks out there so it keeps mom happy too 
Wow this stuff is strong Tin container not laced in the plasic crap The tea is very stonge and not a mixture so you have to add flavors too it but it taste good plain too and is very strong Taste wise it s stonge with an inner spice like taste in it if you drink your tea how your supposed to not a gulper chuckle It was less than what I thought from the other reviewer but it is so strong you don t need as much and I d still have to say it s a great deal Just add a twist of your favorite herb like orange peal or ginger and this can be the making of a great exotic tea but the only thing it s missing is the organic seal of quality and then it gets 5 stars for proving it s grown under kosher conditions which is very important The tins are very nice to look at and I hate to thow them away Obviously they put a lot of pride in the product 
Good Tea and a good buy I was a little hesitent to make a big order for so much tea not knowing if I would like it So I went to a local supermarket and bought a tin there so I might give it a taste test This is quite a good green tea Other than buying generic green teabags I usually buy a Bancha tea This tea is not as grassy more bold with a slight smokey taste and more of a kickiness to it The cannisters are nice and their is an inside foil liner to keep the tea fresh The only thing to be aware is that this is a lot of tea altogether 21 ounces divided into six separate cannisters Unless you really love this tea plan on making some gifts 
The Green Pearl of Tea Gunpowder tea is green tea most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang south of the Yangtse River Delta where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the green pearl of tea Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty AD 618 907 The area s gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe Particularly during the second half of the 19th century when gunpowder tea export reached its peak its price on the London market was second only to then popular Wu Yi Oolong also from China Even today Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself home of silk and tea for its two primary natural products The name gunpowder derives from the tea s elaborate method of processing which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered steamed or stir fried and individually rolled into small pellets Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note It should always be enjoyed without milk or cream 
C Passalacqua Someone told me to look on Amazon to locate this product It s great as a broth but also for gravy and jazzing up beef and poultry entrees The taste is OUT OF THIS WORLD and so easy to make I inject the turkey broth into the turkey before cooking and it enhances the flavor added bonus since the holidays are just around the corner Thank you for having this product on Amazon 
You ll never go back to using bouillon cubes once you ve used and tasted this great product You ll also wonder why you ve been taking pantry space for years with cartons and cans This is an amazingly simple and easy to use packaging concept no scissors no can opener for a first rate chicken broth with a really deep home made taste The Beef version is excellent too 
Amazing Chicken Broth The only better broth I ve had was homemade by my hubby My daughter will even heat it for a quick snack I love it 
Natural and Delicious The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I ve become weary reading labels I ve started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality Nature s Path Organic Apple Cinnamon Toaster Pastries do taste slightly healthy but they remind me of some nutmeg cookies I make that are also made with whole wheat flour Ingredients Organic apple cinnamon filling organic evaporated cane juice organic apple juice concentrate water organic evaporated apples vegetable glycerin organic apple powder organic corn startch organic cinnamon locust bean gum organic whole wheat flour organic white flour water organic evaporated cane juice organic palm oil powdered organic eveaporated cane juice organic invert syrup salt leavening natural flavor agar tocopherols for freshness Unfortunately these do contain palm oil although I don t seem to be as allergic to organic palm oil Makes me wonder what I m really allergic to as in what is in the additional element in the non organic Palm Kernel Oil Could it simply be that this is the non hydrogenated version Could be Each pastry is 190 Calories 40 Calories from Fat They heat up fast in the toaster and are convenient for a snack The Rebecca Review 
Tastes great I have always been pretty picky about my poptarts so I wasn t sure if these were going to taste like cardboard or not when I first got them They are great poptarts My kids love them 
Typical French butter galettes I m French and I love these galettes They are the typical kind of cookies you can find in Brittany Bretagne with a light salted butter taste I like the tin too you can keep it to store whatever you like Make a great gift to French cookies lovers 
good and good for you tasted ok better than the other pure bran things and great source of fibe 
Great Source of Fiber Granted this is not one of the better tasting cereals but when you consider that it will provide the daily recommendation of fiber in just 2 3 cup the trade off is worthwhile If there is an easier way to get 26 grams of fiber I haven t found it Just be aware that if you prefer sugary sweet cereals this definitely is not the one for you 
Great Whole Grain Cereal This cereal is a wonderful better choice instead of the Chex line of cereals It has more fiber organic ingredients and no BHT Excellent as both a cereal w milk and also when used as part of a homemade trail mix 
I love this product This is a great cereal It is very similar to Crispex only a whole lot better for you 
Very Convenient We love this product in our house and it has helped me MOM kick the diet soda habit I add my soluble fiber and other powdered supplements and I am on my way Very true lemonade taste with no aftertaste at all 
Experiencing a Wonderful Taste Journey From where I should start From the amazing taste the nice smell or the natural ingredients Do you know try it and tell me your opinion 
Tasty Brew I ve tried 15 20 different k cups and would rate Timothy s Parisian Night can you say French Roast in the top third At the 7 25 oz setting it makes a full bodied dark brew with a nutty almost earthy taste It s very much a European style blend and with a dash of half and half makes a passable Viennese brauner 
Delicious Coffee Really Easy We love our Keurig maching and this coffee is rich dark and delicious Very smooth and strong Yum 
little calories great tasting tea The crystal light iced tea brand tastes better than all the regular sugared as well as the low calorie sweetened teas If you like it a bit sweeter put an extra pack of splenda in it 
do it I tried a two lb pack and then ordered this for a reorder Tart cherries great for oatmeal and sauses as well as snack 
Fills Young Bellies While Mending Broken Hearts Kraft Macaroni and Cheese beckons back to lonely days running home at lunchtime As I lay heart strewn and crying about the harsh rejection meted upon me by the fairest of the playground beauties soft noodles in a cheese cream sauce would ease my ache Daily at morning recess I would smile weakly and say hello to Heidi who in return would grimace There stood I in a pile of sadness swings and slides all around alone and she having moved on would toil no longer in my presence Today all so many years beyond I do not remember if it was her kickball skills or the way she whispered Green Eggs and Ham ever so flirtatiously just within earshot Her gentle words were never meant for me no matter how I thought her eyes caught mine and with clarity at recess I was reminded of her tease Recess would pass into lunchtime and as the bell rang I blew out the door and ran the quarter mile home Anger grief all inside boiling looking to be purged pushed me homeward Second grade happiness would be found where my mom made lunch Resting on our kitchen table steaming with freshly ground pepper was the golden orange macaroni and cheese A bit of butter and a few drops of milk converged with the cheese for the smooth sweet salty taste with which I could indulge my insatiated heart My mother forever smiling and me upset at Heidi who was forever guiling until soon I with my belly full was no longer riling Fair maiden was never won by macaroni and cheese but my broken heart was oft mended by its flavor 
Make it even better My kids love their Macaroni Cheese but one day all we had was a generic brand They didn t eat it all that well Kraft really is the best so I decided to try to make it a little better for them Follow the recipe on the box with a couple exceptions Put one slice of velveeta chees in while melting the butter I melt the butter while the noodles are draining so as to melt the butter and velveeta faster and add 1 3 cup milk What you ll have is a less expensive version of the really creamy macaroni and cheese that Kraft sells for a lot more money By adding extra milk and cheese they re even getting more calcium My kids love it when I throw in hot dogs and even peas so feel free to throw in other things since it s so cheesy the extra cheesy sauce will take things like peas that kids don t normally eat and make them taste good Give it a try and see what you and or your kids think 
Fantastic Turkey Broth This product is the most flavorful and savory tasting broth I have ever tasted It is excellent as a cup of broth or a gravy base 
Great Hot cereal Full of good health goodies Lots of fiber omega 3 flaxseed Cooks fast I use the stove top method add raisins and pecans 
Healthy hearty and tasty and how to cook it This cereal really tastes good I make it in the microwave first heating the fresh cold water to boiling then adding the cereal stirring and returning it to the microwave to finish cooking I let it boil and bubble for a bit in the microwave which is when the cooking really occurs I often let it sit in the microwave for a few minutes after it stops to set up Years ago a ham radio guy asked me over the air whether I knew how to make gourmet microwave hot cereal I said no wondering how you could make anything gourmet especially cooked cereal in the microwave but that I didn t express out loud so he explained to me the above method with emphasis on heating the cold water before adding the cereal And definitely not using hot tap water as that has the O2 chased out of it or some such So I guess that must be it I used to laboriously mix various cereal grains to achieve this kind of mix but with this product it is all done for me It s also good with raisins added I m delighted that Amazon is selling some of these healthy food items that are hard to find in parts of the country The special offers bring the price within reason 
OUTSTANDING FLAVOR AND GOODNESS I DISCOVERED NATURE S PATH ORGANIC HERITAGE FLAKES CEREAL WHILE I STAYED IN SEATTLE WA FOR ALMOST 6 MONTHS IN THE YEAR 2000 I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT WHOLESOME GOOD TASTE AND ORGANIC BACK IN LOS ANGELES I HAD DIFFICULTY FINDING IT IN TRADITIONAL HEALTH FOOD STORES LAST OCTOBER I RECEIVED AN E MAIL FROM OFFERING FOOD ITEMS AMONG THEM MY BELOVED CEREAL RIGHT AWAY I ORDER 6 BAGS EACH OF 32 OZ I RECEIVED IT A FEW DAYS AFTER AND EVER SINCE I FEEL VERY HAPPY TO GET BACK TO THIS WONDERFUL COMBINATION OF CEREALS BESIDES THAT I M GETTING ECONOMIES OF SCALE WITH THE 32 OZ COMPARED TO THE 13 OZ BOX I USED TO BUY AT THE HEALTH FOOD STORES 
A truely great product This cereal meets three major criteria 1 It is low in sugar no longer a kid and hate cereal that is too sweet 2 Stays crunchy the best flaked cereal I have found for staying crunchy in milk maybe because the flakes seem a little heartier thicker than standard flakes 3 Taste last but not least too many of the healthier flakes taste like cardboard but this cereal is so good I can eat it right out of the bag like a snack This cereal is one item in my ultimate breakfast cereal mix The other ingredients are Kashi s 7 Whole Grain Puffs dried cranberries pecans and flax seed With Heritage Kashi combined you get all the following grains in one breakfast 1 Spelt 2 Quinoa 3 Kamut 4 Millet 5 Buckwheat 6 Triticale 7 Rye 8 Red Winter Wheat 9 Barley 10 Oats 11 Brown Rice 12 Sesame Seeds Then I add the following to the bowl 13 Flax Seeds about a tablespoon 14 Pecans about 2 tablespoons 15 Dried Cranberries about 2 tablespoons Then if you really want to go full on healthy try Better Than Milk Original Flavor Vegan Soy Beverage the best soy milk out there see my review of it 
Crunchy tasty environmental I think my title says it all Of course the packaging is not recyclable but it is at least minimal by today s standards This is a lot of cereal for one person so i hope it has good shelf life 
Loose Leaf Lady Grey Tea the best of all worlds My favourite tea in loose leaf form it just doesn t get any better than this The tins are a good size not so small that it s gone after four cups of tea but not so large that it ll be stale and moldy before you could possibly finish it that fit nicely in my desk at work as well as on the counter by the teapot The tea is fresh and flavourful with the quality I ve come to expect from Twinings 
Delicious This Lady Grey loose tea is a sensory experience It is light and citrusy with just the right kick of caffeine The flower petals are pretty but I cannot taste any difference they might make in the steeped tea It would make a nice gift for a woman who you don t know very well All in all it is worth a try 
Best tea I know Lady Grey is practically the only tea my family and I drink First we bought it because of cornflowers which are kinda symbol of Russia where I was born but we stayed with it for the taste Try it cold with lemon it s amazing 
My favorite tea for a reason I can t say enough good things about this variety and brand of tea The bergamot and other citrus elements in the tea and the delicacy of the tannins make milk sweetener or lemon completely unnecessary The color and aroma are just lovely making this a fantastic treat for the novice or experienced tea drinker and it has just enough caffeine to get me through tedious afternoons without making me jittery I carry the bagged variety everywhere I go 
Excellent Tea excellent service If you havn t tried Lady Grey try it and then buy the loose leaf at this price You won t regret it This is one of the best everyday teas I ve found with a healthy dash of citrus and a flowery finish with no cloying flavors it really is a good all around tea for any time of the day Buying it on Amazon saves a lot of time trying to find it in stock and it arrived faster than the books I ordered at the same time 
Great Product Fast Delivery This is a great product and was better then I expected I needed a large quantity and working through Amazon was great I was a little disappointed in the packaging because the box was basically open due to poorly placed tape But being able to track the package was great 
I love this tea This tea really does help with stress I just sort of takes the edge off I have been drinking it for years and was very happy to find it at a good price on amazon 
Delicious Yes May Help With Stress Relief This Kava Stress Relief Tea from Yogi Tea is for anxiety relief It s an unusual tea slightly sweet it contains stevia and very carob y The good news is that it does not have any of the usual kava taste or smell that many people find offensive The bad news is that I can t feel any of the anxiety relief effects of the tea although it does say that there are 78mg of kava root extract in the tea Still it s a lovely cup of tea and relaxing because it just tastes good I can also taste the spiciness of the tea which is very pleasant I usually brew two bags in one cup which is recommended on the package for a stronger and more relaxing effect however I even tried four bags once but still didn t notice a relaxing effect I am familiar with kava and the overall effect of kava is pretty subtle anyway so this is something to be aware of Your experience of the tea may be different Kava Stress Relief Tea comes with an expiration date a good thing because it s not full of preservatives plus you can tell if it is fresh and has many organic ingredients The ingredients in Kava Stress Relief Tea are kava root extract carob pod Indian sarsaparilla root organic cinnamon bark organic ginger root organic cardamom seed stevia leaf barley malt natural hazelnut flavor natural cinnamon flavor and natural licorice flavor Amazingly I can taste many of these in this lovely and complex cup of tea I would rate the taste five stars for flavor and uniqueness Yogi Tea seems to be another company like Numi Aspen Traditional Medicinals that values sustainable and healthy practices Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed with info about each tea they make Their tea bag tags have metaphysical sayings on them like Your breath is the voice of your soul and Your head must bow to your heart Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea s benefits Kava Stress Relief tea helps you calm down as it relieves stress anxiety and minor pain as well as lending gentle support to the digestion and the kidneys A member of the peppercorn family Kava Piper methysticum is a highly prized medicinal and beverage plant whose primary benefit is alleviating anxiety Kava kava native to Oceania and the South Pacific Islands has been used and cultivated for its ability to calm the body and mind and encourage a good night s sleep A powerful antispasmodic this herb promotes a state of relaxed unconcern while compromising neither mental functions nor clarity of thought when used appropriately Furthermore Kava has been shown to relax the uterus and relieve menstrual cramps and minor menopausal symptoms The Herb Research Foundation 2000 indicates that scientific data supports the use of kava for minor anxiety stress restlessness muscle tension and mild pain For added flavor our formula has been complemented with Stevia Sarsaparilla and Organic Carob Enjoy a warm soothing cup of Kava Stress Relief a delicious way to relax In addition to the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease there is a warning on the box Ask a healthcare professional before use if you have or have had liver problems frequently use alcoholic beverages or are taking any medication Stop use and see a doctor if you develop symptoms that may signal liver problems e g unexplained fatigue abdominal pain loss of appetite fever vomiting dark urine pale stools yellow eyes or skin Not for use by persons under 18 years of age or by pregnant or breastfeeding women Not for use with alcoholic beverages Excessive use or use with products that cause drowsiness may impair your ability to operate a vehicle or heavy equipment Note that the media scare about kava several years ago was not for the kava root and it is my opinion that based on my own research that kava is very safe However I am not a physician and if you have any health concerns you should check with an appropriate professional I decided to give Kava Stress Relief Tea four stars since it didn t really work for me Still it is a wonderful and recommended tea and may work for you 
Cool Brew Iced Tea is very similar to raspberry teas found at your favorite eateries We found it necessary to drink with our sweetener A refreshing drink but has a slight after taste to it maybe making this tea in large quantity is what did it 4 qts I would have rated a 5 but taste was a little off 
doesn t get easier than this Economical way to purchase a cold brew tea that has natural flavoring Easy to make and tastes great No guilt with this drink 
Feedback These teas both the raspberry and the blueberry are priced lower than in the grocery store 3 49 per individual box where they are usually a seasonal item This is frustrating since my husband and I are hooked on them and probably brew and drink a full pitcher per day They are the best tasting cold ice teas and great for the antioxidant benefits This seller shipped them promptly and they were very well packed We will be a repeat buyer for sure A+ 
Yummy I really like this cereal by Nature s Path It is very good and tasty However I just found a new favorite which is the Zen version with Cranberries and Ginger I highly recommend both of them though The Optimum has more fiber and has a completely different taste then the Zen so if you need to change it up go for this one too 
Top notch healthy cereal This Optimum Power breakfast cereal contains wheat oats barley soy flaxseeds and something Nature s Path calls Kamut which look like puffed oats Also there are freeze dried blueberries a few anyway and a delightful subtle cinnamon flavor hits you The ingredient list contains a few other things that are probably good for you Now the third ingredient in the 16 ingredient list and these lists are supposed to be in order according to percentage with the largest first is something called organic evaporated cane juice Now what is that but organic sugar This probably accounts for the cereal being somewhat sweet as another reviewer noted But it is nowhere near as sweet as those tooth decaying empty caloried mass marketed cereals most Americans are feeding their children No this cereal is well within the tolerance of us granolas who don t dowse everything with sugar ketchup and supermarket mayonnaise No I don t mean on cereal Just making a point So when you pour this out of the box you see a lot of extruded elongated brown rod shaped thingies quite a few healthy looking chubby flakes some of those exploded oat looking morsels that are probably the Kamuts and here and there a desiccated blueberry Gawd when I get started writing like this I can t stop I just get more so Better not review anything else tonight You ll never want to eat this Actually my description of the thingies could have been far more graphic and devilish You ll see Please do try this cereal you ll like the heartiness the cinnamoniness new word and the relatively light sweetness I did give it five stars didn t I 
Wonderful Filling Cereal I love this cereal It is the greatest and looks like Amazon offers the best price I like to add frozen wild blueberries to it with milk YUM 
nice and mild just a hint of fruitiness the white tea isn t as bold as green but equally as or better for you 
Excellent Tea Don t mind the reviewer saying it tastes nasty It s quite good and as with any tea you can brew it as light as you want I don t think this tea is too strong at all I brew it with the hottest water I can for as long as I can It s a very healthy tasty beneficial tea Highly recommended 
Yum I am a true fan of all things ginger and this tea is wonderful Very warming and spicy 
My favorite bar High in protein low in calories and great flavor I split them in half and eat the first portion as a mid morning snack and the second portion as an afternoon snack They keep me feeling full and prevent me from eating junk food which has been great for my waistline I can t say enough good things about Kashi 
yummy and healthy they re a quick fix and they taste incredible best protein bar around 
Awesome protein bar great taste and very satisfying I love Kashi stuff and this bar is no exception There have just a great taste not too sweet no funny aftertaste and very satisfying when eaten between meals Highly recommended 
Very Good Tastes too good to actually be healthy Sound too good to be true I thought so but it is really true Nice job Kashi If you have never eaten Kashi products you are in for a treat There are some I like better than others but for food that is good for you it is a pleasant surprise 
I love these cookies I m on no wheat dairy or sugar diet restrictions and this is my treat that I really look forward to sometimes every day Thank you Nana s And the price is great from Amazon 
Yummy and healthy These are the only cookies I have found that I can safely eat without feeling poorly afterwards and which taste similar to a real chocolate chip cookie I try to limit refined sugars wheat flour and dairy products in my diet for health reasons but oh how I miss cookies The ones I bake myself just don t taste that great but these chocolate chip cookies from Nana s help me keep to my prescribed way of eating I don t know what I d do without them I like to freeze them and sometimes I top one with a bit of Rice Dream ice cream on top Yummy 
Healthy and tastes good We love this cereal it is nice and crunchy and it doesn t leave you hungry for another bowl like the over processed cereals in boxes I definately will buy this again 
These cookies are great I ordered these Lorna Doone 100 calorie cookies from amazon because they can not keep them on the shelves at any grocery store around my area I even called a friend 45 miles away and he couldnt find them either You should try them They taste great without the extra junk in them My kids love them 2 
Good tasty snack The dried berries arrived promptly and in good condition We thought they were moist and tasty 
Stoneridge berries I found a package of these berries first at Costco in Arvada Colorado and found these to be the BEST dried fruit I ve ever had I ve since requested at my local Costco Honolulu Hawaii that they carry these and I keep waiting and waiting I was thrilled to find these on the Amazon website and ordered four bags right away Thank you for carrying it 
Delicious This is a dream Quick brew _and_ blueberry It s slightly slower brewing than plain Lipton quick brew tea but it does brew up in about three minutes It s definitely blueberry flavored and it s a little red in color For we impatient flavored tea lovers this is a great product 
Cool brew Blueberry tea This is one of the best tasting teas I have used Keeps well in the refrigerator for two days retaining its excellent flavor I reccommend this tea to everyone and have shared with many family and friends 
GREAT PRODUCT THESE ARE VERY GOOD BISCOTTI I VE ORDERED 4 BOXES OF 12 IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS THEY WERE NICE TO GIVE AS GIFTS THEY WERE GOOD TO BRING TO SOMEONES HOUSE FOR DESSERT THE CHOCOLATE DECADENCE AND THE ONES WITH THE TOFFEE BITS AND ALMONDS ARE VERY GOOD THE ONLY NEGATIVE IS THE SHIPPING AND HANDLING COST IF I DID NOT GET THE FREE SHIPPING AND HANDLING I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED THEM THEY RE GOOD BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO SPEND AN EXTRA 20 TO DELIVER 
Great biscotti I was looking for a crispy crunchy not too sweet flavorful biscotti This prduct certainlyn fills the bill 
Twinings Orange Pekoe Twinings Orange Pekoe tea is a delightful smooth tea It delivers a pleasing cup of tea without acid harshnest Yet it is full of flavor and rich amber color A good choice in the evening or anytime you want to pamper yourself with pleasure It s a tea to be savored 
Delicious they may look like the Ritz kind but are far better Love these as a snack when the day wears on great quality and taste 
Forget the Politics Forget the Earth Just Eat Green is good of course But what s much better than green are these truly awesome cookies PN Os beat the bootie out of any Oreo variation crunchier more filling without being smarmy much better taste And this goes for the mint the vanilla and the chocolate Fast Eddie Felson I love you 
Dip them in chocolate and wow your friends These cookies are superb all by themselves Far superior to that other sandwich cookie in every way But if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence melt some Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Chips in your double boiler and dip these cookies then remove to a rack to dry Your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store and beg you for more Keep out of reach of children 
High Sodium Tasty Cookies These high sodium ginger cookies are too tasty to have around you ll easily surpass your RDA of sodium in one sitting The nutrition facts that Amazon neglected to post are Serving size is 2 cookies 28 g Each serving has 160 mg of sodium 4 5 mg of fat 2 g saturated 0 g transfat 19 g of total carbs 10 g sugars and 0 g of cholesterol The ingredients in these Made in U S A cookies are organic unbleached wheat flour powdered sugar organic palm fruit oil organic molasses organic sugar sodium bicarbonate leavening ground ginger soy lecithin an emulsifier salt monocalcium phosphate leavening and nutmeg There are no hydrogentated oils or trans fats On the back of the package is an Ode to Ginger O s which reads You might m lady tweak my nose You could m lord step on my toes But Heaven help those poor bozos who try to filch my Ginger O s Again these high sodium cookies taste too good in order to effectively exercise self discipline to limit the quantity eaten 
So Much Better than those O s My children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream These are a bit softer than the O s we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat = We purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too YUMMY 
Best chips on the market How often do you eat a parsnip Well I don t make the opportunity very often so I m thrilled to see parsnips in my fancy black snack chip bag Vastly superior to corn or standard potato chips No trans fats Colorful too Delicious dipped in hummus Made by a division of Hain for you health food business knowledge nuts 
Rhoda These are a great deal Cost 2 75 per box they are 3 99 per box at our local grocery store They are also very tasty and a healthy snack Our whole family loves them I worried about buying a case just seemed like a lot but they are going fast and if you are box top saving people there is one on every box So they are good for schools too 
full flavor decaf For rich deep flavor without tasting burned or smelling like chemicals these beans can t be beat nor can the Pura Vida company s mission Look into it 
mcdickson This is a great tasting coffee I highly recommend it as it is shade grown and fair trade certified 
Good Nuts Bad Amazon Normally delicious product but Amazon sent an expired batch the second time I ordered this item That was not the only time I received old expired or damaged batches from Amazon Grocery I really hesitate to do business with Amazon you just never know what you will actually get 
Unlike anything I have been a fan of jack links turkey jerky for about 5 years now ever since I first tried it All time favorite snack Only Jack Links brand any other kind of turkey jerkey I have tried has been blah to say the least Highly recomend Ohh skip there ham jerkey and a1 sauce new products though eek 
Pretty healthy but not a low sugar product Now one of the reviewers of this product complained about the sugar content of this cereal by only looking at the ingredients list which is not how to determine the nutritional value of any product especially when the reviewer cannot distinguish between nutritive and non nutritive ingredients This cereal has just as many simple sugars as Frosted Flakes but the cereal does not claim to be low in sugar What s important about this cereal is that it offers quite a bit of fiber and vitamins minerals not as much as some cereals but since I have no deficiencies in this area I didn t mind Also it only has 3 times the salt of a half cup of milk which is not LOADED A can of healthy choice soup now that is loaded with salt Now I chose this cereal as a replacement for Frosted Flakes Honey Nut Cheerios which against my better judgment I continued to have every morning I should point out that I don t drink coffee in the mornings and I don t drink soda less than 1 a week on average I also eat no sweets Simple sugars listed as just Sugars on the nutrition label seem to be treated like carcinogens while most people don t realize that aspartame artificial sweetener in most diet sodas really is one If your diet is already low in sugar and you feel confident you can burn through those sugars pretty quick since I don t drink caffeinated drinks I need that jolt in the morning then this is a good choice If your diet already has quite a bit of sugar or your doctor tells you to cut down on simple sugars or you also have a couple of cups of caffeinated coffee with sugar every morning then go with another bran cereal without the oat clusters and syrups which I really do not like that much Also if you are concerned about the total carbs please note that a normal 2000 calories diet would include about 300g of carbohydrates so yes high protein diets contradict this Since taste is completely subjective I won t put much emphasis on it In my opinion it tastes pretty good but I don t consume many sweets during the day 
wonderful My kids love these I don t mind the figs are the only part that are organic My kids will only eat these and not the other brand 
Delicious I m not exactly sure how good these are for you but I do know they taste great I bought these because I never have time for breakfast in the morning and I m also sort of a choco holic and these with coffee or better yet hot chocolate are excellent 
An Acceptable Meal Replacement For flavor I could give these cookies a 5 but the health aspects demand that they only rate a 4 All told they taste great and are the best on the go lunch I have found for hubby he often eats on the run The price is right and it keeps him from cruising though the nearest drive though 
Good on the go product These should not be confused with dessert As the name states these are a breakfast cookie originally developed for people in a hurry who do not stop for a cooked meal This variety has chocolate chunks but is not a chocolate cookie Other varieties are available Cookie varieties are based on the original recipe They are available in the full 3 ounce size or as mini cookies They have a good nutritional balance They do have an expiration date Like all bakery products they do not stay fresh forever As other reviewers have warned you need to check the expiration date especially if you are not buying them direct from the bakery Day old bread is also sold at bargain prices but you get day old bread I found that the fresh cookies are yummy and they do fill you up I would recommend them for your travel bags better than airline food which has often been reduced to yucky box lunches for your desk drawer if you get busy and have to skip lunch or for a convenient trail food if you are hiking I used the Rocky Road variety seasonal special in Christmas stockings and the pumpkin variety seasonal special in Halloween bags 
Fills you up all morning These things are great I love Baker s Breakfast cookies This flavor is pretty darn good too big chunks of chocolate and lots of flavor Doesn t taste fake at all I prefer a couple other flavors more but this is definately a winner These cookies taste like a treat but are really healthy for you They will fill you up for hours especially with a glass of water juice or milk to wash it down 
Great With Coffee These cookies are a nice break from the run of the mill granola bar Based on oatmeal not too sweet filling Great value I would purchase again 
Nice soothing tasty This is a nice tea Not bitter I don t need any honey or sweetner at all I ll be getting more of this for sure 
Very Good and Oh So Easy Without a doubt this is the easiest buttermilk buscuit mix I ve ever used Super simple super fast You won t be sorry you bought this 
Good K Cup Coffee on the darker side I recently decided to give these Diedrich K Cups a whirl For years I ve been a dedicated Green Mountain Coffee Roaster customer and their K Cup varieties are excellent however even at their Cafe Express discount rate their coffees are more expensive by several dollars per 25 count pack than the current price Amazon is offering on Diedrich blends I d been traveling in Southern California a few months ago and tried some Diedrich coffees then Although the coffees I tried tended to exhibit the Starbucks West Coast tendency to roast beans too darkly to the point of effacing some of the original regional characteristics of the beans they are fine for dark roasts and preferable to what I ve had from Starbucks Coupled with the Keurig brewer this makes for a decent cup of medium to dark West Coast style coffee 
Excellent Excellent Excellent My mother absolutely loves this tea it s the only kind she will use I received a container of it in a gift basket and called bentley to find out where I could purchase more and they told me they don t sell to the public My mom was very upset I then went on to Amazon which was great for all my christmas shopping who put me in touch with bently so My mother had a wonderful christmas 
perfect what other food is 120 calories only 25 from fat and 5 grams of fiber or 20 of your daily value an IDEAL breakfast or snack just one fills you up a lot and i must stress that they are DELICIOUS 
A delicious high in fiber cereal bar These cereal bars by Kellogg s are the best Well actually at first I wasn t that sure It s rare to see a cereal bar on the grocery shelf that actually has 20 of your daily requirement for fiber in just one bar I was very impressed by that claim and so I brought a box home to try it out These cereal bars are tasty and quite easy to chew on when you re in need of a quick breakfast or snack that has some health quality to it They aren t that expensive either Moreover there are no trans fats although there is a very very slight amount of partially hydrogenated oils in the bar These cereal bars contain some vitamins too which is always a plus However one caveat be careful if you have any allergies to wheat soy milk and or almonds Stay away unless your doctor tells you it s OK to have this food Highly recommended Enjoy SMILES 
Tastes Great I don t like plain coffee but even more I don t need or like all the calories and fat that come with using flavored coffee creamers Even the sugar free creamers have a ton of fat part of which is hydrogenated partially hydrogenated Flavor Blends for coffee are a wonderful alternative to fatty creamers Easy to use and they come in portable small packages you can take with you anywhere This is not a creamer but more a flavored sugar One packet gives a yummy subtle hazelnut flavor but without being too sweet the way some things with Splenda are 
Nothing but the best for the Troops My mom first sent my husband a box in his care package he is stationed North of Baghdad Iraq and it was the best thing he had ever received Being in the Army for 24 years he has had his share of bad coffee but he doesn t have to have wake up to that anymore I sent him another six boxes of the Hazelnut Mocha and French Vanilla He says the Hazelnut is his but he shares the rest It is a big hit with his unit and all have commented on the AWESOME taste and that the Army coffee is significantly improved We won t allow him to run out a box or two are added to every care package my mom and I send Nothing but the best for the Troops 
Mocha is best This is a pretty good Splenda flavor but the Mocha is best in my opinion The French Vanilla is a second favorite Hazelnut is better than no flavor at all I use one flavored packet and one regular Splenda packet in a large 14 oz mug and it s perfect Not necessary to use two flavored ones as it is a little pricey and one has enough flavor for an entire travel mug 
unusual but delicious blend Ever since I have tried this productI eat some everyday It is the perfect blend of savory tangy sweet and a touch spicy I know that sounds like a weird combo but its sooo good addicting even I initially bought this prouct at a local natural and whole foods store but amazon com has the lowest price I ve seen anywhere and u cant beat free shipping It s so conveniant I have ordered this product from amazon several times and I must mention one order contained multiple expired items that were definitely stale tasting so I let customer service know and they immediately responded and very pleasantly resolved the matter to my satisfaction I do suggest the multiple 12 2 oz multiple pack only because this blend is so yummy portion control is helpful 
My family loves these as a side dish When I am short of time and want a fast side dish I make these and my family loves them When I don t have time to peel dice boil potatoes these save the day Teens can prepare them with ease too We like all varieties and they taste great 
Great flavor These are the best banana chips I ve ever had and the dried cherries are a great combination I would highly recommend this product 
Can t get enough I orginally bought this for my youngest daughter who loves this product Soon after my husband was hooked and has been eating it for breakfast every morning since Another great deal on Amazon We buy it regularl 
Wonderful taste and variety My local Sam s Club discontinued the Nature s Path maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal due to lack of sales I was bummed and did not want to resort to the highly processed Quaker instants ick Not to mention I m tired of all the junk ingredients in mainstream food nowadays Then I remembered Amazon selling a lot of easily shippable bulk foods including organics The Nature s Path oatmeal absorbs water much better and the texture is heartier than other leading brands It is also very flavorful The variety pack is nice since I used to tire of the Sam s Club selection of maple and brown sugar only My kids love steel cut oats with a little pure maple syrup but it s not the most convenient breakfast food The Nature s Path instant oatmeal is quick and easy during the busy weekday mornings And best of all I can understand the ingredients label without having to take a chemistry refresher class I m very satisfied with my first organic purchase from Amazon We now peruse the selection of organic foods on Amazon before making local purchases 
Organic steel cut oats instantly Most grocery store variety oatmeals have fillers and are from the rolled oats variety The best tasting and most nutritious oatmeal comes from steel cut oats but it is a chore to cook You have to cook it very slowly and watch it carefully as it will easily boil over all over the place I was astounded to find instant organic steel cut oats at my local Costco You simply open a packet into a bowl add boiling water from your kettle or microwave and stir There are many flavors to suit your moods All of them are delicious in my opinion Try this and you will agree My Costco stopped carrying this brand so I found it here on Amazon Apparently there were many requests at Costco and they have now decided to again carry this brand It is cheaper at my Costco 8 35 for 32 packets and 53 6 ounces You can t beat this for a quick breakfast 
Wonderful This tastes and looks like the real thing wheat semolina My kids can t tell the difference I m not wasting my time sampling all of the others now 
Great product These are great Take a little longer to cook than wheat spaghetti and you must strain them but other than that you cant tell any difference 
Great for gifts and good for me I liked this so much I gave some as gifts to friends before I polished it all off I am better able to stick with reasonable and healthy portions at my evening meal if I can look forward to a little treat later in the evening I serve it in a small cup that will hold a third of a box Satisfying AND healthy what a deal 
Good but not the best I tried most of Jack Links products I will classified this one as good but I personally prefer beef nuggets since it tasted juicier 
Yummy These DO taste almost like the biscuits at Red Lobster They are so easy to make and so delicious I have a muffin maker and they cook perfectly in about 10 minutes 
Great Bargain if you drink a lot of tea We bought this bulk box because we drink a lot of tea it s a great bargain if you re a tea drinker 
TwiningsEarl Grey Tea This is mine and my husbands favorite tea It has such a smooth satisfying taste We have tried about all the Earl grey Teas and this is the best We can t always find it So when I found it on Amazon I was elated Being able to buy it in the 50 count boxes pack of 6 was just what we were looking for And we will continue to buy it here Thanks Amazon 
Convenient and Reasonably Priced These Colombian D Ordado pods work well in my Krups Home Cafe machine The overall flavor is good I do like my coffee a little stronger so I use 2 of these pods and the two 6 ounce cup setting for a nice big mug of morning coffee 
Good Product This is a very good value I use it to put in many Asian recipes instead of chicken or vegetable broth The result is a more authentic Asian taste to my recipes 
Spicy and good We ordered 4 jars and love it It has great flavor and is on the spicy side It is easily frozen in the plastic containers The 20 oz size is just about perfect for our family of 5 
Before ordering I ordered this sauce which is very good and VERY spicy The only drawback is that when I opened the package one jar had cracked and leaked a real mess Amazon sent a replacement and the same thing happened because they were not shrink wrapped first They were loose in the box with just some bubble wrap 
Spicy Sauce for your Favorite Meals Typical of central Italy this sauce has the characteristic of being hot after all Arrabbiata means mad in Italian Although tolerance to spiciness is very subjective this sauce will not overwhelm your palate Enjoy this beautiful blend of flavors the freshness of parsley a hint of hand picked organic marjoram and the madness of the habanero Recipe suggestions Excellent as a dip for shrimp or chips spicy and delicious over tacos quesadillas or any Mexican dish Unexpectedly delicious over chicken cutlet or poached fish grilled vegetables au gratin or saut�ed portabella mushroom We ve also added it to a seafood bouillabaisse for a fantastic dinner party idea 
Annie s is worth the extra I love this mac cheese It has all of the comfort food aspects of easy mac warm and gooey orange cheese but without that vague chemical aftertaste It tastes so cheddar cheesey and is wonderful to keep on hand for those days when there is just NO food in the fridge you don t even need to add milk to this My favorite comfort food when I m sick 
Best Mac n Cheese from a box EVER Annie s Homegrown Deluxe Shells Real Aged Wisconsin Cheddar is the best mac n cheese straight out of the box I ever tasted Kids and grown ups agree A note to the other reviewers don t try to ruin my mac n cheese comfort food experience with your cardboard tastin whole wheat pasta and no salt sauce If you re so inclined to have it just how you would make it go ahead and make your own It s just mac n cheese after all 
The best mac and cheese on the market My children and I agree this is the best tasting mac and cheese on the market This is a great price too about 1 30 a box less than I usually pay When kids are eating several boxes a week that adds up quickly I do agree with the other reviewer about the ways this mac and cheese could be even closer to perfection But I have one child who is very careful about what she will and will not eat and for her this product is a gift Highly recommended 
beautiful Beautiful and easy to use The grater stays sharp after many uses and guests always ask about it I wish it came with a dish to put the salts in It would make a great gift if it came with a decorative dish 
Cherry These cherries are large and plump and may need to be chopped for your recipe 
Stoneridge Dried Cherries Shipping was fast and cherries were great The best dried cherries we have bought 
These taste great I do not understand the bad reviews of this product They smelled great had a nice texture and tasted like a dried cherry should They did not clump at all like many dried fruits out there do They also DID NOT taste like cardboard or were dried like NASA space food like some of the dried fruit out there does I use these in my tea I chop them up and toss in my vanilla ice cream and I eat them straight out of the bag These are the best dried cherries I have ever eaten 
Great deal The price was great it arrived quickly and it was exactly what I ordered Great deal and great service 
Pepper rific This is an all time favorite tea of mine I spend hundreds of dollars a year on tea and this tea really hits the spot in my favorite top ten list of teas The only downfall about this tea is that it is not made with strings I like to have strings on my bags of tea But no matter what this is the best peppermint tea i ve ever drank Celestial Seasonings is a great brand This tea will smell up your kitchen with a lovely invigorating scent Perfect for the mornings I also use this tea when my stomach is upset if my joints are sore to help with cramps and to help with gas Peppermint is a natural reliever for IBS especially if you have the flu or a bad cold peppermint tea really seems to bring up your spirits and relieve stomach irritations 
Refreshing and wholesome This is Celestial Seasonings at their best a plump bag of fresh tasty peppermint leaf which brews up to a clean delicious cup of tea Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet clean taste Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea Peppermint combats flatulence promotes bile flow and digestive juices and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging they utilize 100 natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don t package each tea bag individually Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface 
Earl Grey I am a devoted Earl Grey tea drinker and have enjoyed Earl Grey tea all over the world Ahmad Tea has been my favorite for years I m so pleased to be able to obtain it through Amazon I used to have to carry it by the suitcaseful back from London to stock up 
Great Tea I bought select items to include with other items in gift bags for Christmas The Ahmad selection teas make two excellent cups per bag Everyone receiving the tea commented on the fine quality of the product Highly Recommended 
nice tasting sugar alternative I use this mostly in my coffee and tea and find that it adds a kind of sweetness that I enjoy I ve had others try it and some have liked it as much as I do and others said it wasn t for them I remember reading years ago that Stevia has a slight licorice taste to it but I don t detect any of that sort of taste at all My online research leads me to believe that that might have something to do with inulin fiber FOS thats also a part of this sweetener I tried Splenda and didn t like it Everyone s tastes and body chemistry are different but if you re looking to reduce the amount of sugar in your diet without feeling like you are suffering for it then give this a try 
Great Price I had been using SweetLeaf before buying it at the local super market health food section Buying here is around a 50 savings This product works so great at sweetening with no better after taste I just love that it is a natural product 
Best thing next to sugar I ve been using SweetLeaf SteviaPlus for about 3 weeks now and I m so glad I decided to try it I was worried about the research coming out about aspartame and Splenda well it just does terrible things to my stomach I simply can t use it So I started doing some web searching and learned about stevia I liked the fact that it was natural and used extensively in other countries such as Japan But I still kept my expectations low it sounded too good to be true and I figured it would taste awful I ordered SweetLeaf SteviaPlus and to my surprise and delight I love the taste It s sweet and no bitterness Now I m a person who is used to using artificial sweeteners so someone who uses only sugar might have a different opinion but I did share it with a coworker to use in his tea and he really liked it as well So don t be afraid to try it if you haven t already I notice that I m feeling a lot better lately Maybe it s the switch from artificial sweeteners to stevia At any rate I m happy with it and I recently placed another order for both packets and tablets 
Body basics A delicious nutritious cereal that rebounds energy at breakfast or for a quick snack Very vegan and very good 
A tea I will NEVER be without Twinings was founded in London England in 1706 and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas The history of Darjeeling tea goes back to the 1840s when Dr Campbell a civil engineer planted tea seeds in his garden at Beechwood Darjeeling The result was a nice light tea with excellent color and aroma Darjeeling tea gained a considerable following and is now highly prized as the champagne of teas OK let s get down to brass tacks this is an excellent tea produced by a great company and a tea I will NEVER be without The tea has an excellent aroma and flavor and is harder to over steep than some other teas that I have known Also something of a surprise is the fact that this tea tastes at least as good iced as it does hot As such year round you will find me making Twinings Darjeeling tea So here s the bottom line if you want a tea that is excellent hot AND cold then Darjeeling is for you If you want tea from a great tea producer then Twinings is for you If you want the best tea in the world then buy Twinings Darjeeling tea 
Delicious smooth coffee This is a deliciously smooth tasting coffee Rich flavor and no acid stomach I ve had a hard time getting it locally and Amazon has saved me 
Best Microwave Popcorn This is the only type of microwave popcorn we buy It tastes like a high quality popcorn My husband I love the flavor 
Awesome Snack If you are ever in the mood for summer sausage but don t feel like cutting a piece off of a large log these are the ticket They have a great taste and are the perfect the snack Highly recommended 
Excellent Balance For those of you who like the addition of briny olives and capers to your sauce here is the answer What a great balance of flavors and a quick and easy yet delicious dinner alternative 
The Oliver Lover s Sauce Adding another Italian classic to our product line Puttanesca comes from the expression puttanaio which to put it modestly translates into a lot of things going on at the same time The rich combination of flavors garlic black olives capers and fresh herbs come from the tradition of southern regional cooking Recipe suggestions Use it over pasta or to add some spice to chicken fish or your relationship just heat and serve or bake it in Try mixing it in with scrambled eggs rolled in pita bread for a brunch alternative The favorite Grill or pan sear swordfish and pour it on 
Tastes great This pasta is very good It works great in salads casseroles or regular pasta dishes I ve only been gluten free for a few months and I think this tastes very similar to wheat pasta Granted I ve only tried one other kind of gluten free pasta made all of brown rice but this pasta is FAR better and I like it enough that I feel no need to keep shopping around and trying other kinds 
excellent coffee excellent coffee good value plus you are aiding the growers which is a big plus 
Gum drop delicious Dried Fruit The point of debate here is dried fruit These are delicious I ate many many handfuls each serving Their more like gum drops because of the sugar added by infusion I m suprised that the oil does not factor into the flavor at all Not a typical dried fruit HIGHLY RECCOMENDED 
WOW real raspberries These things are so delicious I think that we have gone through 2 bags already Put them in your cereal ice cream yogart and any other place you can think of I keep a bay by my bedside for those nite time muchies 
Absolutely Fantastic Oh my good god These are quite possibly the most delicious things I have ever eaten In my life I came across these raspberries last year at a Costco here in SoCal and then to my dismay they recently stopped carrying them I ve since been searching EVERYWHERE and I am THRILLED to finally find them here No other brand of dried fruit can compare Their blueberries and cherries are also excellent and I usually don t care for either Highly highly HIGHLY recommended 
Solid but high in fat Wished I had read the nutritional facts before I bought this as 100 120 calories per serving are fat 5 serving to a jar therefore 500 calories of fat in one 20 ounce jar Ouch Good thing I work out as I can afford that from time to time Having said that this does taste pretty good although I have had better when I have eaten out at good cafes Taste is 4 stars for me I paired this with canned sockeye salmon and rotini and it made for a quick and good meal Note that the sauce is pinker in color than the picture on my monitor Overall good enough to make me want to try some on their other mixtures Edit Forced to update this as I later discovered one of the jars had developed a hairline crack and started leaking in storage This makes the 3rd order of products from this company that has developed leaking problems I won t purchase this company s products again not because of the taste but because of the leakage issues 
Amazing This sauce is so delicious It s full of good ingredients and has a great shelf life My husband and I can t get enough of this sauce 
Yummy sauce I recently used it over a few smoked sable fillets tasty We also like the Marinara So versatile flavorful and convenient 
A neccesary part of your kitchen cupboard What a great line of sauces the Scarpetta brand brings to the table I have tried all of them and the time saving of having these already in my kitchen is very helpful I am able to put a what seems to be a different slow cooked italian meal on the table each night in just minutes The flavor profile of each of the Scarpetta brands is unique and tastes truly homemade You can feel the love that went onto each sauce Try them you won t regret it 
A relief First I d like to say that many of Nana s cookies are most delicious and I ve tried most of the flavors My favorites tend to be this one and the chocolate coconut chip As one of the other reviewers pointed out you have to have a particular palate to enjoy this type of cookie For those of use that try to limit our processed cane sugar intake or have particular dietary restrictions vegan sugar substitutes etc these are really delicious and allow a taste of that bad for you diet that we ve been led to believe we want Thanks Nana s for the natural foodie options 
If you have multiple food allergies these cookies are awesome The chocolate crunch is my favorite of the gluten free Nana s cookies though the lemon is pretty good too I have a feeling the person who gave these 1 star is someone who can eat a freakin cinnabon if she wants to For those of us who have dietary restrictions it s a different story It does take a while to get used to gluten free fare but these cookies are among the best I ve had which is pretty impressive since they don t even have sugar in them And the fact that they don t have gluten eggs nuts or dairy in them either is wonderful yes there are those of us out there allergic to all these things I just wish more stores carried them But now that I ve found them on Amazon I ll be ordering in bulk 
My kids love to eat fruit from Just Tomatoes I used to have a hard time getting my kids to eat fruit until we tried the Just Tomatoes products Now I have a hard time getting them not to eat the whole tub in one sitting To have a picky eater eat all the fruits from this company is amazing to me I love them too great for a quick low calorie healthy snack 
What a treat Our dog loves these treats and we love how good they are for him Amazon has also been the best deal we ve gotten for them Petsmart Petco are a lot more expensive and don t have all the flavor choices 
Great treats for Vegetarian Vegan dogs These are great our vegan Golden Retriever seems to love them and is very healthy the cows pigs chicks are pretty darn happy she s eating veggie treats the treats are organic and Newman s donates the profits to charities Now that s a win win win win I only gave them 4 stars since the bags are so small and cause a lot of packaging waste which Newman s should be well aware of why should we have to buy 6 packs of 10 oz bags instead of 30 oz or 60 oz bags When that s resolved they re getting 5 stars from me 
natural dog treats Excellent Our dogs love them We have small dogs so the size is perfect Little hearts for little dog 
Great stuff My little cockapoo loves Newman s Own dog treats especially the peanut butter flavor She ll usually eat anything but I feel better about giving her treats that are healthy organic and made with high quality ingredients that I could eat No by products here Great price highly recommended 
My dogs love em My husband and I like to buy Newman s products We love their cookies so we thought our dogs might like them too So we got these dog treats and the LOVE them They re even shaped like hearts They come with 6 bags so they ll last a while but they re packaged so they won t go stale 
Great for lamingtons This is the best tasting shredded = dessicated coconut I have found anywhere in the USA It is organic and sulfite free This is the unsweetened finely shredded very small pieces of dessicated coconut which is used in South East Asia Australia etc This is not the same product as American style coconut of which the most common type is Baker s sweetened angel flake coconut I like to buy finely shredded dessicated coconut because I often bake Australian British and European style cakes and cookies which do not work well when made with flake coconut I have also discovered that finely shredded coconut can be used to make your own coconut milk or coconut cream at home Flake coconut and dessicated coconut have a different taste and texture A cup of sweetened angel flake coconut has about 2 tablespoons of sugar added to it so it is very sweet compared to shredded dessicated coconut which has no added sugar at all The shredded dessicated coconut is drier and the pieces are very small compared to the flakes so it has more surface area Because of these two things 8oz of dessicated coconut will absorb more liquid than 8oz of flake coconut Some recipes will work quite well with either kind of coconut but others will not even if you compensate for the sugar and liquid Its better especially for baking to use whatever the recipe originally calls for The coconut I received from Amazon tasted very fresh and had a good use by date If you want to increase the shelf life of the coconut throw the bags into the freezer or the refrigerator They will keep there a year Once a bag is opened I always keep it in the refrigerator I don t like buying this kind of coconut from health food stores as it often comes in bulk bins and has been exposed to the air Unsweetened organic coconut can get stale or even develop a rancid taste if it is stored open to the air The sweetened flake coconut is much more stable because it contains preservatives and sugar If you are an Australian wanting to make things like lamingtons or coconut ice you need to use dessicated finely shredded cooconut Flake coconut will not give the right results Dessicated finely shredded coconut is also excellent for replicating those little coconut macaroon cookies that you find in many Chinese buffet restaurants Shredded dessicated coconut can be mixed with water to make your own coconut milk or coconut cream I find this is useful because I rarely use more than 1 2 a can when I cook with coconut milk curries soups laksa etc Sometimes I only want a spoonful or two to add a little flavor to a smoothie or a banana cake I have tried making coconut milk from flake coconut but for my taste it was way too sweet and did not have a good texture To make coconut milk from dessicated coconut Method 1 Put equal parts of coconut and hot water by weight into a blender eg 8oz coconut to 1 cup of hot water Whizz in the blender for a minute or two If desired you can strain and press it through a cloth or a fine sieve when it has cooled down This is not necessary for most recipes unless you require a silky smooth texture for the end product For a lighter coconut milk use 8oz of coconut to one and a half cups of water or you can use lite shredded coconut to start with Method 2 Simmer equal parts by weight of coconut with hot water until froth appears Do not boil Remove from heat and let it sit until it cools down If desired you can strain it through a cloth bag or a very fine sieve pressing out as much liquid as possible To make a thick coconut cream from dessicated coconut Use either method above but use 4 parts of coconut to one part of water I thought the price from Amazon was excellent especially for an organic product At the time of purchase it worked out at one dollar forty two cents per 8oz bag and in my case shipping was free I can t find organic dessicated coconut anywhere else at this price Overall I was very pleased with the taste freshness price and quality of this coconut I don t think that I will have any problems using up the 12 packets in one year especially as I won t be buying any cans of coconut milk 
organic coconut great for cooking really tasty and handy only drawback is having to order 12 but they keep try to split with a friend 
plenty aroma and flavor I use plenty of this product regularly when making ice cream cookies cakes etc I find that this product has a sort of natural sweetness or flavor on its own Because of this much less added sugar is needed in baked goodies and in some cases added sugar is eliminated To obtain this i use this organic unsweetened coconut in combination with organic whole milk 
Perfect snack These are the perfect snack for on the go Actual REAL fruit No sugar No roll ups with 10 fruit They are not dry or leathery and even little kids can chew them well Just the right size for toddlers and small kids and Moms too Great to stick in the diaper bag or purse for an impromptu healthy snack Works in any weather won t melt and even survives at the bottom of the purse Comes in lots of flavors an organic version and bigger bars too for a bigger snack Cheaper than lesser products at the grocery store GREAT 
Delicious Gift Basket Addition I used these to add to a Christmas Gift Basket filled with Special Cocoa Mix Spiced Tea Mix Fancy Jam Spread and three or four Scones for family and friends and unexpected company Everyone loved them and I had apackage or tow left for myself and they are delicious They are such a good value for the money and an exdciting addition for these gift boxes 
We Love Nonni s We just love Nonni s Biscotti products especially the limone It s always refreshing not too sweet not too tart Finding them on Amazon was exciting because we haven t found them locally since coming to Florida The product offered by Amazon was also a great bargain 
Just right This is a delicately flavored not too sweet treat Just the right thing for that mid morning coffe break and indivdully packaged for convenient transportation to work 
One Drawback The taste is OK but not great The one thing about this that is somewhat annoying is that it s a two serving packet which means that it makes 16 ounces for liquid I really only want to eat up 8 ounces at a time That means I have to guess how much is half and then roll up the bag to save the remaining portion Even if I did want to eat the entire packet I don t have a bowl that is 16 ounces and all my bowls are perfectly normal sized The bottom line here is that there is nothing wrong with the taste of the soup still I m not in love with it I just wish there was a better way of packaging I m the only one eating it and maybe that affects my opinion If you have more than one person in your family then it won t be a problem at all and you can ignore everything I ve said 
Not your regular instant soup This is a great alternative to chicken soup if you get sick It will alkalinize you blood and help to get better much faster than you would normally do Also try it in the morning instead of your regular cup of java it will perk you up without the jitters of caffeine True it has a lot of solium but this sodium is from sea salt that brings with it much needed trace minerals The seaweed veriety is the best Open minded and adventurous folks will love it right away for others it may take some time to get used to Do try Your body will thank you 
Its Great But package is a bit Beat up Looks like it got squashed a little and i guess somebody opened the package because i think there was supposed to be a seal there since this is new But I checked everything inside it counted all of the peices and everything was there I tried one and its great This is a good buy for what you get I just got a Damaged package but its not damaged that badly just the outside is a bit squased Overhaull 4 stars out of 5 I will buy here again Fast delivery Thank 
Yummy I received the correct item in a timely manner and it was organic My kids love them as do I I love finding healthy snacks that don t have any additives or junk in them 
Delicious and practical I even drink it when Im at home I carry a few in my make up case and when Im away from home and thirsty instead of buying a soda full of sugar I buy a bottle of water and add the small pack and ready a delicious low calorie sugar less drink And this flavor is specially delicious 
amazing tea I am a no coffee drink tea ALL the time person I have tried so many teas and am constantly interested in trying new ones This has to be the most wonderful green tea out there It is wonderful 
The Best Tasting Green Tea Ever I love this tea It is very refreshing and has a wonderful aroma It doesn t get bitter like other green teas Once I tried this green tea this was the only one for me 
Best Buy I am addicted to this green tea It has the smell of passion fruit I have to have at least 1 2 cups a day Great Buy Can t find it at all stores and it cost half the price on Amazon 
awesome these are my husbands favorite thing to eat thank you for making available at such a great discoun 
Great taste I recieved the variety pack today and tried this flavor first I buy natural snacks for my kids freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar but I find them bland So I ordered these and I love them In fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it it wasn t too spicy for her You can tell they used hot spices but they are very well done so as to not be too much The nuts are big and crunchy and the fruit is small and chewy There is about equal of both nuts and fruit They do use evaporated cane juice and organic tapioca syrup but these are healthier than alternatives and there are still only 5 grams of sugar per 1 4 cup serving 
Very salty The product if reviewed just on taste would only warrant a two but the convenience is worth a five It is probably the best La Briute product that I have found It is a two minute meal that is not completely objectionable but it is way too salty 
Not very chowdery Unlike the December 2006 review and much like the most recent reviews there s not much in this soup other than very small bits of seafood and some potato I m thinking that 1 the recent quality has gone downhill or 2 the December 2006 review was a plant Anyway the taste was okay but it definitely doesn t rate up there with Legal Seafood which I ve had at one of the restaurants and at the Boston airport both much better than this 
This is sooooo DELICIOUS I love soups and stews and I am in LOVE with this Seafood Chowder It s the absolute best flavor and chock full of a variety of seafood The taste is great I ve tried many many chowders and this ranks the highest of any I have ever eaten even Legal Seafood s or Wolfgang Puck s or several local Massachsetts seaside restaurants And it s all natural with no artificial ingredients I recommend this to everyone who loves seafood and chowders Of all the Baxter Soups and Chowders this is really the only one I recommend everyone try I repeat it s great It is a bit high in salt though 1 400 mg can but if this is the only salty food eaten all day it s OK Try it it s heavenly 
Sushi for Dummies This is the best home style sushi kit You get the basics excellent rice sushi wrap sheets soy sauce I made these added thin sliced cucumber smoked salmon in the rolls as I assembled them The best The possibilities are endless Try it you ll see Sometime I can be all thumbs but this was very easy the quality of the food was excellent 
Yummy if not actually sushi rice Quite tasty No flavorings in the rice but still a very nice light lunch Can be a bit messy for those of us who are not skilled sushi roll wrappers I was planning on making this a regular part of my pantry but see that the price has just gone up changing it from a good value to not enough food for the money If the price goes down I ll buy it again but not for 15 dollars a six pack 
Good for a quick cheap meal These are a definite time saver with a couple of faults which another reviewer pointed out no flavorings in the rice nori cut too small To get around the rice problem just add a little rice vinegar and sugar to the rice and it comes out quite good I don t particularly like wasabi but they should probably add a packet to the box for those who do The nori sheets taste good and fresh if maybe slightly salty for my tastes As stated before though they are definitely cut way too small You cannot achieve any kind of decent looking roll with them but if you aren t picky about what the finished product looks like and if you pack any added ingredients pretty thin you can get it to hold together long enough to eat it Bottom line is for the ten bucks I paid for 6 packages I d say it is a definite winner for 6 cheap fast lunches that taste much better than they look I can t eat one sushi roll at a local sushi bar for less than 8 to 10 bucks Now that the price for these has gone up a little I d probably consider just buying the larger size Annie Chun precooked sticky rice containers if Amazon gets them back in stock and providing my own full size nori sheets 
Great snacks to get you through to your next meal My children and I love this flavor and it really tastes like peanut butter 
Great Pretty good Solid peanut butter taste and no digestive problem I enjoyed them for hiking and biking I don t recommend them near water because when wet they taste not so good Good snack for kids when hungry and its better for them then sugarly things 
Great Lunchbox Travel Meal My husband loves Ensavor Garlic Chicken Stew He loves the taste the convenience and the fact that it is made for diabetics My husband is pre diabetic and is on a medically supervised diet for his condition He keeps Ensavor in his office for lunch in his briefcase for meals out with clients and takes it with him when he travels It s a great product 
great coffee I just finished up my first bag of this coffee it s great I normally buy Starbucks Breakfast Blend just so you know for comparisons purpose but I am switching to this brand It s just the perfect blend for me smooth but strong enough to wake me up 
A little bit different type of mini wheat When mini wheats first came out in the grocery store I tried them However I found they were bland It was like trying to eat sticks in milk Then came frosted mini wheats Okay I decided to give it a go Now I had sticks and sugar in milk However I did find out that if you forego the milk and just eat them straight from the box like potato chips they are excellent Now Kellogg s has added fruity flavors to the mini wheat THESE I CAN EAT IN MILK Yippee Finally I picked up the Strawberry Delight in bite size Even though I can eat them in milk I find that I still prefer just to eat them straight from the box like potato chips a type of chex mix or square wheat thin snack Each serving has 140 calories Compare that to other cereals and you ll see it is about 60 100 calories less No saturated fat No trans fat No cholesterol No sodium Total fat is only 0 5g according to the box I don t see how since zero and zero is well zero But I can live with 0 5g Here is the bad news the carbohydrates There are 35g of carbs here But that is about the same as all the other brands Diabetics may want to pass on this due to the 10g of sugar per serving And remember a single serving is about the size of HALF a base ball Not much So if you are just pouring cereal into a cereal bowl without measuring you are probably getting 2 or 3 servings in that one bowl All in all unless you are diabetic this mini wheat is terrific Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews 
Nice and crunchy If you like almonds and cruchy granola bars these bars are for you They are higher in fat than I would like them to be But they are delicious Great for a quick breakfast or snack There are 2 bars in each packett and I usually eat one for breakfast and then one later for a snack 
Oatmeal Club recommends I am the newest member of the lose informal office Oatmeal club I have introduced this Hot Cereal to many a members who are all hooked Those who love oatmeal are and hooked and those who HAD to eat oatmeal as a kid and now hate it love it It tastes great has great farro or barley like texture and it smells heavenly and gets the appetite going 
I love this stuff I discovered these a few months ago and now I eat them for breakfast everyday The nutrition info is good and so is the taste 
Versatile yummy GF mix I use this mix on a regular basis Both my daughter and I are gluten intolerant so we are always on the lookout for great tasting GF products This mix makes a great sugar cookie in fact when I brought some for a party at my daughter s school kids preferred my cookies to the other sugar cookies brought This also makes an excellent chocolate chip cookie 
A hit This makes a great cake or cupcakes I used a modification to make it a chocolate cake it was a hit and also baked them in little bear molds the kids loved them I have 3 little grandgirls and a daughter who are celiac and these mixes are the best thing to have in the house No one non celiac can tell the difference 
Absolutely delicious This broth tastes just like roast beef rich delicious and full of flavor Some may think it s a little salty so taste your food before seasoning with extra salt I m definitely going to buy more because it is so easy to turn into broth and takes up much less cupboard space than the boxes of stocks Excellent product 
Delicious nuts I bought these nuts for my wife as she likes hazelnuts She seems to love this brand and she snacks on these nuts very often My only complaint about these nuts is the price but then everything that is good costs money 
A staple of our kitchen We love this product We use it in granola and in making the best chocolate hazelnut bark ever 
It doesn t get much better Last weekend as a volunteer at Vegfest I had the absolute pleasure of getting to sample all three sauces For four hours I worked alongside the creator of these heavenly cooking sauces The wonderful thing about them is that they are not only delicious but are also so simply to use Recipes are on the sides of the jars and they allow you the freedom to choose your favorite foods I can t recommend them highly enough 
Fantastic Great substitute for high fat potato chips Good amount of soy protein 6g per serving excellent flavor good crunch and texture These are actually pretty healthy and a great substitute for someone looking for a low fat diet No trans or saturated fats My wife and young daughter who do not need a low fat diet as I do love these Woohoo 
So Good I love black pepper and have only recently discovered sea salt as a very tasty addition to foods and I like soy products And I am sorry to say a potato chip junkie So when I saw the description of these potato soy crisps I had to order them to try them Boy am I glad I did They are very good right out of the bag but they are almost in the shape of little bowls so dips and spreads even cream soups can be scooped up in them They go with everything Nice fresh taste too This one will be a staple in my pantry 
better than potato chips I brought a few bags to a work day in May and people are still asking me about them because you can t buy them in stores around here They re a cross between the soy version of rice cakes and potato chips but people eat them by the handful like potato chips But instead of making you sluggish like a bag of chips the soy protein gives you energy 
Indulge Your Tastebuds About a month ago I noticed a new product at my local QFC It was on sale and I actually did a double take and returned to check out the display It was filled with bags of fancy nut mixes by Sahale Snacks I had been trying to wean myself off sweets by substituting nuts and other trail mixes for candy whenever I got the munchies Sahale snack mixes looked like the fancy upscale town mouse to my regular boring country mouse trail mixes The one that caught my eye was Sing Buri with cashew pineapple peanut lemongrass and Chinese chili The ingredients definitely made my mouth water but the picture on the front is what sold me a heaping bowl of delicious sweet and savory looking cashews and dried pineapple The bag was pretty expensive at 5 99 on sale for 5 ounces but I was definitely hooked at that point and decided to give it a try I didn t even wait to get home but opened up the bag in the car and started snacking right away It was amazing The more I looked into Sahale Snacks the more I liked On the website the story is told of the two founders hiking up Mt Rainier in Washington State dreaming of something beyond the regular peanut raisin m m combo that was their trail mix What resulted was a snack mix that was indulgent and healthy These snack blends are a little pricy but in my opinion totally worth it This would be a wonderful nut mix to offer to friends and guests when entertaining This is a high brow snack that you or your guests will love 
Fast and tasty I love this pasta It only takes three minutes to cook and has a great flavor I would prefer a 100 whole wheat pasta but this tastes so good I will continue to purchase this 
Better Than Uncle Bens With Better Texture The Southwestern Spanish flavor is pleasant but not overpowering and the rice is fluffy not clumpy like other brands I always keep a pouch in my car and at the office for when I don t have time to get out for lunch and in my suitcase for when I need a late night snack while travelling We always take Viva La Rice when camping backpacking or boating This is an excellent product at a very fair price 
Kids Love It My kids really like to eat this as an after school or late night snack However they like it best when it has been heated for 90 seconds instead of the 60 seconds recommended on the package My oldest takes it to high school as part of his lunch because it is so quick and he has only 30 min for lunch 
Great Lollipops The best tasting lollipops the fact they are organic is a huge plus Our main focus in our house is to be free of chemical dyes and these fit the bill They have been a hit with my kids and all the other children we have shared them with 
Finally a great kids lollipop If you care about the sugar that your kids are getting and you want a great tasting lolly these are great WOW 
best lollipops ever Thse are the best lollipops I have ever tried organic or not The flavors are delicious honestly I would highly reccommend them to anyone 
Delicious I bought these lollipops for my allergic kids because these are the only lollipops I have found that don t contain corn Not only do my kids love them but so do my coworkers They are delicious much more flavorful than your usual boring lollipops Watermelon is the office favorite so far 
Great tasting I wasn t sure about this as I normally buy green tea It is a very pleasant tea It smells great and is light 
WOW I was hesitant to buy this tea since all of the Lipton brand teas I have tried have a musty taste and odor to me But the idea of a mango and peach flavored tea my two favorite fruits was irrisitable to me I am so glad I gave it a try The scent was incredible and the taste just as good With a little honey it was one of the best cups of tea I have ever had 
Great stuff Its a shame they quit carrying it I would have reordered twice by now 
great granola nutritious soft delicious organic zero trans fats whole grain Hemp For fiber omega 3 s and some protein we just love em 
mcdickson These bars are terrific very moist unlike many other snack bars They are quite tastey and my kids really like them too 
Best lunch box surprise My son loves the yankees so I thought these were great when I saw them on teh website My son loves finding them as a surprise in his lunchbox 
Vegetarian Fast Food This product is great for those meals when you have no time or patience for a larger meal plan and it is so handy for any camping or trips where vegetarian food may be scarce It can be added to any rice or noodle dish or eaten plain with vegetables The taste is pleasing 
A better soda type treat than mass market sodas These Airforce drinks have reasonable flavors and clear attributions as to their ingredients Additionally they seem to provide a little nutritional support beyond the comfort provided by functioning as a polite treat I like this mandarin mint flavor the most but all are pretty good The small Red Bull style cans look chic in the refrigerator and are a lovely rather special no trouble hospitality offering for guests and visitors 
Really tasty I was a little surprised I m not a huge fan of packaged rice or noodle dishes but sometimes I need to throw together something quickly I was intrigued by the list of ingredients and decided to give Fox River Rice Creole a try I m glad I did This is seriously good stuff lots of flavor easy to prepare etc Best of all it s not overly salty one of my pet peeves with packaged food It s great as a side dish but I think it would also be wonderful with a little dded sausage maybe some andouille I ll definitely be purchasing this again 
Great school snack for kids My children love Smart Puffs I love the smaller packages for school lunches 
Good when fresh This is a tasty on the go snack if you are lucky enough to get good fresh batch The last bunch I got wasnt as enjoyable as I was used to I realised it was because it lacked crunch Would buy it again though Great guilt free snack Great for kids too 
Yummy These are sweet and crunchy and I love them My only concern is the price At a dollar a piece it s a little more than my buget allows for a snack Luckily one packet is usually big enough for me to split for my kids 
Excellent Coffee Full bodied and flavorful Make the Medium cup for a smooth and mellow cup of Java If you make the Tall it will be alittle weak 
Good Taste Good Price Of the Gloria Jean coffees mudslide is my favorite Good taste when used with the Keurig B70 and the 9 25 oz size brew I am on my 2nd order over 50 k cups made and have never had a misfire The previous reviewer simply had a bad batch 
Great great Jerky This jerky is awesome Great shape extremely good taste kind of sweet for jerky but very tasty and very healthy no nitrites no MSG no hormones etc Try it 
Best cereal EVER Anyone who thinks cereal is boring for breakfast hasn t tried this one It s so tasty yet also healthy It s my favorite but lately has been impossible to find Kellogg s is missing the boat by not giving this cereal a top notch advertising campaign because once people try this cereal they re hooked Now if we could only get it back on the grocery shelves or the online grocery again are you listening Amazon In the words of another old commercial try it you ll like it 
Kellogg s Fruit Harvest Cereal Strawberry Blueberry I was never big on cereals until I tried this one Now I m hooked This is a very flavorable cereal with a nice mix of strawberries and blueberries It s great for anytime you have the munchies but don t want to eat empty calories It s also the best of all the cereals that add fruit 
Great Coffee We 1st found this coffee at a local store The local store decided not to carry it anymore and we were without it until we found that Amazon sold it It has a good aroma and taste plus it is organic as well 
Saved the Day This is the first gluten free product I found that my daughter likes Perhaps likes isn t the right word she eats large helpings every time I serve it For a little variety I put some broccoli cuts or carrots right into the mix This is THE favorite in our household 
Delicious Another Viva La Rice Ready to eat product that is delicious with just the right amount of flavor and great texture I don t know how they do it but it is just right in size to take to work camping or to have at home 
Very good cereal This cereal is not quite as hearty as some muesli I am used to but is excellent Many characteristics on the plus side is truly multigrain contains wheat oat corn rice barley and millet is sweetened only just enough to appeal to the palate which is to say it is not horribly sweet like the common American breakfast cereal is light and crispy with some of the ingredients powdery so they tend to combine with milk and make it thicker and does in fact have a nice light blueberry flavor The only aspect I m not thrilled about is that the raisins and almonds are scarce compared to the excellent less expensive muesli type cereal I buy at the local Aldi This Nature s Path cereal has a corn flake like chip predominant as shown on the box 
Great chocolate taste and organic to boot These brownies have a wonderful chocolate flavor and I can eat them without worrying about hydrogenated oils preservatives unnatural colors or flavors because there aren t any So far I have made two batches Neither batch came out perfectly chewy The first batch came out a little hard but the 2nd batch was better than the 1st and I think I m getting the hang of it This is better than anything else I ve tried I had given up on the other commercial mixes due to additives so this is a great treat 
Great These brownies are pure and natural Being all organic there is no chemical flavor that is usually present in boxed brownie mixes This mix makes a delicious batch of chewy chocolate heaven you can taste the richness of the real organic ingredients I urge you to try a box a chocolate lovers dream 
Good cereal If you are looking for gluten free cereal that is not sweet this is the one It tastes like corn flakes and holds milk well 
Wholesome and a great deal The number of palatable gluten free cereal flakes is quite limited and they are usually quite expensive This cereal costs 7 00 bag at my local health food store One needs a place to store a case of 26 oz bags but it s worth it to buy from Amazon com by the case 
Never mind the health benefits When it comes to prepared cereals this has to be one of the best manufactured in North America in terms of value for money That it is also delicious and that it doesn t go soggy as soon as you pour on the milk are two more good reasons to try and buy Mesa Sunrise And if you are concerned about all that other stuff mentioned described with words like organic kosher gluten free and so on then by all means enjoy the extra feelings of vindication 
I like this oatmeal I hate oatmeal I am not an oatmeal person I ve tried lots of different brands and flavors because I like the health benefits of eating oatmeal I bought this because of the flax seeds and wanting to incorporate more omega 3 fatty acids in my diet but what I got was a pleasant surprize This is a good tasting oatmeal I heat it up and add soymilk at the end to the consistancy that I like 
Excellent This instant oatmeal is the only one I have had that tastes like real oatmeal It does not have that artificial taste that most instant oatmeals have 
Scarpetta makes better sauce than I do This bruschetta topping is made from perfectly ripe tomatoes and capers and has a full baslamic base note The chuncky texture is perfect for those who would prefer home made but the quality is as good or superior to the sauces I ve made at home I like the other flavors of pasta sauce too but the bruschetta topping is my favorite for its chunky texture ripe fruit and deft balance of seasonings 
Family Favorite Unbelievably rich and chocolaty without sugar No artificial sweetener aftertaste I like that it s low fat AND high in calcium Plus the canister instead of individual packets lets you vary the portion to match the size of your mug or your strength preference Yummy on a cool day 
Good Snacks This is my first freeze dried fruits experience Fruits are very sweet except the kiwi was a little tart I have tried other fruits from the same merchant pleased And just received the apples I will slowly try the rest of flavors Need to say more 
Yummy I like flavored coffees but not my husband That s part of why we got Keurig maker Have started trying the different flavors and this is the dessert y kind of flavor I m looking for and my other top favorite so far is Green Mountain s Caramel Vanilla Cream Been making it on the 8oz mug setting and just fine 
The bes Earl Grey This is a wonderful tea aromatic smooth and robust I haven t come across a better Earl Grey yet 
Best Earl Grey Tea This is in my opinion by far the best Earl Grey Tea in the Market Loose tea is significantly better in taste than the tea bags from the same manufacturer The 6 pack is a great deal 
Great price on the brand of Earl Grey I prefer The opportunity to get Twinings Earl Grey in large containers at a very reasonable price was too good to pass up 
Great english tea Outstanding full flavored Earl Grey tea Better than the other non branded Earl Grey teas 
The Original Earl Grey is my favorite blend of tea by far no competition there The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall British Prime Minister in 1830 1834 by a Chinese manadarin reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil a rather intense tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange the latter is native to South Vietnam and its oil was probably the recipe s original ingredient Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea s natural flavor but with Twinings you just can t go wrong because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend From the Twinings website When the mandarin s tasty gift began to run out Earl Grey asked his tea merchants Twinings to match it for him Twinings unique blend was the Grey family s long standing favourite When guests inquired about it they were directed to Twinings on the Strand where they would ask for Earl Grey s tea by name Unless you insist on having all your tea with cream or milk I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition in my mind it just plain ruins the blend s particular flavor But that s just me of course Whichever way you have it though if scented teas are your kind of thing Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley 
Healthy convenient snack These are great the whole family loves them and they have 5 mg fiber per package Really tasty nice and crunchy I have several boxes of them in the car for when the little ones need a little something when we are on the go Other snack ideas include those little raisin boxes but then raisins get everywhere and packages of dried fruit which seem to work pretty well since they are not as sticky as raisins These All Bran snack bites really go over well and they are much healthier than candy I sure wish Amazon would sell these online 
Bran in tasty bites These are a delicious and nutritious snack My husband who would otherwise never eat such a thing wolfs these down because they are so scrumptious The all bran bars are great too Keep up the good work Kellogg 
Good but expensive Quickly became my favorite when it first came out Tastes great and the milk doesn t turn orange like some of the new granola type cereals I also use it on ice cream to add crunch I would give it 5 stars but even though it think it s great it is overpriced Price here is about the same as out local Safeway 
Yummy This is a very high quality snack which combines a hearty solid granola with irresistable double chocolate I really love this product a chocolate lover s dream Yet it s surprisingly healthy and not too sweet The fat sugar content is comparable to most other granolas I ve tried numerous granola s over the years and this one is special Probably not the most nutritious granola overall but it s definitely a treat for the tastebuds and a welcome relief from ordinary granolas I would not have this as my exclusive source of granola but I will buy this many more times in the future to satisfy my chocoholic cravings In fact I will probably always keep this product handy because it s highly satisfying Great for a breakfast snack or dessert Yummy 
still one of our favorites My family always enjoys Mini Wheats and this shipment was no exception Everything was just as tasty as store bought I have recommended Amazon to family and friends When I had a question Amazon was right there to solve the problem 
Delicious Similar texture to oat granola I purchased this product in the last week from a local store and was so suprised at 1 How good it tastes and 2 How much the texture is like real oat granola I had seen the GF granola before but did not get it because I thought the flakes would make it more like flake cereal I was definitely mistaken Not only does it satisfy my texture cravings it has some great ingredients like flax seeds and dried fruit It actually had a good ratio of fruit to nuts and other contents rather than having one or 2 pieces of fruit in the whole bag like some other manufacturers like to do In all I totally loved this product and now that I see buying in bulk from Amazon will save me 2 bag I will be sure to buy it here next time 
Delicious Finally a GF CF granola This stuff is amazing I got it for my husband and daughter 2 who are GF CF but I love this stuff too And I am truly not a nuts and seed person but I can t stop eating it I m so happy to be able to give my daughter a snack that has such great protein in it and is so easy to eat My husband is just going to keep a bag in his car to snack on 
Great gluten fee rice crackers My was addicted to all kinds of cheese crackers When she had to go gluten free we searched for some adequate substitute While they are not cheddar goldfish crackers they are very tasty and satisfying 
Coffee People K Cups Black Tiger Bold 25 Count Box Pack of 2 Tastes great and the price was good 
Nice strong cup o joe My wife loves STRONG coffee this is the only K cup that did the trick for her Makes a good bold cup of coffee 
Gluten free cream of chicken soup EXCELLENT replacement for the Campbells condensed soup I am able to cook gluten free for a crowd and no one can tell the difference with this simple substitution It is the best 
Good stuff This is an excellent source for omegas and EFAs and also great tasting All the benefits with out the drive to the healthfood store and their high markup on the price Fantastic product from OUTSIDE the US because of uneconomic gullible politician false impressions 
Good stuff Nutty taste this good for you oil makes great iol based salad dressings 
Great Price I was surprised to find out that amazon sold groceries and at a much better price then could be found in a supermarket A+ to Amazon 
Simple muffins that anyone can easily make What I like most about these muffin packs is that the whole mix only makes 6 muffins total Many other mixes make 12 or more and if you have a small household you re stuck with way too many muffins These were better than expected they are soft flavorful and baked perfectly Also use a small amount of cooking spray on your muffin pans and these will pop right out of the pan after cooking It isn t the healthiest food out there but overall I d recommend this mix 
Great stuff This is simply wonderful licorice with an intense layered flavor My Dad s a long time licorice fan and this stuff gives him a big smile so he s getting a four pack for Christmas Great texture great flavor great price 
Good nutritional value Increases nutritional value of soups and smoothies and tastes almost like nuts 
Fabulous I first tried this product when I was studying in Philadelphia I ordered it for an Organic group I lead on campus and the reviews were outstanding I simply love the product and taste of the hemp seeds No trace drugs just natural nutritionally beneficial components 
Best granola I ve ever had Would highly recommend this product I ve bought it for friends even to show them that granola could be this wonderful I ve tried the Flax Plus also but it wasn t as good as the Hemp Plus I would also recommend the bar form of this product which doesn t seem to be on Amazon currently and is a bit pricy in stores 
pistachios Hardley any bad ones in the whole bag I bought these through Figis and theirs were terrible compared to these and had a lot of bad ones in them plus they cost more 
Fantastic The nuts used tasted very fresh The bite sized chunks were just right It is lightly sweetened but not too sweet Very satisfying = 
Great Snack These nuts are excellent just a light glaze to sweeten tham a bit 
Healthy and tasty I ve enjoyed this product for several years and it was very convenient for me to be able to get it in the mail from Amazon Thank you 
You can eat these all day if you buy them on coupon The Granola bar has a high sugar content but not excessively sweet However the bar tastes good and the trace of honey is appealing It has a crunchy texture The manufacturers have added peanuts too the mixture providing a rich taste The prohibitive price makes these bars less attractive 12 bars go quick I recommending waiting until a coupon opportunity surfaces and then buying the bars in bulk The bars have good self life and make a nice addition to your food storage The bars are great for snacks for trips and a energy pickup mid morning and later in the day 
My family s favorite granola bar These bars have an amazing mildy sweet and nutty flavor The bars are very crunchy and hearty in texture and are therefore super satisfying as a snack at any time of the day They ve been around forever and I haven t found anything new that beats them yet The Oats N Honey is our family s favorite flavor We ve tried others and always gone back to the true classic I usually purchase ours at the local grocery store but I am in the middle of trying to figure out if amazon offers a better deal Try it you ll like it 
Great hot cereal and nice alternative to oatmeal This is a very tasty creamy hot cereal If you re gluten sensitive give this a try after I switched to a gluten free diet I was missing oatmeal something awful I thought I would give this a try as an alternative and was glad I did With some brown sugar and raisins and a little imagination you can be satisfied with this cereal 
delicious These were absolutely delicious I bought them as a treat for my co workers they disappeared very quickly We couldn t stop eating them and will be ordering them again They are not shiny covered almonds like we were expecting rather they are hand dipped in a LOT of very good chocolate and have drizzles over the top and a flat bottom edge Very fresh taste 
GReat variety pack all three are good I love swiss miss cocoa especially the little marshmallows they put in the pack The milk chocolate is great the Rich chocolate has a little deeper chocolate semi sweet to darker flavor and the Marshmallows are just cool Great for the wintertime Stock up and enjoy Also great to use part of a pack in a cup of coffee get the sweetness of Cocoa and the kick of coffee got me through a few late nights 
great portion control They taste like graham crackers and are great portion control I ordered a case for the ladies at work and we split it If you are counting calories this is the way to go 
Snacks I bought a case of these at the same time as I purchased the cheddar fries These are smaller packages so you get more in a case These are white cheddar steak fries where the cheddar fries are thinner and longer These white cheddar steak fries are white and very cheesey and salty snack They have unique flavor and don t taste anything like the cheddar fries at all I gave it a 4 star cause I prefer the cheddar ones better 
Slow Shipping I love Andy Capp Steak Fries but be warned about long shipping times It has been two weeks since my order and I haven t received the product I don t know if FEDEX style shipping would have helped 
Very Good These are slightly thicker than regular gluten cornflakes but still tasty Don t expect them to be sweet like frosted flakes They are just plain Very good though and great in recipes 
delicious small or large As anyone who has tried Bahlsen Hit cookies knows they are absolutely yummy despite the odd packaging and name A nice crunchy cookie not sickeningly sweet good with cream and sugar tea funny thing about the minis though both sides of the cookie are facing the same direction so that one of the sides is the wrong way with the printed side towards the cream just a sidebar no detraction from how tasty these cookies are 
Best tea at the best price with free shipping using prime beats local grocery at twenty five bucks for six boxes 
Tea Time I have to agree Best Earl Grey there is Robust but not bitter I have tried the other brand s and none compare Oh look 4 o clock Tea Time 
Mmm Best Damn Earl Grey on the market The Bergamot is well balanced with the black tea flavor Still good even if the bag is left in for too long BUY THIS TEA 
Love This Healthy Snack So delicious and so healthy Fresh and crunchy much better than peanuts I love these soy nuts 
Nice snack We enjoyed these and they are a healthy snack They are not low calorie but very nutritious 
YUMMY I have tried many brands of chocolate covered toffee and I have to say Virgina Diner English Chocolate Covered Toffee is one of the best It is very fresh and it melts in your mouth 
Yummy and healthy We love popcorn as an occasional treat at night but don t like the salt and fat that usually comes with most microwave popcorn We had been using a microwave popper to make our own plain popcorn but with no oil whatsoever it lacked a little something This is just right low in fat no salt so we can add seasonings if we choose and organic to boot I also feel good about buying Newman s products because of the causes they support and all the money doesn t go to corporate profits 
The ELITE coffee that is served to the Celebs This coffee is amazing we stayed at the Shore Club in Miami Beach and we had some of this coffee with our breakfast at Ago Restaurant Hooked ever since this is the only coffee I ever drink now Starbucks Caribou are nothing compared to this One sip or sniff of the aroma will get you hooked forever If you ever make it out to South Beach ILLY has a store on Ocean Drive 
pretty good flavor balance nice chewy texture could have more licorice flavor I like these a lot They are only slightly salty with a bit of molasses sweetness all balanced against a mild licorice flavor They are medium hard and very chewy although they must be kept in an airtight container or they get too hard Personally I would prefer a stronger licorice flavor but these are still among my favorites Salty licorice is indeed a strange thing for those who haven t tried it before If you ve never had it before don t start with a case like what s sold here And definitely stay away from Double Salt licorice until you ve learned whether you like the saltiness If you want black licorice but don t want the salty flavor try Haribo licorice wheels Those have more licorice flavor than these coins and less other flavor They re a bit sweet and a bit softer Note that these coins also come in bags Buying them that way is slightly more cost effective but the tubs might be a little more airtight 
Perfect for emergencies like college First things first you will not be treated to that classic cooking smell In fact your appetite is better off not catching a whiff of that magnesium salt concoction that heats your meal Think happy thoughts and be oblivious Why Because the meal itself is actually pretty good and has an airtight separation with the oven The package also includes plastic spork knife and napkin Basically the ingredients are on par with what you would typically find in canned stew and similarly need not be refrigerated However the meal loses one star because the serving size is fairly small 210 calories isn t a whole lot to go on particularly if you must engage in strenuous physical activity under low temperature conditions Pros lightweight keeps well cooks itself easy disposal tastes good Cons cost and storage space per calorie is somewhat high If you were creative you might be able to figure a way to cook something else using the box oven 
Wonderful item to have on hand for emergencies I received one of these meals after Hurricane Rita They were being handed out by first responders to people in the area before our utilities were restored Excellent product I wanted more so I could stock up in case of another disaster or emergency I found their website and discovered that they were not for sale over the internet I was very disappointed until today I went back to their website and saw that the meals are now available from amazon This is great news I suggest that everyone stock up on these meals in case of emergencies They really come in handy 
Wonderful This peanut butter was wonderful Smooth and creamy just like they said Good price too 
Audra s Review I love Orville Redenbacher s Sweet Buttery there is no other popcorn like it I m a little upset because they took it off the self in Jersey City If I can t find it i will buy Kettle Corn second best 
For people that can t decide between Kettle corn or butter popcorn My title says it all A perfect blend of salty and sweet Best of both worlds 
Clumpy The mix was a little lumpy had some hard chunks that would NOT dissolve they were as hard as rocks and some had to be fished out of the batter The mix was not expired it was as if it had been exposed to moisture or improper temperatures during storage Still came out o k and tasted great 
Great granola Just tried this granola today it s really good The packaging is also great just like a milk carton No broken bags or messes to deal with and really easy to pour This granola has the perfect blend of grains and just the right amount of raisins 
A natural selection Twinings blend of Ceylon and Indian tea produces that more traditional hearty aroma and pungent flavor In non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness brightness strength and flavor Normally I wouldn t attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses trucks and stores for long periods of time Yet Twinings seems to hold up well I love tea would drink 24 7 if possible and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and Twinings is definetly one of them 
Simply sublime green tea Most green teas have a grassy astringent taste to them but this tea is unbelievably smooth and slightly sweet Highly recommended as are all of Rishi s Ancient Tree teas 
Irish blend had nice earthy flavor I recently gave up coffee made the switch to teas Lipton other grocery blends were bitter or weak I purchased the loose tea leaves from Amazon at a good price quick shipping English friends suggested PJ Tips tea which we found ordered from another online site Twinning s blows it away Both the Earl Grey Irish Blend are great both on the pallet to the nose 
Strong and full flavored Twinings was founded in London England in 1706 and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas Irish Breakfast tea is a mixture of Ceylon and Assam black teas well known for its strong malty taste OK let s get down to brass tacks Irish Breakfast tea is not for everyone There s an old Irish saying that says that a proper cup of tea should be strong enough for a mouse to trot on and this tea is certainly within striking distance of that target But if you add milk and sugar to this fine tea you will be rewarded with a smooth and full flavored drink Irish Breakfast tea is in a class by itself among the teas I have drunk in that it comes closest to being like coffee that is having a strong taste that gets you up and going in the morning Not all teas will stand up to a proper breakfast but this one will Overall I have found this to be a wonderfully interesting tea strong and robust And that s my review If you want a tea that will round out your hearty breakfast then Irish Breakfast tea is for you If you want tea from a great tea producer them Twinings is for you I highly recommend this hearty tea 
The best so far I bake 3 4 times per week and honestly can say that this product is great I tried it for the first time to make bread I almost cried my bread was the best I ever made I will buy it again for sure 
Good Yeast I had been searching for yeast in bulk and came across this brand I decided to try and was not disappointed I use it for bread and pizza dough 
Organic Crackers We really enjoy the crackers just did not realize that we would not be able to consume 12 boxes between the end of August 2006 and the expiration date on the product of November 10 2006 Feel that the 12 boxes would last at least 6 months before expiration when you purchase a case Amazon needs to let the consumer know what the expiration date is so you can make decision as to whether to purchase a case or not Otherwise they are great crackers 
Better than the competition I first purchased these crackers because they have no soy in them My daughter is allergic to soy and soy free crackers are very hard to find I bought them and to my amazement my picky husband also loves them He prefers them to all other similar crackers I purchased a large number of boxes which I keep hidden as they tend to disappear rather quickly 
One of our favorites I like a cup of coffee with character and thus far this Black Gold Extra Bold has delivered The Extra Bold defines that this K Cup carries an extra 20 30 of coffee per serving than the standard K Cup and as a result this delivers the extra kick that I tend to like We only brew at the 7 25oz and sometimes the 5 25oz volume on our B 70 brewer as we prefer a stronger cup of joe This roast is on the dark side and delivers flavor with intensity and a nice smoky essence as described I also find that this provides a hint of crema much like a shot of espresso when brewed fresh We like it and if you like stronger coffee we think you will too Try it 
Awesome Gluten Free Muffins These are as close to the real thing as it gets I added chocolate chips to half of the batter and crasins dried cranberries to the other half I have had celiacs for almost 2 years now and these are the best gluten free product I have eaten I had to hide them from the rest of my family b c they liked them as well 
Great muffins My 2 1 2 year old son cannot have gluten items and these muffins are very adaptable and tasty I add fresh apples bananas or carrots with crushed pineapple plus some cinnamon or nutmeg and he loves these muffins They are a bit plain without the additions though 
Natural is best I have a bag of Orville Redenbacher s Natural Popcorn every night I have done this for years I m 76 Orville s Popcorn is the best I love it 
The Best of the Best nut cluster snacks I ve ever had I m known to be nuts for nuts and I ve tried nuts from around the world as friends bring them back for me as gifts Very near the top of the list of the best nut snacks is Mrs May s Almond Crunch From the first time I tasted it to every time I eat it now I am amazed at the crunchiness quality of the almonds lightly sweetened glaze which is very unbrittle like attention to healthiness in the ingredients etc As a side note because of how much I was impressed by this product I went on a tasting spree by buying about 12 different kinds of Mrs May s products from the peanut and cashew crunches to the various sesame crunches etc Perhaps I m biased to the original but none of the others have that same magic I would rate the rest as 4 stars But the almond crunch should get 6 stars 
Delicious addictive and healthy too My family and I love Almond Crunch they re just sweet enough very crunchy and a perfect snack 
Delicious healthy snack I have tryed the Almond Crunch and is delicious and healthy snack better than chips Try it you ll agre 
Fantastic The nuts used tasted very fresh The bite sized chunks were just right It is lightly sweetened but not too sweet Very satisfying = 
Mrs Mays almond crunch These are fresh crunchy natural and healthy snacks you can reseal and keep in the car crumble into non fat yogurt or over salads or pack some in the kids lunch Convenient and delicious 
Delicious These are wonderfully crunchy and delicious The calorie count is misleading however One piece is more than the 25 calories they claim it is But it s worth it 
Excellent Product These are tasty fresh and reasonably priced As finger foods my grandkids love them plain A good buy and great for the grandkids since mom does not know where we get them from and give them them in a plain paper bag Personally I love them rolled in coconut oil and sea salt 
Ten stars actually I love the taste of this cereal If you like the puffed wheat sold in grocery stores for decades you too may find you love the fresh vibrant taste of these OVER SIZED grains of puffed delight Best served in very COLD whole organic milk I think I will go eat some NOW 
Excellent Gunpowder Green Tea Very nice Gunpowder Green Tea Gunpowder Green is fairly dark when brewed and has a robust flavor My favorite of the green teas Timothy s is quite flavorful and works well in the keurig 
The best Just get them We absolutely love this snack The flavor is unique and refreshing We even hide the bags from eachother so we get our own stash The other flavors are good too but this is Sahale shinning STAR Thanks for such an out of the box snack 
YUM I love these snacks especially the Valdosta blend The others are good but lack the crunchy punch of the Valdosta It s a great snack or salad topper Delicious and good for you 
Premium Mint Tea Really From Morocco Moroccan Mint is a premium Numi tea This herbal tea is certified organic and is kosher On the box the manufacturer says it better than I ever could In the Moroccan spring the snow melts off the Atlas Mountains watering the plains below As the days warm some of the most soothing refreshing and full flavored mint flourishes in this ancient land of the Berbers With a flavor as light and lively as a newly picked leaf our choice organic mint will become your favorite mint teasan An all day or after dinner delight no wonder the Moroccans drink ten cups a day The price is perfect a big savings over single boxes If you like Numi teas get it you won t be sorry If you are new to Numi but love mint teas this is one that will not disappoint 
Great tea No complaints on this one at all very mild and easy to drink 
Kids Love Em The kids love em and what could be better than that I bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here We tried the strawberry frosted and like other reviewers I agree not too sweet right amount of frosting Can t wait to try the next flavor 
Our new favorite breakfast food These are our new favorite breakfast food FANTASTIC We love them and that s even after we re on our second set of 12 boxes The strawberry flavoring tastes real not fake like regular pop tarts Overall the taste is sweet but not overly so This flavor is better than the apple cinnamon which we have also tried Definitely one of our best Amazon purchases ever 
Quick breakfast Satisfying and good tasting A little heavy on calories unless it is a meal replacement 
Uncannily good Very tasty and healthy product However I ordered many and discovered expiration dates when I got them Some had only a couple of weeks which was not sufficient Wish the date could be a lot longer and at least remind us about expiration dates in the ad 
EASY COBBLER This is the best crumb topping I have ever made I got rave reviews for my christmas pies and it was so easy cause it was already made for you Just add a few things and done What a pleasure 
Very convenient and tastes good I must admit that although it was pretty good it made me want to go and find a good Rice Pudding recipe so I can keep the needed ingredients on hand to make homemade I made it with water but will try it with milk next time as suggested by a reviewer below Great item to keep on your shelf to make something quick easy and it makes your kitchen smell good 4 Servings 210 calories per serving TOTAL FAT 1 5g 1g SAT FAT TOTAL CARBOHYDRATE 47g SODIUM 65mg FIBER 1g SUGARS 20g PROTEIN 4g Calcium 6 Daily Value 
Fragrant enough to sell a house Fox river rice pudding is incredibly fragrant almost overwhelming when you open the package The finished product is mellow and delicious not too rich I m going to try it in the crock pot one of these days Glad I tried it 
Pretty Darn Good This Fox River Rice Pudding ROCKS Quick Cooking and you can adjust the consistency as I prefer it to be fluffy as opposed to creamy The cinnamon stick is a nice touch although I would not recommend this product for those of you on a High fiber diet like myself to lose weight as the overall fiber content is low it is a nice treat that is low in fat and is extremely delicious 
Simply Outstanding My family really enjoyed this rice pudding I loved the real cinammon stick it gave the rice a rich flavor The aroma in the kitchen had everyone looking forward to a real treat Best of all is how simple it was Boil the water empty package wait 20 minutes Enjoy 
perfect tuna alternative just what it says all white meat individually sized portable and easy to prepare perfect alternative for tuna sala 
My Son Loves These I am so glad I found these My son 22 months old is crazy about these apples and I can t find them at the store any more They have a really great flavor and texture They are very different than traditional dried fruit The apples are plump and actually look like they came from an apple 
Poddy Talk The Love at First Sip pods brew a very good but small cup of coffee in the Melita one cup coffee maker The directions say that you can use the pod for two cycles which would fill a large mug but that is only if you enjoy your coffee very weak This pod and system is perfect for people who only drink 1 2 cups a day and hate the waste and inconsistancy of a self measuring system 
Scrumptious Licorice I bought a few bags for my husband along with other brands We are looking to buy bigger quanties of Tubi s This licorice is simply the best Wonderful taste of licorice Not over powered with anise but wonderful molasses true licorice 
Organic Crackers We really enjoy the crackers just did not realize that we would not be able to consume 12 boxes between the end of August 2006 and the expiration date on the product of November 10 2006 Feel that the 12 boxes would last at least 6 months before expiration when you purchase a case Amazon needs to let the consumer know what the expiration date is so you can make decision as to whether to purchase a case or not Otherwise they are great crackers 
Better than the competition I first purchased these crackers because they have no soy in them My daughter is allergic to soy and soy free crackers are very hard to find I bought them and to my amazement my picky husband also loves them He prefers them to all other similar crackers I purchased a large number of boxes which I keep hidden as they tend to disappear rather quickly 
We Should All Go bAck to Nature I love these crackers for several reasons They are absoutely delicious to begin with And they do not use ingredients like partially hydrogenated soybean oil They are hard to find in stores It s a hit or miss thing here in the Northeast So I ordered from Amazon Propmpt delivery and ease of purchasing will keep me coming back 
Love This Spicy Snack I tried this snack tonight and it was all I could do not to eat the whole bag Well the night is young so I probably will I love the flavors and the spiciness of it 
Good with a peppery kick I bought the variety pack and tried this flavor fourth I buy natural snacks for my kids freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar but I find them bland So I ordered these and I love this flavor In fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it it wasn t too spicy for her They use black pepper which is flavorful but I wouldn t call it spicy 
Best tasting nuts I ve ever had I love these nuts I stock up on them whenever I can find them in the grocery store now that Amazon is carrying them I can stock up whenever I go on a nut hunt They are sweet and crunchy and so stasifying that I can not go back to the other brand Actually I bought the big brand of nuts just recently and gave them away after trying a mouthful These nuts have spoiled me for any other These are GREAT 
great these are the best honey roasted peanuts ever i was thrilled to see that amazon carries them because i was having trouble finding them at the grocery store where i usually buy them 
This Is A Great Lunch I am a school teacher and I only have 30 minutes for lunch I eat one of these most days for lunch It is very filling an inexpensive It is easy and fast to heat up 
Delicious healthy tea My whole family loves this tea even our 5 year old We drink it in the evening to calm and relax us When we are fighting colds or sore throats we drink it with a bit of lemon and honey We also put a couple of tea bags in our bath water for a soothing chamolmile tea soak It has a flowery grassy flavor and is best a wee bit sweetened It is one of the best tasting chamomile teas we have tried Used in moderation it is not dangerous to your health and is a long standing respected herb in natural medicine People with severe hay fever may not tolerate this tea very well but it doesn t affect me and I have WRETCHED allergies and all season hay fever 
This is one of the best chamomiles out there It just is Not much else to say about this 
Golden Temple Peace Cereal Wild Berry Since I love Kellogg s Fruit Harvest with Strawberries and Blueberries I thought I would try this one It is good but not as flavorable as Kellogg s It also has a nice mix of berries which includes raspberries as well as strawberries and blueberries You can t beat the prices for both Kellogg s and Golden Temple in the supermarkets Amazon is the way to go for the best prices 
Very tasty These are the best almonds I ve ever had Though it is true that the Amazon ad states they are all natural an error on their part not on Emerald they are very close to it The pricing here is a bit high At our higher end market I pay 5 49 for an 11oz canister The pricing is better to buy at the store than through Amazon overall But if it is convenience that sways your buying preference this comes fairly close about 7 8 higher I do highly recommend this brand 
Strong but good flavor I ordered this soup along with a bunch of others on my goldbox special a few weeks ago The soup comes in individually packaged microwavable cups that are easy to take to work or school with you Upon microwaving the soup flavor was very good but the dehydrated items inside particularly the noodles and the beans were hard and crunchy After letting the dehydrated items soak for a few minutes I tried it and it was perfect Very good flavor but it has a very strong garlic component to the flavor maybe a little too strong I would recommend further diluting the soup down which would entail emptying the contents into a larger bowl for heating defeating the point of the microwavable cups I would purchase this soup again if it was offered at the Goldbox price of nine bucks for the 12 pack But at the price currently offered I m not certain I would go for it again Nevertheless the flavor is good and if you like strong flavor with the convenience of the individually packaged cups it might be worth a shot ordering it one time to see if you love it 
Bold dark not overprocessed This is dark rich coffee without a bitter taste I ve had to resort to adding creamer to get through other bold dark k cups The San Lorenzo is good straight up 
Geat Coffee Timothys coffee is my favorite And the 2 Packs boxes is a very good value 
It s addictive because it s delicious I m a huge white tea fan and regularly keep more than five varieties at any given time Clipper s Organic White Tea with Peppermint is easily one of the best of any type of teas The flavor is balanced well defined and makes for smooth sippin 
wonderful those dried stawberries were so hard to find where i live so i ordered from Amazon they are wonderful came very fast too made stawberry scones with them yumm 
Yummy This is good and healthy It is not too sweat and not too healthy tasty It is just perfect for me 
Great Taste I bought this green tea because it is organic I knew I was getting a healthy product but what I got was much more The taste is really good It is fresh smooth and full bodied You will be pleased with this high quality tea What a nice surprise Note This Bigelow product comes 40 bags to a box and 4 tea bags to a wrapper 
Nice choice especially if you can t eat egg For an egg free wheat free gluten free dairy free bread it s an excellent bread Good consistency and texture and it tastes quite similar to typical bread My two year old loves eating it 
Guilt free dessert Fast and easy to make delicious to eat and no sugar or fat Buying in quantity is economical and efficient 
The Best Pretzels Around no Contest I love Pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds these are The BEST The taste great are REALLY crunchy a key requirement for me and have just the right amount of salt The Newman s Rounds are just as good maybe even better And as an added bonus Paul Newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity an unbeatable combination in my book 
Yum Well what else can I say I love Zatarain s Add a little sausage and you have a great quick meal 
Great Value I bought these as gifts For the price you can t beat it The tins each had a horrible sticker on them about shipping the items as a unit I assume instructions for the warehouse packer When peeling them off a lot of residue was left behind but it easily came off with rubbing alcohol 
Brings me back to the Islands My husband and I went to Maui on our honeymoon 7 years ago We actually brought some of this brand of coffee home with us Imagine my delight to find it on Amazon It is a very smooth coffee with an amazing aroma Now I just need to go back to Maui 
High flavor No corn syrup This product is packaged very nicely for keeping It has good flavor without health harming corn syrup Used sparingly there is very little downside to this product 
My favorite tea in the whole world I drink this daily I mix it with a regular green tea that I brew all night and then make ice tea in the morning This tea is perfect for ice tea My sister says that it is the only tea that soothes her sore throat when she is sick This tea definitely has a unique flavor you will either love it or hate it I love it I also love all the health benefits of Kombucha This will be a tea that I drink for the rest of my life 
great tea This tea tastes identical to the caffeinated kombucha only it s decaf Great and calming Price is great too 
Taste great great alternative to fruit snacks I got these for my 4 year old who had become familiar with fruit snacks which are full of nothing but awful things She loves them and so do my husband and I I don t feel guilty about giving her these as a treat 
Long time user eater love em I ve been buying Nature s Path gluten free foods for a number of years and have been fully satisfied I ve had access to somewhat lower prices than what traditional grocery stores put on their products but am delighted that Amazon s price is virtually identical to the prices offered by the discount organic foods market we ve purchased these from in the past I doubt you ll find Nature s Path products any lower anywhere else particularly when you consider no sales tax and free shipping if the order is large enough Also I contacted Nature s Path once with a question about one of their products the Mesa Sunrise flakes Customer service is excellent and very friendly much nicer than we typically get down here in the States they re a Canadian company up in B C If this sounds like a commercial it s not intended to be I just have been entirely satisfied with Nature s Path foods for years and have no complaints at all When a company does a good job they deserve referrals everybody wins 
Great product great price Anyone following a gluten free diet knows how expensive it can be to buy the gluten free version of anything and when trying a product for the first time you hope it actually tastes good This is one gluten free product I am completely delighted with both in taste and price These corn flakes are crunchy and delicious I like them better than the glutenated alternatives and work well for other recipes Candies cereal crumb pie crusts fried chicken etc 
Too much I love Twinings but 300 packets of it are a bit too much to purchase at one time There needs to be an option for smaller packaging with this product 
Love this tea This is one of my favorite teas This is 1 2 the cost of my grocery store and since the bags are individually wrapped freshness is not an issue 
Highly drinkable Twinings was founded in London England in 1706 and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas English Breakfast tea is a mixture of black teas from Sri Lanka which are blended to produce a smooth yet flavorful tea Though often served during breakfast this tea tastes excellent all day long OK let s get down to brass tacks this is another great tea Harder to over steep than some of the teas I have known it consistently produces a smooth and highly drinkable cup Highly conventional in its taste English Breakfast tea has a robust flavor that stands up well to lemon and milk which makes it a favorite among those who like to accessorize their tea Plus I must say that this tea is wonderful iced add some lemon and sugar and you ve got the right tea for a hot afternoon And that s my review If you want an excellent all round tea hot or iced one that goes well with any food then English Breakfast tea is for you If you want tea from a great tea producer them Twinings is for you I highly recommend Twinings English Breakfast tea to all even those not normally into tea drinking Or perhaps especially to those not normally into tea drinking 
Get It While You Can In The Can Seriously folks shop around all you like but you cannot beat this Lavazza espresso for a full bodied not at all bitter taste whether you are making espresso or cappuccino I ve used it for at least 15 years in three different machines Francis Francis and my office machine Rancilio Silvia and have never found a substitute My office is right next to Dean and Deluca in NYC and I ve tried super expensive espresso blends at over 20 00 pound nothing comes close Amazon was recently out of stock as they are often and I accidentally brought the Lavazza Oro whole beans thinking they were already ground Yuk I had them ground in my local coffee dealer but they have No Taste compared to this I gave them away and got hold of my favorite black can Amazon s price can t be beat believe me I ve tried I get 8 cans at a time and enjoy perfect coffee all day long just like in Rome Ciao 
Italy loves Lavazza What can I say about Lavazza that hasn t already been said I was in Rome two summer s ago and noticed it is in all the supermarkets Decaf is usually not so great but this is They must be doing something right 
Just the Right Aroma Prefect Flavor Low Acidity Excellent I am thrilled about finally finding coffee that smells and tastes just like what you can get at good hotels and brasseries in Europe I was previously buying Lavazza s SuperCrema in whole bean format because I had tried it at one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Beverly Hills and thought it was great However it would not turn out the same using my semi automatic home espresso machine and my low end grinder Therefore for those who do not own 12 000 fully automatic commercial espresso machines like that restuarant did this coffee is a much better choice The Caffee Espresso comes in perfectly ground cans ready for the home Espresso machine The Italians at Lavazza definitely know what they re doing Definitely buy this coffee and enjoy 
Starbucks Replacement System I LOVE my Tassimo For years I have been searching for an economical and convenient way to replicate Starbucks lattes and mochas at home and this is the system that finally achived it I don t use the latte capuccino milk pods unless I m in dire straights it s better to steam real milk search for milk steamer on Amazon that s a great product too but the espresso is great and I haven t been to Starbucks in weeks Hands down recommended no holds barred 
Great Value Two for s I love my coffee machine but I normally do not buy t discs from Gevalia due to price But found this on Amazon = Wow 2 for 1 Price is great even when you add in any cost for shipping etc Still beats Bead Bath Beyond with a coupon Service and delivery were excellent 
best of the best I purchashed Crown Prince fancy pink canned crab meat before i tried Crown Prince fancy white canned crab meat It s the best canned crab meat I love to eat Crown Prince canned crab meat It s on my favorite list 
Great tea I ve tried almost every green tea on the market and this is one of my favorites It has a great flavor and it really does help me keep from snacking between meals I don t think it s possible to find great organic green tea at this price anywhere else 
Straight from ORBIT I know what excellent coffee is I typically buy Blue Mountain coffee from Jablum at 40 lb and make espresso with that 4 shots at a time because it s so smooth I bought 5 of this coffee mainly because of the claimed hypercaffinated nature and made my usual espresso pot with it By the time I was through 1 4 of the cup basically 1 shot I was completely in orbit from the caffeine and I was quite impressed with the fact that the coffee was smooooooooth on a par with the Blue Mountain that I usually buy but at a fraction of the cost I didn t get the shakes like with other coffee just a state of extreme alertness for the next 9 or 10 hours And while I was workin on that first cup I sent in a testimonial to the Shock Coffee website yep it s on there The beans are a blend of light medium and dark roast they re selected for caffeine content and it s everything they claim I took about 1 of the stuff ground it up and brought it in the office We actually got quite a bit of work done that day Unfortunately for me I now have a bunch of Shock addicts running around asking me for some of my personal stash so I have to buy some just for the office staff If you like coffee get this stuff It s smooth Not rip your lungs out harsh like that Starbucks stuff that you have to add 500 of sugar and caramel to just so you can drink it Buy it it works bing bing bing Richochet Rabbit 
WOW This is some great Coffee Perks you up gets you moving A good tasting highly energized morning wake up Even better as an afternoon pick me up Even thinking about making coffee now just wakes me up 
REALLY SMOOTH RICH GREAT TASTE AND IT WORKS I am so glad I tried this coffee I also shared some with my neighbor who has a business and she took some to the office with her and now it s the only coffee they want If you try this you ll never want any other coffee I even travel with my own for my hotel stays perfect travel packs GREAT JOB Shock Coffee and I love your sleep is overrated slogan 
Big Coffee Drinker A trained eye would see that Shock Coffee is a blend of Arabica Robusta coffee beans Just like many other ingredients there is good and bad Robusta Arabica beans Wines are made from different grapes and it s the individuals pallet that distinguishes between good and bad In Europe the coffee bean of choice is Robusta as they appreciate a stronger and bolder coffee With that said I d recommend Shock for anybody who wants that extra kick with a better than average taste I d also like to reiterate that Robusta beans are given a bad rap but the truth stands that some Robusta beans have a great robust taste no pun attended 
A matter of taste I LOVE this coffee It has a strong flavor and aroma and gets you moving in the morning I do not believe it is meant to be a fancy gourmet coffee but rather what I would call Trucker or Cowboy coffee If you like strong coffee buy it If you like delicate coffee buy something else 
Truly an excellent snack This snack blend is the best I tried it on the recommendation of a friend and have come to love it It s perfect alone but I enjoy putting the mix on salads It definitely spices them up a bit and the flavor is amazing I have become a big fan of this product and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to add a little excitement to their everyday snacks 
Incredible bites of goodness I love these chips they have a taste that gets better the more you chew them and they give you plenty of fiber and soy protein I wish they weren t as high in fat as they are but they re good for a once in awhile indulgence 
Whole Bean Coffee This is very good coffee and is one of my favorites The Moca gives it a little different flavor but it goes well with the dark roast beans I have purchased this item several times and would recommend this product to others 
Stoneridge Orchards Whole Dried Blueberries rate Sorry I could not have rated 10 stars I feel they taste better than if I picked them myself I want to purchase more Thank you AMAZON ALWAYS OFERING THE BEST 
Stoneridge Orchards Bodacious Blueberries Bigger and more luscious than any other available dried blueberries They make a huge difference and are worth the extra price I substitute them for the raisins in our favorite Quaker Oatmeal cookie recipe and everyone loves the results Hope the oatmeal and blueberry health benefits cancel the butter sugar calories 
HFCS Why are people demonizing high fructose corn syrup the only reason it s cheaper in the US is America has lots of corn Eat more corn Use more corn syrup unripe berries have less fructose mass harvesting them probably places unripe berries into the mix and its compensated for 
Stoneridge Orchards Whole Dried Blueberries I enjoy eating the product however the blueberries are very sweet The sweetness helps satisfy my sweet tooth and I do no have the desire for candy The nutritious value I am receiving from eating blueberries is beneficial for my wellbeing I keep them at bedside for a satisfying snack 
Scrumptious tasting English muffins I ve been a big fan of Ener G Foods alternative food products Ever since I discovered that I was Wheat and Gluten allergic these have been my only substitutes for breads These muffins are very tasty and crispy when toasted and are instant favorites of mine Also check out Ener G s Light Brown Rice bread for sandwiches and their cookie assortment These are so good that I don t even miss regular Wheat breads and cookies 
Crystal Light Raspberry Lemonade I ve purchased many of these products I put this in my top three Good refreshing lemonade with a nice raspberry flavor to give it that extra kick 
Single Malt and Cigars Lapsang Souchong tea comes from the mist enshrouded Wuyi Mountains in the northwestern corner of China s Fujian Province north of Guangdong Canton Province whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the Taiwan Straits This tea has an unmistakeably smokey note which for years made it a particular favorite with the single malt and cigars crowd of English clubs and drawing rooms That aroma is created during the tea s smoking process which involves the withering of the tea leaves in bamboo baskets hung on racks over cypress or pine wood fires after they have been rolled and placed into wooden barrels until they emit their own aroma The finished tea leaves are characteristically thick and black Legend has it that this smoking process was discovered by accident during the Quing Dynasty 1644 1911 when an army unit camping out in a tea factory interrupted the processing of the recently arrived leaves and the workers then resulted to drying the leaves over pine fires to make up for the disruption and get to the market in time creating an instant sensation there Because of its potent aroma Lapsang Souchong should not steep very long The rule of thumb is that the paler its color the more likely you ll truly enjoy it 
Great Side Dish for Entertaining I have tried all four Fox River Rice flavors and this is my favorite While cooking the rice the aroma of the seasoning filled my kitchen This flavor also has a little bite from the pepper I have served it with chicken and steak Great product 
Great item I have never ordered anything such as this online I was surprised that the nuts arrived in about half as much time as the site said it would take I will consider ordering again once I have used these up The walnuts were so fresh and nice not all broken up as some have been when I have purchased them at the grocery store 
Great way to get your children to eat a little bit of fiber These are really good Of course their almond and mixed nuts flavors are even better 
Great Snack Hain Popped Corn Cakes are simply delicious just enough crunch and sweetness to satisfy my hungry teenagers Very Healthy too 
I love this tea I absolutely love the taste of this tea and so does everyone else I ve encouraged to try some even my coffee drinking daughter I drink a lot of herbal teas and this is definitely my favorite I can t tell if it s really detoxifying my liver and kidneys but I do know that drinking a cup boosts my energy level and make me feel better Also don t let the name of the tea make you think you can only drink it occasionally the box states that it s mild enough to be used every day for up to 30 days My only disappointment at the moment is that the six pack on Amazon isn t currently available 
Nice and smooth I too totally disagree with the other reviewer who didn t like this This is a mild tasting smooth tea that you could drink anytime It is one of my favorite teas 
It s Great Maybe I m crazy but I totally disagree with the other review I think this tea is delicious I don t know if it really detoxifies your body but it tastes good 
Excellent Sesame Oil If you like a tasty oil sesame oil is one to try And this is a good flavorful sesame oil Perfect for Asian cooking and for tweaking traditional foods that can use a touch more flavor 
A Toddler Favorite My two year old loves these and prefers them over Goldfish I did a taste test with Goldfish and the Cheddar Bunnies seem cheesier They seem less dry too 
LOVE IT This mix is a blessing for those w food allergies Even if we didn t have any food allergies I d buy this mix I do have to cook it a bit longer than the box states and a lot longer 10m if using a glass dish 
WOW DELICIOUS I have tried all of Cherrybrook Kitchen Products and they are fabulous Even without Eggs Dairy and Peanuts these products taste even better than if I made it from Scratch Their Brownie is deliciously Chocolately and if cooked for about 16 minutes comes out fudgy also I also like the Chocolate Chips right in the mix I would highly recommend it 
high fiber with a taste that may take a little getting use to The first thing you notice about this cereal is the aroma It s reminiscent of fish oil supplements Having never eaten flax of any kind before I don t know if the aroma is typical of flax At first serving I was sure I d consume the rest of the box eventually but would not buy more Yet with each serving the aroma is less and less noticeable I enjoy this cereal and will buy it again It has more fiber than any other cereal organic or not I ve seen 
Hot Chocolate This product has no fat This is a good thing I like to mix it with my coffee for instant mocha 
Good but not great Flavor is very good The reason I couldn t rate it higher is that I have trouble getting it to thoroughly mix in 
Tasty bread My husband who has celiac disease thinks this is the best bread on the market It definitely is the easier to make Only requires oil and water and turns out perfect every time Amazon s price beats those health food stores by a long shot Try it 
Great Product This bread is fabulous It actually tastes like bread and is light and airy not heavy like most wheat free products THANK YOU Orgran 
tasty and good for you If you must have a cookie might as well make it a healthy one I bought a case and they went fast 
Satisfied this vegan chocoholic I ve tried a few types of vegan chocolate chip cookies and was always disappointed with how bland they were and loaded with fat and calories These are not only the least amount of calories that I ve seen for a vegan cookie of this size but I found that these double chocolate chip cookies were better than the non vegan ones I ve had in the past They are so so so good Whoever said that you need dairy and eggs in chocolate I have my omnivore friends and family try these cookies to show them that I am FAR from deprived Two thumbs up and highly recommended from this vegan chocoholic 
Amazing tea This tea is amazing It tastes fresh smooth and light It s just perfect I have about 2 3 cups a day Makes me feel great 
Lovely gift item This makes a lovely gift Everything is well packaged and looks expensive The teas are of good variety and well packaged to insure freshness Recommend 
Best ever Gluten free diets can be so much more varied with this product It can be coating to chicken or meat or can be added to juices broths to thicken It can even be used to make a perfect stuffing for chicken or turkey It has make my boring diet almost feel normal No feeling of deprivation any more 
Price is a big factor These are sweet and lightly chewy with a touch of lemon It s been a long time ago since I could get three organic healthy snack bars for a buck 
Good teeth strengthener Originally looked to buy the WASA Light Rye but it was out of stock So bought the Sourdough Rye and Multi Grain instead and glad I did because they have broadened my selection of favorite WASA brand crispbreads And while I normally avoid products with yeast I feel that the toasty crispness of the Multi Grain has neutralized any negative aspects that yeast is a negative is my story and I m stickin to it that may be derived from containing yeast As for varied uses it s equally great for strengthening the teeth and should be a great weight loss adjunct because it is not easy to eat fast and requires some mastication which should satisfy the need to have eaten when eaten as a cracker or mechanically grinding to a pouder for use to coat salmon coquettes Oh some more good news is that moths will try to eat through a package of rye crispbreads which means what s inside is edible for humans too I keep mine stored in the freezer because it is so valuable Should be a good nutrient source in case of prolonged emergencies as well Still my preference among all the WASA crispbreads is the light rye Only 2 ingredients rye flour and sea salt Just give me the simple life without the two accompanying airheads that is 
Wasa the best of the crispbreads I am addicted to Wasa Crispbread Multi Grain and you will be too Very Crisp and hearty flavor A healthy product with no saturated or trans fat and only 60 calories per portion The other Wasa products are also worth a try especially Sesame 
So good I ll actually spend a minute to give it 5 stars I ve never reviewed a food item before but this delectable little bar was so heavenly I had to change my mind At the time it was a mere snack in between classes afterwards it earned a place in my heart as well as my eternal devotion Toffee AND almonds + chocolate sigh What more could one ask for 
My favorite bar High in protein low in calories and great flavor I split them in half and eat the first portion as a mid morning snack and the second portion as an afternoon snack They keep me feeling full and prevent me from eating junk food which has been great for my waistline I can t say enough good things about Kashi 
BEST Protein Fiber Bar ever OK I eat a lot of protein fiber bars and most taste like cardboard or something worse This bar is the best I eat it for breakfast lunch or as dessert after dinner The texture reminds me of a chewy rice crispy treat seriously Love it 
Awesome protein bar great taste and very satisfying I love Kashi stuff and this bar is no exception There have just a great taste not too sweet no funny aftertaste and very satisfying when eaten between meals Highly recommended 
Go Kashi I am one hardly to ever leave product reviews and as much as I buy online I should work on that But after trying the various Kashi products these bars are by far the best and I feel the need to leave a review I started off eating the Kashi Honey Almond Flax granola bars which are very good but definitley not as sweet as these not a good OR bad thing just a comparison However you will still get the protein fiber and omega 3s if that s what you re looking for If you love chocolate and almonds and are looking for a protein fiber bar that tastes good and is more on the sweet side this is definitely one to try Whether you use them as a meal replacement or as a snack they are absolutley amazing and I will definitely be a repeat customer 
flaky can be good I like the basic Special K flakes made from rice wheat though I really shouldn t eat gluten Mostly I use cereal to snack on vs with milk boo lactose Special K tends to have more nutritional value than most cereals which I like too But I wasn t enamored with either the fruit or the yogurt parts of this particular cereal Frankly I think it would taste better without them or with something else The yogurt pieces didn t seem to merge well with the cereal IMHO But then that s why there s chocolate vanilla 
Good flavorful tea This is a great tea and very economical when buying bulk from Amazon I m very happy with it 
Great for weight watchers If you like strawberries you ll love Crunchies Only 98 calories per pouch I snacked on one pouch all day and didn t finish it off Very convenient resealable I have other varieties on order 
Great for gluten free diets Erewhon Rice Twice Cereal is a very flavorful crunchy gluten free cereal I highly recommend it to anyone who is on a gluten free diet 
Excellent alternative to Rice Krispies Love the whole grain rice it s crisy and it crackles and my gluten sensitive son loves it 
delicious Davinci Multicolor Tortellini Delicious tortellini from Italy Great experience like being delivered from a good italian restaurant This product has great taste texture and appearance My only disappointment was just upon arrival first opening the case The boxes seemed so little I mean compared to the 12 oz packages of pasta I m adjusted to buying It says 7oz right on the web page description very clear but somehow that hadn t really registered in my noggin However things got better I soon found out that 7 oz of tortellini cooks up pretty big more servings than I d have anticipated from the little boxes Very happy with the Davinci pastas I ve tried so far I d be complete if only they also made some pasta sauces for AMZN to send to my doorstep along with the pasta Anyway I recommend this tortellini It s great hot and come spring will also give it a whirl for cold pasta salad 
Good gluten free Clif Bar substitute It s hard to find gluten free energy bars that aren t too sweet and this totally fits the bill You wouldn t want to eat these as candy there s some subtle truth in advertising in the Choc Bar name say it out loud but I think I ate at least six of these on my last backpacking trip and I am pleased to report that these are VERY tasty with plenty of water when I ve been getting a serious workout and need the energy Comparing labels the nutrition and caloric content of an entire Choc Bar is pretty similar to that of a Clif Bar The label says the serving size is half a bar but that would be like eating half a Clif Bar there s no way I m stopping after just a few bites when I m in the middle of a nine mile hike 
Great taste and good price As a vegetarian you can use this is many ways as a meat substitute 
Good Coffee Great coffee and a bargain when buying it by the 5 pound bag California does some things better than us here in Indiana coffee is one of them 
Nice coffee Smooth flavorful coffee I wouldn t mind a little stronger flavor but it s very good Huge bag 
Look no further the perfect broth You ve just located the most healthy tasty and useful vegetarian broth manufactured today As a long time user I can tell you that Amazon offers the best possible price for this item I use it for everything a flavoring for plain rice as a broth for stir frying instead of oil as a base for complicated stews and soups If you find it a bit too salty just add more water It has no mysterious chemical additives It is perfect for heart patients diabetics vegans and folks who just like a fast soup treat 
Great soup mix try it Seitenbacher is a fabulous soup mix One canister makes 40 cups of broth which makes it incredibly inexpensive It s also delicious It makes a truly versatile soup base People love my nabeyakiudon Japanese noodle soup matzoah ball soup Jewish dumpling soup golden lentil stew Indian bean stew all of which have Seitenbacher as the base It works for people with allergies and food sensitivities no gluten no lactose no MSG no soy It s all natural and vegetarian no gelatin And I can t emphasize enough the rich deep flavor 
YUUUMMMMMMMMMY Thanks to our purchase of a Keurig I am a converted coffee drinker Timothy s German Chocolate Cake is my absolute favorite A delectable blend of warm caramel and coconut gives this coffee a deliciously sweet note while retaining a medium bodied blend It isn t too sugary it s just right In fact my hubby and his coworkers all claim this as their number one flavored coffee too It is scrumptious 
German Choc Coffee Great flavor and aroma An excellent choice for an evening coffee break 
Macaroni Cheese I love Velveeta and I love the rotini and cheese I have had it before but it is hard to find in the grocery stores I shop at I found it not to be as good as I remembered the broccoli was minimal at best 
Baking with SPLENDA I was eager to try the Sugar Blend for Baking I noticed a difference in the consistency of the cake batter and it did not rise as high and seemed to be more compact The usage guide was helpful and included a recipe on the package The flavor was comparable to regular sugar and those with diabetes are now able to enjoy some of the sweeter things in life 
My only sweetener I am crazy about Splenda I mix equal parts Splenda And Brown sugar for my hot cerael It saves money and calories Asparteem Nutrasweet gives me loose bowels Splenda meets my sweetner needs without calories 
Wonderful to reduce your sugar intake All the splenda products are good But I like the ones that are part splenda and part sugar as they are good for baking Good if you have a diabetic in the house or are trying extra hard to lose weight and are a sugarholic 
Delicious with minimal guilt This stuff is delicious I ve been buying it for years as a good quality fairly nutritious snack food for myself I feed the kids veggie booty and hog the sweet stuff and it seems to be a pretty good choice It doesn t take a lot to satisfy and it s not really that bad for you sugar sure but not as much as some other treats 
Messy hands if you suck on them I love these My son loves these You would think there wouldn t be a problem but he sucks on them As they melt his hands get sticky and then the furniture or toys he touches gets sticky also But they are so Yumm FYI 13 g of sugar Healthier cereal have 5 7 g so I guess it isn t so bad 
Bear Cookies Excellent cookies my boys love them know they are a treat that is on the healthy side We will buy these again 
Yum I love these cookies too They re crunchy animal cookies with a lemony coating that doesn t feel waxy in your mouth The lemon taste is great and they re not too sweet They re a perfect afternoon snack when you want a sweet treat but don t want to overdo it with calories or sugar The box is a little skimpy on the number of cookies you get but the taste is worth it 
great portion control These are a perfect size for work and great portion control I ordered a case for the ladies at work and we split it If you are counting calories this is the way to go 
Best Jerky ever I so love this Jerky It is moist but not too moist and has great flavor We have tried several of their flavors and they are all awesome Great prices for hormone free stuff and no preservatives Jerky tastes so much better and richer without MSG in it 
new tea drinker and this one has me SOLD on tea it was a little expensive but well worth it it lasts allday long or several teapot 
Great organic cookie I love these cookies The only complaint I had is that I ordered a case 12 boxes and the expiration date was 4 weeks from the day I received the shipment Yikes I still have over half the case left and I ve been eating them daily and giving them away I probably will not purchase again from this vendor for this reason alone However if you re looking for a great organic cookie without trans fats this is a nice healthy option 
Good stuff not for everyone I doubt if most kids would like this bar but health food fanatics will love it Subtle flavor mixed with chocolate Bar is very filling Dry use with water 
Yummy Bunnies My son 3 and I love these He likes to hop them around and kiss them before he eats them He likes all the Bunny Graham varieties chocolate honey cinnamon they taste like the traditional Graham crackers 
A veggie my kid likes No way Okay so I realize this isn t a real veggie merely a veggie that s been pureed and turned into a pea pod shaped chip But man they are GOOD What s more there aren t any bad ingredients in this product AND they re baked not fried Better still my kid prefers them to chips So while I don t totally win the Make Your Kid Love Veggies award with this snack I feel I m one step closer Oh and I love them too 
Fun little snack These are a fun little snack They taste good and are crunchy so you can pass on the potato chips They have two grams of fiber and a small amount of vitamins They are not low in calories so be careful of the amount you eat My daughter likes them which is a plus The price was good at Amazon but the shipping was steep 
Great for toddlers too Our whole family loves this snack These make a great toddler snack they re kind of puffy so if you don t actually chew them they ll just melt My 2 year old has been eating these for a year now and is constantly asking for his Peapods A portable snack far superior nutritionally to the typical cookie cracker goldfish pretzel and other processed junk most kids are eating These are just dehydrated snap peas corn oil and salt and there s still LESS sodium in these than Pepperidge Farm s low sodium goldfish A great alternative to the usual snack highly processed of white flour sugar salt and or chemical preservatives They re better for you and they taste great We love them 
They finally came to America I ve been over here in Japan for the past 3 years and haven t made too many visits to the states I will be returning next week though However this stuff is definitely one addictive snack In Japan it s marketed by the same company as Saya Endou Not a strong flavor just something to munch on Not too salty and not too sweet Kampeki Perfect A purchase of the snack is a victory against terrorism 
Yum I m excited to find these for sale on Amazon and at a very reasonable price I just tried them for the first time a few days ago and was wishing there was a nearby store that carried them Everyone I ve given them to has liked them even those who are not normally healthy eaters These crisps are reminiscent of puffy corn snacks like cheetos but with a different light flavor The calorie content is similar to other chip type snacks 150 per serving but these have the nutrition benefits of peas protein 5g per serving calcium 6 DV per serving and iron 4 DV per serving I haven t tried the Ceasar flavor yet but intend to do so in the near future 
Wonderful cereal This is a wonderful GF cereal It is crunchy a touch sweet and the fruit is a wonderful addition This is the first GF cereal that my son will really eat He frequently has 2 bowls and he does not eat much Highly recommend 
One of my favorites I m not a huge coffee fan most of the time I find it bitter Then there s the whole language you have to learn if you want to order it at one of the popular coffee joints But occasionally I do feel like I need that little surge of energy This Kona Blend coffee is the perfect choice It has a lot of flavor but none of the bitterness I find in a lot of other coffees This is the one I put in the coffee maker when I plan to spend the day cleaning house or working on my thesis It makes great iced coffee too 
My husband loves this coffee That s all that matters to me I can t always find it in stock at the local store and I want my husband to be able to enjoy it I m not a real coffee drinker but this Kona blend seems to lack the bitterness that first turned me off coffee years ago in the first place So I enjoy some of it too occasionally And whatever blend he s drinking my husband likes Millstone brand I know it always smells wonderful 
healthy and delicious I love this soup It is healthy vegetarian and low calore For a light meal I eat it alone When I want something more substantial I mix in leftovers and a dash of hot sauce The microwave bowls make a good portion size It is really convenient to have it delivered in bulk to my door 
Better than Cheese Doodles I ve tried the Andy Capp HOT FRIES WHITE CHEDDAR and these Regular CHEDDAR These have a satisfactory flavor and don t over do it I find them a good snack with tasty underlying corn flavor and a non greasy crispness that I like about the Andy Capp products They are different from Cheese Doodles Cheese Doodles are more about orange coatings and are uneven in texture I think it must be the corn potato combo in the Andy Capp products that makes them feel good to eat 
Love Andy Capp Fries Andy Capp Fries have become my favorite crunchy snack I like both the Chedder and Hot fries The texture and flavor from both varieties surpass my love of potatoe chips and cheese doodles Highly recommend Andy Capp fries in both flavors 
Great stuff Supposedly this is the safest artificial sweetener and it tastes fine too Favorite uses coffee tea and hot cereals such as oat bran and unsweetened oatmeal I ordered two of these gegunda boxes and am grateful for the opportunity to save so much money vs supermarket prices Unfortunately there was a terrible delay I ordered on Feb 2 and didn t receive until March 20 Otherwise no complaints and I m fixed for sweetener for a good year 
My husband can t tell the difference I think Splenda is great but I grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is is to let a sugar addict try it My husband happens to be one and he cannot tell the difference between Splenda and sugar in his tea As with other artificial sweeteners you get an unpleasant after taste with the Splenda there is none You can use this to cook with too It s a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar 
Great product This product has been a lifesaver to me With wheat allergies and loving pasta I thought I would never get to eat it again The pasta tastes great and my family doesn t even notice the difference they like it too Thanks Orgran 
I LOVE these I have sensitive to sugar teeth and these are beautiful and healthy Most granola bars you find in stores are full of sugar and have next to no nutritional value no thanks These are good for you and taste rather good too They are a bit bland but I like the texture with what s in them and how they re held together they re a bit like rice krispy treats but taste healthy Yum I love taking these to work for a quick snack instead of vending machine 
Amazing Tea I bought this tea for my mom for her birthday and everyone in the family loves it This is excellent chai tea 
Annie s rotini and cheese This is amazingly good Worlds apart from the usual mac and cheddar products on the market Really worth trying Delivery was fast and everything arrived just fine I highly recommend this product 
The Best Pemmican Premium and Long Lasting Peppered flavor is the Best I have ever had by far and I am a certified jerky freak They are not stringy or rubbery simply easy to eat and absolutely delicious 
Sulfa free dried fruit is fantastic As an asthmatic with a sulfa allergy I thought I was limited to naturally dried fruits which are tasty but not aesthetically appealing I d been looking for some way of getting my fix for dried fruit without running the risk of at worst a trip to the emergency room I d found a number of other freeze dried fruits but most of them had sugar added something I try to avoid I ordered this product Orchard blend with the hope that it would be flavorful Wow was it Aside from being good as a quick snack for when my blood sugar starts to drop it s also fantastic when mixed with plain oatmeal to give it a little something more I m extremely pleased with this product and I would recommend it to anyone that has been avoiding dried fruits because of a sulfa sensitivity or allergy 
It doesn t taste like diet food Excellent taste and texture The apples are the crunchiest but even the pulpier fruits have a pleasing texture If you really like your crunch I d go for the all apple product My only disappointment is that you re not getting a lot for your money I love the convenient portion control packaging but 1 10 for a 3 4 ounce 70 calorie serving makes me more worried about my wallet than my weight when considering what to snack on in the afternoon So I ll order more but these have become an occasional snack and not an everyday one 
MMMMMMM Good I found timely service and a surpisingly good tasting snack I have never had this type of dried fruit and was very satified as usually healthy things just don t taste that good Nice surprise 
Amazing cookies I bought some Nana s No Refined Sugar cookies in several flavors when a local health food store was having a moving sale They were so incredible I looked online and was delighted to find them on amazon and bought some here These cookies taste fantastic and they are very moist as well Really all of the flavors I tried choc chip coco chip and oatmeal raisin were outstanding 
Forget the Politics Forget the Earth Just Eat Green is good of course But what s much better than green are these truly awesome cookies PN Os beat the bootie out of any Oreo variation crunchier more filling without being smarmy much better taste And this goes for the mint the vanilla and the chocolate Fast Eddie Felson I love you 
Newman O s Fantastic My husband and I like the Newman O s better than Oreo s and our 3 year old son loves them As we did as a child he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling just like an oreo Also the Newman O s do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have 
So Much Better than those O s My children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream These are a bit softer than the O s we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat = We purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too YUMMY 
Stoneridge cherries good buy Nice chewy texture not fossilized like the health food store bulk bin kind and great taste Packaged as they are 2 resealable packages of 20oz each it s a very economical buy too Just store one in the fridge or freezer until you finish the first Our kids like these better than raisins 
Good Stuff I have ordered Stoneridge Orchards Dried Montmorency Cherries twice The cherries have arrived in good condition and taste wonderful 
These cherries are great I was very pleased with these dried cherries They are delicious not too sweet not too tart Healthy too 
Fabulous I ve never been a big fan of dried fruit good for you or not they are just too sweet for me But these montmorency cherries are wonderful It s the right mix of sweetness with tartness I LOVE to eat these straight out of the bag 
The Sahale boys have done it again This is yet another fabulous blend of ingredients not too sweet not too salty Great for kids and us big kids who are on the go and tired of the same old trail mix protein bars on the run Keep up the good wor 
GREAT I AM A PREDIABETIC PERSON THIS PRODUCT HELPS KEEP MY SUGAR UNDER CONTROL MY NUMBERS ARE GREAT AFTER I EAT THIS CEREAL 
Real Tasty Real Creamy Great treat for athletes watching sugar intake Love this oatmeal No sugar which is a bonus for athletes wanting good complex carbs w o added sugar one packet gives you a nice creamy treat Much creamier than other instant oatmeals Highly recommend it 
This is much better than the stuff in my grocery store This is great instant oatmeal I eat it almost every morning I used to buy the Quaker or store brand of the same flavor in the grocery store but I will continue to buy this It is very convenient to order this in quantity even though I m the only one in my household eating it since I go through it pretty quickly 
the description says it contains splenda Since the description says this product contains Splenda I don t understand why the guy who posted a bad review would avoid Amazon Grocery products at all costs just because he apparently didn t read the description before buying McCann s makes great oatmeal Read the description before buying ANYTHING would be my adivce 
popcorn Excellent product Amazon s prices were very good a few months ago However now the price is more than the popcorn costs in the grocery store 
A delicious breakfast cereal that leaves you wanting MORE This delicious breakfast cereal packs a punch and it doesn t overload you with too many calories or fat either It stays crunchy in milk and the honey nut taste beckons you to have another bowl The cereal is comparatively low in sugar certified kosher and it contains no trans fats hooray It offers potassium and the recipe keeps carbohydrates as low as possible 22 grams per serving 75 cup It does provide folic acid and 25 of your daily recommended allowance of iron but this is not a substitute for iron pills if your doctor wants you to take iron supplements This breakfast cereal contains almonds if you are allergic to any kind of nut PLEASE ask your physician before eating this cereal Overall this fantastic breakfast cereal is tasty and it stays crunchy in milk unless you leave it in milk for over 20 minutes or so It contains important nutrients but this cereal alone cannot be a substitute for any vitamins your doctor may want you to take It is priced about right and the sugar and iron will give you just enough of a kick to start your day Pick some up and enjoy them as much as I do SMILE 
Yum My family and I absolutly loved the SiNamon flavor of LesserEvil popcorn great flavor and the box was enough for a movie with the family Was it healthy Well it was better than movie theatre popcorn for sure but it is called Lesserevil not completely wholesome and good for you Good stuff overall and Amazon s price is great just make sure you like the flavor first because you hav e to buy a cas 
Being Evil is Fun Delightful popcorn mix which is great for snacks and is a really nice treat for lunches Very tasty and hits the spot for those sweet tooth cravings without being too far off the old diet Buying it here is a bargain too 
Cinnamon lovers rejoice Not only does this stuff taste wonderful but it s much healthier than most of the items on the grocery store shelves I would definitely recommend this as a great snack 
Bright colorful taste Even though it s all natural the taste is rich with fresh fruit flavor In this way it s even better than standard dried fruit 
Anything from Timothy s is terrific One of the best varietals I have tasted Smooth and rich almost syrupy like most of Timothy s coffees Delicious 
Timothy s World Coffee Nice flavor and aroma I like the darker blends and this is a little light but still flavorful 
Best Cranberries on the Market I ve tried several different cranberries and these are by far the best on the market I received these today and had another brand available to taste test compare The ingredients listed on each package were the same but Bob s has fewer calories and a much sweeter taste The berries do cost a little more but they are worth every penny The following recipe is great 1 2 cup Bob s Red Mill Extra Thick Rolled Oats Only brand I use 1 Cup 100 Juice Apple Cider 1 2 Tablespoons dried cranberries Brown Sugar to taste Cook Oatmeal Apple Cider Cranberries in microwave approximately 5 minutes Add brown sugar stir allow to sit 2 3 minutes Add additional cider after cooking if you like a thinner oatmeal If only Amazon sold Bob s Rolled Oats 
Not bad at all I bought this on something of a whim I like some of Genisoy s other products and was worried that it would be terrible But it really isn t bad The instructions read For best results add 1 scoop of powder to 8 oz of protein fortified nonfat milk and mix in an electric blender or in a shaker Can also be mixed with water or other beverage of choice I didn t want the extra added calories of the milk plus I m lactose intolerant so I went ahead and mixed it with water worried it would be bland It was pretty tasty The reason they say to put in a blender or shake is because it s difficult to mix it gets very thick Kosher status isn t clear here on amazon but it s got a circle K hechshar if this is relevant for you And this particular product has many more vitamins and mineratals than the Genisoy Ultra XT product I m going to go out and get the vanilla too Definitely recommended 
In a word delicious These cookies are unbelievably good Perfect with a cup of coffee or tea perfect alone I stopped buying them because I just could not stop eating them If I could buy them in packs of three or four then I could have them in the house again 
Yummy Planters Cashews in Milk Chocolate are SO SO delicous I am absolutely addicted They are so good a great snack or dessert And they even come in different sizes one size for home and one smaller size for on the go I could not ask for tastier chocolate or more wonderful tasting cashews Try em Amazoners you will love them Thank you 
Gloria Jeans K Cups Hazelnut 25 Count Box Pack of 2 Tastes great and the price was good 
Yummy Granola Bars I usually hates granola bars They tend to be too sweet and I am not crazy about the texture My 3 year old son s daycare requires all new kids to pack an earthquake emergency kit yet we live in California and one of the required items is 10 granola bars I bought this just to prepare the kit hoping that he would never have to eat them Since the product comes with 30 bars I took some to the office as my emergency stash They are actually quite tasty My son also likes them as a quick afternoon snack while we are out and about Never thought we would actually consume them when I bought this but it looks like we will reorder soon And it s organic 
Graet product great price I have used this product for a long time as Lipton has always been a trusted brand I do go through A LOT of tea so buying it on Amazon was quick and more affordable then other stores 
this decaf is pretty smoooooth My family loves this coffee This decaf is very smooth it does not have a weird decaf aftertaste and we will continue to order this It s the next best thing to having Kona coffee which we cannot always afford 
Great texture The shells are a nice change from the otherwise limited choices of Gltuen Free pasta shapes I will buy these again 
POPP N FINE STUFF WONDERFULLY TOTALLY DELICIOUS YOU DON T WANT TO FINISH THE LAST KERNAL IT S JUST SO POPP N GOOD 
the popcorn s a hit Both adults and kids alike very much enjoyed this popcorn Nice cheddar flavor without any yellow hands 
Lower price I buy this at Sam s Club for about 12 2 Before I became enlightened re organic products I was a Folgers user This coffee is a deeper roast and has a higher acid level but is flavorful For the price this is an incredible deal 
Wonderful Tea to Drink When Feeling Ill This tea is comforting when feeling ill or under the weather Also it has a pleasant taste I highly recommend it 
Still buying these years later The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I ve become weary reading labels I ve started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality Nature s Path Organic Blueberry Toaster Pastries are made organic wheat flour and they are absolutely delicious They heat up fast in the toaster for breakfast with a cup of tea and are convenient for a snack I d go as far as to say these are better than cookies TheRebeccaReview com 
Tasty I enjoy this cereal with vanilla rice milk It is good Especially when I eat it which is what I do 
Tastes very good This fills me up and it tastes very good I only with the box was bigger I can only get 2 bowls per box 
Delicious I have eaten this amazing cereal every morning for a year and I still look forward to eating it It has an interesting flavor that I know I will never get tired of I highly recommend trying it 
Great Cereal This is my favorite cereal I recommend it to everyone I can I eat a bowl every morning at 9 am and am still full at lunch time Best of all it tastes great I agree with previous reviewer that the flax seeds are tasty but probably useless as the body can t break down a whole flax seed to obtain the Omega 3 but it adds nice texture and nuttiness Also Amazon has a great price on this vs grocery stores 
Great price good quality This is our favorite cereal And it s so much cheaper here than at the grocery store The boxes run out fast so it s nice to have several and not have to buy it at the store all the time 
The best granola nay the best cereal ever I first tried this granola when they had it at Costco and since then I was hooked I was never a huge fan of granola to begin with I usually liked the taste but a lot of granolas were very hard and crunchy even when eaten with milk A lot of them were also either too sweet or not sweet enough So when I tried this granola it immediately blew away all my preconcieved notions involving granola This granola is what granola should be not too sweet and easily softened in milk The flavor is awesome I have since tried most of the other Nature s Path granola flavors and they are all pretty good as well but I think I still like this one the best Also this one has omega 3 in it which is good for you Anyway this is definitely my favorite cereal and it must be if I m going to the length of ordering it on the internet I just ordered my second 6 pack and I don t think I m getting tired of it anytime soon 
Comfort y LIke oatmeal with good taste and texture a little sweet I cut it with plain oatmeal 
Triple good Can t stop eating them You won t want anything on them either They are that good Warning be prepared for quite a number of broken and crumbled crackers from the shipping 
Delicious and gluten free Excellent product for those on a wheat free diet Have a hamburger again with a REAL bun Even better if you microwave for 20 seconds prior to eating Enjoy 
Tasty cookies These cookies are very good and you can actually eat quite a few before the calorie count starts to add up I shared them with some friends and everyone thought they were excellent 
Great alternative to sugary drinks This product is great Very refreshing It tastes just like you are drinking it straight from a young coconut It doesn t have any added sugar it s only 60 calories a serving I just wish it were cheaper 
Relieves leg cramps If you have ever had trouble with leg cramps be sure to drink Zico It will relieve your cramps almost instantly probably because it is so high in potassium I have recommended it to others and it always works Pat Rampolla 
Great for trips I personally like the taste of this product but I can see that others may not The taste is unusual with natural tones I definitely like the packaging Standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time but a box of Zico survived a 2 week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine 
This product is awesome I found this product in the store and the packaging caught my attention I love everything it has to offer I tried one sip and I fell in love It quenches your thirst much better than water and has a subtle appealing taste I can t believe anyone could complain about the taste I live with chronic pain and there are days that I can t get out of bed and I drink and eat nothing all day I now have this product to enjoy along with the benefits it offers I am addicted and plan to always have this product on hand 
The Difference between Coconut Water and Milk Ignore the review below me as she is incorrect Coconut water is simply the liquid taken from the center of young coconuts Their is no chemical wizardry all you need is a knife and a straw As coconuts mature this water is absorbed into the flesh When this coconut flesh is ground and strained coconut milk is produced the liquid of pina coladas These drinks are quite good if you enjoy coconut water 
LOVED IT MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE BEEN OFF SUGAR FOR SEVERAL YEARS WE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THESE SPIRULINA BARS SURE THEY ARE GREEN YET THAT IS THE COLOR OF SPIRULINA MY HUSBAND HAS PASSED THESE BARS OUT TO A NEIGHBOR AND OUR CHIROPRACTOR AND THEY LOVE THE BAR ALSO MY HUSBAND TRAVELS ALOT FROM WORK SITE TO WORK SITE AND THIS SPIRULINA BAR HELPS HIM WITH HIS HUNGER PAIN IN A NUTRITIOUS WAY 
A little sour but overall filling and good I ve been wanting to try Spirulina the superfood that everyone in the health world swears by and figured this would be as good an opportunity as any to do so The bar is a medium sized green rectangle It smells interesting and is very moist and chewy I m not a big fan of sour foods so I didn t like that it tasted a bit sour My brother however LOVED this bar more than all the others we tried Has a lot of cashew and is very sweet and packed with good fats VERY FILLING Overall if you like sour and sweet this bar is for you 
good not very vanilla this is a really good sweet granola great with vanilla soymilk in a bowl mellow sweet taste no distinctive vanilla flavor i would buy it again 
Great Granola This granola is great tasting and healthy Other brands of granola have unhealthy oils in them but this granola does not Apple blueberry is my family s favorite flavor 
Crunchy Cereal With Domineering Pecans This is a great granola that is both nutritious and delicious Although it is called Cranberry Pecan I find the pecan taste to predominate in the mix while the cranberries are quite chewy and weaker than in some other cereals This is a traditional cereal and is a great way to start the day It is relatively high in calories but appropriate for breakfast in suggested quantities The texture is very crunchy and while I prefer the Bear Naked texture which is softer this is still a wonderful product In the six pack the cereal is very reasonably priced and given the quality of the product is an excellent value I recommend this cereal to anyone and especially to people who love pecans 
Love it very much We got 6 pacages of Nature All Natural Granola French Vanilla about three weeks ago and we are almost finishing all of them Very cruncy and tasty especially with milk 
Good and chewy This granola is very good it s very chewy and takes a long time to chew the dried cranberries are very chewy I think it would taste great on a salad or mixed in with other cereal I wonder if cooking it like hot oatmeal would soften it 
Navitas naturals Organic Raw Cacao Nibs Couldn t find this item in any stores in my town so I went to Amazon naturally and found it The item was delivered on time too Thanks Amazon 
Best price fine quality I ve been eating cacoa nibs for a few years now from other stores This one has just the same quality for 1 2 the price elsewhere 
raw cacao nibs These were exactly what i wanted and tasted great in my home made mint cocoa nib ice cream where the bitterness didn t turn you off from the product 
It s healthy but While I m quite impressed with the health claims for these nibs frankly they taste like dirt Or what I imagine dirt would taste like I don t understand how one reviewer got the nibs to melt When I tried it I got hot dirt I finally settled on grinding them fine mixing them with peanut butter sweetener regular cocoa powder and a little milk It s not bad but maybe next I ll just get some really dark chocolate Life s a little short to be eating dirt 
Healthy convenient snack We keep a big basket of these for tossing into the lunchboxes or grabbing on the way out the door For those of us who are concerned about bovine growth hormones in cheese products they re a great alternative to some of the other cheese crackers out there 
The kids love these great for school snacks My kids love these snacks and now they are in a handy bag for school snacks It makes me feel good that I ve sent my children off with a healthy snack Will buy them again good price 
Finally natural snacks that actually taste good Ever since having my little girl five years ago I have been dedicated to serving her wholesome nutritious and natural foods This can be a difficult task in today s world with so many processed nutritionless foods filled with harmful perservatives and trans fat I didn t want to deny my daughter snacks but I hated the idea of giving her foods filled with chemicals and hydrogenated oils So it is no surprise that I was thrilled when I stumbled on Annie s Homegrown products Here is a brand that I can serve to my child without guilt All of their products are made with a small handful of natural ingredients that we all can recognize and pronounce No partially hydrogenated oils no preservatives no ungodly amounts of sodium And they are delicious to boot My daughter goes crazy for these little cheddar bunnies They are perfectly cheesy and not too salty and their cute shape appeals to little ones This is a company that cares about what you feed your children and yourself And that is a company I am happy to support 
My daughter LOVES them My daughter is addicted to Chedder Bunnies LOL Which is fine because they are not made with any hydrogenated oils They are her favorite snack and she asks for them everyday We are always stocked with a box or two 
My 17 month old loves them Just the right size snack pack for my 17 month old Healthier alternative to other packaged crackers without sacrificing taste 
great for kids and adults These are just delicious and I like having the controlled portions in the bags a very satisfying snack for 150 calories 
Natural Cheese Crackers Great for Snack Mixes made without hydrogenated oils which is a good thing since it s difficult for our bodies to absorb trans fatty acids that come from hydrogenated oils box These are definitely natural snack crackers to bounce around about I mean it is so rare to find even natural foods without hydrogenated oils I can t count the times I ve read labels only to be disappointed to find that natural does not always mean healthy Ingredients Certified organic wheat flour expeller pressed safflower oil aged cheddar cheese contains milk salt enzymes cheese culture salt yeast extract paprika annatto extract for color ground celery seed onion powder yeast I ve made my own cheese crackers and these really do taste homemade About 24 tiny crackers will satisfy any cheese cracker craving and that is about 70 calories These crackers are Bernie the Bunny Annie s beloved mascot approved They are also made with only vegetarian ingredients I love the cute rabbit shape and you can add these crackers into snack mixes with pumpkin seeds chocolate chips dried cranberries GeniSoy Soy Nuts and anything else you can think of including sunflower seeds TheRebeccaReview com

yumminess so good i love bear naked i think the fruit and nut is the best out of their varieties 
Granola Fruit and Nut This is a great tasting granola It is good as a cereal or as a snack I can save money when I buy the box at Amazon instead of at the grocery store 
Excellent quality flavor and eat ability and Amazon s price can t be beat I first purchased Bear Naked Low Sugar granola from a brick mortar grocery store for 4 59 for the 12 ounce bag I loved it and keep it in my office at work to incorporate into any flavor of yogurt or to satisfy those late afternoon munchies It s nutritious delicious and wholesome The Amazon price is an absolute steal for this product over 1 less per bag than you might pay at a store down the street Having tried Bear Naked s other products I can also assure you that you are not sacrificing flavor or texture by choosing the low sugar option 
Delicious Guess what I m eating right now You guessed it Bear Naked Banana Nut Granola I was in the organic section of a grocery store the other night looking for low fat granola I m on a low fat diet to help combat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides wince I bought myself a 12 oz packages of the Banana Nut as well as the Bear Naked Peak Protein Granola The latter was so so but the Banana Nut YUM It s delicious plain in my opinion but you could certainly eat it with milk soy milk as cereal or mix in with some yogurt There are 11 servings per bag about 1 4 cup and here are some nutritional facts per 1 4 Cup 140 calories 60 from fat Total Fat 7 g 10 DV NO Trans Fat NO Cholesterol 5 mg sodium 17 g carbs 3 g dietary fiber 5 g sugars 3 g protein If you love organic hand made nutritional products Bear Naked Banana Nut is wonderful It contains almonds and tastes a bit like dried banana chips + tasty granola P S The price here at Amazon is a STEAL I would have paid over 10 more if I would have bought the same quantities at the grocery store 
Still a Great Treat I have to say that this 100 count box is a great deal for your money Although this isn t a full size Slim Jim but rather a shorter one it s the perfect size for a lunch box surprise or a mid afternoon pick me up Slim Jim has managed after all these years to still provide the same taste of slightly spicy slightly salty goodness and you won t go wrong with the 100 count box 
Never quite sure what it actually is but it is a unique taste There is a reason that Slim Jim doesn t ever quite say what it is It isn t a beef stick It isn t jerky It is what it is I remember eating them when they first came out and wondering what they were Now tasting them again I remember the question There is some kind of meat in there but it is treated in a lot of different ways A Slim Jim is still as greasy as I remember as well The trick is to enjoy them without eating them to excess For what they are they are convenient tasty and can be fun 
A tasty treat anytime While on the computer in your car at work or just want a tasty snack Slim Jim is the perfect treat Not big enough to ruin an appetite for meals it is just the right size to curb hunger and tastes great The size of the Slim Jim in the 100 count box fits anywhere pocket purse glove compartment so you can have a snack anytime Enjoy 
Ate Them As A Kid Still Good When I was a kid I ate slim jims all the time I am glad that they still taste the same Unfortunately nowadays they like to change and mess with too many of the things that we grew up with and loved as children Here s what I used to do and still do I get the end real wet until the skin gets to the point that you can slough it off without breaking it I eat the skin and then I slowly chomp the stick until it s all gone Then I grab another and do it all over again And I don t care how many of these you ll try to eat in a week a box of 100 is guaranteed to last a long time This is a good buy I recommend the good ol slim jim 
Best Coconut Water Ever I have tried most varieties of Coconut water and this one is by far the best My wife is the pickiest person I know and even she loved them I know they are slightly expensive But when you wife is Pregnant and wants Coconut water you had better get her the best 
Great alternative to sugary drinks This product is great Very refreshing It tastes just like you are drinking it straight from a young coconut It doesn t have any added sugar it s only 60 calories a serving I just wish it were cheaper 
Tried the Sampler Pack Excellent One of the few food items I ve found on here that I think I ll buy again Remember that it s best chilled ice cold if you re ever gonna sample it Not so good when not so cold great when actually cold Very refreshing feel either way though after you ve had a drink 
Fantastic Healthy Food I ve been eating these bars for breakfast and they re a great alternative to the typical sugar filled selections If you re trying to find foods low in saturated fats and refined sugars these bars are a fantastic find 
It s a Meal This is unlike any other bar I ve tried I like that it s gooey green I m tired of the drier oat like bars It s satisfying tasty May not be for everyone though I only wish more ingredient percentages would be listed on the Amazon descriptions most of these things are pretty high fat Ok for a meal on the run 
Healthy delicious snack I received it quickly and was happy with the delicious alternative to plain granola It s a healthy snack that s great on yogurt and a good alternative to other cereals 
good not very vanilla this is a really good sweet granola great with vanilla soymilk in a bowl mellow sweet taste no distinctive vanilla flavor i would buy it again

Love it very much We got 6 pacages of Nature All Natural Granola French Vanilla about three weeks ago and we are almost finishing all of them Very cruncy and tasty especially with milk 
A great way to start or end your day Absolutely scrumptious granola that is good for you low fat high fiber a delicious alternative to the bland tasteless granolas produced by the major American cereal makers I ve tried virtually all of the Back to Nature products and each and every one is sensational Do yourself a favor and try this product Highly recommended 
Good and chewy This granola is very good it s very chewy and takes a long time to chew the dried cranberries are very chewy I think it would taste great on a salad or mixed in with other cereal I wonder if cooking it like hot oatmeal would soften it 
Great Healthy Snack Back to Nature Apple Strawberry Granola are an excellent product for a healthy breakfast or snack Each flavor of the Back to Nature Granola is tasty I would be careful before ordering this product in bulk My order of 6 bags came in this week and they are due to expire on September 15th I did not realize before ordering that this product was getting ready to expire and would not have placed the order had I known this As this is a food product it is not eligible for return So while this is an excellent product I would not recommend ordering this from Amazon Grocery unless you are prepared to have a bulk order of food that is getting ready to expire 
Happy Chocolate I have been using the Navitas Natural Organic Raw Cacao Nibs for four months now and it gives me a feeling of happiness well being and energy for the day We add it to our fruit smoothie in the morning I don t eat chocolate with dairy and sugar as it gives me pimples However I can tolerate the nibs 
Great on ice cream These nibs are great on ice cream or with cool whip Not good alone but paired with a sweet they are great I am going to try cookies next week I have already bought more 
Best price fine quality I ve been eating cacoa nibs for a few years now from other stores This one has just the same quality for 1 2 the price elsewhere 
It s healthy but While I m quite impressed with the health claims for these nibs frankly they taste like dirt Or what I imagine dirt would taste like I don t understand how one reviewer got the nibs to melt When I tried it I got hot dirt I finally settled on grinding them fine mixing them with peanut butter sweetener regular cocoa powder and a little milk It s not bad but maybe next I ll just get some really dark chocolate Life s a little short to be eating dirt 
Good for the body You have to use this product a special way to appreciate all it does for you It is very good for the body I tried to eat some right out of the bag but decided it is best to put it in other food items like homemade cookies or my applesause Good stuff 
BITTER BITTER BITTER These little nibs are very bitter I wouldn t recomend poppin them straight from the bag They were fabulous melted in a pan with some sweetner dip with chunked fruit lay on tray covered with wax paper and refridgerate for 20 min The chocolate hardens Raspberries are my families favorite but any fruit works Also very good sprinkled in warm milk for a homemade hot chocolate This is a great product for experimental food people Straight out of the bag disappointing

fantastically refreshing I bought the natural flavour Didn t find it very palatable the first time But the next time was much better and now I am hooked on to it An acquired taste indeed The 11 ounce is difficult to down in one go though 
Mango is really mango e If you dont like mangos you will not like this drink It does not taste like an organic mango but rather it tastes more like the essence of mango you would smell from an air freshener This does mix pretty well with cold rum I would suggest you find this brand locally to try it before you buy it This water does not taste like the water you would get from the Asian countries I cant really explain why either

Best of the best Bear Naked is my favorite granola and Fruit and Nut is by far my favorite flavor I came across Bear Naked because one of my favorite breakfast s is granola mixed with banana and yogurt When I went off of refined sugar I was having the hardest time finding a granola without sugar added Bear Naked uses all natural sugars like pear juice and maple syrup My favorite part of this flavor is the dried cranberries and the coconut plus the almonds add crunch to an overall chewy texture I recommend this brand to all lovers of granola and to anyone looking for a healthy treat 
The best darn granola on the planet Bear Naked Granola is just fabulous I ve tried every granola around and Bear Naked strikes the right balance between crunchy sweet and ostensibly good for you And Amazon s price certainly beats what you d pay at the store 
cheaper than one by one at the store Good low sodium low sugar granola that I feel I can t afford at the onesie price in the traditional shopping venues 
Granola Fruit and Nut This is a great tasting granola It is good as a cereal or as a snack I can save money when I buy the box at Amazon instead of at the grocery store

Delicious Guess what I m eating right now You guessed it Bear Naked Banana Nut Granola I was in the organic section of a grocery store the other night looking for low fat granola I m on a low fat diet to help combat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides wince I bought myself a 12 oz packages of the Banana Nut as well as the Bear Naked Peak Protein Granola The latter was so so but the Banana Nut YUM It s delicious plain in my opinion but you could certainly eat it with milk soy milk as cereal or mix in with some yogurt There are 11 servings per bag about 1 4 cup and here are some nutritional facts per 1 4 Cup 140 calories 60 from fat Total Fat 7 g 10 DV NO Trans Fat NO Cholesterol 5 mg sodium 17 g carbs 3 g dietary fiber 5 g sugars 3 g protein If you love organic hand made nutritional products Bear Naked Banana Nut is wonderful It contains almonds and tastes a bit like dried banana chips + tasty granola P S The price here at Amazon is a STEAL I would have paid over 10 more if I would have bought the same quantities at the grocery store 
Not bad I hesitate to write a review about a food because well one man s meat is another man s poison I like the not too sweet and minimally processed taste of this brand the Banana flavour is our favourite The Fruit and Nut flavour lacks a little oomph and the fruit inside is too tangy for my taste buds so maybe TOO minimally processed Also remember that All Natural is NOT organic even if you find this in the health food section of your grocery store Our local Target also carries this brand of granola and has the best price for it 
Being Naked Is Good I love granola and cereal in general but I have to say that this is the very best granola I have ever had The people at Bear Naked have a philosophy that I love and which is on the back of every bag we believe food should be hand made from wholesome and natural ingredients you can actually pronounce Although I do eat processed food I appreciate the appeal of the more traditionally prepared foods and this granola tops the list for nutrition and taste Like most granola it is high in calories and fat but take note that the fat comes largely from the nuts contained it also contains expeller pressed canola oil and it has no trans fat and only 1 5g of saturated fat per serving This cereal is softer than most granola though not soft enough for me to consider it chewy It does have large chunks of nuts and also contains cranberries and flax seed for optimal nutritional and digestive health The six pack sold on Amazon makes the price per package reasonable the ingredients are quite expensive so as a value proposition I think this is not only a great product but a great buy Delicious and nutritious a great combination that I recommend highly 
Mom of 4 We love this granola Bear Naked makes wonderfully nutritious and delicious granola We love eating the Banana flavor by the handfuls and the Peak Protein flavor mixed in with our yogurt Amazon sells it for a great price too 
Never quite sure what it actually is but it is a unique taste There is a reason that Slim Jim doesn t ever quite say what it is It isn t a beef stick It isn t jerky It is what it is I remember eating them when they first came out and wondering what they were Now tasting them again I remember the question There is some kind of meat in there but it is treated in a lot of different ways A Slim Jim is still as greasy as I remember as well The trick is to enjoy them without eating them to excess For what they are they are convenient tasty and can be fun 
A tasty treat anytime While on the computer in your car at work or just want a tasty snack Slim Jim is the perfect treat Not big enough to ruin an appetite for meals it is just the right size to curb hunger and tastes great The size of the Slim Jim in the 100 count box fits anywhere pocket purse glove compartment so you can have a snack anytime Enjoy 
Ate Them As A Kid Still Good When I was a kid I ate slim jims all the time I am glad that they still taste the same Unfortunately nowadays they like to change and mess with too many of the things that we grew up with and loved as children Here s what I used to do and still do I get the end real wet until the skin gets to the point that you can slough it off without breaking it I eat the skin and then I slowly chomp the stick until it s all gone Then I grab another and do it all over again And I don t care how many of these you ll try to eat in a week a box of 100 is guaranteed to last a long time This is a good buy I recommend the good ol slim jim 
Delicious nutritious tasty and satisfying I keep these and the cheese filled type on hand When I need to carry a snack in my handbag to get me thru a long day I reach for them I keep a box in my office This is a snack you can feel good about and enjoy My kids are grown but if they weren t I d be giving them these instead of the garbage sold widely in stores The ingredients quality and taste make these a great family choice for quick snacks any time 
much better than the overly processed regular pb crackers I love the taste of the snack crackers I enjoy knowing they are organic and I can read the ingredients and know what they are Okay they are the healthiest snack but occassionally is ok 
the best cheese crackers for kids big kids too our family loves these Annie s is a great company my teenage son takes a box to each away ballgame to share with his teammates my husband has a handful with his glass of wine in the evening wine and cheese very cheesy and healthy too plus who can resist the cute bunny shape try some 
Wish I Could Buy it Locally Simply the best boxed cereal I ever ate Wonderful crunchy texture delicious oats plentiful raisins I could go on but it is only cereal after all But it s that good 
Taste Great for only 25 calories I have to say this is a great tasting hot cocoa It does taste diety and each packet is only 25 calories Try it you ll like it its worth the money 
Good Taste and Good Carbs A little hard to mix in but a good one 
fabulous product I love this organic high grade cracker actually I am adicted to them 
An All Time Favorite First I would like to remind people that these are flatbread so they re harder thicker than crackers They have a great taste I even eat them plain sometimes with chili or soup etc One of the things that I like about them is that they don t get soggy when I put something on them They stay nice firm crunchy If you re looking for a nice crunchy treat these are wonderful If you don t like biting into something that s quite firm then you d better try something else 
My Satisfying Crunchy Snack I love these Krackers Put a little Smart Balance Peanut Butter on and it makes for a great pick me up when I m hungry 
Delicious Kind of hard though I thought these crackers were delicious They had a rich flavor and the pumpkin seeds were a nice touch My only complaint was that they were very hard and I couldn t bite into them I had to break them into pieces to eat them Maybe I just have sensitive teeth Regardless I thought they were very satisfying and one cracker was a very nice snack for only 100 calories 
Perfect Lunch for Work Another perfect lunch for work The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is the need for more chunky veggies in the soup otherwise the taste and convenience is exceptional 
I must have gotten all their barely While I agree that this soup is a bit saltier than it could should be I truly enjoy it And for the record I am horrified that anyone who s bought and doesn t like the taste would throw away perfectly good food that could be donated or given away What a disgusting waste Anyway this soup has plenty of barley and while it doesn t have the volume of beef chunks that a Campbell s Chunky soup might have they aren t as sparse as some of the other comments would have you think I found the consistency of the soup just fine when I heated it thorougly but it can be a little gloopy when it s only warmed instead of well heated I work out of my home and get some hectic days where I can t afford the time to make a lunch or go out and grab fast food This soup is my mainstay for a quick and nourishing bowl of energy replenishment because the ease of microwaving it in the pouch can t be beat I have just enough time to gather my bowl spoon and iced tea and the soup is ready All in all I will be buying this product again 
Great coffee This is an excellent coffee with a bold flavor and aroma Much better than anything you can get on store shelves 
Good flavor good value The Senseo system is the best home brew coffee ssystem I ve found While the Sumatran blend is my favorite the Brazilian is not far behind 
Very Pleased with the Product Extremely pleased with the product and with the price point at which Amazon had offered it The 3 75 ounce can contains larger sardines typically 3 or 4 I m looking forward to trying the 4 and 3 8 ounce cans when next offered as I suspect that it contains smaller sardines In any case Reese and Amazon constitute an incredible value 
skinless and boneless sardines This is the best price to buy the best protein from the sea Sardines are vegetarians and least toxic of all the fish in the ocean 
Savory and Smooth I like a good cup of Joe and when our friends turned us on to Kona coffee we were instant fans But the cost was killing us So when I saw that Amazon had their new grocery line I was on it checking out their price This is a great cup of Kona for the price I hate bitter coffee this is smooth 
great but not crazy about the noodles I ve had miso soups at various restaurants and this is actually really good I love the fact they are environmentally concerned with their products I ll buy their products just knowing they care so much about how much we have to throw away so it s biodegradable Only thing I m not crazy about is the noodles I would have preferred a thinner noodle only because it s so bulky and not really typical of Asian dish 
Finally A Fast Good Udon Soup Finally there is a quick way to make a great Udon Soup at home For any Udon fan this is a must try product The noodles are as good as Udon noodles get and the soup mix is great base to start your Udon Here is the way we make Udon using this product as a base We take the noodles and soup mix from two packages bowls add some additional soy sauce and spices we like and boil it all in a pan you don t need to screw around with all the noodle rinsing just throw them in the pot When the soup and noodles are warm we add chopped romaine This is super good and costs less than for two LARGE servings of Udon a deal by any standard When we really want a full on Udon we add some sliced pressed fish like the restaurants use in traditional Udon the half moon pressed fish white with the orange red coating and shrimp This is heavenly 
Tasty Healthy and 1 Minute to make These only take 1 minute to make the noodles are already expanded as in NOT DRY They taste great and I dont feel like I just ate fast food when I finish one of them or two 
wow love at 1st bite I started to love Annie Chun s udon soup in March 2007 Although it was on my AMAZON GROCERY LIST for many months cause i read a very bad review from a guy that did not know what is great I just ordered many A Chun s soup noodle bowls And i will order more again in future Annie Chun is a cute and talented woman and she is the 1st Asian female that i admired and read her story about her soup noodle for second time on Amazon com 
Very Nice Tom Yum Soup I added a half of dozen or so of frozen pre cooked shrimp and this was great as an evening meal The package includes the spices that one would expect to find in a Tom Yum Thai soup While the quality may not be what one might expect to find in a good Thai restaurant preparation in five minutes is surely an acceptable compromise 
Excellent dark roast coffee This coffee is a wonderful dark roast Once it is opened the 5 pound bag also maintains its freshness longer than many other brands 
Excellent Dark Roast Fogbuster is excellent for a dark roast and the 5lb bag is a great value If you re looking for something mild I d suggest Jeremiah s espresso or Kona blend 
Great Snack or Treat for Entire Family I bought a case of these for my son he s a toddler and my husband and I have wound up snacking on them too I think it s sort of hard to come up with a large assortment of quick n easy 100 organic nutritionally alright snacks these days in a super busy household and the Late July products make it simple 
Great Product These crackers are the best I ve found and my husband has tried them all I m the organic nut and I ve slowly been converting him from conventional to organic I ll compromise but he won t so whatever organic products I give him have to be as good as or better than what he s accustomed to and Late July crackers fit the bill 
A perfect substitute Being dairy free and not wanting to eat high fructose corn syrup I was thrilled to find crackers that could replace other buttery tasting crackers My favorite lunch Wolfgang Puck soup with Late July crackers crumbled into it Yumm 
Great alternative to traditional brands I have been looking for a long time for a cracker to substitute for the main two brands available nationwide All the others I had tried were not approved by my family for a variety of reasons mainly not having any taste These crackers are light crispy and great tasting These will replace all the other ones we used to buy even my picky 4 year old likes them 
Bunch of Munch These delicious mini crackers are small enough to grab a satisfying handful Yep it s got all the organic requisites organically fed cows whose lips never taste hormones or antibiotics well maybe these are injected I don t know and the crackers contain non hydrogenated trans fat free organic palm oil The taste is mild but you can taste the cheddar and the texture is more flakey than hard or brittle If you grab 30 crackers one ounce there are 5ounces or 150 crackers per box you ll get 310 mg of sodium or 13 of the Recommended Daily Value RDV for a 2 000 calorie diet Now that s by any means low sodium but you can easily eat half of that and feel you ve had a snack Per 30 crackers there are 4 5 grams g oftotal fat of which 1 5 are saturated and none are trans fat Total carbohydrates are 19g including less than 1g of sugar but also less than 1g of dietary fiber Hey noone said this is health food but compare this to what you re snacking on now and that cheese gives it 3g of protein Full ingredients and nutritional information may be found at latejuly com products but other good stuff includes organic wheat flour organic whey sea salt and organic evaporated cane juice Nothing artificial no corn syrup preservatives hydrogenated oils and they re both Kosher and Lacto Vegetarian gotta make sure there s no meat in your crackers If that s not enough Late July is independently owned and family operated Mainly though it s the light taste the organic ingredients and that enticing small size you can grab by the fistful Full information at the above mentioned website 
Great organic product If you re looking for an organic version of Ritz this is the one for you Some breakage from shipping but a tasty little snack 
We love this stuff My sister in law introduce me to this product We LOVE pizza in our house and we could probably eat it every single day if possible This crust is so easy My 5 year old helps us make the pizza all the time It s perfect for the 9 round pan You put sauce on and your favorite topping and into the oven it goes I highly recommend for everyone to try Especially if you have kids this can get them involved 
Fresh and crunchy This microwave oven popcorn pops light and fluffy When it s popping it actually smells like popcorn and not like some kind of artificially flavored buttery grease There is a hint of salt and light butter It s really good stuff unless you re looking to replicate the trans fat experience of the movie theater concession stand 
Good Coffee This type of coffee was very good I thought it might be a bit darker but overall it has a good taste and aroma 
Why is it so hard to get This is the best but so hard to find I like one of the other reviewers had shipping problems I waited 2 months before I received my shipment It is worth the wait I cannot find it where I now live and it really goes a long way and is very flavorful I just went and bought a large rubbermaid bottle and mixed half of the Knorr bottle and the rest with water and made a quart of broth to add to my food when cooking it beats paying 3 00 and change for a store bought box I do hope they bring more in PLEAS 
wonderful i just love this stuff So do many others who purchase it keep it comin 
The BEST This product has been in my kitchen for 15 years it was then sold and labeled Bovril Knorr started marketing it about 5 6 years ago Unfortunately they no longer carry the concentrated beef It gets used in soups sauces and gravies and for cooking pasta and vegetables I have tried all the concentrates in the supermarket and even some commercial brands and this is the best 
A WINNER Took a chance on this item and am glad I did You can use as much or as little as you like need concentrate mixes with water and there is no extra to save for the next time or to throw away It stores well takes little space no paper sticks to the cube and it does not clump together I add some to rice when I boil it to provide extra flavor Great for soups sauces a hot drink and more It s a nifty treat to share a bottle with a friend but be warned they ll go crazy trying to find it in a store 
tastebud excitement I recently ordered a case of essn Sparking Fuji Apple juice It is very flavorful tastes kind of like sparkling cider 
Good after school snack My kids love this snack They can prepare it without problem It should be healthier than other common snacks Less worry The macaroni is thinner than other Kraft packages which is a plus 
You ll love this if you love macaroni and cheese Being Kraft how could it be bad Very delicious and easy to prepare just squeeze out the cheese like toothpaste No need to add butter or milk so quite convenient and fast The cheese product itself tastes a lot like Velveeta when eaten straight so don t let the word sharp cheddar make you think it s anything near bitter And why would you eat it straight Because there s always that little bit left you can t quite squeeze out to lap up like licking the spoon and yum 
Great tuna This is a cut above any of the tuna you can buy in the grocery store I will definitely reorder when it is gone 
Best Tuna I m very happy that it is low mercury but with this quality and taste I might still eat it if they added mercury I m back here ordering my sixth or seventh shipment and this time I just had to leave a review I would give this 6 stars if I could I love tuna and I ve tried all the different major brands and many of the smaller I get excited when I see a type I haven t tried and I snap it up and since trying this I ve always been disappointed This brand is by far the best I ve ever tasted This particular no salt variety is the best of those though some of my family and friends disagree on that point This is not tuna for making tuna salad or even my favorite dish the tuna melt out of This tuna is so good you eat it straight as it comes from the can Makes a great tasty snack 
tasty tuna I like that fact that this tuna is tasty and unsalted The low mercury eases my mind and is the primary reason that I tried it I have since purchased it again and will continue to do so 
Meat I bought 4 pounds of this jerky about 2 weeks age I took 1 bag to a friends house and left it there He is a real picky eater When I came back the next day the bag was almost gone He ate about the whole thing I love the taste as well The meat is from grass fed beef so there is very little fat content My friend aasked me to order him some more I will 
great value not great jerky I was disappointed this jerky has MSG in it which seems to add a lingering aftertaste to it s mostly salty flavor the jerky texture is a good balance of chewy and flakey without much gristle at all the jerky is not oily as many beef flavors get when compared to bison buffalo but it does not have any noticeable smoke in it either which makes me wonder how they actually cure this stuff I consider this an average 3 star jerky but it s remarkably low price help give it a bonus star 
Jerkey THey have the best 1 lb of great jerky It s made of beef from Brazil Which is the best in the worlk Yes it s better beef than the U S The price about 30 of what you would pay in the grocery store 
size comparison for the miserly frugal Warning boring review follows ha ha I was interested in buying these individual servings of cereal for my family and wondered if the cups bowls or little boxes were cheapest per ounce The cups hold more than the bowls and boxes usually about twice as much based on cereal type I mean we would have eaten 2 bowls if it was really cheaper that way I went to the kelloggs site to compare how much cereal was in the cups versus how much in the individual bowls or the little boxes The bowls cups and boxes all seem to end up costing fractions of pennies of one another ounce per ounce I didn t add up all the kinds per variey pack and see which grand total costed pennies more or less based on ounce I am not THAT frugal but picked corn pops and frosted flakes to compare The prices for all the kinds are very comparable so if your wondering which type to buy it doesn t really add up to much difference I do check these things because sometimes the big value sizes are actually more expensive per ounce gram than the little sizes Those marketing people are tricky Therefore if you want to have more little bowls or you pick the cups that have more in each you can make your choice and know you won t be spending way more either way I skipped choosing the boxes because I liked the convenience of the bowls but honestly the carboard boxes are probably better for the planet but anyway I will save some energy water and soap by not washing bowls Now all they need to do is sell a cute little dispenser for my counter and I will never go back to boxes 
Kellogg s Ceral in a cup These were wonderrful I have to get up real early and when I get my breakfast all I have to do is grab one pour the milk in and eat No mesy bowls to worry about At 5 AM in the morning that is great 
Great Price This was such a great price on this cereal I was paying 1 every day from our cafeteria for these 
Planters Is A Winner Once Again I purchased these on the special Friday sale where they were 7 99 for 3 cans At the store where I normally shop here one can is almost 5 so this was a fantastic deal I liked how they were lightly salted and not as salty as alot of nuts are I agree with the other review that they were mostly almonds Id say 60 almonds 30 cashews and 10 macadamias but they were still quite good 
Great Meal or Side Dish Needs no refrigeration before cooking and cooks up fast Use just butter and grated parmesan or tomato sauce or most any sauce 
A great alternative to Senseo I bought this product because it was a cheaper alternative to the Senseo coffee pods I ve been buying I don t have much else to compare with as I ve only used the Senseo products in my pod style coffee maker The Gala product taste just a good as the Senseo in my opinion and it certainly is less expensive One interesting note I only received one pacakage of 18 pods and the rest 11 packages remaining in the order were not shipped Upon inquiry I was told these were no longer available and I was promptly issued a refund for the whole order 
Best tasting instant mac and cheese This is now the only brand of mac and cheese I will buy and I don t mind paying a higher price because it tastes great and is made with some organic ingredients I find that one 6 ounce box makes 2 4 servings depending on how hungry you are and for optimal flavor I use both butter and a splash of milk when I mix the macaroni with the powdered cheese 
A True Bargain This amount for only 11 79 can t be beat While it s more than I would normally order the price was so low I got it anyway and will store it in the freezer The expiration date was good too 3 08 
Great tasting flaxseed meal I have tried 10 different brands of flaxseed meal and can tell you that this is by far the best tasting and has the most consistent quality There are two types of flaxseeds brown and golden Both have the same nutritional value but golden flaxseed is significantly smoother in taste and not as pungent bitter aftertaste I especially like Bob s Red mill for the organic offerings at a minimal price increase I regularly sprinkle 1 2 tablespoons on my cereal in the morning to give it a nutritional punch of fiber protein and essential fatty acids The texture is very fine and almost has no noticeable effect on the cereal if I went with 1 Tbls you wouldn t even know it was there I highly recommend giving Bob s products a try I am sure you will find it as enjoyable as I have Always store flaxseed meal refrigerated opened or not 
Delisious and nutritious An excellent product inside I just wish the packaging were different Information recommends the flaxseed be stored in its opaque packaging But it s just a bag So I cut off the top and hope my clip won t slip off and I ll have flaxseed spilled all over the refrigerator shelf Better packaging might be a shaker container like what s used for parmesan cheese but opaque The package is big and you have to buy 4 so even using some every day on my cereal I will have flaxseed for a long time from this order Store extras in the freezer put the one you re using in the refrigerator 
GREAT IF YOU RE STARVING I had never heard of these and when I came across the product listing I thought these were going to be more like around the house snacks given the description and comments These are only really enjoyable to eat in the same way whey protein shakes or powerbars or other good for you meal replacement or snack like food units are enjoyable they stop the hunger with a minimum of fuss The balls are fairly dense prepare to gnaw on them Taking a bite is a commitment The texture with all the exterior seeds is coarse The peanut butter flavor is well faint Using the words great tasting in the marketing is stretching the truth a bit IMHO I would not buy these for taste alone On the plus side they work I was running out of the house without having had breakfast so I threw two balls in my pocket and ate them in the first 10 minutes of driving My hunger reacted the same way it would to any other 400 calorie breakfast it went away and stayed away until lunch There was no negative aftertaste or other unpleasantness and it made me feel like I had eaten food rather than some sort of snacky candy thing I don t have a particular allergy related need for this product although I like the fact that it doesn t use refined sugar I m not sure how much of this product I will order in the future but I can foresee finishing this pack 
Excellent Product Betty Lou s Peanut Butter Balls This is an excellent product which is both healthy and good tasting I would recommend the entire Betty Lou product line to anyone wishing to have a delicious treat and maintain a healthy life style Easily well worth the cost 
Delicious Nana s no gluten lemon cookies are very delicious I highly recommend them You will also find family and friends who may not be allergic to wheat or gluten products also wanting to eat your cookies All of Nana s cookies are very fresh Patricia M Marylan 
Outstanding jerky I m a big fan of good jerky made plenty of my own and this stuff is great It s a little pricey but the quality and flavor are worth it It is on the sweet side but that s to be expected hence the name sweet n spicy You won t be disappointed I couldn t keep my hands off the 8 bags and scarfed them down in 4 days dirty gluttonous pig 
Treat yourself I prefer variety so most of the time I drink Starbucks house blend and sometimes masala chai spiced tea Then occasionally I treat myself with illy The illy medium roast is very smooth and mild with no aftertaste or bitterness It is perhaps the best coffee you can buy It is about twice the cost of Starbucks but well worth it 
Illy Espresso Coffee is out of this world Confession I have been a true fan of Starbucks I used to think Starbucks was the best coffee ever and the many bags of Starbucks in my pantry will prove that However I recently received a gift of a half pound of Illy Espresso Coffee Medium Grind and I was for once in my life truly impressed with the quality flavor and aroma of this coffee I also find this to be heartbreaking as I do not know what to do with all my Starbucks that I have on hand I just gave 3 pounds of my Starbucks to my mother in law since I will not be drinking it anymore If you are a true coffee conesseiur then you will love Illy coffee If I ever open a coffee shop I would be more than happy to invest in this company 
The Best Salmon Jerky Our family finds this salmon jerky to be the best and most authentic Jerky does mean it s dried but the flavor and nutrition is still there It s delicious and nutritious simply awesome 
Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bars Variety Pack As good as those purchased in local grocery stores 
Green Tea Decaf This tea came to me fresh and intact From now on I will only by my bulk tea from Amazon 
Bigger is Better I drink this tea all the time and was happy to see it on amazon in 40 ct boxes as opposed to 20 or so I drink so much tea all day that I needed 40 count boxes The little boxes just dont last long 
Yummy I love this tea The flavor is fresh and clean It is so good hot and even better at room temperature I drink about 6 8 cups a day and it makes me feel full and satisfied 
Tea Time Good flavor Easier to use than the bags with paper cover and string 
Wonderful I ve been very pleased with the quality of this tuna Every can I ve opened has been perfect large chunks no little off color shreds 
Great healthy crunch If your looking for a great source of complex carbs without the fat and sodium look no further These cakes taste really great and have a crunch you wont believe I have them everyday for breakfast along with my protein and fruit A great healthy start to the day 
Unsurpassed flavor and quality I have not found any sardines that have exceeded the pleasant flavor and texture of the Reese skinless and boneless sardines in olive oil The cans open easily and consistently in my opinion these sardines are my absolute choice for value and taste second to none 
Tasty Fish No need to pay more when Reese s are the same as pricier brands Plus I found no tiny grit and no damaged sardines You ll avoid busting off the ring when opening the can by bending the ring so it touches the can rim and then pulling up 
Very happy Ordering was fast and easy Good price Best part was the free shipping so the value was absolutly worth it 
Best Hazelnut Flavored coffee I recently purchased a full case of the Melitta One Hazelnut flavored pods to use in my Melitta One coffee maker and I can honestly say Melitta coffee is the best I ve had of all the brands I ve tried One nice touch every Melitta coffee pod is individually foil packed for freshness which is apparent from the first sip I ve tried other brands that were stale and tasteless Also the Melitta One Skip the Buzz is the very best decaf I ve ever tasted in my life I give Melitta One my strongest recommendation 
Excellent product These sardines are top quality They are small beautifully packed with a nice light smokey flavor The olive oil packing liquid adds nicely to the flavor It s certainly worth the premium price 
Good Mix It does not get easier can become addictive having so many only 25 min away 
Mocha Splenda I found this a great product taste wise and can be used a multiple of ways to perk up whipped cream yogurt angelfood cake etc 
Flavorful Coffee The Mocha sweetener makes my day just a bit sweeter I like it in the morning and I love it in the evening Very delicious 
tastes great My spouse and I are both using this product and enjoy the slight taste of chocolate it gives the morning coffee 
Great tasting sugar free drink Okay I don t see how anyone could not like this drink Granted it doesn t taste as good as RedBull but the flavor definitely isn t crappy Since I tried the sugar free version it definitely tastes less watered down than the Red Bull sugar free version as well The reason I bought this was because I wanted a sugar free energy drink that wouldn t cost be 3 dollars a pop I have been drinking Red Bull You should get sugar free because 1 it is a lot healthier 2 when you pull an all nighter you shouldn t have all that sugar in your teeth anyway Liquid Lightning is not only sugar free but it is a lot more healthy compared to Red Bull since it has only 5 calories 0 Sodium Red Bull has a lot 100 vitamin C It tastes good too and for 1 a can you can t go wrong Highly recommended 
Excellent I m no expert but I drink a lot of coffee and tried many coffees in my life and this one is particularly excellent So excellent that I decided to write a review for it something I do not do often Definitely recommended 
exquisitely dark and satisfying I work in a business that sells gourmet coffee beans so I like to check out the competition We sell lots of organic coffee These espresso roast beans were perfectly roasted The coffee is smooth and deceptively subtle for such a dark roast I was jealous The blend was just right Clean on the palate with an immaculately gentle mouth feel Well done 
OUTSTANDING BISCOTTI I ordered this for my mom and my mom raved about it Because of the way it is packaged she has even been able to share some biscotti with her friends This biscotti is addictive bet you can t just eat one 
great tasting and healthy My family has been eating Fig Newmans for years Figs are great for you but how do you get kids to eat them The answer is Fig Newmans Since they re organic you can feel good that your little ones aren t ingesting pesticides along with the cookies Two Fig Newmans will fill you up and keep you going They re a great snack 
Great cereal I have been eating Seven in the Morning now called Seven Whole Grain Nuggets for a few years now and started having trouble finding it in my local grocery store Thank goodness for Amazon This cereal is tasty and satisfying Crunchy texture if you eat it right away gets softer if you let it sit in the milk a few minutes Love it with fruit on top 
GREAT COCONUT OIL Try it you ll like it Nutiva is the BEST COCONUT OIL I love it and you will too if you re looking for a high quality virgin oil 
Great Product I love the smell of this product I have tried other coconut oils and they are not the quality of Nutiva You can use this for so many things It is a great light weight moisturizer I also love to put it on my hair It adds a great taste to smoothies and I have also used it to cook with This is a very versatile product I love it 
Great stuff I love these figs The natural flavor is well preserved and there s no added sugar which makes it a great healthy snack when those between meals hunger pangs hit you I ve quickly run through my 6 pack 
Great wheat egg dairy free treat My 2 and a half year old son is allergic to wheat and eggs and LOVES these cookies He takes them to school when there is a birthday party and all the other kids want his cookies 
Pure Bar Apple Cinnamon Bar 1 7 Ounce Bars Pack of 12 Wow These bars are sooo good Outside of regular Clif bars these are my favorite I wish amazon sold more than just three flavors Texture is good and the ingreds are high quality I m not a vegan but these would be a staple for me if I were Actually they are a staple for me 
Hodgson Mills We love Hodgson Mills products Their Gingerbread is great and they have whole wheat bread machine mixes which I have trouble finding here in the frozen north It s nice to get these products via Amazon The price is better per case from Hodgson Mills directly but with 2 day free shipping I get with Amazon it evens out and ordering is so easy with Amazon Nice addition 
Excellent Product I ve received my second order of this product This time I ordered the larger size This is an excellent alternative sweetener It has no after taste like a lot of the artificial sweeteners I use it in my drinks cereals and cooked dishes I ve never tried baking with it I highly recommend this product try it you ll like it 
An excellent sugar substitute with a low glycemic index I bought this one and the dark variety They are both very good kind of a gentle sweetening agent not in your face sweet like white sugar I preferred the dark type as it seemed to have more flavor but this one s taste is probably better for most baking recipes as it would impart a less assertive note No trouble using agave in all my recipes both sweet and savory like that little bit of sweeteness one wants in a Thai dish for example 
great tuna Great tuna and the price is good too What more is there to say 
Very Good Not the Best I have ever had but it was very tasty and worth the price I paid 
Excellent A+++++++++++ Fast smooth hassle free transaction as always and expected highly recommend will purchase more going forward 
tasty a great price but stringy We love beef jerky and were amazed at the great price for this product It is very heavily seasoned and tasty The pieces are large and quite stringy Hope this is truly made from cows it is from asia 
Don t be a Jerky If you like Beef Jerky try World Kitchens Peppered Beef Jerky They have outstanding favor and are really moist They are the real thing I loved peppered beef I can usually eat the whole bag but I pay for it later 
Tasty meal at the office I eat this meal about twice weekly and find it is extraordinary Until Ensavor came along I had not tasted an instant meal so tasty with just the right spice and zest that was actually created with good ingredients Why is that so difficult This stew tastes just great over a bed of short brown rice and has just enough liquid and protein to complement the vegetables that are cooked just right 
Quick and Delicious Delightfully good and quick to microwave just snip off the top and set specially shaped packet in the microwave oven Wonderful on a bed of rice or topping mashed potatoes or just plain 
yummy and easy i love this stuff all you do is cook it up like the directions say then add what you want i love sliced kielbasa and dinner is ready i don t have the patience for cooking and i m not very good at it but my family likes this dish it has a little heat but my 3 year old eats and likes it i cook up 2 boxes for my family of 6 
Addictive I don t know how is it that someone took rice and made it taste so good but I have been eating these for several months now They are extremely addictive Sometimes I find myself getting up in the middle of the night just to eat them Not too sweet and no stomach reaction from someone like me who can t tolerate gluten I have tried all of the flavors and they are equally satisfying Of course this is a processed food and has no live nutrients as they say but its the only snack I eat really when I buy processed foods 
Yummy My kids and I love these cereal bars They are one of our favorite GF treats and worth the expense 
Delicious My son is on a gluten and dairy free diet and he loves these bars they are delicious Ordering them on Amazon is great you get alot at one time and don t have to try hard to find them at the store each week 
Coffee Heaven Love this Cappuccino coffee It has a hint of flavor that is just enough It is not a strong cup of coffee so you don t get a morning jolt from it however the taste makes you wantto drink it all day 
Very Good Cappuccino from a K Cup I hate flavored coffees but this one was the exception The K Cup process seems to add a hint of a a frothy flavor but not so much as to hide the flavor of the bean I drink a lot of coffee so buying K Cups at the department store is prohibitively expense This coffee was excellent and the price was extremely reasonable Throw in free delivery and this is the only way to buy K Cups even cheaper than eBay and so much less hassle 
THE BEST JERKY I NTHE WORLD TOP FLAVOR GRADE A BEEF SOOOOO GOOD BUY IT AND EAT IT IN ONE NIGHT ALL GONE IN HOURS YEAH I GOT MUNCHIES THIS BEEF IS SOO GOOD GOD BLESS THEM BRAZIL COWS I LOVE THIS STUFF I EAT IT IN THE SHED ALL DAY 
Best Ever I found this beef jerky on a trip to Oregon and quickly grew addicted I purchased a few bags for co workers and they loved it so much I gave it as Christmas presents last year No other jerky compares to it except homemade My whole family is happy that it s on Amazon now 
Fantastic I love jerky and have tried it all including making my own This is the first product I consider as good or better than mine And the price is GREAT 
Forget the Politics Forget the Earth Just Eat Green is good of course But what s much better than green are these truly awesome cookies PN Os beat the bootie out of any Oreo variation crunchier more filling without being smarmy much better taste And this goes for the mint the vanilla and the chocolate Fast Eddie Felson I love you 
Leaves Oreos in the dust Been eating these for some time and couldn t pass up the good deal on Amazon as they can be pricey in the grocery store Rich chocolate flavor 
High Sodium Tasty Cookies These high sodium ginger cookies are too tasty to have around you ll easily surpass your RDA of sodium in one sitting The nutrition facts that Amazon neglected to post are Serving size is 2 cookies 28 g Each serving has 160 mg of sodium 4 5 mg of fat 2 g saturated 0 g transfat 19 g of total carbs 10 g sugars and 0 g of cholesterol The ingredients in these Made in U S A cookies are organic unbleached wheat flour powdered sugar organic palm fruit oil organic molasses organic sugar sodium bicarbonate leavening ground ginger soy lecithin an emulsifier salt monocalcium phosphate leavening and nutmeg There are no hydrogentated oils or trans fats On the back of the package is an Ode to Ginger O s which reads You might m lady tweak my nose You could m lord step on my toes But Heaven help those poor bozos who try to filch my Ginger O s Again these high sodium cookies taste too good in order to effectively exercise self discipline to limit the quantity eaten 
Panko Praise Panko breadcrumbs for anyone that has not used them are the best things for fried chicken fried fish crumb toppings and anything else you can think of for breadcrumbs They don t get soggy or fall off the meat fish Some products are not what they are trumped up to be Panko breadcrumbs are the exception I gave a box to my girlfriend and we both profess to be good cooks She has a yen for fried chicken and was just amazed how well the panko breadcrumbs held up Her husband kept raving about them I am glad I bought 6 boxes you will be too 
Great package for any coffee fanatic This is a great pack for anyone who wants to try out new brands of coffee unflavored without wanting to buy the regular 4 pack 
Great Stuff I like this stuff I initially thought I liked the Sumatra blend best and ordered a box of that Sumatra is kind of sweet but not in the sense that it contains sugar Brazil and Columbia are similar but different and Kenya is for lack of a better word dry If I make a cup of Kenya and don t wash out the machine before the next it will come out tasting like Kenya blend Kenya is ok but probably not going to be my favorite I just ordered another variety pack to help me decide while I wake up 
coffee lover This coffee is the next best thing to Starbucks Easy and quick to make I love i 
Dr Kracker Flatbread I like these they taste good crunchy and they are healthy food made with 100 whole wheat 
An addictive flatbread We first bought this in a store in Vermont and were pleased to find that it is available by the case Every time we serve this to a guest they want to know where to buy it It is tasty and healthy and you just can t get enough Maybe its the poppies 
Thinner would be better Like the ingredients and the taste it s just a little bit to thick for a flatbread 
Dr Kracker Flatbread Seedlander This is the world s best cracker healthy and filling I eat them for snacks and sometimes for meals with a piece of cheese or some other type of protein Very tasty Very satisfying 
Love this product and so do the kids This is the best dried fruit product we have tried Sweet and crunchy totally portable great for toting around in your bag and a super quick and easy snack A good choice for people trying to reduce their calories because it is portion controlled and very satisfying as well as delicious 
Yummy and only one point Weight Watchers point that is The bag is one point A great healthy snack to incorporate into your WW diet or any other healthy lifestyle I haven t had a problem with crumbs and powder in the packets I ve tried no more than any other dried fruit I d buy from Trader Joes or the Gerber ones It s definitely a small bag for the price so if you re near a Trader Joes you should really buy their dried fruits Amazon does have a great price for this item though I paid 1 79 for one packet at a major chain That s insanity 
Food fruit snack Very good product to have on hand if you need a quick on the go snack Good tasting and easy to eat I keep a couple in my car to snack on if I can t stop for a meal right away 
Promising but flawed In principle this is a great product It s actual fruit with nothing added dried to a crisp and put in a packet that only has 85 calories If you re looking for light healthy ish snack foods that are still tasty this is a great choice But there are a couple of problems 1 The packets are very narrow and long which makes it virtually impossible to reach into them to get the fruit out once you re past the top third or so 2 There s a decent amount of fruit dust inside which as these are berries and cherries is red and just waiting for a bit of added water to stain up any fabric it lands on Either of these in isolation is no problem but put them together and you ve got a product that you MUST pour out and yet a product that you CAN T pour out I guess maybe if you had a bowl or something it wouldn t be a big deal but that sort of takes away the portable snack nature of it no As much as I liked the fruit the inconvenience of the packaging is going to keep me from buying more Oh and one more caveat Despite the Cherry Berry name this is at least 50 apple I suspect that apples are to dried fruit mixes what peanuts are to mixed nuts the inexpensive and unobjectionable filler The apple tastes fine and all but I wouldn t mind more cherries and berries and fewer apples 
The Best Snack for Crunchy Snack Lovers The fruit is crunch dried via a unique process developed by Sensible Foods making it more than just your run of the mill dried fruit snack It s naturally sweet it s crunchy it s delicious and it s healthy What more can you ask for My dog loves the dried apple bits as well It s his favorite treat My one qualm with the product is that I m a guy and for me the serving size is just too small So I usually eat 2 packs at a time Your kids will love it your pets will love it and you will love it 
As Rachael Ray would say YUM O As the mother of three children two of whom are Celiacs I can honestly say I love this stuff It has a very nice taste very nice texture and it s SAFE for my children to eat We don t have to worry about toxic grains with this one It s chocolately without being too chocolatey And it s small enough that it s not a choking hazzard for little ones 
Exceptional With the handful of cereals that are available for celiac children we found this cereal exceptional It is very tasty and has a good texture 
Wonderful for little ones We absolutely love this cereal eat it quite frequently We have also found out the little ones absolutely go crazy for it Best of all no mil or wheat for those of us with such allergies 
Handy snacking I like the serving size of 1 5 ounces in these packs sometimes 1 ounce just isn t enough They have a nice flavor rather like dry roasted peanuts since they have some spice added paprika onion and garlic powder et al I think the sugar content is a little high I d have given them 5 stars otherwise Nice change from oil roasted almonds which can seem too oily to me sometimes or raw almonds 
Maui Coffee Prompt service and I got what I ordered I coffee is good but not outstanding 
Senseo Vienna Hazelnut Waltz Coffee Pods The Senseo pods are easy to use and brew a strong but very pleasant cup of coffee Hazelnut Waltz is one of my favorites 
World s best coffee This coffee is great I can t usually find the flavored type in the stores and when I do it is more expensive than online If you want a fresh cup of coffee any time of day or night put SENSEO in your cup 
Senseos Vienna I have been enjoying drinking Senseo coffee for a few years now and having recently tried their new flovor Vienna Hazelnut Waltz I have a newfound favorite It is absolutely delicous and uniquely Senseo coffee I deffinately recommend trying this product 
Vienna Hazelnut Waltz Coffee Pods The Vienna Hazelnut Waltz flavor is a delightful change when I m looking to put some pizzazz into my day The flavor is delightful and not too strong 
Good granola at a great price At less than 2 a pound it s hard to find better granola for your money The taste isn t quite as good as the Bear Naked brand I ve also gotten from Amazon but it s easily half the price A little dry but eaten as a cereal with milk the taste is perfect I ll be less likely to just snack on this granola because of the texture dryness but will gladly use it as a breakfast cereal or on yogurt Plenty of nuts and cocunut in it as I had hoped 
Great tasting chips but UPS crushed the box We eat nachos three or four times a week in our house so we go through lots of corn tortilla chips And these are the best tasting we ve found You can really taste the corn in them not just corn flour They re flavorful but not overpowering with just the right amount of salt I only give them four stars because the box that contained the bags was fairly flimsy and got crushed by UPS so a lot of the bags contained little more than crumbs 
Good coffee nice choco hint This is a nice blend of flavors The cacao nibs provide a mere hint of choco flavor so don t expect to brew a mocha in one quick session here I tend to make strong coffee and some can come out a little bitter This one is quite smooth I could use a little darker roast than this turned out to be but to Jeremiah s credit it is advertised as a medium dark roast I d call it medium but taste IS subjective is it not For a baseline I currently call Starbuck s Caffe Verona my favorite Overall for the price especially with the 10 off of 50 promo thanks Amazon this is quite good 
Great Crackers These crackers are really good even my kids love them I read in books writen about Saint Hildegard that spelt is the best of all grains and wonderful for your body To me this is a great way for you to get more spelt in your body and in your kids 
Very tasty healthy I first discovered these crackers when looking for an alternative to wheat due to allergies They re very hearty and go well with a lot of spreads toppings The combination of the seeds makes for a great nutty flavor 
yummmmmmmm Are you love CHOCOLATE here you found one of the best cookie with the REAL CHOCOLATE chunks every bit is a dream Trust me Im a real CHOCOLATE LOVER and this one is a black diamond I read some where some somebody said that is maked with very cheap product I very desagree with him this cookies is SUPER 
Bentley Tea Box I love this little box of tea bags and use it quite often especially when I have a get together in my home People love the choices and the taste and often ask where they can get one just like it 
Tea Box Beautiful wood tea box costing very little and contains 60 packets of delicious herbal tea Wonderful bargain great gift 
Nice wood box for the price Great gift great wood box for the price I have not noticed any odor as mentioned in another review Coems with teas that are very good Nice value 
Good news Bad news Good cracker I ordered a dozen due to the excellent price I was thinking I would keep them on hand The expiration date was less than two months away These crackers lose their appeal soon after the expiration because the seeds become rancid If you buy buy in small quantity 
Perfecto I got hooked by first trying the flatbreads based on so many favorable reviews here When I discovered the same 3 seed crackers in bite size that was it They taste Great are good for you and are very reasonably priced the ideal combination And the containers are re usable All told very very cool that s older person speak for way cool 
This is an excellent price I LOVE these and I got totally addicted to them but had to stop buying them because they were 7 a box at Whole Foods So 6 boxes for 18 is a steal Very tasty crispy high in fiber and filling time to renew my additiction 
awesome i absolutely love these crackers they taste great theyre great for me and a covenient guilt free snac 
Just add tuna Make up a batch of tuna salad dip it out with these crackers yummy lunch or dinner These crackers are much heartier than your typical saltine or Triscuit I find the whole ones a little too big to eat unless I break them up first This tub variety is just the right size 1 2 bites worth Holds up very well to cold cheese spreads too 
The Best of the Lot After trying many of the richer coffees in the K Cup field this coffee was both bold and smooth straight up As an alternative add a little warmed milk and it tastes like the coffees served in the coffee houses dripped out of the filter stand in Colombia and Costa Rica No grinds from the packet smooth and bold using the 7oz Keurig setting and robust using the 5 oz setting ENJOY 
Excellent espresso This is one espresso grind that I actually enjoy over and over again There is no strange after taste with some other premium brands This is a coffee lover s coffee It is rich and deep with a slightly nutty undertone Try it You won t regret it The canister is nice too 
Illy Cafe We love Illy coffee but it is difficult and expensive to find in our area When I found it on the Amazon web site WOW About half the price and delivered right to my door and quickly I surprised my husband on Christmas morning when he found the can sitting next to the coffee pot Excellent 
Best decaf ever For anyone who has had to give up the high test coffee for decaf will not feel deprived The best tasting decaf I have ever tasted 
perfect if you like your coffee a little lighter If you like your coffee a little lighter bodied then what the Cafe Kilimanjaro is then this is your coffee When I m making coffee for guests and they don t want a dark roast that I normally drink I throw some Espresso Milano in the machine and make a cup with it and I ve never received a complaint about it Usually I m asked where the coffee is from and what kind it is It s a perfect fair trade organic medium roast from Pura Vida 
Good stuff Maynard Clean smooth coffee flavor Beautiful red color Some of the best drip brewed coffee I ve ever had I ve bought it here several times Which as the package says is way cheaper than flying to Maui 
Wholesome goodness and great taste My daughter can not stay away from these tasty cheese crackers 
Taste great These are great for packing lunches or snacks on the go without all of the bad stuff you get in the other commercially available products Great price with the free shipping over 25 too Will definitely buy again 
My favorite cereal This high fiber cereal is prefect in milk since it stays crunchy The flavor is very good and the high fiber content is certainly excellent for your health 
Great prunes messed up system The prunes were wonderful highly recommended Unfortunately over and over Amazon kept sending us just one little bag instead of the case of 12 bags it is supposed to be that we ordered despite repeatedly contacting them They finally just refunded the price after about the 3rd time around with the same mistake I hope they get their system straightened out or get rid of the constipated employee in shipping pilfering the prunes 
Good prunes Like another reviewer I like how these prunes are drier and tastier and not slimy like the non organic brands 
Yummy I love the Barefoot Contessa I have 2 of her cookbooks and love the show I have made this coffee cake the long way and from this box Both are fantastic Everyone loves it It s a nice treat on the weekends or to serve with your afternoon tea or coffee 
easy coffe cake I LOVED THIS COFFEE CAKE IT WAS EASY TO MAKE AND QUICK I USE IT ON A SATURDAY MORNING FOR A SPECIAL TREAT AND IT DOESNT LAST LONG THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA LINE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES AS ARE HER SHOWS 
Name says it all lesser evil black and white This sweet treat is as they say a lesser evil It s not health food in that it s a sweet combination of vanilla and chocolate but it is much hearlthier than other carmel and chocolate popcorns out there just check the ingredients Other reviewers complaining about the nutritional fact panel or the health benefits of this product don t quite get it Some reviewers have noted that this is not kettle corn are correct Others who say this is half caramel corn miss the black and white across the front of the bag it s not caramel it s vanilla The chocolate half is delicious cocoa laden and therefore perfect when you want something light not chocolate dipped which would be overwhelming heavy and creamy The vanilla half is also not dipped heavy or overwhelming It s a lightly sweet plain corn taste to cleanse your palate for more chocolate People who love the New England tradition of black and white cabinets milkshakes frappes can t we all just get along will adore this popcorn People trying to avoid nasty chemical ingredients will appreciate this corn People who love subtle flavors will love this treat People who think Oreos are really good won t get this snack nor do people who weigh and measure every kernel because they re watching calories It s a sugary albeit natural sugar with no hydrogenated oils snack It s the lesser of all the evils out there and makes being nutritionaly bad feel really good 
Kettle Corn is salty The quality of this good but the Kettle Corn flavor did not do much for me I have had other kettle corn and liked it This was less sweet and more salt than what I prefer It s not bad I still manage to choke down the entire bag but it s not what I was hoping for Think I may still try the cinnamon though I hope I like that one better 
Highly addictive The chocolate is mild enough not to overwhelm but strong enough to sate a chocolate craving The kettle corn part really is just caramel corn but it s really good ESPECIALLY considering there is no corn syrup preservatives trans fats artificial flavors or gluten Compared to other snack foods I feel no guilt in eating this 
Being Evil is Fun Delightful popcorn mix which is great for snacks and is a really nice treat for lunches Very tasty and hits the spot for those sweet tooth cravings without being too far off the old diet Buying it here is a bargain too 
Cinnamon lovers rejoice Not only does this stuff taste wonderful but it s much healthier than most of the items on the grocery store shelves I would definitely recommend this as a great snack 
Just like I remembered When I was young a while ago sardines didn t come three or so to the flat can as they do now they were small fish young sprat The very best were so tiny that they were packed crossways and two layers deep lightly smoked in oil These still are and at the best price I ve seen in years The taste is utterly different from the cheap supermarket brands If sardines could be elegant these would be 
An Absolute Must Have I regularly buy this product because I don t think I could live without it Like some of the other reviewers I am also Irish born and bred and it really helps to have such an easy product to bake which tastes wonderful I will have to try the suggestion of one of the other reviewers one egg and substitute the water for milk sounds like an idea thanks I would certainly HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying this product it s really worth every penny and cheap too 
Great no fuss Irish bread I am irish and have used this for years Substitute the water for milk and add 1 egg and this tastes 10 times better 
Tastes like Ireland This is really good Irish brown bread Not only does it taste exactly like the yummy brown bread you get in Ireland it is also super easy to make Just add water to the mix and bake for about 40 minutes I don t want to forget to mention that it is really good for you as the first two ingredients are whole wheat flour and oats Enjoy 
12 is too much Some products are better by the dozen but I think that I would have rather opted for a variety pack if I were to buy another 12 pack of Zataran s If you are reading this review then you have probably already tried the dirty rice since you are about do buy a dozen packets of it So you already know that it is a decent mix we add our own spices to it to give it even more kick 
ultimate oatmeal I was never a big oatmeal fan but once I tried Nature s Path Optimum oatmeal I loved it It has a combo of oatmeal nuts and fruit and a great taste 
Tastes good and it s healthy too I bought a box of this oatmeal at our local grocery store thinking it would make a nutritious easy to make breakfast for me I was surprised it tasted so good It s slightly sweet just the way I like it The real test was when my 16 year old asked me if she could try it She loved it Now the only problem is keeping enough of it on hand for the both of us I heat the water in the microwave and add it to the oatmeal in a bowl It is nice to have a healthy choice for breakfast that is so easy to prepare 
Unfamiliar yet satisfying taste I originally bought a bag of this at the local grocery store because of the health claims on the packaging Since then I ve bought a bunch of it from Amazon grocery I use it mostly on my breakfast cereal but have also used it in baking including the muffin recipe on the package I can t recommend that recipe because the muffins have too much stuff in them carrot and apple shavings nuts raisins etc and the muffins wouldn t hold together except for the gooey consistency of the baked product Yuck However in a pizza crust it s great adding extra flavor and texture that is both unfamiliar and satisfying I like having taste in the pizza crust as much as in the toppings and adding some flaxseed meal helps add flavor It also goes well in other baked goods and I ve used it in cookie recipes quick breads etc 
Excellent High Quality Food Bob s Red Mill is a high quality food company The Organic Flaxseed Meal is a versatile easy to use food for healthy consumption of Omega 3 Fatty Acids and Lignans I have used several different brands of flaxseeds Bob s Red Mill Organic is by far the most flavorful and is ground to a consistancy that is perfect as a flour substitute about 1 4 of the flour in muffin and bread recipes or add the meal to homemade peanut butter or sprinkle on yogurt or cereal I keep the flaxseed meal frozen and use as much as needed out of the bag straight from the freezer My kitchen is never without this naturally wonderful organic food 
Delish We love this all natural organic apricot Very sweet and soft Worth the money You pay more at a health food store per bag I ve been shopping from the health food stores for over 25 years Let me say that the color is not as bright and cheerful as the non organic counterpart but keep in mind that this is all natural It was not treated with chemicals preservatives or colorings This is good tasting and good for you For me it is good quality and deliscious I will order this again and other natural fruit products by them Enjoy 
A quick dish from Pacific The roasted chicken rice takes only 90 seconds in the microwave so it s fast The flavor is really good much better than another ready to serve brand that we tried 
Highly Recommended I am a busy woman and yet I have to serve top quality and delicious meals that take little time to prepare Well this rice with roasted chicken meal is one of my secrets in the kitchen It is organic takes a few minutes to prepare in the microwave and I haven t head anything less than it s great The quantity is significant so one purchase lasts for a long time I am very very pleased with it and high recommend it 
Pleasant taste This soup is easy to heat up just pop in the microwave for two minutes The taste is good very creamy and not too spicy It has been a hit with vegetarian guests 
Taste like homemade but easier These are my favorite cookies They are so easy to make but you must use real butter for the best taste I always keep a package in the cabinet for short notice needs Just add butter and egg I love to roll the dough into balls and then roll the balls in sugar and cinnamon to make a special snickerdoodle 
Jamie SO GOOD These are a GREAT alternative to those roll up things I love them and so do my boys Thick good texture Perfect for snacks or in the lunch box 
Perfect For Small Toddlers These are soft not leathery which is perfect for small children There are no worries about choking and they are very delicious I gave these out at Halloween and at parties and the little ones and the parents loved them They are also great crumbled up into hot cereal and yogurt instead of sugar 
Mouth Pleasing and Healthy Too WOW I am impressed with these snacks A whole apple in each bar and no added suger of any kind I love the convenience of these fruit bars We snack mostly on fruit here in the house but sometimes it s not convenient to carry fruit with you on outings So I ve been looking for something like this for a long time and it s better than I expected much better than most fruit leathers you can find in a health store These strawberry snacks have also been tested by a three and four year old pallet and they always ask for more They re so good I ve ordered more of another flavor 
The BEST Snack ever My family loves these as a snack or sometimes even a quick meal replacement The Cashew Pecan Balls are the favorite among all the other flavors It was great to find them on Amazon 
Excellent espresso in a pod I love ESE pods I know some coffee snobs disagree but I ll take 90 of the taste for 10 of the work any day As for pods I ve had Starbucks Illy and Espressione Arabica I like the Espressione the best I lived in Italy for 3 years and hit the coffee bars daily I know what I like in espresso The Starbucks was a bit too rough too American tasting Suprisingly though the Starbucks pods tasted just like an espresso at one of their stores Very consistent The Illy is too smooth It goes well with food and after dinner but I tend to take my espresso at breakfast and prefer a bold smooth taste The Espressione Arabica achieves just that I ll be buying it again for my every day use 
Loves convenience in GA These pods have got to be the best invention yet They are compact extremely easy to use is the best solution to making several very quick cups of coffee Fresh ground coffee is nice but there is virtually no mess with these pods The crema is just as good as ground coffee these can be used in a pod holder as well as a one cup filter basket What more could a person want 
Excellent but expensive I really got hooked on the great taste and superior creama it produces but I find it a bit overpriced compared to other pods I now buy pods from Boyd coffee at a substantial savings Wish Amazon would put it on sale so I could stock up 
deliciously easy but what happened now I have enjoyed those pods for more than a year with my Frances Frances Espresso machine but today I am a little bit concerned about the fact that your price went from 37 99 last month to 60 00 today Why The advantage of buying 150 pods at once was to cut down on the price if it is the same price or more expensive than other stores do we still have a reason to purchase them from Amazon Please enlighten me I would be very sorry to have to go elsewhere Thanks 
lifesaver This is a tasty cereal It has a good crunchy texture It is one of a few safe foods my daughter can eat It has no extra preservatives colors gluten etc It has been a lifesaver for us to find a food that dose not have a lot of extra preservatives dyes etc that could make her ill It has been a lifesaver as it is one of her main foods in food trialing She can only eat rice at this point We buy it by the case Thank you Erewhon for making it and Amazon for supplying 
Gluten Free Cereal that tastes good with fruit This cereal is like rice crispies and it taste good but better with fruit There is also a Erewhon Crispy Brown Rice Ceral with mixed berries that is much better for me although I have not been able to get it lately This is a great gluten free product for those who have to avoid gluten products Celiac disease suffers are always looking for tasteful foods that are gluten free I hope more products become available in bulk for us 
Great item but no longer available My son loves this cereal but it is no longer available from Amazon It s really too bad 
great rice cereal This is a great crispy rice cereal We also use it in snack mix 
Crispy Rice Cereal Good product good taste I was able to make Rice Krispy treats for my allergic child 
peanut butter granola Very good granola bar A bit chewy Nice flavor natural peanut taste 
Not as fresh as I hoped Love the taste although the bars were too hard to bite into The freshness was an issu 
Peanut Butter Goodness Not bad Crunchy Good peanut taste I agree with the other reviewer not enough peanut butter taste for the really strong PB cravers but enough to keep mouths happy Good for a filling and satifying snack 
Pretty good but more peanut butter preferred Pretty good overall but if you re really into strong peanut butter flavor you might prefer something else They do make a great snack though 
A nice surprise I tried this item since I was intrigued from the product description and I was actually surprised from the delicacy of the white tea I love orange based teas and this is a great one does not have a strong taste that overpower the white tea and has a great aroma Definitely I will try also the other white teas Note the order is 2 boxes of 50 each The package inside the can of 50 contain 2 packages with 25 tea bag each And one more stuff the price is great for white te 
delicious I ve tried the peanut butter but these taste so much better I m ordering 2 more boxes 10g of protein on such a yummy treat 
Better than the best macaroon you ve ever had These are amazingly delicious In fact I wish they were half as good so I would not be tempted to eat so many I love all the Betty Lou s products I ve tried and I m here at Amazon to buy more because they have the best price 
Just say NO to Cow s milk This is SOOO much better for your child This stuff is great It s funny that all the previous reviews said use this if your child can t drink cow s milk NO use this INSTEAD OF COW S MILK D This is so much better for your baby than cow s milk it s much closer to human milk than cow s milk Goat s are much closer to us than cow s cow s chew cud and have 4 stomachs they eat food and regurgitate it later and finish chewing it then it goes through several processing chambers stomachs Think about it a baby cow drinking milk from it s mama is going to process it s food the same way that mama cow is processing her s WE DON T HAVE 4 STOMACHS why would our babies drink that milk why should we think that cow s milk is going to be sufficient for our needs Goat s graze they eat little bits of food all day and their food steadily processes through their bodies hence if you ever have been around goats you ll see they eat and poop eat and poop it process very quickly through their bodies Just like we do we process our food very quickly and need foods that we can digest absorb very quickly and easily That s REALLY why Cow s milk is not the best for us not just because of lactose and all the hormone antibiotic stuff yeah that stuff too but that s not the MAIN reason However it s the main source you see because it s CHEAP and EASY to obtain thin about how many goats it would take to produce the same amt of milk a cow produces it s all about supply and demand But heck anyone could own a goat and milk it easily I can t wait to have a farm of my own someday so I can have goat s milk for the whole family D But as for Meyenberg powdered milk this stuff is so easy to mix and so convenient with a toddler Just take it with you and mix it whenever you need it and don t worry about it spoiling in the fridge or running out and having to go to the store to find that they are out I REALLY wanted to keep breastfeeding beyond a year but my supply just couldn t keep up with my son s needs at that point So I weaned him and have given him some cow s milk and mostly Goat s milk and now I have pretty much stayed only with the Goat s milk and I can tell that he likes the flavor MUCH better and his BM s are not loose and watery like with cow and he doesn t have as much gas with this either And gosh what an EXCELLENT PRICE Thanks AMAZON 
Great price After shopping around this is by far the best deal on powdered goat s milk 
Goats milk This is the best stuff going for a child that is unable to drink formula or soy milk I used it for my son when he was a baby I started him on it when he was about 3 months old because of allergies and his doctor said to leave him on the soy milk even though it was causing him much discomfort I couldn t just let my son suffer and took it upon myself to put him on goats milk and ended up with a healthy kid and a doctor who was also a convert 
Great Cow s Milk Alternative Easy to Use My daughter is allergic to soy cow s milk but tolerated goat milk very well She has been drinking it since she was 12 months It s nice having a powder so we can take it with us when we are on the go There is more information about the milk itself on the meyenberg website After looking over the website I felt confident that goat milk would meet my daughter s nutritional needs 
My toddler drinks it My almost two year old is allergic to cow s milk so we give him a mixture of goat s milk and rice milk Liquid goat s milk is expensive at least where I live so we switched to the powdered form a few months ago I don t drink milk but my son seems to like it okay Goat s milk products have a distinct flavor that you either love or hate I love it in goat cheese and goat butter but my wife hates it Judge for yourself 
Powdered Goat s Milk is easy to use This product is very easy to use and is good for people and pets that are lactose intolerant I use it as a treat for my ferrets and they love it It can help sick ferrets feel better and gain weight Thank you for offering something so easy to use 
Whole Bean Coffee This is a good dark roast coffee We enjoy Italian Roast Beans but they are not always available in our area This was a good product for the money 
The real thing If you want the best espresso coffee used in Italy and i know i was born and raised there then Lavazza espresso is the one Richer than Lavazza oro and coffee bar quality I mean Italian coffee bar quality The very best you can put your hands on but you have to know how to make it right 
Two previous reviewers on crack Maybe this says something about the psychedelic effects of jasmine tea First anon_2003 thinks there are snails in the teabag Then Graham rips anon for saying they were in the bottom of the cup even though anon wrote that they were in the bag not the cup I guess this is the proverbial tempest in a teacup In any case I like this jasmine tea It s not too perfumed and does have a smooth taste No snails But wait There are little green men in that teabag 
Previous reviewer is on Crack I have purchased this tea for quite a while and it is the best tea out there for Jasmine Green Tea The taste is not overwhelming and the finish is smooth and sweet I have never had any snails or other non leaf items in my tea Besides if it comes as a tea bag how can the snails be in the bottom of your cup Shouldn t they be in your bag I think you should wash your cups more often or step away from the pipe 
Great pasta We stumbled upon this brand of pasta on Amazon by searching their gluten free options We are long time pasta lovers though recently learned our family cannot eat gluten in wheat So the search has been on This blend of corn and rice it the ticket very tasty and stands up like wheat pasta We have cases on hand 
Wonderful juice with a light fizz for grown ups I ve reordered this Sparkling Blood Orange and Cranberry juice three times now Clearly it has been a winner at our house The flavor is a very definite blood orange flavor with a slight cranberry back up and a gentle fizz as a bonus The juice is a beautiful dark red color that looks fantastic when served in a nice crystal glass The next time you need a special juice to serve at a brunch try this one Your guests will love it 
great drink greatly overpriced Bought a case of this beverage and enjoyed it very much tangy citrusy unique taste with just a bit of carbonation to move it along Unfortunately it is WAY overpriced 
Wonderfully Tasty This is wonderfully unique flavored soda although a bit pricey Just the right balance of sweet and tart along with a bit of fizz makes for a great flavor treat We bought a case and it took us through the holidays everyone really enjoyed them children adults included I would certainly keep some around the house during holidays and special occasions but it s too expensive to replace our usual beverage of choice 
Raises the Bar for Tuna Excellent Clean fresh over all with out strong fishy smell or taste The texture is quite nice and unique solid and firm yet moist I m hooked 
Great tuna option for gourmet or family and kids Excellent taste and quality To me worth the price as best of show for canned tuna I will give it six stars if the net weight is truely 7 5 oz The only comparable quality albacore tuna we have found is also troll caught and solid pack and sold out of Gig Harbor WA by the Tuna Guys By the way I have no doubt that the low mercury claim is legit 
Terrific Tuna Great tuna low in mercury and high in Omega 3s Good nutrition and good taste For those watching their carb intake tuna has zero carbs 
Teff is great stuff Teff replaces oatmeal as a hot breakfast cereal Teff s pretty unique its a tiny seed It doesn t get mushy when cooked but does stick together To cook it boil it in water use about 1 2C Teff to 2 1 2 C water to serve two or one large guy Add some salt too say 1 8 to 1 4 teaspoon and just boil until thick Stir so it doesn t stick to the pan Flavor is kind of nutty but mild and its really good Its much higher in protein and complex carbs so you can feel the difference around noon still with you Its a definite must have for athletes and if you can afford it everyone else You may also like grated orange peel nutmeg cinnamon or for us we add toasted anise seed as well for peak flavor We serve it with milk and a pinch of sugar Its excellent if you prepare any dish like this you will probably find Teff is better than all of them Take advantage of the shipping deal when you buy two boxes 
Suprisingly Yummy I bought this to add variety to my diet and tried the teff pudding recipe on the back delicious I think My family didn t agree but they did like the bread I made with teff flour Hmm perhaps if I soaked the grain overnight first that would make for a smoother pudding Try the pudding or add the grain to a mix for breakfast or as a side dish it s healthy and it tastes good 
Excellent Grain More difficult than oatmeal or quinoa to cook for breakfast the small grains must be shaken apart once added to the water and more frequent stirring required to avoid a sticky gel like mass on the bottom of the pan These minor annoyances aside teff has excellent flavor and nutritional benefits including 20 of the RDA for Iron Great with fruits and nuts for breakfast or as a base for vegetables in a casserole 
Terrific Tiny TEFF Just got Teff for the first time several weeks ago and we all love it in this house Baked some French Bread with Teff in it and it was absolutely delicious The French Bread didn t last a day Give this tiny grain a try and you won t be dissapointed 
Good alternative to other graham crackers These are VERY good healthy alternatives to regular graham crackers The comment above that states she won t try any of the other products is TOTALLY missing out on something very good I have purchased all of the crackers they make and love every one of them Anyone I share them with also loves them If you are looking for healthy crackers without the trans fat and other nasty chemical ingredients found in almost every other cracker in the supermarket you should certainly try these As for the grahams not being crispy I have to agree sometimes they aren t as crunchy as I would like but then again most graham crackers are not Try the other dr krackers if you want a real crunch 
Very Good Ordered this for my mother and she loves these Graham crackers and I will order some for myself soon I don t know the expiration date on the package as it is tough for mom to find the date It is crunchy for her and mom is happy 
No salt added I like these kipper snacks because there is no added salt I find the phrase Low Sodium Added unclear 
Perfect I have tried many types of canned herring but Crown Prince Natural Kipper snacks are the BEST There is barely any liquid in the can each can is packed full with delicious smoked herring These kipper snacks are wild caught and low in sodium so they are a very healthy way to get your Omega 3 s high in protein too If you are like me and don t always have to time to cook fish this is a perfect way to enjoy the heart healthy benefits of fish 
Great For Singles I LOVE this product as it s just the right size for me to eat for lunch or to snack on with crackers I had bought this product from my local grocery but if one buys enough groceries on site the shipping is free there is usually a discount that applies so the cost was just an added benefit I also send these to some of our guys in Iraq as they keep forever don t require any opener package easily and the package is compact easy to dispose of with little room needed I like this smaller package so I don t have leftovers the next day The amount is more than adequate for me to have one sandwich with enough left to snack on later I prefer tuna in water instead of oil and I have always hated having to squeeze the water out of canned tuna so this easy open package with very little liquid has been great Love this product and will definitely continue to buy 
The most affordable way to get your pucker This is a very good price for Crystal Light Lemonade The only place that equals it is Costco and my nearest Costco is far away I just don t get there often enough The Costco price is the same as this but you can buy just one box instead of three Even when my local supermarkets have a buy one get one free deal on the regular sized canisters it doesn t come out to be as cheap per ounce as this is My husband drinks this stuff almost exclusively I never cared for any diet drinks myself until I married him and tasted his lemonade It s so tart and lemony that you can rarely taste the artificial sweetener at all I now drink the Crystal Light Iced Tea mixed with some brewed mint tea I never thought I d be a diet drink drinker but now I am thanks to this product 
Yum o These didn t last long even with just me and my 15 year old son in the house and very convenient 
Great for kids gives a nice variety I bought this mostly for our kids but I ended up eating my favs out of all 5 packs In the end you are left with a bunch of Cheerios or what ever the family doesn t like But it s still nice to have a variety in the morning Great shipping packed well 
All of your classic favorites These are all of my favourite breakfast cereals Good to eat any time breakfast snack lunch dinner and after dinner snack Buying in bulk makes it possible to not have to shop so often Each yummy box contains enough for one child or adult Some of us even like to eat them without milk or as a on the go snack Perfect This huge pack of 40 total boxes will last you a while 
Incredibly tasty low calorie puffed cereal Normally unsweetened puffed cereal is an eating experience best compared to munching on a styrofoam cup But not Kashi puffed cereal The whole grains wheat brown rice spelt sesame buckwheat triticale and others are Kashi s special blend and they make for a tender crunchy mix that has flavor I like it so well I eat it dry as a snack instead of nuts or chips The different grains have different textures and density making it an interesting cereal yet light low in calories and healthy It s good this comes in batches of six boxes because I certainly go through it 
I love Kashi This is the only Kashi product I like It is low calorie 100 fun to eat doesn t get soggy fast I like crunchy cereal won t eat soggy and a good out of the box snack if you re desperate Tastes good if you like puffed cereal Works well with my eating plan 
Love it I lost 20 lbs eating this as a part of WeightWatchers plan A bit of Splenda fruit milk it makes a great filling breakfast I spend alot of time reading labels and this is one of the only cereals at HEB without a bunch of sugar I am going to keep it in my cupboard at all times HEB quit carrying it and instead have the Honey Kashi So I ordered a case from Amazon A lot cheaper and less hassle It arrived quickly 
Great Cereal 0 Sugar but Cheaper at Local Grocer Breakdown price for this online is 2 99ea but our local grocery has them for 2 50ea 
Yum Yum and baby loves it too This cereal is great with fruit Even my nine month old likes to eat it as a snack It isn t sweetened but the natural grains are delish 
Portable Protien snack The only thing that could make this product better is to use all organic meat 
The Perfect Snack This product is excellent in many ways It comes with single serving bags which is very filling without being too much at one time I have been buying two cases per order from Amazon com for over a year and there has never been any problem at all These are actually healthy great tasting and the proper portion bags take the worry out of eating nuts In addition the mixture of nuts is delicious without having to buy other kinds The price and the packaging are excellent too 
Like being back in Italy The Illy is the best commercial Italian coffe that you can find not only in the USA but in Italy too It is pricy but it is really worth all the money that you spend on it Illy has a smooth velvet like taste that roll on your tongue The smell is sooting and relaxing but is strong enough to weak you up no matter how sleepy you feel I highly raccomand it to everyone because if you like coffe you can t help but love it and if you don t like coffe you will love Illy anyway It s just too god 
Fast and easy These pods make the preparing of deliciouse espresso capuccino and late much easier faster and cleaner 
Great Convenience for Espresso Lovers Illy Dark Roast Pods provide a great tasting cup of espresso with crema and without the mess of cleaning up all those grounds The tin packaging is compact for easy storage but I recommend keeping the opened pods in a vacuum container to maintain freshness If you re willing to invest in two 18 pod tins you can t beat the price on Amazon For a slightly different great taste and individual packaging to maintain freshness try Espressione as an alternative though the individual packaging requires additional storage space in your cupboard 
Great Best pods For pod espresso these are the best They make a great cup when I dont want to heat up my Ms Silvia and grind 
Good coffee best price yes these pods are slightly larger than the regular ones but you can make two cups 2x4oz or 1x8oz out of 1 pod and the price is right I use the 1 cup insert squeeze the pod a little so the coffee gets loose inside when I close the senseo lid I push at the lever and lid at the same time 
Java Pod Review The best of all the pods available They have a bolder taste without the bitterness 
SWF seeks tall dark warm fast Joe So I had this enormous coffeemaker and I like to have a cup of coffee before I buzz off to work Problem Mr Coffee and I don t seem to see eye to eye when it comes to getting the grounds water ratio right for just a cup or two in the morning I found one of these single cup coffeemaker thingies at Target Get this They were offering a 6 pack of 18 count coffee pod packages for 39 99 and you got the machine for free As a result of my rocky relationship with Mr Coffee I was easily bellying up to the bar ista and spending 39 99 in a month at Starbucks so I bit The manufacturer of the JV Pod machine I bought recommends using only JV short for Juan Valdez Pod brand pods of course The trouble was I had trouble finding them after the first batch I got with the machine I bought several packs of these Melitta guys different flavors from Amazon to use in my JV Pod coffeemaker Since a friend has a Melitta machine I sprang for enough of these pods to qualify for the free Super Saver shipping and figured I d give them to her if they didn t work for me As it turns out they work just fine in the JV machine and both the regular and flavored coffees though not necessarily gourmet stuff are really quite tasty I would have no problem serving this coffee to a guest in my home 
My Favorite Offering from Melitta This is the Melitta Pod that I make sure is heavily stocked in my kitchen While the others taste fine I prefer this for the bold flavor and stronger dose of caffeine 4 starts because of inconsistent quality most of my pods have tasted good but a few seem a bit stale at times 
An Excellent Source of Supplementary Protein Bob s Red Mill Soy Protein Powder is a low cost versatile source of protein It has negligible fat and no cholesterol has a neutral taste and odor and mixes well with the foods with which I have tried it I have been using it more or less daily for approximately 1 month At breakfast I mix 2 tablespoons with 1 1 2 cups of milk 1 tablespoon of nutritional yeast and 1 tablespoon of blackstrap molasses The mixture is highly nutritious and tastes surprisingly good I also add 2 4 tablespoons of it to approximately 2 quarts of mixed fresh and frozen veggies that I steam for lunch most days The protein powder takes on the taste of the veggies Down the road I anticipate that I will add it to beans and vegetarian chili to give additional protein to these foods also 
Kettle Korn at it s best I read where Orville wanted to come out with a different kind of popcorn and when he marketed kettle korn he knew what he was doing A blend of sweet and sour coats every kernel 
My favorite kettle corn I m a huge fan of kettle corn and this brand is definitely top notch My favorite of all brands You can t go wrong with Orville 
Tasty Pops up just right Wonderful taste like Kettle Korn popcorn is suppose to taste like sweet and salty Love it 
Great tase too dry The taste is good and spiced well but it is really dry and hard 
tasty salmon jerky This salmon jerky is definitely tasty It has a slightly strong peppery taste to it which I really like The previous reviewer was correct in thinking the jerky was a bit too dry and hard to chew It ll take you a while to bite a piece off and chew it My jaws were too tired to even eat a whole serving Nonetheless the jerky is quite tasty so I m not dissapointed These come in eight resealable pounches each with 2 ounces of salmon jerky I m sure these will last a while since it ll take a while to chew them all up 
Salmon anyone This California style salmon jerky tastes great but a little overly dry and hard to chew in my opinion Still it is nice to have and it is very funny to see looks on people faces when you offer them salmon somewhere on a trip in the middle of nowhere 
Great stay fresh packaging This coffee tastes great when brewed in my pod coffee maker I especially like the packaging Since each pod is individually wrapped the coffee is always fresh no matter how long after I open the box For me the benefit of a pod coffee maker is that I can make a single cup on a weekend and then not make coffee again for another week I was unpleasantly surprised to find that some pod coffee is not separately wrapped which means it becomes stale rather quickly after the packages is opened Thanks to this coffee s packaging I can enjoy fresh coffee with every pod not just the first one or two pods in the package 
delicious aroma and great taste We originally purchased this to take on camping trips to replace yucky instant coffee These little packets are a great substitute for that and we now use them at home for those times we want to only make one cup at a time instead of making a full pot 
Excellent for toast better than most My experience with gluten free breads goes back over 22 years This is the best gluten free bread I ve found for toasting It actually turns a nice shade of brown in the toaster without burning Good flavor and consistency I add butter cinnamon and sugar or peanut butter to mine keeps very well in the fridge 
Excellent Very excellent mild tasting coffee K cups are great A one cupper has never been easier 
Great Coffee Fast Remember what you re ordering this is coffee that s just this side of instant Viewed in that light it s spectacular Will never beat freshly ground and brewed the old fashioned way but it makes a great daily substitute 
Crunchy Healthy Good cereal Don t know what else you want me to say about it But definately good stuff 
The best This is the best new cereal on the market Even my picky 13 and 10 year old children like it 
Easy take along treat Delicious I buy a case of these or the cocoa variety whenever Amazon features them on the Friday Sale generally about six dollars less than the listed 22 00 The 5 ounce packages are paper reinforced cylinders easy to pack and easy to open great for a take along treat The packs don t re close however so you pretty much have to devour all contents once opened For Christmas I made up small gift baskets using these a coffee mug or two and some instant cappucino 
A whole roll in one sitting Gotta watch it with these I got in on the cookies a few weeks ago from Bahlsen that had the chocolate filling They are wonderful cookies and at less than 1 a pack you cannot go wrong These things were made for a quick coffee or milk dunk Don t let them soak as the light cookie will fall apart but a quick dip sets them up just fine They come well packed and wrapped Recommended highly 
NICE COOKIE I RESERVE 5 STARS FOR FRESH BAKED COOKIES THIS 4 STAR COOKIE CONSISTS OF TWO LIGHT CRISPY WAFERS WITH A CHOCOLATEY TASTE REMINISCENT OF BROWNIES NOT DARK CHOCOLATE AND IN BETWEEN A LIGHT CREAMY FILLING NOT AT ALL LIKE THE DENSE OREO FILLING THEY WOULD COMPLEMENT ICE CREAM NICELY NOT TOO MANY NOW 
A very Yummy cookies If you ve ever had as Bahlsen Hit cookies normally a plain cookie with chocolate filling you ll know these have to be good A creamy center that can easily be eaten separatly by nibbling off the cookie top and bottom A dry cookie that isn t too sweet but full of flavor Great for a mid day snack I always have a roll in my desk draw at work Very Very Tasty 
Enjoying coffee while benefitting the farmer I ve been drinking Pura Vida coffee ever since I heard a recent Harvard MBA tell us of his efforts to cut out the large middleman profits in the coffee business so that the coffee growere could realise a better life The bonus is that it is really good coffee I look for the gourmet coffees and Pura vida is one of them Thanks for such a good product easily shopped for and for the chance to help the little guy 
Happy with all three flavors This coffee tastes great to me I hope it really does help people and is grown the way they say 
coffee time i m ix this with th african coffee from this co deleicious 
Fabulous coffee better than Starbucks I first purchased this coffee because I recently decided to go a little more organic Let me tell you this stuff is amazing The taste is much cleaner and fresher than Starbucks which is what we used to use Actually we ran out at one point and bought a bag of Starbucks and neither me nor my husband liked the Starbucks as we did before And proceeds go to coffee producing countries So you getting great coffee at a better price than Starbucks and you are contributing back to less fortunate people in coffee producing countries What could be better 
Great for finding a favorite I had been looking for a new source of whole bean coffees with a rich taste In this sampler I found a new favorite the Ethiopia Sidamo It was a nice medium dark roast with a rich winey flavor that I loved The Columbian was also a nice coffee On the other hand the Sumatra had an almost burned taste that was very acidic The beans were fresher than many that I buy off the shelf and they are definitely a better value than the Gevalia that I have been receiving These are a full 12 ounce 
Good snack cookie These 1 squares are low in fat and sugar so parents can feel good about serving them to their kids I wouldn t say they have a deep chocolately taste but for a healthy snack they re pretty good 
great icebox style cookies I recommend these cookies to any chocolate lover the cookies have a deep rich cocoa flavor they re low fat yet quite tasty a delicious and nearly guilt free snack 
Great price Love this product and the price was great as long as I purchased enough to qualify for free shipping 
The BEST bold coffee Pura Vida Kilamanjaro has absolutely spoiled my wife and I to coffee Starbuck s doesn t even match it s taste and knowing that Pura Vida does such great humanitarian work in the coffee growing countries only adds to its value If you like bold coffee I highly recommend Pura Vida Kilamanjaro It s now the only bean in our house 
an excellent dark roast If you are looking for a premium dark roast coffee this is it Not only are you getting a dark full bodied coffee but it s fair trade and organic as well Think about it you get an amazing cup of coffee every morning and the coffee farmer in Indonesia and Ethiopia the sources of Cake K are receiving a fair living wage for their labors One of the best if not the best coffees that I have ever drank I recommend everyone try it once because thats all it will take for you to become hooked on it 
yum This stuff is so good and entirely gluten free I like mine with bananas or a little salt and brown sugar Good stuff and fairly foolproof 
Wonderful Doesn t OVER sweeten or leave an aftertaste I just got my box of 250 from Amazon this week and already love it It is much more like sugar than even Splenda and I have loved Splenda for years It is not as sweet as Splenda It lets you taste the coffee or tea flavor and not just taste sweetness I had not realized what I have been missing I also noticed that after my morning coffee I feel much more satisfied for a longer time I feel good that it is all natural I get enough chemicals and over processed foods who needs more Try it you will not be disappointed It will open a whole new world of flavor to you 
Best Sweetener Out There Buy It I just received my box of Sun Crystals and I can not rave enough about this product I have never tasted a low calorie sweetener that is as close to the flavor of sugar in my life I am a big time Splenda fan but this has a smoother taste to it although not quite as powerful as Splenda I use 2 packets in a coffee normally and it is the perfect amount of sweetness without being overpowering Using one packet in tea is just enough sweetness to take the bite off the stronger teas but not ruin the flavor of high end teas Being all natural I feel like it must be healthier for me and my family than other low calories sweeteners This is the only one I actually feel ok giving to my children I recommend this product highly to anyone who uses low calories sweetener Don t forget to type in the 5 discount code 
I love new Sun Crystals I received a sample of Sun Crystals tried it and loved it I have ordered a container of 250 packets from Amazon I hope that it becomes available in our local grocery stores soon I just wanted everyone to know that the taste is so much like full calorie sugar that it is amazing even though there are only 4 calories per packet The consistency is also just like full calorie sugar There is no artificial aftertaste like some of the other low calorie sweeteners as it is all natural I highly recommend this new product 
tea is good something else is wrong I purchased this item from Amazon and expected 6 boxes of 20 bags I got one box of 20 bags I complained When the man I spoke to said they would just send it again I was thinking that they would send me 5 boxes but they sent me 1 box in the second order I guess this is just one box of 20 tea bags for the price I do really like the tea though It makes excellent iced tea and hot tea So if you want 1 box for the price puchase this item 
Just a very good cookie This is one of the few products I would buy even if I could have wheat products The cookie is not a soft type cookie I ve had good luck with shipping they are packaged well from the factory and amazon does a fair job in packaging for shipping 
Couldn t live without Pamela s Peanut Butter Cookies These cookies are just delicious Even my friends who don t have to eat wheat free or gluten free love them They re so chewy and tasty and filling they really meet the need for a wheat free nutritious treat I recommend them 
Best Wheat Free Shortbread in the World This is the best tasting shortbread cookie in my book Since I am unable to eat wheat it is a rare find to discover an excellent cookie or any other wheat free product After I purchased my first box at a local health food store I went online to see where I could buy more I now purchase these cookies in bulk at 3 4 cases at once and they stay fresh until the next order Thank you Pamela wherever you are Paul 
delicious Gluten Free is very important for my diet but finding a cookie that tastes better than any other regular cookie is terrific They are moist delicious and have plenty of chocalate chips 5 Sta 
Real Ginger Real Bread These will satisfy the craving for gingerbread When you bite into them you ll immediately know you re in for a treat The eating experience alone hits the reward center of the brain Soft dense and chewy describe the cookie s character The rich flavor of molasses provides depth to the tasting experience Shredded Ginger gives the cookie a distinct texture and kick to the palate One cookie can satisfy the worst craving for carbs All the Pamela cookies are delicious but this one could be a dessert all on its own 
Love Peanut Butter Cookies If you do not eat gluten and you love peanut butter cookies you HAVE to try these cookies They are so superly delicious They are somewhat crumbly in the box and at least one cookie in every box will be broken into pieces But they are so good you will not even care Definitely try them you ll love them 
delish delicious better than a can any day and the same nutritional value and at this price you cant beat i 
Best on the internet The best price and free shipping that makes this a great deal Also hard to find product 
Love Love Love these Guys you really should get these little green spirulina ginseng balls My two college kids practically beg to get them My husband and I also love to have a few with us on trips Great snacks Great taste compared to a lot of healthfood snacks Clean and green and healthy for you We actually put BETTY LOU S SPIRULINA GINSENG BALLS in our Christmas Stockings this year and everyone cheered Do yourself a favor Buy the big canister They are tons cheaper this way and you won t run out as fast 
My favorite snack Love these balls They are super tasty and filling Hard to believe they are so good for you too 
Good yum ok I just bought a box since its so much cheaper than getting single ones usually 1 + each 1 they are healthy and vegan 2 i leave a box of em at work for breakfast quick and easy 3 the taste is on the good level compared to healthy snack bars taste like nuts and rasins n a bit of the green stuff but its fine if u usually eat things like this It is moist n chewy Overall I like the taste and will buy more 
AMAZING I thought they would taste like algae or grass but they did NOT Deliciously nutty and filling at only 150 calories I used to drag through my morning at work I ate one of my coworkers because it was the only food available Amazing Yummy and energizing and after one I wasn t hungry for the rest of the afternoon 
Yummy Finding a quick nutritious satisfying vegan treat is no small feat This is it I always have an emergency ginseng ball in my purse just in case I get the munchies when I m out and about in the big bad junk food world we live in And THIS is the way to buy them Less than HALF of what Whole Foods charges I shouldn t be telling you all this I never want amazon to be sold out when I come looking for my ginseng ball fix Never mind They re awful Don t buy them 
great I bought these to get off the chocolate but now I can t stop eating them 
Yum Corn Free I bought these because I have a corn allergy and wanted to substitute them for the LA Weightloss bars that list corn syrup as the first ingredient I was pleasantly surprised that they were pretty tasty My favorites are actually the Fudgie Filberts that taste similar to a Little Debbie brownie if Little Debbie s were diet Following that I would say Almond and Coconut are tied for second Third is the Peanut Butter which is the highest in protein but not as good as the others My husband didn t like any of them but could tolerate the one I liked least Peanut Butter Over all I think these are great as a healthy snack for people with food allergies or other dietary restrictions I think I would have picked a different name than Betty Lou s Nut Butter Balls Nut Butter Balls doesn t sound as appetizing as what they actually are Nut Butter Balls Mmmmmm 
Yummy I ve loved gummi bears since I was a kid and back then I didn t care so much if they were hard to chew like Haribo s brand These are great gummi bears as they are easy to chew and taste sweet but not over whelmingly I eat them all the time at work if they are available I love them and haven t been able to find them in the stores around here so I m glad that Amazon has made them available 
My Favorite Gummy Bears These are the best around They are soft and chewy not hard like other brands and are affordable and easy to find in stores 
Dr Kracker Flatbread Sunflower seed cheese 7 oz I love these Krackers and they were great but I have to say that the date on the tag was from Oct I bought them in December I still ate them and they tasted just the same 
Great Vegetarian Snack I ve only tried the sunflower cheese crackers I stumbled upon them in an organic food store and I m addicted As a vegetarian sometimes I struggle to find healthy snacks but these are great One cracker is about the size of a slice of bread but much more dense and filling They re very crunchy and flavorful Since they re also USDA Organic you can eat them with a good conscience knowing that your support of organic products means they re healthier for you healthier for the environment and healthier for the farmers Though a bit pricy I highly recommend them 
Love these crackers I have tried this flavor along with the Klassic 3 seed and the Seeded Spelt and I have loved everyone of them I find that they are a healthy snack to pair with yogart for dipping or with brie cheese and some fruit I cannot wait to try the Seedlander Muesli and the Graham although I have not been able to find those in any local stores 
Crunchy with fiber Spelt pretzels with fiber are hard to come by Organic to boot My family used to eat Vita Spelt until I realized there was no fiber in them and they weren t organic Much cheaper on Amazon than in Whole Foods 
Why did you stop selling this product I like this product and would by more if I could 
Betty Crocker I love all brands of Betty Crocker s cookie mix the double chocolate is usually sold out thus why I bought it through this website I am a chocoholic 
A Lovely Cookie Worth Sharing These cookies are nothing like the ones I ate when I was 11 at the lunch table while sitting next to Nancy These Double Chocolate Chunk cookies are exquisitely kind to the senses but bring no memory of my fifth grade dream girl Her pleasant eyes would assuage a long morning s pain in Miss Charminker s class but it was the meting of her chocolate chip cookies that met my heart Betty Crocker s cookies are worth sharing too all of these years later Made in the oven they are almost like homemade almost like the ones Nancy s mom made Twelve come in the bag if you bake them right The subtle bright sweet aroma tinctured with the bold yet faint milk chocolate scent captured in a classic cookie enraptured my senses as they will yours But still the crusty stale brown white cookies Nancy shared with me in my youth caused me to smile far more with a deeper gladdening She d lift them gingerly from her brown bag place one precisely in front of me on the table and one in from of her on the table She would then proceed to excavate the treasures within and side by side we would eat our lunches until the bell rang If you don t know Nancy or her equal then I suggest you buy the Betty Crocker cookies They ll taste better than most of the cookies you ll ve eaten and maybe you ll sit next to someone nice at lunch to share them with Be sure to share If you do she might sit next to you tomorrow 
Excellent This coffe is great and you have to love the price Flavor wise it is definetly a 5 star I do not think you can give a product bad reviews just because someone made a mistake in the shipping department You have to rate the coffee not the shipping of the coffee and it gets a top rate in my book 
As good as Senseo pods Received 12 packs just fine Pods are same size as Senseo and I cant taste a difference Not a great cup of coffee but drinkable 
As good as Senseo pods Unlike the other reviewer I received all 12 of the 18 count packs The pods do fit in my Senseo machine and are as good tasting which is not saying much they re all quite weak as the Senseo pods 
Trader Joe s is Cheaper Great tasting cereal and at Trader Joe s it is only 2 29 box 
healthy and delicious This cereal is absolutely delicious It even tastes good if you are eating it as chips The multibran and high fiber content are good for your health too 
cereal i like eating organic and this has lovely flavor and crunch i recommend it as part of a healthy breakfast 
Fantastic deal This was such a great deal 6 boxes for only 17 60 Usually one box alone is 3 99 The ordering was easy and the shipping was extremely fast by the end of the week The product came in great quality also Definitely recommend ordering from Amazon 
Multibran Cereal Easy way to get a healthy start to the day Flax was recommended by my doctor to help lower my cholesterol 
Rednecks love it too No kidding This cereal is fabulous and I NEVER buy anything that says organic on it I initially picked this cereal up because I lost about 20 pounds on Weight Watchers last year and I am very careful about total calories versus grams of fiber I decided to try a box and loved it immediately My husband even likes it He swears that it tastes just like Wheaties but I think it is much better I save over a dollar a box buy getting it on Amazon and I highly recommend it to everybody 
Popcorn Review I am so happy to be able to find popcorn that is NOT butter flavored It is difficult to find anything in the store without butter 
Wonderful This is the best popcorn You can t find it at the grocery store anymore so I m glad Amazon is carring it It s the only popcorn my Husband will heat 
Orville Redenbacher Natural Light Popcorn We eat a lot of Orville Redenbacher Natural Light Popcorn it is lightly salted not full of butter etc taste great and has to be better for us than most other popcorns on the market Much easier to fix than popping the old time way The only local store that carried it switched to some off brand popcorn We were so pleased when we found it at Amazon com got it at a good price and had free shipping Thank you Amazon 
5 star popcorn The product as well as the price and shipping was fantastic I will be a repeated customer Thanks again amazon 
Great Better than Wolff s Kasha I grew up eating Kasha and it is an easy to prepare healthy meal Bob s Red Mill has a great selection of all things GRAIN If you are ever in the Portland area you should check out the store restaurant Great vegetarian selections as well as meat eater stuff 
Like it s supposed to be This Kasha tastes good it cooks great in my rice cooker it s great with milk as morning cereal AND BETTER FOR YOU and I feed it to my son who loves it Great product 
Great soup Yeah it s a really good tasting soup Easy to make Throw in some onions and some pepper and it s very tasty very filling I don t must like health food but this stuff is genuinely good 
Hemp Seeds For My Raw Food Diet The hempseeds are great I wasn t able to buy them locally and found that buying them through Amazon not only was affordable but excellent quality I will continue to purchase many of the foods I need for my Raw Food diet at Amazon and it s partners 
Good product for protein fat and carbs I have been using this product for about it a year It is great in protein shakes as well as meal replacements It adds the good nutrition that is neede 
Best tasting green tea in my opinion Some of the other Yogi green teas like the one with echinacea taste kind of bad to me but I really like the antioxidant one Not sure if it s actually anti aging that s a pretty bold claim but it s nice Mildly caffeinated so it gives me some energy without making me wired And it s good plain or with milk or even milk and sugar if you want to make it more like a dessert 
Yummy Subtle sweet taste of lemongrass It s alot cheaper to buy it here than at the grocery store where it costs 5+ I drink about 5 cups a day 
Better price than the supermarket This is one of those items I buy regularly at the grocery store that I got for less from amazo 
Good Pasta This penne pasta is great Tastes as good or better than most wheat pastas Other non celiac people can t tell it s gluten free I will most likely buy from this brand again they are good and pretty cheap here on Amazon 
Madhave Agave Nectar This is a great product at a great price The light amber colored nectar reminds me of butterscotch and the darker variety is more like maple syrup Both blend easily in liquids and taste great on cream of rice cereal It s low on the glycemic index and doesn t require much 
Great item Never heard of it Did some research and decided to try it Extremely satisfied with my choice I went for the Light version since my research mentioned that it was the one with no strong after taste Much better natural choice than artificial sweeteners Does have calories but the glycemic index response is very good translation it doesn t give you that sugar rush I like things fairly sweet so I use 2 3 teaspoons per cup of coffee You may need less DEFINITELY get the 12 pack Best value and you ll be amazed at how much you start using it 
A Great Tasting Sweetener at last I could not believe how good this nectar tastes I was expecting it to have an aftertaste or be bitter like most artificial sweeteners I was pleasantly surprised at first taste I then had my husband taste it because he doesn t like artificial sweeteners and he loved it too It will come in handy on the Perricone Weight Loss diet because of it s low glycemic index The price for the case here on Amazon is really good too so I m stocking up If you are a diabetic this is the best tasting sweetener with the lowest glycemic index out there right now 
Great sugar substitute My search for a non bitter stevia non artificial non refined sugar sweetner is over at last I hesitated to buy this because of the requirement to buy 12 Boy am I glad I did buy the whole box We use this in everything including baking and find that it has a really good taste Most sweetners ruin the taste of our fine coffees but the agave simply supplies sweetness We ll be trying the amber agave next in hopes of a heartier sweetness for winter baked goods 
fix delivered Tastes as good to me as Starbucks Sumatra Good price free shipping if ya got Premier comes right to your door what s not to like 
Fiber riffic Have you ever described a food as tasting healthy when you mean it tastes so bad it must be good for you Fear not It is pleasantly adaptable to use with any fruit on hand I honestly will say though that it does have an earthy quality It may take the uninitiated some getting acquainted with just a little If trying for the first time I heartily recommend trying the Hemp Goddess Supreme recipe on the jar s label Surprisingly palatable You ll be proud to have done something nourishing and healthy for yourself Easy to digest The powder is indeed rather coarse When you find it ll tide you over very well until your next meal you won t mind Including this in one s eating habits can only be an addition for the positive 
The Best I was having blood sugar spikes and after adding Nutiva s hemp protein to my smoothies I can cruise for a good 3 hours without hunger or spiking This has been a godsend I chose Nutiva because a few die hard friends will use nothing else Plus I am a Californian and like that it s made here I tried a few other products over the months and keep coming back to Nutiva I just like it best and Organic is really important to me 
Great for a snack I love this cereal It makes a great lowfat healthy snack You don t have to be a kid or gluten sensitive to love this it is for everyone 
Kids and adults love it This is one of the great products that we love by Envirokidz The Gorilla Munch and Panda Puffs are both favorites at our house although we eat all of their gluten free cereals I highly recommend their products for those needing gluten free products especialy when making a transition with kids 
My kids are crazy for this ceral My celiac son and non celiac daughter both agree that this cereal is wonderful I have to agree Peanut butter taste is great and they are good both with and without milk My kids can polish off a box in 2 days 
Gluten free and it tastes good It s hard to find gluten free foods that taste good This cereal tastes very good and is gluten free I like it better than the Gorilla Munch flavor If you have children who like peanut butter and are gluten intolerant you need to try this cereal 
Maybe not Good for You but it is GOOD This is my favorite gluten free cereal hands down Let s face it it isn t nutritious This is not a health cereal But thank goodness It also won t send you in absolute sugar shock either and I love the peanut butter flavor It s a good light snack for breakfast and I bet it would be good in recipes too 
Truly grubbin I love this cereal I m a 30 year old cereal lover and this stuff is great I can t take the real sweet stuff like I used to and with only 6 grams of sugar per serving plus some fiber I often eat two bowls at a time as a treat Don t let the nutrition label fool you it s great tasting stuff Goes awesome with sliced banana and holds up very well in milk 
Great breakfast cereal Our local store has also stopped carrying Grapenut O s and we were delighted to find it on Amazon We bought a case and expect to be a regular customer 
This cereal is great I love this cereal For some unknown reason most grocery stores do not carry it and I have a lot of difficulty finding it anywhere I m glad to find it online but see it is currently unavailable on Amazon 
the greatest cereal ever I bought this cereal in massacheusetts on vacation my family devoured the entire box on the way home on the flight i have been so upset to not find this cereal anywhere and it is so good as a diabetic snack on the go i live in so cal and am awaiting its arrival 
Never stop making this cereal I agree They don t sell them in Mobile AL either Whats up with that I can t be the only person that knows this is the greatest all time cereal Crunchy and good for you too Please tell the people at Post to not stop making this cereal Is it popular anywhere Is it in stores anywhere anymore 
YUMMY I just love this cereal it s sooo crunchy and tasty I eat them right out of the box and don t feel guilty They aren t sold here anymore so I m glad I can get them here 
My Second Favorite AFTER Sumatra I have been an avid senseo fan for about a year However I was getting a bit bored drinking the same Dark Roast every morning I found the other flavors too mild So I was very happy when I saw the new flavors Sumatra Colombia Kenya and Brazil After trying all of them this is my close second favorite 
Excellent blend to wake me up in the morning We were glad to see that Amazon started carrying this Colombia Blend After discovering it in Europe and bringing several pacakges over we later had some shipped to us from family in Belgium This has a good strong taste and I particularly like it in the morning Recommended for any Senseo lover tired of the regular blends found in the retails stores 
delish i was looking for some different coffee for my senseo seeing as all i find around NEPA here are the same flavors ive already had i was quite pleased with this flavor i purchased it on a whim my only complaint is after three full bags of it im beginning to mix it with other flavors to keep it interesting thanks amazon 
Whey protein my way At last a product where I have complete control over what ingredients I can use and have versatility of what shakes drinks I make No need to worry about artificial ingredients and sweetners You can make just about any concoction with this protein powder and make it 100 natural Bottom line if you want to control what you put in your body you must get this 
Soft Chew Great Flavor This is nutritious flavorful jaw and teeth friendly snack for the person that wants a pleasant tasting meaty between the meals boost A change from the standard nothing can destroy it not even you jerky a required item for some activities but usually not for the normal environments in which we function most of the time 
tasty and nitrite free My kids love this jerky for its flavor and I m happy to let them enjoy it as a protein boost snack because it s free of the nitrite based preservatives found in many jerky products 
I love licorice but cant eat wheat so this is I love licorice but cant eat wheat which is in most licorice candies so I was soooooo happy to find this I would buy again I bought a case and it won t be going to waste Besides licorice is good for circulation and better than other candies P S Not too sweet either Not bland definitely but I liked its reasonable sweetness 
I love this stuff I don t like water I know I m supposed to drink it but I just don t like it I have tried most of the powdered drink mixes and this is the only one that I really like I actually crave it I drink more water now than at any time in my life because it tastes good I honestly can t believe that this is a diet drink Zero carbs 5 calories and great taste what more could you want 
great tastes great if you like crystal light not syrupy sweet like sugary brands although i do use more water than they suggest plus you cant beat this pric 
An Amazing Protein Energy Source If you dig the taste I am a huge fan of Ruth s Hemp Protein Powders in this blend with Flax and Maca you get a ton of great nutrients and the boost of Maca which is a good energy source I use this with 10oz of almond milk 5 6 frozen strawberries and a 1 2 frozen banana Blended up in my Vitamix The only thing about this powder is that it does have a distinct taste I like it but some may not If you do find you like the taste you ll be hard pressed to find a better protein powder on the market 
Hot or Cold I tried one case about 2 months ago and absolutely love it I has a great kick and is excellent hot of cold I just received cases 3 and 4 one for work and the other for home It has a very smooth hot chocolate taste when heated in the microwave 
My daughter s favorite These were just as good as their other coconut bars and the mango was not overwhelming 
Great for tea lovers I purchased two of these chests as gifts Beautifully crafted even finish color will coordinate with most decors Excellent price for this product Lining is an off white my preference would be a darker color that is simply a matter of personal taste Recipients raved about the chests and couldn t wait to serve their tea 
Mmmm Tasty At first I was leery about buying food because there was no nututritional info in the description These have 11 carbs and 1 gram of prorein just like the brand in my supermarket They are made with organic rice and taste great I saved a whole 1 per bag on these and with Amazon Prime shiping was free Needless to say I reordered when the first case was gone 
Gluten Free Spice Cake Mix This is one of the best gluten free mixes around It is especially good when mixed with pumpkin to make pumpkin bread You wouldn t know that it s gluten free 
Gluten free Ginger Snaps are terrific I have been playing around with modifying favorite recipes to make them gluten free as well as trying various pre packaged mixes this one s a winner To make terrific Ginger Snap cookies just follow directions on the box 
Dr Kracker Flatbread i love this product it is tasty and good and healthy i can eat it on stage 2 of the south beach diet 
Amazing crackers I am low carb for life due to health issues The one thing that I miss most in my low carb life style is crispy crunch These crackers are amazing They are so crunchy and taste fantastic and while they would not work on a very low carb diet they work just fine as an occasional treat in a low carb life style They have a very nutty flavor and you can actually see the various seeds they contain in other words they are real whole grain crackers I am hooked 
Healthy crunchy and tastes great The Dr Kracker Flatbread Seed Spelt are not only healthy but taste great and are very crunchy I gave some to my daughter and she liked them enough to buy herself a case Also these crackers are very filling relative to the amount of carbohydrates they contain Amazon sells these for much less than the health food stores so the price is amazing 
yum The hazelnuts are fresh therefore wonderfully crunchy and flavorsome I ll be back for more Thank you for providing a superior product Mr Bob of Red Mill and Amazon 
Acquired taste When I lived on the border of England and Wales I had a roommate from Copenhagen Denmark and he got some of this in his Christmas goodie basket from his Mom At first it is a shock to the system and I was the only American in the house that didn t spit it out Soon I was bugging him to get his Mom to send more It is a testament to the impression that it made that 25 years later I checked Amazon to see if I could get it here Before I got home my wife and kids had gotten into the box and tried it They didn t try a second piece I however after the initial shock of the first piece remembered why I liked it And although this case will probably last me a long time I do rather enjoy the flavor But be warned the flavor is HEAVY on the salt and very light on the sweet Not for the low sodium diet alt all But it is a treat that you can enjoy without emptying the whole container in a sitting and wonder where it went So if you are adventurous or if you remember the taste from your European adventures try this exotic treat 
Convenient and cost effective way to try several types of tea Celestial Seasonings makes great tea bagged tea in visually and philosophically inspired packaging The wellness assortment features five flavors of four bags each in separate interior envelopes It s a great way to have several styles of herbal refreshment available without a lot of open packages around Great value for the money at Amazon prices too 
yummy They taste like those little bits of cheese that melt out of a grilled cheese sandwhich and get a little burnt by the griddle I think they taste great but they do have a bit of sodium in them 
Great flavor and crunch This crunch dried fruit is delicious The fruit has a fresh flavor even though the pieces are dried We ve tried several different varieties and haven t been disappointed Great for a mid afternoon pick me up 
classy canned seafood I love to eat canned seafood from Crown Prince and C P FANCY PINK CRAB MEAT AND FANCY WHITE ARE THE BEST CANNED CRAB MEAT 
Yummy twist on classic mac n cheese Only reason this item gets a 4 is because of the price I can get this for 1 69 in my local store and even cheaper when I have coupons can t do that with amazon Otherwise my family loves this version of organic mac n cheese wish they made the larger size My 7 yr old doesn t mind the little green flecks he knows they are the special tasty ingredient and now isn t as squeemish to see green bits in other items 
Bakery on Main Gluten Free Granola This is a tasty product unlike some of the gluten free foods that I have tried It is very crunchy with lots of fruit and nuts It has plenty of calories but I use it as a topping for other less tasty cereals e g bran flakes or some of the high fiber cereals that remind me of twigs and leaves I will definitely be ordering more in the future 
the best coffee ever I was recently at a very nice restaurant for dinner and this was the coffee they served It was very rich and delicious We raved about it so much that our server gave us some of the beans to take home I ve been addicted ever since This is by far the best price I ve been able to find 
Illy is by far the best tasting espresso After having Illy at the espresso bars in Italy well no other espresso tasted good to me Illy tastes great made in a good pump espresso machine It also tastes great made in a steam espresso machine e g a low end Krups and a Moka an Italian poor man s espresso maker The rich flavor isn t burnt tasting like many espresso roasts Everyone I ve made an Illy espresso for raves over the flavor compard to espresso from chain coffee stores A tip when brewing espresso using a steam espresso machine Shut off the valve before any steaem comes through the coffee The high temperature steam will leach unwanted flavors into the coffee I used to buy Illy at the local stores but the prices were over 11 per can sometimes 12 I was happy to see Amazon start carrying it at an even lower price If you can t find Illy a good runner up is Lavazza however its flavor isn t as intense as Illy 
These are great tasting These tuna filets are so great tasting They take two minutes to prepare and the terriyai sauce is very flavorful The meat is tender and juicy Highly recommend and will definitly be ordering more 
Good sea stuff Prime tuna fillets seasoned perfectly and presented attractively instead of like cat food 
Another great tea from Numi I was already a fan of Numi s Morning Rise and Monkey King Jasmine teas but their Gunpowder Green tea is an absolute standout Sure it s in a teabag but you can see that there is real tea in there not just tea dust You will not be disappointed with this tea 
Best bagged green tea I became a fan of green tea when my Navy duties took me to Japan and Korea In Japan particularly I learned a little about the differences in green teas shade grown finely ground and so on Since returning to my land locked home in the Rockies the only good green tea I ve been able to get my hands on has been through mail order If you re drinking Lipton brand green tea and have judged green tea accordingly you really are missing out This is the first green tea in a bag as opposed to loose leaf that really reminds me of the good teas I had in Japan At work I don t make time to pre heat my tea pot and my tea cups and brew it properly so I really appreciate a delicious tea in the convenience of a bag and if you like green tea I m certain you ll like this one 
A Low Caffeine Hand Rolled Fine Green Tea Temple of Heaven Gunpowder Green Tea is a premium Numi tea It is a low caffeine green tea is certified organic and is kosher On the box the manufacturer says it better than I ever could Our whole leaf Temple of Heaven Gunpowder Green Tea is gently steamed within hours of being plucked then skillfully hand rolled into small tight pearls This process preserves its delicate flavor and aroma far longer than other green teas Steeped in hot water the leaves unfurl releasing a well rounded full bodied flavor Rich in fluoride calcium and anti oxidants and with very little caffeine this is a perfect choice to greet the evening The price is perfect a big savings over single boxes If you like Numi teas get it you won t be sorry If you are new to Numi but love green tea or want a green tea that you can drink in the evening I do not think you could find a better source than Numi 
I love these cookies These cookies are one of my favorites They are very light and are excellent with milk or coffee I can t wait for them to go on sale again so I can stock up 
Addictive little cookie As one reviewer said be careful you don t eat the entire package Well that didn t work for me These are incredible One of my co workers had ordered a CASE and it didn t last a week in our office 
Delightful When I got two 25 packs for 4 with free shipping I couldn t say no I d be losing money if I didn t buy them Anyways they are pretty good slight hazelnut filling Not overly sweet like Oroes 
AWESOME Cookies These have to be one of the best cookies ever They taste kinda like a saltine with chocolate an awesome combination EVERYONE who has tried them LOVED them 
Addicted We re on our second box of these and still love them They stay fresh in their packaging and mostly arrived undamaged Occasionally the first and last cookie in each pack were broken but just within acceptable limits check for too many broken cookies on receipt and exchange if needed 
nice cookies these are better cookies than American ones you would be surprised highly recommended 
Tasty and different Please realize that these are not cookies as much as crackers They have a sweet taste but don t expect an oreo as the taste of hazelnut is much more subtle than other tastes Overall excellent I very much enjoyed them 
I love these cookies These cookies normally cost 1 50 to 2 00 per package in food specialty stores I love them but I resisted when I was shopping for Christmas BUT when I saw them for 25 packages for 12 00 with free shipping I caved OK they are not low fat but one splurge a year won t kill us 
want to buy it again great cocoa cookie really crisp My hubby like it so much We definitely will buy it again 
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT I have been using Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil since December I used to buy it at the heatlh food store by my home however after receiving the great deal on Amazon I will continue to buy it here Since I have been using Nutiva Coconut Oil my skin is glowing and I feel better all over I use it as a daily moisturizer on my skin after my showers and I drink 2 tablespoons daily I have a very hardy healthy appetite and eat alot For the amount of food I eat I should weigh more than I do I believe that the Coconut Oil helps you maintain a healthy weight I am so glad I found out about Coconut Oil and I will continue to use it forever Thank you 
FABULOUS WONDERFUL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED I have been studying the benefits of coconut oil for some time I tried several different brands but when I opened a jar of the Nutiva I knew that I had found what I was looking for Absolutely the freshest most wonderful organic virgin coconut oil on the planet I substituted the butter and or vegetable oil in several recipes with the Nutiva coconut oil and achieved incredible results I even fried eggs in it last night and they were GREAT I will never fry with any other oil again I also use it as a spread on toast bagels and muffins AAAAA+++++ Try it you ll love it 
Nutiva VCO Great Product Amazon delivered exactly what I ordered and on time For me Nutiva VCO is a great alternative to unhealthy cooking oils If we compare short chain fatty acids such as the lauric chains in coconut oil which are metabolized within the mitochondria of cells versus longer chain bearing oils which require conjugation and transport to the liver I think VCO must be healthier for me overall Nutiva also tastes good and frankly people it s a great lotion Yes it takes a few minutes to sink in but once it does you have soft skin 
Great Taste Virgin coconut oil is great for your health and taste buds I tried several different brands I like this one a lot I am not a big fan of coconut flavor but this one smells different It s preasant Just 54 ounce jar was too big I didn t have a sense of US unit I recommend smaller jars if you don t bake often You ll enjoy this oil as a substitution of butter and also you can use as your natural skin cream 
Freeze dried raspberries These are DELICIOUS So good perfect for a snack I love them 
Great flavor great snack I bought these because my husband loved the Just Blackberries so much We both agree These are great He eats them as a snack between meals I put them in yoghurt yum If you love berries these are a wonderful alternative when they are out of season 
Excellent in so many ways Another reviewer called this a genetically engineered horror and the same review gave high ratings to Poptarts not that they taste bad but they are pretty high in sugar and artificial stuff I believe the name of the company is Just Tomatoes with the name of the product being Just Rasberries Freeze dried fruit is hardly a genetically engineered horror It is JUST RASBERRIES nothing else added and very good in taste and very healthy I like the rasberries and the strawberries best I have used them in my cereal as a snack out of the box in yougurt and in smoothies If you like to have certain fruits when they are not in season and don t care for frozen these will fit the bill 
Delicious These disapeared fast in my house They are great in granola or any breakfast cereal They are also very good plain but I prefer the blueberries from the same company 
Outstanding This was so easy to make great for you also can t wait to order more 
Delectable Delite This is a very tasty bar I have tried almost every raw food bar on the market and this is definitly one of the best It s not too heavy and tastes soooooooo good have I mentioned it s yummy LoL 
Not as good as a lara bar A bit more sticky and not quite what I would call a chocolate brownie Tasted almost identical to the coconut chocolate lara bar 
Pure Brownie Bar Mostly Good The product didn t taste like your typical brownie but it was very chocolatey and very tastey The consistency was rather dense and chewy as opposed to cake like Wholesome ingredients and being a healthy alternative to typical junk food are what make Pure Chocolate Brownie Bars a four star product This is more like a health food brownie If I can eat healthy brownies all the better I plan to purchase more 
Exactly as Advertised This bar is the closest thing I ve ever experienced to eating a brownie fresh from the oven in a packaged food I have no idea how the folks at Pure Bar managed to make a chocolate bar that tastes so much like baked goods using only raw and living ingredients but it s wonderful that they have and I mean to buy several more cases Any of the store bought brownies you ve had won t satisfy you like this will Entemanns and Hostess are not nearly as delicious and warm tasting and the health food and energy bars I ve had that are chocolate flavored always end up tasting like wheat germ or oats It s easy to carry one bar fills me up and as a chocolate fan I am happy to see that Pure Bar uses raw cacao powder the real deal and not carob chocolate substitutes You can definitely taste the difference This particular Pure Bar product makes for the best tasting snackfood or dessert I ve ever eaten out of a wrapper and unless you re on a completely raw vegan diet it s going to be better for you than whatever meal you ate just beforehand If you like chocolate like I do you re going to love this It s a soft gooey brownie pure and simple walnuts and all 
Yummy We love these crackers My kids all eat them and I keep a bunch in my backpack for emergencies They are crunchy and have a nice aftertaste They smell really good too 
Well I love them I really like these cookies A very unique vanilla y taste The only thing you have to watch is the saturated fat The box quickly disappears 
Great Cookies at a Great Price My kids love these cookies It is great not having to go to the health food store spacifically to pick them up and pay more then three dollars a box If you are on the gf cf diet then I would check these out as well as the other gf cf evnirokids products 
Awesome This is my first Robert s American Gourmet product The taste is amazing on these It tastes like you are eating Sour Cream and Onion chips These are very addicting to eat I recomend these 
Excellent espresso in a pod I love ESE pods I know some coffee snobs disagree but I ll take 90 of the taste for 10 of the work any day As for pods I ve had Starbucks Illy and Espressione Arabica I like the Espressione the best I lived in Italy for 3 years and hit the coffee bars daily I know what I like in espresso The Starbucks was a bit too rough too American tasting Suprisingly though the Starbucks pods tasted just like an espresso at one of their stores Very consistent The Illy is too smooth It goes well with food and after dinner but I tend to take my espresso at breakfast and prefer a bold smooth taste The Espressione Arabica achieves just that I ll be buying it again for my every day use 
Convenient and delicious I have a Briel espresso maker and these pods have made using the machine more convenient than my stovetop pot I have used the expensive pods and these taste as good and have fabulous crema Enjoy 
Makes excellent espresso The espresso pod is easy to use easy to clean and makes very good espresso I am very happy with it and just ordered another box 
great coffee About to order my fourth box this year It makes a smooth brew ideal for my latt 
Loves convenience in GA These pods have got to be the best invention yet They are compact extremely easy to use is the best solution to making several very quick cups of coffee Fresh ground coffee is nice but there is virtually no mess with these pods The crema is just as good as ground coffee these can be used in a pod holder as well as a one cup filter basket What more could a person want 
Excellent but expensive I really got hooked on the great taste and superior creama it produces but I find it a bit overpriced compared to other pods I now buy pods from Boyd coffee at a substantial savings Wish Amazon would put it on sale so I could stock up 
deliciously easy but what happened now I have enjoyed those pods for more than a year with my Frances Frances Espresso machine but today I am a little bit concerned about the fact that your price went from 37 99 last month to 60 00 today Why The advantage of buying 150 pods at once was to cut down on the price if it is the same price or more expensive than other stores do we still have a reason to purchase them from Amazon Please enlighten me I would be very sorry to have to go elsewhere Thanks 
This works I use the regular Sleepytime frequently in the evenings but on those nights when you need a little something extra this stuff is amazing Its very nice when travelling and you are having a hard time sleeping in a strange bed I don t like taking medications no Lunestra for me but with this don t need to 
Works Well I like the flavour and the product does just as it says very well and non addicting 
A NATURAL CURE FOR INSOMNIA THAT WORKS I ve had difficulty falling asleep since my college days Once I entered my mid 30 s the insomnia became more frequent Melatonin and valerian pills did not work unless taken at levels that left me with a morning hangover effect L Tryptophan 5 HTP and GABA were ineffective I have also tried numerous prescription sleep is necessary to get through nursing school and OTC medications that are used to treat insomnia Most left me with a headache or excessive daytime sleepiness zombie mode I first tried Sleepytime Extra Sleepytime and other chamomile teas do not work for me about 6 weeks ago and each time I drink it I become sleepy within 15 minutes Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime Extra works like a charm The 25mg of Valerian root works synergistically with the chamomile and tilia estrella I m stocking up before the FDA comes down on valerian like it did kava kava I also recommend 30 60 minutes of sunlight in a m hours because many people are unaware that they have DSPS Delayed Sleep Phase Insomnia 
It s nice to have that something EXTRA I use to take valarian root pill before I went to bed but always felt it was a little too sedating With this tea it s a lot milder the differance is like a Lullaby vs a sledge hammer It also has a nice aroma bouquet and flavor I like to mix this with blueberry or when I m under the weather Echenacia tea Celestials wellness tea 
Relaxation with no hangover The tea works like a dream It relaxes me just enough to go to sleep and I don t wake up feeling drugged Works much better than valerian capsules 
Crisp Refreshing and Delicious If you love lemons and even if you don t think you do you will love this drink It is so crisp and refreshing chilled Yes it has sugar but what fruit juice or fruit for that matter doesn t If you don t drink soda like me and are kinda burnt on water try essn s juices Lemon and a little vodka make a great cocktail too They re a little pricey but quality products usually are It s also great to get it delivered to my door and save the trip to the store 
Best Cereal I ve ever tasted I wan t one to eat cereal in the morning My doctor had me visit a nutritionist who suggested the Kashi brand cereals I ve been eating this for 2+ years now and enjoy it every day Who said cereal has to be bland to be good for you 
Oreo flavored crackers without the creme filling These are great snacks for traveling such as by airplane or car The cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker The cracker is less messy than a cookie which can break apart and crumble and for this reason a preferred treat The texture is comparable to a medium crunchy chip and very light to eat The first response by most people when eating the cracker for the first time is Humm these are good This is a pleasant response and these crackers will probably be a big success over time 
Good cookies good price I might be a little strange but I can t get enough fortune cookies If you need them in bulk like me this is a pretty good deal Flavor is good crispy and individually wrapped Fortunes are average and have lotto numbers on each one 
Hard to find Bisquick mix I was pleased to be able to order this Bisquick mix because the stores in our area no longer carry it We love these honey flavored bisquits but will be hard pressed to use all 22 before the expiration date I ordered them in the middle of March and they have a June expiration date It would be good if the expiration date was longer or if it was given in the product description 
Best Ever Biscuit Mix My husband never cared much for my homemade biscuits I didn t make them often enough to really get it right like my mother and grandmother used to do Then I tried the Betty Crocker Bisquick Mix and WOW what a difference it made We like the rolled method better than the drop but either way these are easy quick and consistently great biscuits As good a true southern biscuit as even my grandmother used to make My husband is now a very happy man when I make his favorite sausage gravy biscuits breakfast 
Awesome coffee This is some of the best French Roast coffee I really enjoy the taste aroma and color I highly recommend this coffee to anyone who wants a great cup of strong dark coffee 
Pamela s gluten free Chocolate Walnut Biscotti This is worth trying I enjoy this when I need chocolate or a desert and haven t had time to bake It s yummy alone or dunked in coffee It is more dense than traditional wheat Biscotti so it did take eating two or three before I fully enjoyed having this as a desert or treat option I give this ready made sweet treat a thumbs up for the gluten intolerant 
Great relaxer and does not interfere with my medications I have been a big fan of Celestial Seasonings since the 1980s when a friend drank the different blends and I tried one My husband drinks this faithfully every night and I sometimes drink some of his I do have one complaint though small when I drink a full cup it sends me to the bathroom a couple of times in the night I also notice that it does not interfere with my or my husband s medications that is a big concern among alot of people and medical community Everyone reacts differently I know if you want to buy one box and try a few drinks of it each night or every other night if you are on prescriptions like we are we are only baby boomers not old people I would do it that way In a previous review from someone who sweetens it I think that would ruin the whole taste and aroma of the SleepyTime Give it time and it will grow on you 
A wonderfully different taste Ah it s a definite American story in 1969 friends Mo Siegel and Wyck Hay of Colorado began selling the herbal teas that they had previously only made for themselves From such small beginnings came that famous tea company Celestial Seasonings Among Celestial Seasonings many products is Sleepytime an herbal infusion that has such a wonderfully different taste that I have been able to win my wife over to it and she does not consider herself to be a tea drinker Many are the evenings when I will brew up some Sleepytime to go along with my famous spiced bread Anyway Sleepytime is largely a mixture of chamomile and spearmint which produces a healthy drink that has a wonderful aroma and taste I m sure that I cannot adequately describe the taste it doesn t taste like anything you ve ever tried before but its seductive flavors will win you over If I could make one suggestion to Celestial Seasonings it would be to change the name to something else I ve had friends refuse to try it afraid that the tea will make them feel drowsy You can buy Sleepytime with Valerian root which definitely promotes sleepiness but the regular product is just a pleasant herbal drink I suppose it s called Sleepytime because its fresh spearmint tastes very good late in the evening and its natural lack of caffeine means that it won t keep you awake But this is a wonderful product that tastes great at any time of the day By the way it also makes a unique zingy iced tea 
Wonderful Tea to Drink Before Bedtime This is awesome to help relax you before drifting off to sleep I highly recommend it 
The classic Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint but the additional ingredients including rose buds create a satisfying complex blend that is very tasty and soothing Not only is Sleepytime caffeine free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey Sleepytime contains chamomile spearmint lemongrass tilia flowers blackberry leaves orange blossoms hawthorne berries and rosebuds The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect Blackberry leaves which are soothing to the stomach contain tannins which provides a tea like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect it also can be used to soothe tummy aches headache menstrual cramps and is a mild anti fungal Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging they utilize 100 natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don t package each tea bag individually Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface Quote from the box Ultimately the bond of all companionship whether in marriage or friendship is conversation Oscar Wilde 
Nice afternoon coffee We were glad to see that Amazon started carrying this Kenya Blend After discovering it in Europe and bringing several pacakges over we later had some shipped to us from family in Belgium This has a nice subtle yet defined taste and I particularly like it in the afternoon with a cookie covered in Belgian chocolate or biscotti Recommended for any Senseo lover tired of the regular blends found in the retails stores 
Kenya Blend For Strong Coffee Lovers This blend lives up to its description of dark robust and strong It has a slight bitter aftertaste that makes me want to go one or two blends lighter but will appeal to those seeking their classic morning beverage strong and jolting 
great product Great product what else can I say While I lived in the caribbean I ordered food since it was too expensive to buy good quality food there 
Very versatile More than just for pies and cobblers these blueberries are great in breakfast cereal in muffins and in pancakes Or put them atop a scoop of vanilla ice cream Yum 
Good Stuff I actually drink this cold I brew an entire pitcher of it hot and then put it in the fridge to enjoy as a cold beverage This tea has a nice mango not overpowering flavor and is both refreshing and crisp I have yet to try a Bentley s tea that I haven t enjoyed so I wouldn t hesitate to recommend this flavor or Bentley s in general Good Stuff 
great product Great product what else can I say While I lived in the caribbean I ordered food since it was too expensive to buy good quality food there 
Tastes very good If you like a thin crust pizza these will work for you They hold the toppings well and taste great I tried and failed many times to make my own pizza crust This is worth the price if you must have pizza I froze the other pizza shells and they always turn out great Just sit out thaw for about 30 mins before adding toppsing cooking 
Fabulous I never thought I d bother to review a cookie but These are terrific indistinguishable from real cookies We go through a lot of these 
Fantastic Rarely can I say that a GF product tastes better than the gluten version Thse cookies do though Melt in your mouth delicious and just the right amount of lemon I am confident tht if you gave these to gluten eaters they would not be able to tell the difference 
The best gluten free cookies I have ever had I feel like have tried every gluten free baked good out there Since I am allergic to dairy eggs soy and bananas as well this product is a lifesaver for when I need a cookie They taste really really good and don t make me sick I love these things I pray they never stop making them 
Delicious and good for you These are high quality pilchard sardines wild caught from Morocco and contain 2g of heart healthy Omega 3 fatty acids per can They are boneless and skinless and ready to eat My favorite way of eating sardines is crushed with some extra virgin olive oil and hot sauce Jamaican pickapeppa sauce is ideal on top of crackers Buying a whole case of 25 cans is much more economical than buying individual cans of comparable quality at our local supermarket We re very happy that Amazon sells these sardines 
Good Value The tea is very good The box looks to be made of plywood but is reasonably attractive solid and functional If the box would have had a veneer over the plywood or something along those lines then this would have been 5 stars As it is I am very pleased with what I got considering how reasonably priced it was 
Oddly Good Has a weird after taste but over all it s good and way better than even diet soda with no sodium I m not sure what a previous rater was talking about I can read all the ingredients in the soda with in my book usally mean it s all natural ingredents Already bought a couple different flavors to tr 
I d prefer more natural ingredients Be aware the list of ingredients contains nether pomegranate or blackberry I am also not sure putting amino acids in a drink is such a grand idea We get all amino acids we need from proteins anyway In my opinion this soda does not taste very natural However it does appear to be a healthier alternative to regular sugar loaded carbonated drinks 
I love these breadcrumbs Try these Packaged in 6 individual canasters for long lasting quality I gave some to my grown daughters and we have used these on fish shrimp pork chops etc I will buy these again 
If you need Gluten free Buy this This Cereal is great Great taste for Gluten Free It is hard to find a cereal that is not like cardboard when it is gluten free This tastes just like the cereal we used to enjoy Very Happy with this brand will buy again 
great for gluten free diet My daughter is 6 and is gluten free due to Celiac She enjoys this cereal which is great since she s a picky eater 
Soo Good Wow this granola is amazing It s so crunchy with lots of flavor and texture A must for anyone looking for the best gluten free granola out there You won t be disappointed 
Mmmmm Finally something crunchy and tasty I have been purchasing Bakery on Main products from the health food store for a while now and find they are the best gluten free granola I have found Have shared them with coworkers who have no idea they are gluten free Would purchase again from Amazon because the price is much lower than the health food shops 
MORE THAN JUST CERTIFIED ORGANIC HEALTHY THIS STUFF TASTES GREAT IN A NUTSHELL Everything that one could want in a boxed Macaroni Cheese meal is in this excellent product from Annie s Homegrown Its ingredients are Certified Organic with real cheese and whole wheat pasta The rusult is a very healthy fast food that tastes significantly better creamier richer and more satisfying than its processed counterpart and WITHOUT COSTING THAT MUCH MORE 
annie s mac n cheese best of the organic mac n cheese products Even my teenage son loves it and asks for me to buy this brand We usually get the one with Wisconsin yellow cheddar but this one is very good also 
Easy Delicious This is fast food that tastes great It really is pretty close to the real thing and tastes like comfort food The noodles aren t mushy The cheese sauce is creamy flavorful I like to add some extra cheese I also add veggies or a can of tuna now then Makes for a very quick meal The organic and non organic varieties taste exactly the same 
Best Mac Cheese Out There A young mother to be experiencing morning sickness enjoyed and even began to crave this Mac Cheese delicious and so creamy You just have to try it 
Organic Goodness Great tasting organic product I have been on a somewhat organic diet since I was a child My parents always had an organic garden and now I have one My son also loves organic food and this was a great alterative to regular store brands Adding organic sour cream or extra cheese to it just enhances the taste Amazon is a great way to purchase this product if you do not have a Fresh Market or a health food store in your area 
Bob s Red Mill Fava Beans Very uniform texture and big in size Excellent quality highly recommended with full body flavor 
A Class Act Whether you call it sauce or gravy or something else the liquid background for the steak and vegetables is exceptional A cut above some homecooked stews this steak stew is in a class by itself compared to other prepared stews I will be ordering this again 
healthy snack These are wonderful Very crunchy and tasty Healthy for people on the go Just keep some in your car if you need a snack in between running errands and or taking kids to activities Great snack for duffle bags when kids aren t able to get home right away from a game 
Fair Trade Organic AND affordable We ve been looking for a good French Roast that is also Fair Trade and preferably Organic But the others we have tried have either not tasted as we expect one was even chocolaty not what we want in a French Roast or just way too expensive This one tastes like a good French Roast coffee should and it is even less expensive that the Starbucks I had been buying at Costco All that and organic too We finally found the coffee we ve been looking for 
Yum Yum Yummy I had been getting the Starbucks French Roast coffee and enjoying it quite a bit However I decided I would switch to organic coffe to avoid the unnatural stuff I must say I was not disappointed When I opened the package of coffee I found the beans fresh and oily Upon grinding and brewing them I found my tongue in a tastey coffe wonderland I m hooked 
Good Dark roast coffee Don t be fooled this is not you average Starbucks French Roast The roast is darker and the beans are oiler The roast is a little on the dark side for me but this is still good coffee I have used it for drip and stove top espresso and it is fine for both As someone else mentioned the oily nature of the beans prevents them from free flowing through a burr grinder One strange thing is that there is no date on the bags No expiration date No roast date In fact there is no printed code or lot Who knows how old it is It is good that these purged bags do a good job of keeping coffee fresh while sealed No can here just the usual coffee bag 
Slippery good I love the flavor of this French Roast which isn t always what I go for but the beans are so oily they don t grind well in my burr grinder I ve found that with other French Roast beans too but none as difficult as these Maybe that s why they taste better than other French Roasts Overall great high quality coffee 
good coffee I bought this initially based only on its price since it worked out to a little over 5 dollars a pound Since I bought it the first time it has risen in price twice and is now about seven dollars a pound Still a good deal with free shipping but I can buy bulk boutique coffee for about 8 dollars a pound locally As a result Amazon may lose a customer if they keep raising the price However it is an exceptional french roast much better than Starbucks product Delivery has been fast and painless 
Excellent French Roast Besides espresso roast beans french roast beans are my favorite Rocamojo does not disappoint I love opening a new bag of this coffee and smelling those beans and the way my whole house smells when I brew with them These are dark oily beans These beans mean business The coffee tastes as good as it smells and makes a great dark rich strong tasting coffee with that beautiful french roast after taste that lasts on your palette the whole day You have to like dark roast coffees though to like these beans Just like you wouldn t order an IPA if you like Miller Lite These are the IPA of coffee beans Yum 
GREAT COMMENTS When people tell me it tastes like the coffee shop I guess that s the ultimate critique Funny thing is I agree with them Great coffee ROCK A MOJO Looks like they varnish the beans they are so dark and shiny MMMMMMM good stuff 
Betty Crocker Brownie Mix Excellent product and such a handy way to buy it Amazon to the rescur again 
Sip and Savor This tea is absolutely splendid either iced or hot It s the only drink that gets better as it sits Its zip actually increases 
Great tasting I know that people have different likes and dislikes but I am truly shocked to see a one star review on this tea I think this is my favorite flavor out of any tea I have ever tried and I drink a ton of tea 
Satisfied customer I loved this product and I can t find it in my local stores I had to be careful not to eat too much 
Great snack I originally bought these for my kids but they didn t seem to like it so I started eating them They are delicious and only 70 calories a bag They make a perfect snack and it keeps me away from cookies candies and other desserts Yes they are salted but are nowhere near as salty as potato chips or cheetoes 
yummy and crunchy These really taste great I will order them again A nice snack item and much crunchier than dried fruits and veggies I have eaten in the past Is it as yummy as chips No but it is a decent substitute for a lot lower calories 
Parents kids both love these I d been ordering these for my family but decided to put a case out at my son s 6th birthday party The kids gobbled them up and the moms came running to me in droves to ask where I got them No one had a problem with the salt and the mom s liked the flavor as much as their kids Buy these for your next party and you will be everyone s hero 
Great Stuff Too Much At Once Too Much Salt This is some amazing sweet corn It s dried but also very light and airy and it really does taste like sweet corn and is a great snack Why only 4 stars One is that they put salt on it for some reason which really detracts from the overall taste if they d leave out the salt and maybe tell to that you can add some to taste and neither of us would add any it doesn t need it they d have a real winner The second is that you have to buy a case quantity and while it s a very tasty snack it s going to take a long time and waste a lot of cabinet space to get through 24 packs of it especialy with the salt content 
Favorite cereal This cereal quickly disappeared from my pantry shelf It s not too sweet just crunchy enough and very flavorful We will buy this again and again 
The Best It is a shame someone ruined the star rating on this product with a shipping complaint We have bought the Supper Nutty and Crisp n Crunchy Golden temple granola flavors also All are great but this one is by far the best My husband absolutely loves it he can t get enough It is like a traditional granola with a good crunch but it isn t too sweet which is nice It is also one of the few brands without processed sugars I will be ordering this one again Note the ingredients listed on Amazon are incorrect The first ingredient is organic rolled oats not organic rolled wheat At least when we purchased a month ago this is a wheat free soy free vegan cereal aside from potential cross contamination Unless it changed within the month since our purchase for some strange reason 
LOVE this product For anyone who needs a shelf stable quick lunch option this is the one The soup is delicious and the prep couldn t be easier plus I love that you can prepare and eat it right in the bowl I always make sure I have a few of these in my desk drawer at work so I never have an I forgot my lunch issue and the portion is big enough to actually constitute a full meal for lunch anyway I love the Udon flavor and my husband swears by the Miso 
great but not crazy about the noodles I ve had miso soups at various restaurants and this is actually really good I love the fact they are environmentally concerned with their products I ll buy their products just knowing they care so much about how much we have to throw away so it s biodegradable Only thing I m not crazy about is the noodles I would have preferred a thinner noodle only because it s so bulky and not really typical of Asian dish 
AUTHENIC thick Udon Noodles Biodegradable bowl Authenic but a little bland for me I add Ponzu sauce to taste and make sure it gets really HOT in the micriwave If steaming when you take it out it tastes better Pre Rinsing the noodles as directed is nonsense Just cover them with good clean water I never use TAP stir in the sauce and toppings and nuke it about 90 seconds uncovered Stir and serve It had everyone in MY OFFICE drooling with questions Best price is on Amazon just order 2 so you don t pay shipping 
It s unreal how good the Kimchi soup is I ve tried several of the Annie Chun flavors and I liked most of them but the Kimchi soup is just unbelievably delicious This is the BEST packaged soup product of any kind that I have ever tried and I usually dislike canned or packaged soup products This is even better than my favorite canned Brunswick Stew that I have loved for so long It is moderately spicy but if you don t mind a bit if spice this one is just too good to pass up I could practically live off of this stuff Thank you Annie Chun for making a packaged meal worth eating 
Finally A Fast Good Udon Soup Finally there is a quick way to make a great Udon Soup at home For any Udon fan this is a must try product The noodles are as good as Udon noodles get and the soup mix is great base to start your Udon Here is the way we make Udon using this product as a base We take the noodles and soup mix from two packages bowls add some additional soy sauce and spices we like and boil it all in a pan you don t need to screw around with all the noodle rinsing just throw them in the pot When the soup and noodles are warm we add chopped romaine This is super good and costs less than for two LARGE servings of Udon a deal by any standard When we really want a full on Udon we add some sliced pressed fish like the restaurants use in traditional Udon the half moon pressed fish white with the orange red coating and shrimp This is heavenly 
Hot and Sour Soup I have purchased this item several times It is good and can be expanded by adding more vegetables or chicken It comes packaged well and is easy to prepare It is also in an environment friendly bowl which is important to me 
Very Nice Tom Yum Soup I added a half of dozen or so of frozen pre cooked shrimp and this was great as an evening meal The package includes the spices that one would expect to find in a Tom Yum Thai soup While the quality may not be what one might expect to find in a good Thai restaurant preparation in five minutes is surely an acceptable compromise 
Wow these are awesome Picked them up at the local whole foods and we love them lots of crunch my lasy loves the seedlander I love the Muesli I highly recommend these 
Great healthy snack acquired taste When I first opened my 6 pack of crackers the organic nature really seemed to hit me hard at first But a few crackers later and they were hard to put down It is one of the healthiest crackers I ve had not salty but the currants provide that tinge of sweetness that really makes it an interesting cracker to eat and continue eating Highly recommended especially if you sit at a desk all day at work like me and want a healthy snack food 
Hint of sweetness The Dr Kracker Snacker Spelt Muesli Stick provide the same great taste and crunch as their other products but with a hint of sweetness due to the bits of dried fruit in the cracker Their smaller sizes makes them suitable for a quick snack and they are very filling The amount of carbohydrates in each is very small in comparison to other snack crackers 
Great snack that you can feel good about eating I diet and am very careful what I eat I allow myself a pack of these as a tasty treat and they are excellent Make the junk in the supermarkets pale by comparison 
Easy tasty quick snack My son loved these Unfortunately so does my husband which is why I m ordering more 
Gluten free Cream of Mushroom soup EXCELLENT replacement for Campbells condensed soup for those of us who need to eat gluten free It enabled me to revive some old recipes I had given up on I use this when cooking holiday green bean casserole and no one can tell the difference 
So glad I found this This is the best gf mix I ve found yet I too have not used it soley as a soup but as an ingredient in cooking other things like polenta or add evaporated milk to it to have something more like a cream of mushroom soup base I m so glad I found it 
Gluten Free Pantry Angel Food Cake Mix GREAT product I disagree with the person who gave this product only one star I did find that I had to beat the cake longer than the box indicated and needed to bake it longer I mixed my first one using my portable hand mixer which was really too small for this product Second time I used my new stand mixer with the whip attachment It more than doubled in volume after beating it about 10 minutes longer than the package suggested and I beat it on high The cake filled my tube pan to the top and I baked it about 5 minutes longer than package suggested as my first one was a bit underbaked My husband who is NOT celiac loves this cake also We can t tell the difference between this one and a regular angel food cake mix I also used 1 teaspoon of GF vanilla and 1 teaspoon of GF almond extract instead of using 2 of vanilla I like the almond flavoring in angel food cake better but that is personal preference 
a little too sweet This product is good but I add more water than the standard ratio because it is otherwise too sweet 
My favorite This is as close to grapefruit juice as it gets but it doesnot interfer with medications like the juice Very refreshing and tangy No artificial taste 
Almost as good as a Starbucks Doubleshot Tastes pretty good but it s still not Starbucks I like ordering this with free shipping and the GROCERY coupon codes Amazon runs occasionally Last time I got 10 off 2 cases Then its worth the price Their chocolate espresso beans are great 
Just like Starbucks but cheaper These are pefect for a quick pick me up in the morning I don t like hot drinks but I need something with the power of coffee to get me going after I wake up These drinks taste just as good as their Starbucks equivalent but are much less expensive 
Much better than average I wouldn t consider myself a jerky expert But I do like jerky and I have tried more than a handful of brands This is definitely better than most You can taste the brown sugar and the spicy Actually you can see the spicy all over the insides of the bag Don t rub your eye after eating this stuff Most of the strips were soft and chewy And not overly salty like others I ve tasted And I feel the spicy on my tongue as well as the back of my throat which is always a good sign I will be putting in another order in a few weeks so I can have some at a camping trip 
Lot a Hot I live on this stuff The hotter the better I get the Hot Spicy so I get the whole bag to myself to hot for the rest of the family HA I get at least 4 bags at a time Love it 
THE BEST BEEF JERKY IN THE WORLD MMMMMM SOOOOOO GOOD THIS IS THE BEST JERKY IN THE WORLD SOOO GOOD JUICY FLAVOR I EAT IT ALL IN ONE DAY ALL GONE THE SPICES KINDA HERT COMIN OUT THOUGH 
Incredible stuff Very high quality meat and just enough spice processed just enough to make it slightly soft If it wasn t so addictively good I d order another bag right now 
Excellent A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Fast and smooth transaction speedy delivery satisfaction guaranteed will do busines with again thank you 
My favorite jerky on Amazon I ll preface this by stating that I love hot foods and I am not affected by them so I can understand other reviews saying that the World Kitches Hot and Spicy was too spicy This was not the case for me though I found it to be a perfect blend of spicy and sweet I really enjoyed it and ordered more I got on a kick where I thought I would try all of the spicy jerkys on Amazon I found this to be the one I liked the most because of bothe the flavor and the fact that there were a lot of thin cuts of meat which made it easier to eat This does have a kick so if that is a potential problem you may want to go with something milder I will say I have had even hotter but if you enjoy some flavor with your spice you may want to give this a try 
Good quality good taste great value Yes this beef jerky is hot That s why it s hot spicy If you always order your Mexican or Chinese food mild I d say to get a different flavor The spice blend which is mostly hot pepper is pretty good The quality of the beef is as good or better than any of the mass market beef jerky you can pick up at your local store The big difference This stuff is about 1 4 the price If you like beef jerky buy this brand There is no better value out there unless you re making it yourself I ll probably order some every time I order books 
Special Treat for Guests It is special to be offered your choice of tea and company always enjoys picking their own flavor It is especially nice when it is presented in a lovely wooden box sort of like opening a gift You soon learn your friends favorites It also makes a lovely gift 
Buy it for the tea I saw this and thought it would be worth trying primarily to have a nice box to keep tea in The box is great but I was astonished at how much I like the teas Whatever their source for tea 100 Ceylon has a very smooth and distinctive flavor Their English Breakfast is easily the best black tea I ve tried and I love tea at least when taken without milk It s fine with milk but isn t as good as some UK teas The flavored teas are all very well balanced as well I d strongly recommend this or a related smaller size if you re looking for some very great tea as well as a good place to keep it 
Best Tasting Crystal Light I just love this stuff Sugar free It tastes GREAT Use it for mixed drinks also like vodka it will cut back on your calories big time 
Tasty We enjoy this all the time but we really enjoy it during the summer when we are outside Great taste 
Creamy and Delicious All Annie s products are excellent Beats the other name brands for flavor It s organic with no additives Good item to keep on hand for a quick lunch 
Makes great latte s Lavazza Oro is the smoothest most mellow espresso we ve tried It s now our gold standard get it ha by which all other espresso is measured 
Delicious cereal My entire family loves this cereal It is not too sweet like many on the grocery store shelves but has loads of flavor and crunch We will purchase this again 
Quite different it s a presentation I have regular and quite extravagant High Teas This set was given to me as a gift I tried it the first time on a table full of guests and die hard tea party ladies None of us knew what to expect it was wonderful to say the least lots of oohs and ahhs The tea can t remember which was used first was delicate and tasty It was enjoyed by everyone Unfortunately the second time I made tea it was fairly bitter but the presentation was still spectacular and being a good hostess I had the back up teapot of regular tea on the table Nobody complained as everyone enjoyed the show I will purchase more tea 
Spectaular Gift This is a spectacular gift for a relatively small price and will delight anyone who loves tea The pot inside the set is specially made so that you can watch the flowers burst open when the hot water is poured in A very special kind of gift So special that I bought one for myself 
Numi Tea box I loved this gift box of teas It was something different and a unique gift for my husband for valentines day I want to purchase another gift box of flowering teas for my friends birthday in May 
A Delightful Experience The clear glass teapot is adorable The bamboo box is of average construction and it might not take too hard a beating if you decide to put it to some other use but it looks attractive on the counter The flowering teas won t change your life but they taste nice and are interesting to watch My husband and I had great fun watching them unfurl and taking pictures 
Beautiful and tasty too The packaging was great came sealed inside a cardboard box which can easily be gift wrapped Although I was planning to give this one as a gift I felt the need to open it and take a look Shouldn t have done that because I soon knew it had to be mine With my first dinner guests after delivery I boiled water opened the bamboo box removed the glass pot selected the flowering tea from the top of the pile and brought it to the table after pouring the water onto the tea Oh my Godness what a sight I didn t say a word and it was hysterical to see the look of the first person who noticed the flower bloom We agreed that it looked like a monster at first and after laughing amongst ourselves I poured the first pot of tea into three small teacups Yummy Poured a second pot then a third Each was great and each time the visual was so lovely We came to the computer and ordered three more sets I know I ll be ordering more too with extra boxes of the flowering teas Every part of this set was wonderful from the packaging and delivery bamboo boxes little glass teapot and tasty teas It s a real nice value and very presentable gift Amazon s prices can t be beat on these 
Great snack My 3 year old loves these It is nice to see her enjoying something she is allowed to eat since she was diagnosed with Celiac Disease in December I can t keep enough of these in the house 
Great tea neat can The tea is great tasting If that were not enough the empty tins are attractive little storage containers to have on hand 
Best Earl Grey around Twinings is apparently the original Earl Grey tea and it shows why it became so popular Even with so many imitators none can compare to the perfect cup created from Twinings loose leaf Even the bagged variety is better than most other offerings Do yourself a favor and skip out on fancy boutique varieties that never rise above sub par and stock up on the best And forget about other mass market brands such as Taylors or Bigelow they aren t even in the same ballpark 
The Original Earl Grey is my favorite blend of tea by far no competition there The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall British Prime Minister in 1830 1834 by a Chinese manadarin reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil a rather intense tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange the latter is native to South Vietnam and its oil was probably the recipe s original ingredient Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea s natural flavor but with Twinings you just can t go wrong because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend From the Twinings website When the mandarin s tasty gift began to run out Earl Grey asked his tea merchants Twinings to match it for him Twinings unique blend was the Grey family s long standing favourite When guests inquired about it they were directed to Twinings on the Strand where they would ask for Earl Grey s tea by name Unless you insist on having all your tea with cream or milk I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition in my mind it just plain ruins the blend s particular flavor But that s just me of course Whichever way you have it though if scented teas are your kind of thing Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley 
Best popcorn I LOVE this stuff Can t find it in any of the grocery stores around here anymore so finding it on Amazon has been wonderful 
Corn on the Cob Microwave Popcorn This is the best microwave popcorn that I have found It really tastes like you are eating corn on the cob Hard to find in retail stores 
enjoyable If you like corn on the cob and if you like popcorn your gonna LOVE this popcorn It is wonderful and isnt even deadly to a diet 
Not a lot of flavor I love Orville Redenbacher popcorn and decided to try out this new corn on the cobb flavor Its flavor is good but very light and doesn t taste like corn on the cobb to me I usually buy the Ultimate Butter flavor which is much more flavorful and buttery than this one I will probably not buy this flavor again and will stick to the Ultimate Butter flavor 
I LIKE CORN This is like soooooo cool Popcorn and corn on the comb together oh I think I m dreaming I first had this popcorn from a Walmart sample guy and it was so good I was forced to buy a box of it I like Corn I do not like KoRn they are a disgrace to real corn 
yummy I bought these Because Dr Manny FOX NEWS FAN said they were better for you than the other leading bars on the market Boy was he RIGHT these are Good the filling reminds me of a nut filled danish just not as sweet but just as satisfying My husband looked at me funny but he tasted them and takes them to his training as a prework out boost as well as an after dinner snack as I don t but treats but these work for us 
Another Decadent Healthy Treat These are soft chewy lightly nutty and very very good thus far my favorite of the entire Betty Lou line The name makes my family and friends laugh but they get hooked on the taste right away We are so thrilled that Amazon can deliver us great vegan treats at a great price 
Yummy These are SO good though I haven t figured out how to best use them High fat calorie but not the content for a real meal Just good 
Yum Corn Free for resricted diets I bought these because I have a corn allergy and wanted to substitute them for the LA Weightloss bars that list corn syrup as the first ingredient I was pleasantly surprised that they were pretty tasty My favorites are actually the Fudgie Filberts that taste similar to a Little Debbie brownie if Little Debbie s were diet Following that I would say Almond and Coconut are tied for second Third is the Peanut Butter which is the highest in protein but not as good as the others My husband didn t like any of them but could tolerate the one I liked least Peanut Butter Over all I think these are great as a healthy snack for people with food allergies or other dietary restrictions I think I would have picked a different name than Betty Lou s Nut Butter Balls Nut Butter Balls doesn t sound as appetizing as what they actually are Nut Butter Balls Mmmmmm 
a great afternoon snack This is without a doubt my favorite flavor of all of these I m a bit of a novice in the world of veganism and these are one of my favorite ways to get some protien in my system They re soft yet portable and fill you up for quite awhile even though they look small I love these things 
Where s Flex I love the different Nutrisoda drinks but my favorite flavor and the one I need the most is FLEX Please add this to the offerings Get your kids off the sugar fix and introduce them to Nutrisoda 
Great flavor and its good for you If you try this which i highly reccomend you will notice that the soda has a very strong fruity flavor I really thought it had a great taste also I think that it really calms you down I dont know if it is one of the fruit extracts in it or if it is an herb but it works 
the best flavor in the group This is the best flavor in the group my other favourites are Radiant and slender it s a great treat with out the associated guilt of putting on more calories 
Best snack food ever I d never tried this particular trail mix from planters so I just ordered it based on how good it looked in the picture And I must say this is one of the tastiest snacks ever Everything in there the peanuts almonds raisins etc all taste great The only problem is that I can t stop eating them But it least they re quite healthy So it looks like I ll be ordering some more Highly recommended 
healthiest and tastiest snack I ve ever found I love these They re a great source of fiber without having to drink that powdered goo or eating a bushel of broccoli everyday And my kids love them too yes they are that delicious I put these in their lunches and they think it s a treat Amazon is the only way to buy them though so expensive at the grocery stores And don t worry about buying too many they will not go to waste The brown sugar ones taste good but are a little firm and crunchy so I recommend the honey oat definitely the best Enjoy 
The only bars with high bran contents These are the only cerial bars easily available that actually have a worthwhile fiber content Each bar has 5g of Fiber that is 20 of the recomended daily amount This is great for IBS sufferers or those who care about their internal health They taste good like HobNob biscuits you can get in the UK 
The best snack Like all of the other All Bran Cereal Bars these are excellent My personal favorite over the other 2 flavors but all three are divine Again wish Amazon would stock up on more of these because they always run out It might be because of me But again tasty low calorie high in fiber all around good 
Best Jerky This jerky is not just an excellent value it is by far the best jerky we have eaten I buy it every year as Christmas gifts and ofcourse save one pkg for us and everyone raves about it My family always looks forward to Christmas because they know jerky will be there for the holidays Perfect to put in your day pack for a hike or to take with you on vacations camping trips or even to the office for a quick healthy snack Delish You can t beat the price and quality of this jerky You really get a lot I would highly recommend this product and have to several family members as well as friends A+++ Thanks Best secret in the jerky market 
2nd batch was much improved I order several bags of this in the hot and spicy It had a grit texture like it had sand in it I wrote the company and found out that some bags were manufactured with larger grain sugar than they had intended This caused the grit texture They sent me replacement bags and the replacements were wonderful Excellent flavor and texture Give them a second chance 
Dirty name delicious treat Don t let the semi provocative name of this product sway you IT IS YUMMY WITH A CAPITAL YUM This is slowly becoming my 1 TV watching partner LOL You give me a few bags of Pirate s Balls and tell me there s a PASSIONS marathon on and we re gonna party hearty Marty Woo 
A New Staple In My Pantry These cookies were a seasonal offering at a local store I purchased one box After trying them at home I returned to the store and purchased the remaining inventory A simple scoop of vanilla ice cream is transformed by the inclusion of a butter crisp I also love them with tea or straight out of the box Don t be daunted by purchasing a pack of 12 boxes The cost is a little over half of what I paid in the store Lastly unless you hide them in a dark corner of your pantry you ll never have to worry about the shelf life because they will be consumed quickly by family friends and yourself 
Experiencing a Wonderful Taste Journey From where I should start From the amazing taste or the natural ingredients Do you know try it and tell me your opinion 
diabetes heaven This is a very good and hearty product It s easy to take to work or camping Nice consistency It has the diabetic exchange values listed on the package so it s easy to keep track Best of all this taste great 
Very smooth taste Coffee has a very light and smooth taste I would have given it a 4 5 but could not 
Hot Fries are God Basically hot fries are god I have to say that the majority of young people love Hot Fries Those that do not like Hot Fries will find them inedible Some people love hot fries I happen to be one of them It s great having a case of these always having a bag on hand for that omnipresent hot fry hunger I guess there might be some crack thrown in at the factory These are definitely worth a try at this price If you love hot fries or even only eat them occasionally this will save you money and you ll never have to drive to the 7 11 at 10pm anymore 
Best snack food ever This has been my favorite snack food for over 30 years Since I recently moved and hot fries are not sold in my local store I was delighted to see them offered on Amazon This is a low calorie snack with no sugar And it tastes great 
The Greatest Snack Food of All Time The undisputed heavyweight champion of snack food is now available on Amazon for all of us who have moved to areas that do not carry these much treasured golden baked hot fries Andy Capp you are my hero In this person s mind you are the leader among snack food icons I bow down to your greatness and happily purchase your product in delight I love you Andy Capp more than you will ever know 
I just ate through an entire bag These are great I couldn t stop eating and I didn t care because they re so healthy I ll try to keep it down to one bag a day The BBQ flavor is about as authentic as any potato chips I ve ever eaten and these chips are really crunchy too Just make sure you have a napkin and perhaps a dustbuster available when you come up for air 
great taste not to sweet or salty alot of soy crisps are very salty but these aren t and they tase so good I can barely them in the house I can eat all 12 bags in a couple of days but other soy crisps like genisoy BBQ is not as good and can take me forever to eat get these crisps cause they are the BEST SOY CRISPS EVER 
Awesome pick me up I really like these for snacks Peanut butter is so healthy but messy to pack away for mid day The perfect size to be filling but not too large that you will waste any Tastes like peanut butter cookie dough without the work or the raw eggs Enjo 
These are delicious Even my kids love them I do have a hard time keeping them around the house however and the people in the office are always wanting one so I have to keep a hefty supply on hand Thank god they are so reasonably priced on Amazon 
Lifesaver I ve been buying these balls for a couple of years because I ve found they are the best way of anything I ve tried to recover from low blood sugar attacks The protein and complex carbs in them keep me going long enough to get me to my next meal 
Puts the bounce back in your day These snacks are crammed with an array of nutrients including 15 grams of whey protein I have two of these every morning for breakfast along with a cafe latte While high in calories they help refuel me afeter my morning run and sustain me through to lunchtime 
Marinara Sauce Great base sauce just waiting for your own special spices to be added or use as is for milder flavor Would work for any Italian or American dish I will order more 
Gourmet sauce This sauce is simply wonderful It s almost like you were eating at a fancy italian restaurant I reccomend this sauce to any spaghetti lover 
The answer to your Marinara dreams I have tried all the Scarpetta line and this sauce is the cornerstone of their line Excellent for all factes of cooking and should be a staple in your kitchen pantry Simply simmer the sauce and allow the aroma to fill the house like you have been working on it all day No one needs to know the truth 
Good Variety If you have not had Sahale Snacks before this is a good why to try them all If you do however you may be better off getting just those kinds that you like as they are all quite different 
Delicious Healthful Snack My favorite blend so far is the Socorro mix Interesting flavors and quality ingredients Well done 
Killer stuff These snacks are great They are so different from the typical nut snacks out on the market today Well done 
Yummy flavor This irish cream flavor is one of my favorites nice creamy taste without being overwhelming 
Pod Coffee Very quick delivery my sons really enjoy this coffee and the sale price made it all the sweeter 
Senseo Killarney Irish Cream Coffee Pods 4 Pack 64 Single Serve Pods This is a great coffee flavor either plain or with a little Bailey s I m not normally a flavored coffe fan but this is very refreshing 
Best Cereal Ever This is hands down the best cereal I have ever tried and I ve tried a lot I have eaten cereal almost every day of my life You won t find a cereal with more fiber and protein that tastes better than this one It has excellent crunch without the Cap n Crunch effect of shredding your gums It has a mild sweetness to it without being too sugary Add a little fruit to it and you have the perfect breakfast The only problem is that it s hard to find and can cost a little more Even Amazon has run out Make more please 
I l LOVE this cereal When I first tried this cereal I expected it to be like most organic type cereals dry ugly texture awful taste But I was pleasantly surprised and have been eating it ever since The taste and texture are great and it would be difficult to find another cereal that delivers all the vitamins minerals protein fiber calcium low calories etc that still manages to taste great Also it has the blessing of the American Heart Association You just can t go wrong with this product and I will continue to enjoy it 
We love this cereal A friend told me about Optimum Slim She ate it for its high protein content I bought a box and was immediately impressed by the number of nutrients high protein AND high fiber everything I look for in a breakfast to start my day And I love the texture and taste My 17 year old son who like Mikey hates everything tried it and guess what He likes it Hey Mikey We are thankful that our friends at Amazon com are selling this considerably cheaper then we can get it at our local supermarket as we go through a box every other day 
Goes great With Veal or Chicken Marsala My husband and kids cleaned their plates of the Italian Arborio I ve made it several times with veal and chicken and the authentic flavor pairs well Cooked it last night and need to order more I have always been happy with the Fox River Rice quality and flavor 
5 Stars very good deal I had many people try the cookies and they wanted more and to know where I got them Also my students 9 year olds loved them 
Very good I brought a couple packages up to my family and they were gone in a day My niece and nephew loved them too I recommend these chocolate chunk cookies to anyone 
Great I love these cookies They are hard to find at my local grocer Amazon has a great price 
crispy oatmeal cookies I love that these cookies can be dunked in milk and not fall apart they reallly are that good also it seems as if they put a raw sugar on the outside b c you can taste the sugar but yet they are not loaded w sugar haven t tried other flavors yet 
These cookies are the best If you like OREO cookies you will like these even better and they are a heck of a lot better for you no chemicals all natural 
THEY RE FABULOUS The best sandwich cookie you ve ever tasted No trans fat no refined sugars no hydrogenated oils no cholesterol nothing artificial and just the right blend of mint and chocolate It just goes to show you a company can produce something tasty AND healthy You won t be disppointed if you try these 
Pretty Tasty for Sugar Free I have eaten a fair quantity of these over the last few months and they are not bad at all If you are looking for a sweet sugar free snack then they fit the bill I have experienced no digestive issues with these at all unlike some other sugar free sweets 
Good but not sweet enough I have a sweet tooth so while this is sweet I need to use more than when I use honey Though it is sweeter than sugar I will keep buying it because it s a good deal 
Low Glycemic natural sweetener Blue Weber agave is the lowest glycemic index of agave nectar This is 100 blue weber a great flavor and price I use it in tea and baking or just about any where I would use a bit of sugar The texture and flavor is like honey Great stuff 
Tastes Great This tastes great I love it in my coffee and have even used it for pancakes It really doesn t give me a spike in blood sugar as promised The only negative is the packaging they are using During shipping some of the seals underneath the lids came off and the bottles leaked I probably lost about a tablespoon each from 3 of the 6 bottles The lids don t really fit the bottles either They have a pop top but if you use it the syrup sometimes leakes out from under the lid where it attaches to the bottle If they could fix the bottles this would definitely be a five star product 
cereal bowls I was tired of buying so many boxes of cereal a week My teenage son eats it like its going out of style And there are bowls and spoons all over the house I tried this to try and get a variety They actually lasted about a month and it was nice to not have bowls to wash Now if only the spoon were included Also it would be nice to have even more variety but all in all great purchase 
Quick and easy No more half full cereal bowls with soggy cereal The product is the perfect size serving No more stale cereal either Kids love it with a favorite for everyone 
good eating This is great for large families who want variety in the morning or small ones who don t like cereal to go stale before the box is done Good variety too Well worth the money especially with the price of gas 
Rating 8 out of 10 A Good For A Short Snack I enjoyed eating cerial Whether if it is for before school work or just to snack on And what I like about this is that they come in varieties Frosted Flakes Froot Loops Cocoa Puffs etc so I won t be eating the same thing every time which is also good If you re in a rush in the morning and want something to grab and go within a 15 minute period I recommend this to you Also you don t have to waiste your dishes because they come in their own plastic bowls My only problem is that they are so small and after about 10 spoon fulls it s all gone Sometimes I m still hungry after eating one packet and I m skinny too True this contains Trans Fats what breakfast item that kids enjoy eating doesn t contain them Not very many items Maybe eggs and whatnot Also if your kids are somewhat active in somekind of fitness activities those deadly trans fats should be worked off by the end of the day And using fat free milk with the cerial would make the situation better also 
Perfect Morning Tea Caffeinated Numi Tea s Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea is a premium Numi tea both certified organic and kosher The only ingredient is fair trade certified organic high mountain Yunnan Black Tea FOP Flowery Orange Pekoe There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea On the box the manufacturer writes This noble tea is grown in the mist covered mountains of Yunnan province What distinguishes this fine organic black tea is its perfect sense of balance exquisite tiger s eye color and a lean vibrancy which makes it suitable at any time of day Like a complex wine it is the perfect tea for food marrying well with a wide variety of dishes It has a distant and hard to place floral quality yet it leaves the mouth tasting as clean as spring water And it energizes the body and mind more harmoniously than the best of coffees We are proud to bring you this high grade leaf Although this tea says orange pekoe it does not taste citrus y but has a strong morning black tea taste with flowery overtones It is like a regular orange pekoe upgraded many many times with something delicate lovely and flowery added It s the perfect morning tea or for anytime you want a high quality pick me up The price is super a big savings over single boxes If you like Numi teas get it you won t be sorry If you are new to Numi but love regular black this will probably be the best you ve ever had and you ll wonder why you ever drank the old stuff 
Warning for chicks Great tea good taste and its well beyond soothing for bedtime but please be warned that it does contain st john s wart which is an herb that can reduce the effectiveness of your hormonal birth control pill Check the warnings on you pill mine warns against taking st johns wart 
Best Bedtime tea around Have tried all the other bedtime teas at the health food store and this is the best And the price here is great too about 40 less than in stores 
Delicious full bodied complex I use this espresso as regular coffee for a drip machine It is loaded with flavor full rich flavors and no bitterness I have purchased it twice first the five pound bag then 4 one pound bags I think the individual bags are not only a better value but they can stay very fresh until you need them I had no trouble with the 5 pound though it was a delicious on the first day as the last I highly recommend this coffee 
LOVE IT Seeing as to how I m a chocaholic I thoroughly enjoy getting my morning fix with my cereal As a kid I d break Hershey s Chocolate into chunks and drop them in my Frosted Flakes had I only thought then to patent that idea as Kellogg s has done I d be rakin in all the dough D 
Pretty Good I thought this was actually pretty good The chocolate pieces added just enough chocolate taste to enjoy I did not have any issues with waxy taste This is not baking choclate that melts in your hand so don t expect it to be It has to hold up in the milk as well as on the shelf I will definitely purchase again 
K cup Review Love Timothy s coffee Best price and speedy delivery I m a return customer and will be again 
Great Price Great Coffee Purchased it and a Keurig coffee machine for my husbands Grandmother she can use the coffee machine without the threat of spilling from a coffee pot She is sooo happy This is the flavor she liked best from a variety pack and I was able to buy this from home and ship it to her in Wisconsin Perfect for an older person who may not be as steady and I can keep her in coffee for months with Amazon and their 2 pack of K cups at such a great price and free shipping Thank you for helping me help Grandma 
THE BEST THIS COFFEE IS NOT ONLY CONVENIENT TO USE BUT THE THE FLAVOR IS ALSO EXCELLENT 
Best coffee ever I purchased a Keurig 60 coffee maker and a sample of Timothy s was included I had never heard of this brand To my surprise it was so delicious and inexpensive I now purchase only this brand from Amazon Timothy s is my favorite coffee 
Fluffy White Rice In 60 Seconds My family tends to eat in shifts and we eat a lot of rice If I cook a pot of rice it takes 30 minutes and is cold and sticky by the time my family gets to it Now my boys can have their rice when they want it Viva La Rice works great for lunch too We really like this product 
Bargain filters I cut my filter costs in half compared to my Brooklyn neighborhood sources At roughly 3 5� a brewing this is a great deal 
Great oils This is an awfully nice gift pack if you want to take the oils out of the box The cardboard box with the story of the oils manufacturer came with a big florescent pink label screaming NOT INTENDED FOR INDIVIDUAL SALE Sell only on Amazon or something of the sort directly over the text explaining the oils I was disappointed as people like to read about where gourmet gifts come from and I had planned on wrapping them in the box Other than that the tins cans are very attractive and unique My parents were VERY happy with them 
Best Pop Tart Ever My all time favorite flavor of Pop Tart but no stores in my area have it Thank you Amazon 
LOVE THE CHOCOLATE AND VANILLA TOGETHER I wish I could find these locally they are the best combination of the chocolate crispy pop tart crust and sweet vanilla creme 
Great variety With 5 kids it s not easy to please all of them at the same time This variety box has all the right flavors They are crisp and fresh and come in flavors my kids like Good deal with the 10 off coupon 
Delicious and easy I enjoyed McCann s sugar free instant oatmeal The texture is much better than some other instant oatmeals that remind me of pulverized cardboard The maple brown sugar flavor has a deep maple flavor The sweetness tastes natural not artificial I love that each packet only contains 100 calories yet is very satisfying 
Nature s Path Heritage Flakes Cereal My all time favorite cereal Superior taste Attractive appearance Flakes hold their crunchiness even when sitting in milk for longer than average time Especially like the mix of grains used 
Excellent cereal Great source of fiber toasty flavor not soggy in milk Love the flavor Doesn t need sugar added to taste good A winner in our household 
Healthy alternative Product is dry roasted no added fats Decent quality and a good source of fiber protein and iron which makes me happy using it as a snack for my daughter Will buy again 
Japan Italy and Florida These great breadcrumbs were hard to find in the Tampa area so the order was a house warming gift for my sister a great Italian cook The best thing was that I hand delivered them and was fed well I am sure we will order again any excuse to leave NY and go to F 
Betty Crocker Specialty Potatoes Casserole Au Gratin These are really good fresh made or leftovers I buy them often They take 20 minutes though whether you use the microwave or not Worth the time 
Delicious low cal treat Baxters soups are usually very nice but the lobster bisque is especially good It tastes authentic it has a good flavour is creamy and has just enough lobster bits to make it interesting Add some fresh black pepper and a dash of brandy or sherry and it rivals soup served in a very good restaurant It s also surprisingly low calorie Though the nutrition info here says 130 calories for 8oz the label actually says 120 calories so even if you ate the whole can for lunch you would consume only about 220 calories 
Wonderful The Lobster Bisque is absolutely delicious Nice lobster flavor I cannot imagine what you could possibly add to improve the taste of this soup Just open heat and enjoy I ve become such a fan of the Baxter s line that I can t wait to try them all 
Smart Money packs in the flavor Smart Monkey is my favorite brand of raw food bars and the Carob Brownie are the best They have so much flavor compared to the brands you find in the grocery store Well done to whomever came up with the recipe you ARE a smart monkey 
fresh and tasty the carob is great all of their products are fresh and tast 
Amazon must have been nutty I too purchased these on a Friday sale six bags for 6 99 Considering the current price Amazon must have either mispriced them or been out of their minds If they ever go back on for that price don t hesitate They are completely fresh and perfect for cooking or just eating right out of the bag Oh I forgot to mention they are terrific on top of a banana split 
Super product Fantastic Price I grabbed these up on a Friday sale six bags for 6 99 What a bargain Great for salads cooking baking and toasting for snacks Delighted here 
Great in Salads These slivered almonds are an excellent addition to salads I m sure they are good for lots of other things baking stir fry but they definitely make plain salads seem a lot more gourmet And they re the perfect size shape cut for this purpose The shelf life is also great Especially if you store them in the freezer or fridge you should be good for more than 6 months A bit pricey retail but you can t beat the Amazon 6 pack discounted price I m stocking up 
The Spitfire of Mustards I ve been using Colman s mustard ever since I spent a month in Ireland and the UK on business The food was basically inedible even the steaks until I started slathering on the Colman s Makes all the difference the mustard has a horseradish type kick thats addicting I ve stopped asking for Colman s at US restaurants they think I m weird but I definitely keep a supply at home Its great on all meats and poultry even vegetables There s not many foods I won t put it on Thank you Britain for this major contribution to the culinary arts 
Quaker Breakfast bars The Quaker breakfast bars are pretty good for breakfast bars They are pretty small though 
It took me awhile to realize it s not an energy drink I bought a multipack of all the Nutrisodas from beveragesdirect and i thought for the longest time that all the nutrisodas had energy stuff in it in fact only the energy nutrisoda was energetic I can t say much about how good this was for my joints but this is my favorite flavor out of the bunch and i ve had the chance to sample all the nutrisoda flavors it s like a sparkling apple drink with a midtone of cherry and anyone can make good use of the ingredients they added for joints in this stress filled world 
Excellent first food While typical fruit roll ups tend to be hard and chewy these are soft and break apart easily for my 15 month old to eat He loves them and they are much healthier than grocery store brands 
Very pleased Unlike the other reviewers I do not like fruit rollups or leathery fruit bars of any kind These bars are soft and chewy and very satisfying They are a great snack to keep handy I would highly recommend especially if you are a person who doesn t usually like the other types of fruit leathers sticks rollups etc 
Great price great taste Wow we ve never had so much Macaroni and Cheese in a long time And Annie s is really really good This doesn t need additional milk or butter and the sauce is an easy to squeeze out paste in a foil package It tastes great and makes a great receptacle for some creativity of your own too Tips to enjoy it Just boil in plenty of water the six cup requirement is a minimum Drain quickly put the pasta back in the hot pot The remaining heat is just right to melt the thick cheesy sauce into the macaroni Don t rinse the pasta in cold water it will make it hard for the sauce to combine well All the Deluxe versions are animal rennet free Annie s FAQ is very specific about which ones use vegetable rennet not all do but Amazon isn t picking up the information I tag the really vegetarian ones animal rennet free whenever I can Try blending sundried tomatoes a fresh tomato olive oil garlic pizza peppers salt freshly ground pepper and a touch of balsamic vinegar into a paste This really complements the mac and cheese and gives it a new gourmet taste that still doesn t take away from the mac and cheesiness of it Tabasco Chipotle sauce makes a great addition for the adventurous The smoky taste is tempered by the creaminess 
you ll never eat kraft again Our family all agrees this is much better than kraft s mac cheese Much stronger cheese taste Not the most healthful food on the planet but quick easy tasty 
Yummy This makes a great lunch for taking to the office Just water and microwave and it s actually pretty tasty 
The kids love em My kids love these I feel great giving them these for a snack too Healthy natural and yummy 
Better than fruit leather Great product and our 2 year old daughter enjoys the chewier texture of these snacks over fruit leathe 
strawberry flavor is the best taste great no added suger has fiber what else could you ask for in a healty snack 
Good snack These have great flavor and texture They are not too sticky like some other dried fruit snacks My only complaint is the wrapper It is a pain to remove 
We love these I just got a case of these my 2 year old and I had just introduced ourselves to fruit leathers which we love I figured I d look this up as it s considerably less expensive per bar than buying an 8 pack at the store My daughter absolutely loves these and so do I We re planning on bringing them as treats when we go across the street and play with the kids who stay with one of my neighbors My daughter even told me that they re now her favorite treat And I feel fine knowing she s getting something that s really tasty and sweet but that it s not gonna kill her with too much sugar and corn syrup 
Perfect snack for kids These are the perfect snack for on the go Actual REAL fruit No sugar No roll ups with 10 fruit They are not dry or leathery and even little kids can chew them well Just the right size for toddlers and small kids and Moms too Great to stick in the diaper bag or purse for an impromptu healthy snack Works in any weather won t melt and even survives at the bottom of the purse Comes in lots of flavors an organic version and bigger bars too for a bigger snack Cheaper than lesser products at the grocery store GREAT 
Twinings still kicking it The flavor was light but the tannin a bit stronger I had to add a tad more cream 
Great Tea Great flavor easy to dispense and a nice metal canister I m not a big connoisseur of teas but the fact that it was green tea helped me decide to try it And for the nice price I m glad I did Will be nice to give a canister away here and there to friends and family 
Present This was a present for my grandmother who loves this tea She was so pleased to get it I am glad that I bought it and had it sent to her 
best broth ever I LOVE this product It is reasonably priced when one considers each packet can be reconstituted to equal one cup of broth The broth is organic with a rich flavor of chicken I also use the beef broth it is delicious as well but my favorite feature is one may store the equivalent of 6 cans of broth in less space than one can takes up A definite 5 stars from me Savory Choice broth concentrates are the best 
Space saving Quality Great product when you need just a little extra stock broth It won t replace my use of Swanson s because it would be too much to open 8 packages for 2 quarts of stock for soup etc but it is great for making pilaf etc or when you re just a little short of the quantity needed 
Just like Grandma would make VERY good broth I took a pouch for my mom to try and she couldn t get over how much it tasted like how her mom s chicken soup broth I bought this without tasting it first and am very pleased 
Amazingly good This is the best chicken stock you ll ever find without going to the trouble of making it yourself Could not recommend it any higher 
BEST CHICKEN BROTH EVER This is the best broth I have ever tasted It s as good as homemade and a lot easier to make I can t wait to try the the beef broth 
great quick snack a little dry but given that they re pretty healthy all things considered i m willing to forgive 
much better than expected These are very tasty indeed The flavors taste natural and fresh better than I expected and the texture is very good My young son has a real sweet tooth and these are a great treat for him In fact my whole family enjoys them My husband about died when he saw I ordered a case of Pop Tarts but he was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the more healthful ingredients I will definitely keep these on my shopping list and recommend them to anyone especially families with children who want a quick and tasty snack that s a little more fun than a piece of toast and more wholesome than a donut or most cookies 
THE ONLY THING MY 3 YEAR OLD WILL EAT FOR BREAKFAST Yes these Toaster Pastries from Nature s Path are the only thing my 3 year old will eat for her breakfast Thanksfully they are fairly healthy Now her 2 older brothers are making it a staple for their breakfast also They are very tasty and toast well in the toaster The frosted strawberry and blueberry ones are equally as good just depends on your taste preference We have not tried any of the UNfrosted ones though 
sweet sweet cookies They came in a pretty tin in perfect shape with none broken They have a pleasant crunch and a lovely buttery taste and texture The French know how to do it right 
Very Good I hadn t been able to find these cookies and I was so happy to see them on Amazon These cookies are so good great with hot tea and coffee They re nothing like those horrible butter cookies you find in the supermarkets and drugstores 
Great bran cereal Bran Buds is definitely one of the better bran cereals around It actually tastes good OK it isn t a cinnamon roll but it s still pretty good It stays crunchy in milk but is not so hard that you wonder if your teeth will be damaged I like combining bran buds and a flake cereal Bran Buds has been at my breakfast table for years 
That old staple Bran Buds Good cereal if you like something other than flakes It doesn t get mushy like them However this product doesn t provide the minimum vitamin content some other breakfast cereals do an important consideration when one considers how vitamin deprived many of us are and carbohydrate stuffed 
Good stuff I like the way this tastes but it s not fantastic it fills you up fiber expands and keeps you regular Honestly 2 3 a cup and your set for breakfast i don t know what s wrong with the last guy who posted I m pretty sure he s some dude who thought it would be funny to write a post about some old guy s unfortunate run in with bran Nothing goes through you that fast Bran is not a laxative Its bulk forming fiber I wouldn t really care except that this is a good product 
better than expected I took a chance buying 6 boxes of this cereal and I was rewarded It is flavorful crispy and reasonably proced The only problem is that one of my six boxes had a hole in the bag I discovered tis because the cereal leaked our through the cracks in the box Still a decent value with the lost box 
A Modern Musli Grain Cereal with a Hearty Crunch My local Whole Foods sells Nature s Path products for 3 79 a box so this Amazon com price is an excellent deal The cereal is hearty and crunchy although it becomes soft in a few short minutes when submerged in milk I sometimes add a little sweetner as sugar is not added artificially My housemate who grew up in France Italy loves this cereal as he says it reminds him of his European grainy musli style cereals However I am not a big fan of what is sold as Musli or Muslix in this country and Heritage Bites are nothing like this Think Chex style bites and crunch without the Chex fake crunch slimy coating preservatives and sugars 
Better Than The Nutrition Label Indicates Upon arrival I read the nutrition info myself on the cereal box and was pleasantly surprised to find they were better than Amazon s listing They have 6 grams of fiber balanced soluble and insoluble fiber in a 1 ounce 28 gram=3 4 cup serving and only 5 grams of sugars all for only 100 calories All this isn t worth much though if they don t taste good right Well they are good very yummy even out of the box They are rather like Life cereal regular flavor just a bit less stripped of the good stuff in taste The whole grains really shine through and they tend to stay crispy in milk much longer I enjoyed a bowl of them topped with just a fine bit of honey so that the flax seeds I topped them with would stick and not sink to the bottom a bowl plain with milk and also a bowl made into a Muddy Buddies healthy version I bought these initially to make the recipe Muddy Buddies Puppy Chow recipe healthier using alternatively sweetened chocolate freshly ground almond or peanut butters and some date sugar to toss in after coating These would also be a great alternative choice for other Chex cereal recipes I like them so much I will give up my usual choices in cereal that provide the same or less amount of fiber for TWICE the calories and that also soak up too much milk in the bowl Give these a try they won t replace some of the worst offending sugar laden kid s cereals with no one noticing but these are really a good choice and tasty and are always handy for those chex mix recipes with a healthier spin If a sugar addict really needs more sweetening just let them top these with a better choice in sweetener of your own choice not a giant company s choice in what makes them the most profit Best of all we can have something affordable we like the taste of without supporting these huge companies that are ruining our health and economy as well as putting the family farmers out of business I can t think of any reasons why I wouldn t recommend these 
A great idea I love these Crystal Light on The Go packets I have to travel about 20 40 miles to do my shopping so I like to have a beverage with me on my trip home These really come in handy when a store has nothing cold that I like I hate water It has no taste These packets come in when a store has no good soda The only problem with these packets is that sometimes the powder doesn t dissolve completely in the bottld water you use A lot of times a big clump of powder mix forms at the bottom of the bottle and you have to find a way to stir it to make it dissolv 
Greatest Cookies EVER They are crisp buttery yet light Unlike some other cookies they even taste great when they are broken into smaller pieces as shipping by Belgium is liable to do sometimes The only downside is they are addicting there are about 24 wafers per box and before you know it s time to order another 12 pack Yes it seems like a lot but if you need to remove temptation these make great gifts As you can see the boxes are classy and in most gourmet stores EACH box can sell for nearly 6 so you will also seem a genuine benefactor The only thing wrong with these cookies is that Amazon makes it too easy to obtain 
Love this Coffee I bought this coffee for work as we were bored with our current selection and it was a massive hit It has nice rich flavour with no nasty after taste 
YUM I love smoked oysters and this brand is the best I have ever eaten Packed in cottonseed oil they have a dark rich taste yet not oily Great with a good snack cracker great for camping which is what I use them for 
that s a lot of oysters The Crown Prince brand has been one of my favorites I like their oysters not just for the price at the local grocery store but as well as for the flavor Though here at Amazon buying a pack of 24 oysters at once might be a bit extreme 
Yum These are the best dried cherries you will ever eat Not only do they come from the best cherry region in the country they are by far the yummiest I have ever tried They are a great value for the money too Don t hesitate to order some today 
Delicious Dried Fruit Tart Cherries Love them So Good These are very very good I love these for a snack and they take care of a sweet craving too Not too awful sugary sweet just sweet and tart enough I tried a handful in my oatmeal with some vanilla creamer this mornining for a treat and it was so good with those sweet tart cherries They are great to snack on and add to muffins and in baking A great buy in bulk compared to what I find in our local supermarkets which are very pricey These are nice sized and fresh too They would be great in trail mix My husband likes them as a snack in his lunch too Thumbs up 
great product Great product what else can I say While I lived in the caribbean I ordered food since it was too expensive to buy good quality food there 
High Praise Wow Just in time for the holidays Now I can brine or bbq my turkey methods that leave me with little or no usable pan juices and still make a great gravy And a turkey base instead of chicken for my leftover soup too What a concept This is a super simple product to use Little storage space and little waste but big on flavor I keep some of each flavor in my RV It would be great for any camping style especially backpacking 
Yummy and still good for you My husband and I both love this My children who eat only whole grain type foods normally don t like it I am not sure why but they still prefer oatmeal type hot cereals It is great with a little splenda or to really bring it up a notch I will lightly thaw 1 C of frozen berries and add that with a little splenda YUM 
From a person with a very limited diet I agree with everything that the previous reviewer wrote in their review I gave the cookies a rating of 5 stars though because i havent eaten a cookie in about 4 years without getting sick This is because I have severe allergies to wheat and soy Pretty much every cookie you will find in a normal grocery store will have one if not both of these ingrediants So when I found Nana s cookies I was as happy as can be Yes the texture is different than a wheat cookie but it s better than going without cookies It also doesnt hurt that these cookies are delicious If you are like me and have a very limited diet these cookies are a very welcome addition to that diet 
A little blend Frankly I think the chicken flavor is a bit bland The noodle texture is good and rather filling Probably the traditional ramen flavor taste better But with the price offered and the free shipping it is a great buy and fantastic delivery service 
Heritage Flakes This product has the benefits of organic whole grains and environmentally responsible packaging but it s also my favorite cereal flavorful and super crunchy even if left in milk for a while 
Starting the Day Right This cereal gives you a great start in the morning and is delicious It is good and good for you 
Great Nutrition A wonderful product without all the sugar and low on the glicemic index 
Healthy tasting These bars are fairly good to be healthy yet they lack the flavor and texture of many other granola or fruit breakfast bars To me they taste like the equivalent of whole grain rice crispy treats if there were such things with added cranberries and some ginger The combination of the cranberries and ginger do aid in the flavor but the bars are stickier than I had expected All things considered though they seem to be a healthy alternative to more caloric bars 
amazon over charging big time while I have rated the item with 5 stars because of the product itself not the sale from Amazon I was on line trying to find this product in bulk Amazon sells this product 12 jars for 30 90 which abmounts to 2 575 per jar It is soooo much cheaper to buy this in a grocery store Thus I don t recommend purchasing it thru Amazo 
What a wonderful peanut butter It has great consistency creaminess and doesn t separate This is a definite new favorite 
Outstanding ignore the misguided reviews This is the best Peanut Butter product ever produced by major American food service company If you re expecting peanuts and salt with separated oil and a rock hard refrigerated consistency after opening this is not that product If however you dislike most of those products which are more annoying to eat than many people find to be worthwhile this is what you ve been waiting for It uses a natural tropical oil which has a naturally long shelf life as opposed to the disastrously unhealthy alternative of hydrogenated oils Many people panic over seeing saturated but that is exactly the sort of grossly uninformative evaluation that led us to using the far more deadly hydrogenated oils to begin with advice which is frankly unforgivable Learn about fats for yourself and make the right decisions I recommend Know your fats available right here on Amazon If you want the most healthy peanut butter you can get grind your own and eat it fresh and congratulate yourself for fantastic self discipline and patience For the rest of us we need more products like this Finally a grown up version of an American food product 
MUCH better than the original Skippy We love to have peanut butter on toast for breakfast but my husband would not eat anything but Skippy no matter how I pleaded He does not like natural peanut butter at all When I found this in the store I was so happy and he loves it I do too it tastes great like Skippy but without all the crap of the original Highly recommended 
Like these bars cant tell are gluten free except taste wholesome Cranberry center isnt dyed but looks like real berries which is appreciated these days everything is crayola colored I like these even better than the apple ones which seem to be sweeter Blueberry and apple are both also good though Great to tuck into your purse because they are sturdy enough they wont crumble into nothing when you cart them around 
Tasty Treat The Glutino brand excells in taste with no strange aftertaste This bar was very good although I hoped for less filling and more crust as the filling was too sweet for my taste I was looking for a bar that wasn t too sweet so the cranberry flavor sounded promising While it is not as sweet as other flavors it is still rather sweet Still highly recommend this flavor and this brand 
Twinings Lady Grey 300th anniversary tea Twinings developed this tea last year 2006 for their 300th anniversary a counterpart to their famous Earl Grey product Lady Grey has the distinctive Earl Grey flavor but with just a hint of floral It has become my family s favorite tea We can no longer get it in our stores but is easily available on line from Twinings Buy it maybe we ll get it back in our stores A wonderful product 
King or is it Queen of Teas The first thing you notice when you open a tin of Twinings Lady Grey beside the redolence of bergamot oil mixed with the aroma of black tea and lemon which is a staple of the Earl Grey Teas is the striking visual pattern of the loose tea Dark dry tea leaves sprinkled with bright dots of dry orange peel and stunningly blue cornflower petals It is almost as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds Milder and less caffeinated than the Earl this mix has become a permanent inhabitant of our pantry and our tea cups for almost 5 years now Note that unlike Earl Grey Lady Grey seems to be a Trademark of the Twinings Co If you are looking for a similar tea that is not manufactured by Twinings you may have a hard time figuring what is the exact equivalent For example some other companies market a blend called Pouchkine or Afternoon Earl Grey which essentially are milder versions of the traditional Earl Grey and lack some proprietary Twinings only ingredients most notably the cornflowers 
Tea Drinker Delighted The price was excellent and the tea arrived quickly This is where I will be buying my tea in the future 
mmmm kava this particular brand has a combination of herbs that make for a sweet and spicy tea i love kava and the relaxing effects i feel i am ordering more now 
Knock out punch It has a strong flavor and its a little different but if you want something to relax you for the evening and put you over the edge this is it I have sent it to friends and family and can tell you most were impressed I gave some to my 21 year old daughter who has issues and she said it lulled her to sleep so much so she recommended it to a friend 
Excellent Tea My whole family loves this tea We have never tried a tea with so many good effects It relaxes you and makes you sleepy Love it 
Kava Stress Relief Tea Awesome blend of spices that is natually sweet It envelops you like a warm calming hugg The best way to deal with the chaos of everyday living 
Soothing and sensual great decaf pick me up I have trouble finding this particular tea in non health food stores This tea is caffeine free so it s ideal for unwinding at the end of the day or for a quiet escape during a stressful work day The tea has a strong aroma and flavor a little bit spicy so not for everyone but I find the scent irresistable and calming on its own The flavor is a touch of sweet a touch of tingle on the tongue And as a bonus each tea bag label has an inspirational saying on it Even if you find the quotations silly they re at least good for a giggle 
The Whole Box I ve been eating this cereal for years Aside from being nutritious it is also delicious It s hard to believe that something that tastes so good could actually be good for you Usually it s the other way around if it s good for you it tastes like crap This sure bucks that system It s great with milk for breakfast as usual and instead of eating something unhealthy for a snack have a bowl of this cereal If you eat it strait out of the box be careful and pay attention you could eat the whole box and not realize it until you stick your hand in and it s empty uh oh It s really yummy So go ahead enjoy it Oh yea Amazon has the best price too 
Almost Perfect We jokingly call this cereal bugs twigs and leaves in our house However we do so with affection The only complaint we have is that this cereal is a bit on the sweet side Okay it s very sweet We find that is its only fault though Having been born and raised on cold cereal I can honestly say that this is the best I ve ever had Hubby concurs and eats it for breakfast and dessert LOL We used to get it at Sam s Club but it was discontinued quite a while back So very happy to find it here at Amazon 
The best cereal ever First I want to mention that I never write reviews online I probably should but I just never have the motivation to do so Well this cereal is so awesome I just have to review it I ll shortly explain on a few topics to help you understand its greatness Taste It tastes wonderful My thoughts during the very first 2 seconds of my very first bite was Oh man not another cardboard tasting cereal It was just then that the lightly sugary cinnimony taste hit my tongue How delightful Texture Its crunchy just like I like it but not too crunchy Its not just flakes like alot of cereals it contains 4 5 different types of crunchiness Effect This is where the cereal sold me Taste and texture are wonderful yes yet the way it makes me feel is out of this world I ll pour a bowl of this stuff with my favorite soy silk enhanced milk scarf it down in hungry and sluggishness and about 30 min 1 hour later I m pumped Yes this cereal will literally infuse you with bursting energy And not just a burst like caffeine no this energy lasts for hours I ve had the energy from this last for at least 5 hours each time Overall Even if the price is a tad pricey over the regular brands of cereal out there I love the taste texture and effects so much that I dont mind the price And now that Amazon is selling it cheaper in bulk the price drops from about 4usd a box to about 3usd a box 25 off yes Bookmark this page and go try this at your local grocery store first I m sure you ll be back to this site to buy in bulk too 
Incredible This cereal is my absolute favorite Very high in fiber low in calories but tastes absolutely scrumptious too What more could you ask for 
Great product In my opinion absolutely one of the best tasting highest fiber cereals on the market today Plus it s all natural Bought it from Costco as a special limited item which disappeared fast so glad Amazon finally added it to their product line 
It made for a better Holiday season I bought the flour to make cookies for my granddaughter for the holidays It s been a long time since she had homemade cookies as I had a hard time finding a wheatfree flour that didn t need other ingredients added to it to make it work like all purpose flour I could not tell the difference between the cookies I made with Organ flour and the ones made with all purpose flour I look forward to making other recipes for her using this flour 
I am so excited about this product I bought this product after seeing it on Amazon I have tried it in two recipes It substitutes just like flour I made the best banana nut bread with it It is awesome to be able to use a regular recipe without any special instructions and come up with something so good to eat but gluten free No need to feel deprived I am anxious to try it in some other recipes 
Good for Big Appetites My kids really go through cereal It was good to buy extra boxes ahead 
Intense Ginger Experience and Digestive Aid This Organic Ginger Tea from Yogi Tea is ideal as a digestive aid and it also purportedly enhances circulation It s a lovely intense all natural herbal tea made from organic ginger root organic lemon grass orgnaic licorice root organic peppermint leaf and organic black pepper The taste is exactly like ginger spicy and peppery with sweet overtones It s very nice anytime but especially after a meal Note that this review is for the six pack of Organic Ginger Teas an amazing savings on Amazon by buying in bulk I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general Ginger Organic Tea comes with an expiration date a good thing because it s not full of preservatives plus you can tell if it is fresh Yogi Tea seems to be another company like Numi Aspen Traditional Medicinals that values sustainable and healthy practices Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed with info about each tea they make Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea s benefits Our 100 Organic Ginger tea has something to offer to anyone who wants to get or stay healthy For millennia herbalists from all over the world have known of the healing soothing and energizing qualities of this root considered the universal medicine Organic Ginger Zingiber officinale has been used worldwide as a safe and mild home remedy for a variety of conditions including motion sickness occasional upset stomach and intestinal gas as well as minor menstrual cramps Ayurvedic practitioners have used Ginger for years as a way of activating the body s fire element Agni which burns up Ama the body s toxins comprised of both undigested food and naturally occurring toxins When Ama is decreased the body gains strength balance and harmony As a natural warming energizer Ginger is also known to support the immune system promote rapid and complete digestion and increase intestinal tone and peristalsis Furthermore it works as an antioxidant and has been shown to safely and effectively relieve nausea associated with motion Our 100 Organic Ginger tea tastes delicious and provides the highest quality of a timeless remedy There is a warning on the box that if you have indigestion or heartburn that persists you should see a doctor There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease Highly recommended 
Nice addition I use this as an additive to green tea or oolong It s a soothing addition that takes it up a notch 
The best gluten free bread I ve found When my mother in law purchased light rice bread I expected it to be even worse than the regular rice bread we had been tolerating However I was in for a pleasent surprise This bread is much lighter than the very dense rice bread made by EnerG It still tastes better toasted but my 4 year old will eat it straight out of the bag too I am enjoying it as well and so much easier to use than my previously preferred brand which had to be pulled apart with a knife after storing in the freezer I have used to make rice crumbs for meatloaf as sandwiches as garlic toast as regular toast and am hoping to try french toast soon the first bread even worth attempting that one with 
For a gluten free bread This was a keeper The best I have found so far Light and airy Can make peanut butter jelly sandwiches doesn t NEED to be toasted like the others Makes a mean french toast My daughter who is pretty picky eats this bread a lot 
So good I ll actually spend a minute to give it 5 stars I ve never reviewed a food item before but this delectable little bar was so heavenly I had to change my mind At the time it was a mere snack in between classes afterwards it earned a place in my heart as well as my eternal devotion Toffee AND almonds + chocolate sigh What more could one ask for 
BEST Protein Fiber Bar ever OK I eat a lot of protein fiber bars and most taste like cardboard or something worse This bar is the best I eat it for breakfast lunch or as dessert after dinner The texture reminds me of a chewy rice crispy treat seriously Love it 
Go Kashi I am one hardly to ever leave product reviews and as much as I buy online I should work on that But after trying the various Kashi products these bars are by far the best and I feel the need to leave a review I started off eating the Kashi Honey Almond Flax granola bars which are very good but definitley not as sweet as these not a good OR bad thing just a comparison However you will still get the protein fiber and omega 3s if that s what you re looking for If you love chocolate and almonds and are looking for a protein fiber bar that tastes good and is more on the sweet side this is definitely one to try Whether you use them as a meal replacement or as a snack they are absolutley amazing and I will definitely be a repeat customer 
Nana s No Wheat No Refined Sugar Chocolate Chip Cookie Tastes good Fruit juice sweetened Excellent ingredients 
Great Chocolate Chip Cookies These cookies are great for people who can t have wheat or sugar They taste like real chocolate chip cookies I have been looking for a substitute and these are the ones 
oh my goodness well whats to say they are the best no wheat no suger no dairy cookies i have ever had in fact they could hold there own against a regular fat suger filled cookie 
Very good product I gave these cookies five stars because I m someone that loves whole foods and the richness that affords They have no wheat and harmful sugar in them I think they taste great I don t need or want something with 8 tablespoons of sugar to taste good 
Love these cookies I love these cookies Talk about getting to eat guilt free I gave these cookies four stars because someone used to sugar and processed foods could not appreciate these cookies as much as someone that loves whole foods and the richness that affords I can t wait to try some of Nana s other cookies If you are used to a whole food diet you will give these cookies five stars 
Organic Cheerios I bought this just to test them out As others have stated they are super crunchy I like to put a little honey on mine to sweeten them up but plain is just fine too 
Review of Nature s Path Organic Heritage O s cereal I ve loved this cereal for many years They are like Cheerios but stay crunchie in milk I used to buy it at Whole Foods but they quit selling it in these Eco Pacs I start every morning with a bowl of this cereal and fruit My two dogs also get some of this cereal every morning It helps keep us healthy since it is full of fiber 
Crunchy is a good thing This cereal is super crunchy but it sure beats soggy soup which is what most cereals turn into after a couple of minutes in milk It also makes a great pick me up dry snack when you re craving something crunchy but don t want all the calories and sodium of most chips crackers pretzels The flavor is mild kind of along the lines of cheerios but better in my opinion since I go through a 2lb bag of Heritage O s a week Whole grain organic low sodium breaks all stay crunchy records what else could you ask for in an O s cereal One word of caution though This cereal may cause those close by to complain of the crunching noise you emit while eating it 
Amazing Protein Powder I was so happy to find this product as I use Protein powder in many things that I bake and cook I feel it is important to have plenty of protein in ones diet that does not include fats It is helping my fingernails to grow and harden which is something I have been fighting Lett 
Great Snack These shortbread cookies are the best You get quite a few in one pack and they are very tasty I bought the oreo ones too and they are very good 
best cookies ever I LOVE the 100 calorie packs My favorites are the Sunchips the Teddy Grahams and now the LD shortbreads In my town it s hard to get any of the popular 100 calorie packs like the Cheetos Sunchips or Hostess carrot cakes because they always sell out But the Teddy Grahams and Lorna Doone shortbreads never seem to sell here so I always have plenty I try to limit myself to one pouch a day but somedays I might have 2 because they are so good 
I am so glad to find these here These are not in stores around my area for very long before they are gone I will order from Amazon because they are really good for a 100 calorie snack 
A Bit too Sweet for me I loved the blueberries and raspberries but not the cherries I thought the fruit all types were a bit too sweet They added a lot of sugar to it Otherwise it is a healty snack 
New to blueberry flavored tea and really enjoying it We tryed both the raspberry and blueberry and for me it s no comparison the blueberry rules I m struggling with drinking less soda and increasing the tea After I cold brewed a glass added some sweetener a few cubes I fell in LOVE Glad I ordered enough to get a start on spring summer and grilling If you like berry flavored beverages give the ice Cool Brew Tea Blueberry a try 
Berry Good Fabulous tea This makes a great presentation with frozen blueberries floating in it It has become my favorite organic tea 
Nonni s Toffee Almond Lemon Biscottis great product unfortunately shipping took a toll on the biscotti s majority arrived in crumbs broken pieces Have since ordered an additional 8 boxes The lemon ones were shipped in a second Amazon box which seemed to provide some additional protective as only a few were broken in some of the boxes Would recommend seller in the future ship all 12 pack boxes in a second box and add extra cushioning protection It would allow folks to dunk their biscotti s rather than have to eat direct from the wrapper and get crumbs everywhere 
great i loved it that it came on time and my kids love it i would buy it agai 
love these bars I have been eating NuGo bars for almost a year now all the flavors are wonderful and they really curb your appetite and fill you up I eat them wiht a salad for lunch healthy way to maintain weight without feeling deprived 
Yummy flavor and great texture I really like Nu GO bars flavors I like best are banana orang 
best white tea I wish I could give 6 out of 5 stars With so many choices I gave two leaves and a bud a try Judging by the package outside it s like a regular brown box no fancy tin But the tea is individually wrapped in some soft satin materials and you can see the little tea leaves Then each is wrapped in a plastic to maintain freshness I was blown away by the packaging already at this point Then the tasting began it s such a smooth delicate tea I can t describe how nice it is but I quit the cheap lipton or any other brand This is the tea for me 
Great for fruit cobbler This fruit is great for a quickie cobbler Just pour a can in a 9 by9 pan Add cobbler topping mix together cup sugar cup flour 2tps baking powder and 1 egg Sprinkle over fruit Pour melted butter over top sprinkle a little cinnamon over top and bake at 350 for 30 minutes Try it I ve gotten lots of compliments on this and it s simple and fast 
This soup rocks I love new england clam chowder and when I can buy a healthy version of it as opposed to the more fattening ones and have it be just as good if not better I m all over it like white on rice Healthy Choice has come through with another fine product I will definitely be buying this one again 
Newman O s Fantastic My husband and I like the Newman O s better than Oreo s and our 3 year old son loves them As we did as a child he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling just like an oreo Also the Newman O s do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have 
Leaves Oreos in the dust Been eating these for some time and couldn t pass up the good deal on Amazon as they can be pricey in the grocery store Rich chocolate flavor 
Great cookies at a great price Everyone in my family from 3 to 64 years old loves these organic cookies I purchased these cookies at several local stores before I discovered that Amazon had them I sent a package to my grandson who is in the Army in Iraq and he raved about them Newman s has another big winner 
Try the Ginger O s I do not like store bought cookies especially Oreos too dry and greasy for me But upon the recommendation of several people I tried the Ginger O s and was pleasantly surprised They have excellent flavor and the cream does not have that greasiness to it If you like ginger cookies don t hesitate to try these 
Original is great Wheat dairy free is a bit tough I love the Original Vanilla Creme Newman s O s so when I saw the Wheat Free Dairy Free on sale one day I picked one up I figured it would basically be the same as the Original The chocolate and vanilla tastes are great but I found the cookies themselves to be rock hard So unless you have an issue with wheat or dairy products I would recommend the Original Vanilla Creme and not the Wheat Free Dairy Free variety 
Perfect Snack for everyone Tasty healthy and fun Unlike other chips you get bored quickly you can dig in the bag and pick different chips according your mood 
my children love these granola bars They are healthy and you don t have to force your children to eat them These are two very good reasons to buy them 
Taste Great I really like the taste of these I could eat them like candy bars they are so good in my opinion Mabe not the healthiest granola bar around But they are definitedly one of the tastiest the Yogurt just melts right into the granola on these just great I even like the vanilla but really like the Blueberry and Strawberry I wish they were a little bigger sometimes I eat 2 instead of 1 but I do recommend if you are worried about flavor these are top notch 
Water tastes much better now I think this flavor is even better than the lemonade 
Cheaper than at grocery store sale price Came quickly and well packaged Quality product at a great price ThankYou AMAZON 
Liver quivering delightful Here in the shanty where every grocery dollar has to be spent to maximize the calorie per buck quotient we still find ourselves splurging on the best meal money can buy Hamburger Helper s Cheeseburger Macaroni CM concoction sates me in a manner no other food can accomplish Sure the kids have to eat their peanut butter sandwhiches for supper so as to allow me to eat an entire pan of CM but I am the one needing the nourishment to arise every morning and descend into the mine for 14 hours to eke out the meager living here in America s proverbial Heartland I could eat CM for breakfast lunch and dinner and never tire of it sliding down into my bulbous belly Mighty fine stuff girls and boys 
Yummy Great for a snack when you need something sweet but don t want all the sugar 
Tasty but pricy Excellent flavor texture freshness Price is too high for such small packages 
I love this stuff This shizz taste good I particularly like the oat clusters It has also made me regular LOL 
Healthy and good tasting My neighbor talked me into getting these because we are both trying to eat healthier and like to try new things Well these are DELICIOUS They are my new favorite breakfast even my children 2 4 yrs old like them They do share a cookie because they are quite large but the size is perfect for me We had no problem with the two batches we ordered both were very fresh and very chewy I stored them right in the freezer and would just pull one out as needed I m reordering now Loved these 
Delicious healthy and perfect for on the go breakfast or snack I had some reservations about trying new relatively healthy food products but this double choc chunk breakfast cookie is a winner I love to bake and have tried many cookies both home made and store bought and Baker s chocolate chunk breakfast cookie is in my top 3 favorite chocolate cookies Not only is it pretty healthy low fat high fiber and protein it tastes very good My only concern for this product is its short shelf life so you have to eat it pretty quickly However that only means that the product is made without excessive preservatives unlike many other similar products on the market I just love that I can pronounce everything on the ingredient list 
The absolute BEST Ahmad English Afternoon Tea is the best I love to sample delicious teas from all over the world I orginally bought a tin of Ahmad tea as a gift for a discount at Marshall s around Christmas time in 2001 I had so many selections for the gift basket I was making that I ended up keeping the Ahmad for myself Boy was I ever glad I did I haven t found Ahmad teas in any store since then I ve been ordering it online ever since and re filling the authentic tin it originally came in During my breast cancer treatment chemo radiation all that good stuff in early 2005 I was able to enjoy Ahmad English Afternoon Tea even when I couldn t keep anything else down 
Nice taste and does what it supposed to do This is the only green tea with echinacea that doesn t have any peppermint and that was the reason I ordered it The taste is nice and after I ve been drinking this tea for approximately a month when nasty winter cold virus attacked everyone in the family one by one I recovered faster than anyone else Therefore it is one more proof for me that Echinacea does help to strengthen you immune system I would recommend this tea to anyone 
My favorite breakfast blend This is my favorite k cup for morning drinking I prefer smooth medium blends like this one and some bold blends If you like light blends this might not be for you 
These cookies are 2 19 in my SuperMarket We were buying Bahlsen cookies at 1 70 2 19 at lockal supermarket until I found that they are 1 41 box here at Amazon 
Bran that s good and good for you These are the greatest Light not too sweet delicious AND high in fiber Who could ask for anything more Problem is Amazon seems to always have a limited stock so they go fast They should even out the supply demand ratio and also offer the other 2 flavors on a more regular basis 
Nutritious but crumbly These are great breakfast bars low in calorie but high in fiber They are the only bar I ve tried that keep me satisfied until lunch HOWEVER they are very crumbly and don t stay together very well so can be mess if you re on the go in the morning 
The best decaf ever This is really the best decaf I have tried It is hard to find any better than the italian decafs like this one or Illy Unless of course you are the average local coffee drinker used to embarassments like Folgers or accustomized to all the overburned and stinking like charcoal brands named for an unknown reason French Roast Italian Roast etc believe me they have nothing to do with French or Italian coffee Not to mention the local decafs which taste more like tea made out of burned wood shavings 
Flavor without the added calories My husband and I loved our hazelnut flavored creamer but gave it and its added calories up as part of our New Years Resolutions This is a nice substitute without the calories While it does not taste as good it is a nice treat when you want a bit more flavor in your coffee We did not like the vanilla and plan to try the mocha next 
Worth every penny I read about these little jewels in a magazine recently and decided to try them I bought the Hazelnut flavor and love it Not only are the packs perfect for your purse or desk but the flavor is true to Hazelnut and blends perfectly with the taste of Splenda I usually have a large cup of coffee for which I have to use two packets They aren t cheap so my recommendation would be one pack of regular splenda and one pack of flavored You won t be disappointed Try them 
Cherrybrook Kitchen Cake Mix I just want to say that my son has a SEVERE nut allergy and it was great to find a product that is safe AND tastes great The mix was a cinch to whip up and makes yummy cupcakes kids love them Be sure to get the icing as well 
Great Oatmeal This oatmeal is some of the best stuff I ve ever had I couldn t believe it tasted so good without any sugar or other additives The packages are a lot larger than the average instant oatmeal package as well This is cheaper than buying the instant oatmeals from safeway or albertsons Healthy tasty cheap what more could you want 
tastes great I have never liked oatmeal When I saw this at my local Costco I decided to give it a try Boy was I surprised I absolutely loved it It is the only brand of oatmeal I can eat Not only is it organic and made from steel cut oats the flavor variety keeps the breakfast exciting for my family Sadly to say Costco stopped carrying it and I was forced to go online to find it It is a little pricey here but you get what you pay for 
Great instant oatmeal I ve tried most of the instant oatmeals and this brand has the best taste while using organic ingredients The variety pack is good so you don t get bored with one flavor The price here seems very good as I pay 3 89 for one box at the local health food store 
compact convenient cheap The handiest way to get cold Crystal Light almost everywhere just buy a bottle of cold water empty one package shake well drink 
GREAT TASTING THESE ARE VERY CONVENIENT FOR TRAVEL THIS ORANGE TASTES LIKE THE VERY POPULAR SUNNY D I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO LIKES THE POPULAR ORANGE DRIN 
Jerky Always Good If you like beef jerky you will like this product I ordered it for my 25 yr old son who expects a big bag of jerky every Xmas no one was disappointed My only disappointment was realizing that I could purchase this flavor at Walmart for a substantially lower cost per ounce 
Not bad but Well this beef jerky is ideally packed for snack size wise and it is softer to chew than some other brand However tastewise it s nothing special Not bad but nothing special 
LOVE IT This hot cereal is great I ve been eating it for years Bob s Red Mill is the only vendor that I know of They are local but I m glad they have it on Amazon now so I don t have to make the 1 1 2 hour round trip It has an almost nutty taste It is high in protein and fiber and is fantastic with dates and milk 
Delicious and low in calories Absolutely delicious snack for only 100 calories Intense cheesy flavor and great crunch 
VERY GOOD I bought this product as I am trying to cut down on my snack calories and they were just as good as the orginal higher calorie ones you get at the store 
great tasting Not the most economical way to buy this but the packets are convenient and the cheesy garlic is delicious without being overpowering 
This tea is the Best I used to drink coffee This is my only hot beverage now It is exquisite The caffeine in tea is water soluable so it is easier on your body than caffeine from coffee Anyway I truly enjoy the flavor I recommend it wholeheartedly 
Yum I first tasted this tea way back in the late 70 s when I worked at a specialty restaurant Now I use it in my secret recipe iced tea it adds a flavor that no one can identify but one that they can t seem to get enough of It s also good hot with cream and sugar The taste is like lemon and nutmeg I ve tried other brands but Twinings is the richest in flavor 
The Earl Grey iest This is as good a deal for this tea as it gets I love Earl grey tea and drink it almost exclusively There are other brands that are good but for the money Twinings is the best you will not find it in the grocery stores this cheap even on sale 
This is the best soup I ve ever tasted I love this soup it is fantastic I have literally been eating this every night for a month I have never tasted soup so flavorful My local market no longer carries this flavor of Wolfgang Puck soup and I am ecstatic to find it on amazon com I m ordering two cases 
Great Value for the price Nice decorative box of variety teas great to use or give as a small gift 
Great Pods These are excellent Columbian pods with a deep rich flavor A perfect medium roast Worked fine for me brewed at 8 oz in a Grindmaster OPOD 
Good miso This is a good miso base I make true miso soup by adding nori seaweed cutup scallions tofu etc I almost didn t buy it based on the poor review on a similar product but I m glad I did It s tasty 
Delicious but 2 jars broken The shipment of 4 jars arrived with 2 of them broken poorly packaged Customer Service will replace them though And then I tried the sauce just as is over pasta with Parmesan cheese on top DELICIOUS Just hot enough to get your attention but not so hot that it would burn your mouth Wonderful I can t wait for the replacement If it weren t for the poor packaging job I would give it 5 stars 
great sauce if your looking for a little extra kick I ve tried all the Scarpetta sauces and this is might be my favorite It as a nice early and late kick Not too strong or overpowering yet memorable on the palate 
Delicious All the flavors are great Try em all YUMMY 
Truly Delicious Mac Cheese Annie s Creamy Deluxe Shells Real Aged Wisconsin Cheddar is made with all vegetarian ingredients and even organic pasta The sauce is made from cheddar cheese cream whey dry milk natural flavors and annatto for color The 12 ounce box is enough for two to six people depending on how hungry you are at the time We serve this as a side dish with many meals and normally can get about four to six servings from one box When making the pasta use a large stockpot filled halfway with water because if you even use a medium to large saucepan it might boil over The instructions say to use a medium saucepan but I can t recommend that personally as it always boils over Once you have the pasta cooked all you do is add the packet of creamy delish cheese sauce This is probably the only box of macaroni and cheese with information on where to get a Be Green bumper sticker I also like the cute Rabbit of Approval sticker on the Annie s Homegrown products They are all delicious not overly salted and you feel good eating such a healthy product The Rebecca Review 
Tasty This macaroni and cheese is the only kind that both the adults and the kids in our family enjoy It has a slightly sharp cheddar flavor that makes it taste so much better than the processed cheese food types Our whole family swears by Annie s Homegrown Deluxe Shells Real Aged Wisconsin Cheddar and it is much cheaper buying them here than one at a time at the grocery store 
As good as it gets from a box I grew up a Kraft boy and you wouldn t find me with off brand boxes of macaroni and cheese No sir Just the authentic and best for me When I got older I realized thanks to Mark Bittman s superb cookbook How to Cook Everything if you happen to be in the vicinity of a bookstore pick it up that boxed stuff is horrid compared to making actual pasta with actual cheese But well sometimes I just want something out of a box And our seven year old ALWAYS does for he has the insane and tasteless taste buds of a child In those cases I always went back to Kraft until we started shopping at Whole Foods and bought a pack of Annie s to try out very skeptically in my case as I d had a lot of off brand stuff that failed to live up to the Kraft ideal Even so called premium and deluxe stuff like the Velveeta Shells and Cheese was just totally weird and off putting But heresy of heresies it turns out that the Annie s stuff is actually BETTER than Kraft Both the regular box with the powder and this stuff with the cheese gel taste better than Kraft through some feat of food science alchemy Try em out Personally I give the nod to the Deluxe over the regular just because it s twice as easy to make no mixing milk butter and powder just rip the pouch and mix with the noodles and easy to make is pretty much the whole point of boxed food but it is a lot more expensive so if you re price conscious and willing to put forth a bit of effort get the regular Annie s Or better yet get that Bittman book and learn to make pasta with sage and parmesan for the same price and just about as much work 
always a fast easy and great meal i love this product it tastes like velveeta shells and cheese only you know it s better for you and better for the enviroment nothing bad to say oh heads up the wheat version is pretty nasty 
Quality product very tasty I m very happy with this product The preparation is extremely easy and I find it to be very tasty I would say this is a cut above most types of boxed mac and cheese I wouldn t hesitate to recommend this and for those with children you will have some smiling faces once they try it 
Great taste but like the others too much sodium Annie s Deluxe macaroni and cheese comes with a pouch of cheese sauce which tastes better than any dry powder variety and it is quicker to mix Regardless of how thoroughly I mix the cheese powder milk and butter the dry powder varieties do not taste as good as Annie s Deluxe Our 3 year old really enjoys Annie s Deluxe and I feel better offering her this rather than Kraft macaroni and cheese Even if the taste wasn t as good as Kraft I would choose Annie s since the ingredients are natural and some are organic Kraft uses artificial color in their dry powder macaroni and cheese though I don t think they do in their deluxe version Kids and adults don t need artificial colors I would give Annie s Deluxe a 5 if they would reduce the sodium content and make a Deluxe version that included whole wheat pasta and was ALL organic currently only some of the dry powder versions are all organic And while I am creating my dream version I would give Annie s a 10 if they would enrich it with some calcium and other vitamins and make a whole wheat bunny shape version My big hangup is that the sodium is too high like all the other brands It would still taste great with a lot less salt if kids are not given high sodium in the first place their taste buds don t crave it Unless pasta is whole wheat or other whole grain there isn t much nutrition in it so whole wheat pasta that is enriched is the way to go Annie s offers many varieties that include some of the improvements I am looking for but it would be great if they would include them all in one version Boxed macaroni and cheese is truly junk food no matter who the manufacturer but Annie s is doing great things to make it better Knowing that macaroni and cheese is often kid food is reason enough to improve it nutritionally The price is reasonable on Amazon and at WalMart however most of the grocery chains and Wholefoods charge too much The best price I found was at Annie s home website when they offered 25 off and free shipping 
tasty snack I love cherries so I thought I would try these dried cherries Common complaints on here include the sugar content to them I say check out raisins and craisins they have it too These taste great a handful is a good snack and I imagine they would be awesome in bagels other baked goods 
Best bing cherries ever These are the best cherries ever We bake with them and they are great right out of the bag 
Tastes great Ah it s a definitly American story in 1969 friends Mo Siegel and Wyck Hay of Colorado began selling the herbal teas that they had previously only made for themselves From such small beginnings came that famous tea company Celestial Seasonings Among Celestial Seasonings many products is Peppermint an herbal infusion that is based on peppermint leaves pure and simple Now I must admit that I put off trying this tea for years after all I am not a big peppermint fan But I must say that this tea tastes great I love this tea with a spot of honey or with milk and sugar it makes a great late night drink But it also makes a very interesting iced tea So if you want to try a fascinatingly different herbal tea then get Celestial Seasoning s peppermint tea 
Yummy If you like Peppermint then you will love this tea It is another one of Celestial Seasoning superb products Very warming and relaxing 
Great tea I have a cup of peppermint tea most mornings and this is what I buy every time It has the best cleanest taste for this type of tea No caffeine as it s just pure peppermint leaves Quality product 
Excellant I SERIOUSLY DOUBT EVERYONE CAN BE SATISFIED WITH ONE KIND OF COOKIE AS FOR THE COMPLAINT OF BEING TOO SPICY WELL DUH GINGER IS SPICY AND A GOOD JOB THEY DO IN MAKING THIS COOKIE I HAVE TRIED THREE KINDS OF NANA S COOKIES AND I LOVE THEM ALL VERY HAPPY THERE IS PEOPLE MAKING A GOOD QUALITY COOKIE WITH NO SUGAR THANKS TO THEM AND 
A nice treat These are a little more crumbly than some of Nana s other cookies that I tried before I found out I should be on a gluten free diet But they are a whole lot better than any I ve been able to bake on my own They are good and spicy just the way I like my gingerbread 
Love this My baby absolutly loves this I feel so much better about feeding her this over Gerber Start reading the ingredients and if you can t pronounce something than you shouldn t be feeding it to you baby 
Fabulous tea Growing up with an English mother I have been drinking tea since I was 3 years old I ve had lots of different kinds of black teas I thought Twinnings couldn t be beat until I had this tea Each flavor is excellent and these are my new favorites 
try Goat s milk instead we moved to NY where we could not find fresh Goat s milk so we ordered the canned milk to see how it would be After trying it I will now never return to the fresh No need to This is wonderful I have it on blueberries every morning It s like desert A true treat 
evaporated goat milk better than powdered I used this product as a supplement for my dog and her puppies for almost 4 months Its high fat and protein content is needed for her ability to produce milk and keep healthy and their energy and growth I preferred the evaporated in cans rather than reconstituting the powdered version 
Best Whole Goat Milk I have been buying this for my daughter since she loves drinking this and it is extremely easy to digest and has better value than cow s milk Sa 
Completely Natural I ve been using the Stevia packets for over a year now and recommend it to everyone I know Some of the packets do contain hardened powder but this has no effect on the sweetness As mentioned before just put the Stevia in first then add hot beverage There is no need for the powder to dissolve the sweetness is dispersed in the beverage and the remains I suppose are the inulin dietary fiber They have been using it in Japan for 30 years with no apparent ill effects From what I ve read the artifical sweetener industry put pressure on the FDA to have it banned in the 90 s and that is why it has to be marketed in the USA as a dietary fiber and not a sweetener 
Review of Sweet Leaf SteviaPlus I am thrilled with this product the taste is great the price was excellent Being a diabetic for 44 years having used many artificial sweetner products during this time I am so excited there is now an easily accessible product which is natural not filled with chemicals I m hoping that the word will get out to diabetics everywhere just how great SweetLeaf s SteviaPlus actually is Thanks so much 
My favourite Always liked the taste of darjeeling tea True to the form the really good stuff is quite expensive but then there is Twinnings to me it s the best of affordable teas Bonus for sloppy people it s hard to oversteep With many other teas if you steep it longer than indicated the tea taste becomes bitter and harsz Not so with this one 
The King of Teas Unquestionably the most refined of teas Darjeeling comes from a region in the Indian West Bengalese Himalayas close to the Nepalese border 7000 ft above sea level Originating with the small time private mid 19th century plantations of a British civil surgeon named Dr Campbell tea has long since transformed the region into a major economic center with over 80 running gardens producing over 10 million kgs over 22 million lbs of tea on a total area of almost 20 000 hectares approximately 75 square miles and employing over 50 000 people on a permanent basis with a further 15 000 being hired during the plucking season March November The area s natural climate with its mixture of rainfall sunshine and rich soil makes for a very distinctive flavor and to be called Darjeeling tea must have been grown and processed in that particular region Darjeeling tea comes in several harvest varieties or flushes the lighter Easter harvest or first flush and the stronger Spring harvest or second flush which has an unmistakeably fruity Muscatel like note There is also a Summer harvest or third flush which is even stronger than the tea from the second harvest but it is somewhat less refined and therefore less popular than the first two varieties Twinings variety is a second flush tea with a subtle quintessentially Darjeeling perfume a great introduction to this region s exquisite teas that will hopefully make you curious for more 
Peanut Brittle This peanut brittle has great taste and just the right amount of peanuts The pieces are a medium thickness and not too thin The only negative comment I have is the can arrived with brittle in lots of small pieces I don t know if this is due to shipping or not 
Yummy I am SO thrilled with Amazon s new grocery service Our children love these all natural graham crackers but seldom get them our nearest health food store is over an hour away It was very convenient to have a case delivered to our home 
Best Graham Crackers ever I had been looking for graham crackers without hydrogenated oils and no high fructose corn syrup These are the best Great value buying them this way it saves over 2 per carton from the local stores The taste and texture is great Will buy them many times more 
Excellent product I was looking for a pancake waffle mix with natural ingredients and no hydrogenated vegetable oil trans fats and tried Canterbury Naturals Old Fashioned Pancake Waffle Mix I followed the mixing directions added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and these pancakes tasted very close to my Mom s homemade recipe but without the fuss The pancakes have a tender texture and great taste My family loves these pancakes and so do I 
very high quality sauce I don t know what Scarpetta means in Italian but it should say something about very good sauce If you re looking for a WOW affect for your next Italian try thi 
I Am Eating This Stuff OK I m eating this stuff and I don t eat cereal What s that tell you It tells you it s pretty good And it s organic so I tell myself I am helping out my body by eating it which is probably not true At 3 per box delivered I don t think I d buy this but with an Amazon deal I got them for 2 each and now I am considering loading in a bazillion of em This is a Prime member s find Maybe I ll mix in the rest of the flavors 6 boxes at a time Comes to 40 per bowl not counting the milk and half banana 
Outstanding find Anyone who loves raspberries will find these absolutely delicious Not too sweet not too tart almost perfect Fresh berries would be the only improvement Great snack for all ages 
Raspberries I am enjoying these in many ways it is my favorite fruit I will certainly buy again 
great raspberries Purchased the raspberries for my daughter in college did t last the night with her 5 suite mates 
Great coffee at an awesome price I am very pleased with the Timothy s Breakfast Blend This particular batch was from the old fill where the pods are rounded on both the top and bottom Remarkably though they have not locked up my Senseo I m pleased with the quality of coffee especially for the price I paid 
Fun sauce with a smooth creamy twang the sauce has a nice balance between the Italian herbs and the smoothness of the cream I recommend using the sauce over plain lately buttered spaghetti makes a great satisfying dish 
Quick Easy Healthy Recipes From the makers of Sauces n Love these shelf stable sauces are great to stock in the pantry for quick easy recipes that are delicious and healthy and take minutes to make I love the vodka sauce with seared scallops and grilled shrimp 
Good in cereal yogurt baked goods I agree with another reviewer who said that these aren t as good as the strawberries However they are still quite tasty in cereal and I have also used them in baked goods like scones where they add a nice flavor without turning the batter all purple like fresh berries do Another advantage over fresh blueberries is that you never get any moldy ones 
fine for cooking These are fine for cooking they aren t that great for snacking though Very crunchy but the blueberry flavor isn t very strong The dried strawberries were so good I was a little disappointed when I opened these Maybe the strawberries were too good 
Best ever These are the best Pop Tarts ever and I think they have been discontinued because I can t find them locally now These were shipped fast AND complete 
Great Value Was hesitant purchasing food online but the product was well packed and arrived in good condition My savings from purchasing at Amazon were 65 over my local gourmet market And the cereal was fresh and crispy 
WOW best cereal ever Please bring it back Amazon I am crazy about this cereal I love the flavor and the crunchiness I m very disappointed that it is no longer available 
Dog Treats These are 100 natural which makes them an excellent choice for all breeds This is nice for dogs with allergies A great valu 
This is it for homemade espresso This is the best coffee I have found to use to make homemade espresso I was blown away the first time I tasted it It easily matches the fresh espresso you will find in American coffeeshops 
Jeremiah s Pick Coffee This coffee was very good The taste was very good but not as rich and full bodied as Starbucks 
Better than expected I looked all over for the Limone Biscotti after receiving a few at Christmas Unfortunately you can only get them in a combination package or in limited quantities So this opportunity to purchase a case was perfect My entire office enjoys having these biscotti with their morning tea or coffee You can t beat Nonni s 
Great product Great price great flavor This brand of biscotti is wonderful Buying by the case was the way to go I love knowing I will not run out for quite awhile Thanks 
Nonni s Biscotti Products Nonni s Biscotti is a good quality and tasty Biscotti It is also available in most stores and supermarkets Occasionally supermarkets have sales on Nonni s Biscotti and when they do It is much more cost effective then buying their product online which is higher priced Overall It is a good buy when Amazon can compete with those sales prices 
excellent superlight substitutes for palmiers Many of Bahlsen s cookies are too sweet and floury for my taste but these light flaky cookies don t taste stale and are not too rich but are nice and do not taste like sugared cardboard I don t crave these but when you eat them you realize that these are better than the average boxed cookies and unexpectedly delicate and fresh tasting given the supermarket price 
Great deal The price was great it arrived quickly and it was exactly what I ordered Great deal and great service 
I love this tea Ah it s a definite American story in 1969 friends Mo Siegel and Wyck Hay of Colorado began selling the herbal teas that they had previously only made for themselves From such small beginnings came that famous tea company Celestial Seasonings Among Celestial Seasonings many products is Lemon Zinger an herbal infusion that is based on lemons hibiscus rosehips and lemon grass As you can tell from those ingredients this tea lives up to its name having a real lemony zing to it It wasn t too long ago that I broke out of my black tea only phase and began drinking herbal infusions well this tea came as a real revelation to me It s good hot and I really enjoy it when I have a cold or similar illness But it also makes a great iced tea with its lemoniness providing some great relief on a hot summer day Overall I love this tea and give it my highest recommendations 
Lemony and decaffeinated This tea smells like lemon sours What a great fragrance This auburn shaded brew tastes lemony with a slight hint of lemon peel bitterness I imagine it would taste good with some sweetener Pretty good but not my favorite Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging they utilize 100 natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don t package each tea bag individually Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface Quote from the box The greatest thing in the world is to know how to belong to ourselves Montaigne 
These are great Full of flavor all whole cashews I have tried nuts from other vendors and they just do not stack up to these babies They are huge and they taste wonderful 
Jumbo is an understatement They were great my groom is a huge cashew fan as is my mom and both were more than pleased They are not heavily salted at all we were pleasantly surprised the salt is more of a fine powder than what you would expect from a salted product They always live upto having the best peanuts in VA we send them to people all over the country and they are all hooked 
Quite Tasty These are not too sour but they get the job done I bought for 12 which I believe is a decent price for this 
Great Gummy Worms While I don t know how they can be better for you than any other gummy worms they are really good I don t know anywhere else you can get a box of 12 delivered for around one dollar a bag Good buy 
Great flavor This Raspberry tea is excellent Unbleached tea bags and flavor make it a favorite for me 
TOP NOTCH I LOVE Crystal Light On The Go makes it so easy to be wherever I am 
Best Tasting Yogi Green Tea I drink hot and cold tea now instead of diet soda After trying many different brands and types I ve centered in on Yogi teas They have great flavors I drink Green tea in the AM and switch to herbals once I get to the office Of the several Green tea flavors Yogi makes I prefer the Kombucha Give it a try 
A Soothing Pleasure The gren tea with Kombucha is absolutely wonderful Not only is it good for you but tastes great You really need to take a quiet break to appreciate the flavor It s such a soothing experience you almost wish you didn t have to face the hectic world again 
Very Good I ve had the other Nana s No Gluten Cookie Bars in Berry Vanilla and they aren t that good But the Chocolate Munch flavor is good They are more moist have a good flavor and a little crunch The only reason I m giving it four stars instead of five is that the texture is a little bit crumbly I will be buying these again 
Dr Kracker rules Great taste great crunch very healthy perferct for a low carb diet We buy in bulk and vacuum seal for future use 
They are great I eat these nuts daily right after I eat some fruit They are wonderful however it would have been wonderful had they been roasted 
Very good This soup is very good I add some milk to it because it is a little too salty for my taste but with that addition it is great 
Delicious It doesn t get much better than this I dish this out on all sorts of food It makes everything taste great It is also pretty reasonably priced I have ordered another 4 pack and plan to always have it on hand 
Spicy goodness This topping was more delicious than I imagined it would be on cheese tortellini The ingredents are flavorful and fresh The sauce is chunky and loaded with spices not a mild sauce good for those who like food with a kick I m glad it came in a four pack because I want to share it with my friends 
Fresh Artichoke and Black Olive Bruschetta A crowd pleaser Bruschetta is simply and delicious Chunky tomatoes fresh artichokes and black olive on crusty ciabatta bread is farm fresh and addicting Also fantastic over grilled fish served with pasta or a pizza topping We love it as a dip with flat crackers Indulge and enjoy Buon appetito Thinking beyond the ingredients is essential for our environment Our fresh sauces are made with convenience in mind microwave freezer and dishwasher safe great to reuse for leftovers storage seedling gardens art projects your creativity is the limit without sacrificing flavor 
Great Product Annie Chun s Rice Express Sushi Wraps and Rice Bowl is a wonderful product tastes great and the most of all the kids love it 
Tasty and Fun Really tasty top quality stuff Easier to make than expected My 13yr old enjoys preparing it and looks forward to being the chef every time we have it on the menu 
Very tasty The sticky rice is perfect just microwave it in the container it comes in for 2 min The paper thin wraps are very small and it is a bit difficult to roll The result is a bit of a mess but tastes great I put a small amount of crab meat next to the rice Each pack comes with 10 wraps a container of rice and one soy sauce pack The calorie count is 340 But with 1 2 it is a reasonable 170 and is enough for a lunch I bought it when it was a gold box item for 10 It is worth that but I will not purchase again for a higher price Overall it is easy to make tastes great and is a great option to have around since it does not require any refrigeration 
Yummy I ordered this when it was the gold box deal and I would order again even at the higher price Reading the reviews just reaffirms the old adage that you can t please everyone I m happy that there is no added flavor in the rice The rice is quite tasty as it is Have we gone to a culture that has to modify everything In today s world we don t taste what we prepared to eat We only taste the condiments we pour onto or into it I thought the wraps where big enough How hard can it be to roll sushi for goodness sakes I thought the salt taste in the wraps added a little rush to the flavor when I bit into the sushi All in all I think this is a great option to lunch and a good value Having to roll your own helps you to slow down your eating and allows to feel full just about the time you munch on the last bite Tomorrow I think I ll add some tuna Yummy 
Yummy My kids 3 4 years old just got finished having this for lunch and can I say it was an instant hit They loved rolling their own sushi I had a few rolls too and it was very tasty I ordered this on a whim when it was a Gold Box special and I am so glad I did 
Loree s Love of Nature Valley Cinnamon Granola Bars I really like the Nature Valley Cinnamon Granola Bars and have for some time However I can no longer find them in the grocery stores in my locale The boxes of Cinnamon bars stopped being available some years ago and recently they were no longer available in the variety pack either It was a pleasure being able to purchase them again 
Delicious Convenient healthy too Garlic Chicken is my favorite Ensavor flavor not too sweet not too sharp not too garlicy As a diabetic I need to eat six times a day even when I m on the road When I have a microwave available I use it But when I don t I park my car facing south leave the pouch on the dashboard and heat it up that way Each Ensavor meal is ready to eat nutritionally balanced and portion controlled Getting hungry while away from home used to cause me great anxiety as my tradeoff was a diabetically unsound meal vs delaying my eating and enduring headaches and light headedness Ensavor really satisfies Bravo 
good buy this was a great buy and I recommended it to everyone I would use amazone again for all my needs 
Price was right and no clean up These are very handy I know they are more expensive than buying the big box but no clean up in the morning is great just a spoon and I m off to work I had bought the larger size earlier but these are a better size for me 
Yummy I love to put a bag of Pumpkin Crunch on the table at work and watch people s faces light up when they taste them Try it 
My Husband Loves This Brand of Peanuts As a southern born boy my husband is pretty picky about his peanuts When he discovered this brand he couldn t stop talking about the great taste He was delighted to get these as a gift and can t wait to share them with everyone he says they re the next best thing to fresh 
very tasty but hard to get The product is very good and was delivered promptly I am curious to know why it is hard to find on local store shelves 
Yummy I am on a diet so these make the perfect mid day snack 24 mini wheats per serving and I love that they are made with whole grain wheat which makes them filling I haven t tried them with milk yet but the strawberry frosting helps with my need for sweet I am definitely going to buy more 
Strawberry Delish As a fan of frosted Mini Wheats I love trying all the new flavors and the strawberry delight flavor was on my mind I expected them to be a little sweeter but they have a delicate strawberry flavor that tastes very natural The pink milk looks pretty with these little bites of tasty crunchy wheat floating around Sort of a pleasing aesthetic experience that makes these perfect for an afternoon snack The Rebecca Review 
WOW Peanut Free and Delicious I have tried all of Cherrybrook Kitchen Products and they are fabulous Even without Eggs Dairy and Peanuts these products taste even better than if I made it from Scratch The Chocolate Chip Cookies rise well have plenty of Chocolate Chips and taste great I would highly recommend them 
great taste but NOT instant as the package says To be fair the package does also have in somewhat smaller and less prominent print a detailed statement telling the buyer that microwaving cooking will be necessary BUT if you just look at the package front you ll get the impression you can make this like you make instant oatmeal Not so I hate using microwaves so that was a big turn off for me All that said the stuff is delicious and definitely warms me up and fills my tummy keeping me from getting hungry better than most oatmeals do The texture is thicker and heartier than regular instant oatmeals kind of a cross between a light muesli and oatmeal I make mine add about 2 ounces of organic skim milk and I m good to go The sweetness is light and wonderful no overly sugary yuckiness 
Favorite Hot Cereal This is my new favorite hot cereal and has a unique hearty flavor that I ve not found in any other Very satisfying and not too sweet Excellent 
real breakfast I have the instant Hot Cereal at least three times a week I used hot water then place the bowl in the microwave for 25 seconds 
Best gluten free cake mix available Both my mom sister are gluten intolerant so I have used many gluten free products to make cakes or other recipes for family get togethers This is the best cake mix by far This cake mix is just as good as wheat based mixes I modify it to make various kinds of cakes coconut cake red velvet cake etc It always gets rave reviews even from those used to eating wheat based cakes My mom sister can tolerate vanilla pudding so I add one third to half a box of instant vanilla pudding regular not sugar free per bag of cake mix to make it extra moist I also use The Gluten Free Pantry s chocolate truffle brownie mix it is better to me than any wheat based brownie mix 
Good mix of Yogi teas with alot of licorice I like yogi teas and figured that an assortment during the winter would be nice however I found that 3 of the 4 teas contained licorice root which i am not particularly fond of tasting However if you like licorice root then this is a good assortment 
Fantastic product Savory Choice is the best stock I ve found and I love everything about it First off it s flavor is incomparable to any other pre made stock product and it really tastes like what chicken stock is supposed to taste like I shared it with my grandmother and it won even her stamp of approval Secondly I love that it is concentrated so that you make up just the amount you need which is especially handy when you are deglazing a pan to make a sauce for example you don t end up with a whole quart container going bad in your fridge Finally if there s anything I learned from NY apt living I love how small the footprint is of the box itself It s also great to pack for backpacking trips to keep in your desk at work etc They make chicken beef and turkey and around the Bay Area it s available at Whole Foods Berkeley Bowl Andronico s etc 
Delicious and no cans to store I ve used this Savory Choice product for over a year and can recommend it highly It is delicious and easy Inside each individual packet is a thick liquid just add it to a cup of water to make the broth This is not like the low salt low fat powders or the canned products but more like broth you ve cooked from scratch Comes in beef chicken and turkey flavors I keep it handy on my RV as well as in my kitchen 
Delicious and versatile These three sauces are delicious I think that probably the most difficult part of Indian cooking is getting the right combination of spices and flavors for the sauces These sauces from Taaza do the hard work for you In practically no time you can create delicious meals by adding your own fresh ingredients You can add whatever vegetables meat or seafood you may have on hand to make complete meals For example I may add shrimp bell peppers and onions to one of the sauces For another sauce I may add potatoes cauliflower and chickpeas You can come up with your own combinations even though the combinations may not be authentically Indian the sauces make it seem like they are Also by reading the nutritional charts on the bottles I know that they are healthy unlike the food in some Indian restaurants that are loaded with calories I know that I can feed my family rather inexpensively with these sauces and they taste like they came from a restaurant And my kids love these sauces too 
Uniquely delicious This alternative trail mix is a uniquely delicious treat I bought it because I love cashews and thought it would make a great snack It did indeed I ate the entire bag in one sitting and had to run out for more It s a healthy snack and a great alternative to trail mix While I haven t tried the other flavors yet I m sure they are just as tasty You won t be let down with this wonderful snack Enjoy 
This is grand really really grand I first tried this nut and spice delight at Costco I had some of the samples that were offered that day and I choose to purchase the Sing Buri My goodness this is good The flavors are just right You know how a really good Asian or French sauce holds together and has a progression of flavors I found that this happens with the nuts and chili and lemongrass Really this is a gorgeous snack and healthy too Now that Amazon is offering this company s products I ordered 2 And with the nice 10 bucks off this is a very nice bargain Depending on your palate some folks are happy with Planters nuts you know I think you will be delighted with this choice Scrumptious 
A Great Value for a Great Product I don t usually buy this cereal in the supermarket because it can run almost 5 00 a box in manhattan but when I saw it here I couldn t resist at a little over 3 dollars a box All the nutrients and fiber that you can cram into a 24 5 box and a great taste too Jam packed with raisins almost a guilty pleasure and the flakes hold up longer than most other cereals of this type 
Excellent Gourmet Salt Sampler I ve always wanted to try gourmet salts but didn t want to risk spending the money in case I didn t like them or they ended up all tasting just like regular salt Dave s Gourmet offers a great way to try six varieties all in one convenient shaker Amazon offers these salts as a three pack making them a good value Each salt really does have its own distinct flavor Warning the Eurasian Black Salt has a VERY strong sulfur odor and taste I used it successfully in a tuna salad recipe in place of hard cooked eggs The Smoked Salt is just as the name implies salt crystals with a natural smoke flavor excellent for giving indoor cooked meats a just grilled taste The other four salt varieties are milder tasting and offer a nice change to standard table salt Hawaiian Red Salt can really liven up the look of bland colored dishes such as pork or potatoes Keep in mind that gourmet salts work best when sprinkled on foods after cooking heat can alter the taste a little I highly recommend this product 
Great Tasting I loved them and so did the little one And I appreciate having lollipops without refined sugar 
Tasty Good Value If you have kids sensitive to food colorings or are just trying to avoid artificial ingredients these are great treats to have My children have only recently made the adjustment from commercial artificially flavored and colored candies So they are picky about organic treats These lollipops have passed the test with my eight children Their quality control seems to be pretty good something I don t always see with organic foods and the flavors and colors are really nice not boring or tasteless I keep these on hand to trade for candies others give them that they are not able to eat due to sensitivities with food coloring 
Great Product I LOVE the white sesame crunch It has just enough flavor to keep you munching It s better than a candy bar or bag of chips Hard to find in the area and no problem ordering it Same good quality same great taste I d recommend it but don t expect tons of flavor and spice that it doesn t have 
Good Snack for Diabetics This is a good snack to carry in a purse for when I need a quick snack It is high protein and low sugar which is good for my diabetes requirements Also it is easy to eat because of its small size I like the zip lock bag so that I can eat two or three and close up the bag I am always looking for quick and easy snacks for my diet requirements This hits the target and also hits the taste spot too 
Yummmmmm If you expect it to taste like fried chicken you will be disappointed as the other reviewer was BUT if you just enjoy it for how it tastes it is great Quick meals galore add to rice stuffing or pasta You can even clean off the gravy and BBQ it I think it is one of the better tasting fake meats around 
A lot of flavor little calories These are my favorite of the 100 calorie packs so far Fun mix of different flavors and textures in the crackers plus they have a nice spice mix that really gives them a nice zesty flavor 
Easy to make for lunch After having this rice at a neighbors dinner party I ordered some for my family I was eager to eat it again and tried making the Rice Creole for lunch last weekend 20 minutes later I mixed in some cheese and rolled it in a few tortillas Easy to make and goes great with any meal or as a meal itself 
Yummy These are great for on the go My kids love them even the toddler can handle the texture with no teeth Good value buying here too 
Great Healthy Snack These crunchy snacks are healthy addictive and tasty I love the crisp texture the flavors and the perfect size for a snack Much better than the Apple Chips that have all that added junk and sugar These Sensible Foods Snacks are just dried fruit Love the apple harvest flavor best then tropical blend A favorite snack item 
Good snack I love these as a filling snack They are also satisfying if you are craving something crunchy I keep a few bags in my car for the trip home from work or if I am running late in the morning and can t get breakfast They also have a nice flavor really natural not artificial tasting 
Good Coffee Enjoyable Not too strong Not my favorite of the k cups but a nice medium coffee with plenty of flavor Not as strong as the ultra bold but a nice rich cup of coffee I recommend using some of the smaller cup settings when brewing this coffee 
My family favorite cerial My family loves this cerial I wanted to buy more of it Unfortunately it is not available anymore When will you have more of it to sell 
The best breakfast cereal but why did it disappear This is the best breakfast cereal I have ever found The low sugar content whole wheat and yummy blueberries and strawberries made it my favorite healthy breakfast and snack food Now it has disappeared from store shelves and it isn t available online either Kellogg s website does not list this product under the list of discontinued products So why is it not available My family used to purchase about 2 3 dozen of these per month and I know many other people bought this product I find kids and adults searching for this product at grocery stores and looking dejected as they helplessly purchase some other product instead I hope Kellogg notices that there s a market for this product 
Best cereal This cereal has a reasonable sugar content which I like a lot becase all other cereals have tons of added sugar in them Love the fact that it has strawberries and blueberries in it Tastes great 
The best cereal I ve ever had This cereal tastes great And of course strawberries and blueberries are good for you too And they ship it to you what more can you ask for 
THE BEST This cereal is great It has great flavor and I loved the strawberries and blueberries Delicious I would recommend this cereal to everyone 
A healthy choice but I expected a little more nutrition Kellogg s Fruit Harvest Strawberry Blueberry packs a huge punch with a great taste and it contains no fat no trans fats and no cholesterol It is relatively low in sugar and carbohydrates too Despite the fact that this is one of the best tasting breakfast cereals out there I am disappointed in its vitamin content The artwork on the box leads you to believe that this cereal just has to be very healthy for you Yes it has 25 of your recommended daily intake of iron niacin vitamin B12 vitamin B6 riboflavin thiamin and folic acid but I expected this product to be healthier still I will take off one star for that to make this a four star review It is low in sugar just as they say it is However if you aren t getting the proper amount of exercise you need then the extra sugar in the strawberries blueberries and corn syrup could turn into sugar inside your body As always when planning a diet it helps to consult your physician before starting a new diet Nevertheless the strawberries and blueberries taste delicious even when you eat this dry and drink milk along with it Kellogg s Fruit Harvest Cereal offers whole grain which is an important part of any healthy diet Overall Kellogg s Fruit Harvest Strawberry Blueberry breakfast cereal is a great choice to start your day Sure it may not be the absolute healthiest cereal on your grocer s shelf but this cereal beats junk food by a mile Buy some and enjoy today SMILE 
Wonderful Quick Food Love these because you can store the box in a cupboard no wasted refrigerator space and still have a good quick meal ingredient My husband loves these as a light lunch or evening side dish served with butter and grated cheese I love them in soup especially a simple chicken broth soup to which I add a bit of black pepper dill and lemon juice The DaVinci tortellini are aso great 
good if you use the right amount brews a pretty good cup of coffee though I have to use five 2oz scoops for my mr coffee 8 cup coffee make 
Delicious My husband is a celiac and it s hard to find gluten free product that s easy and fast This product is easy to prepare quick and tasty My husband I enjoy it every time 
Very tasty extremely easy to make If you enjoy lemon poppyseed muffins loaf this is the mix for you Plus it is the easiest mix ever takes just a minute to mix Personally I add about a tablespoon of pure lemon extract to the mix just to kick up the lemony flavor My family and friends love when I make these muffins 
outstanding quality great price Stash s Organic Pinhead Gunpowder Green Tea Loose Leaf is the best of the best of green tea s It is rich smooth and looks like liquid gold in the cup The tea leaves can be used 2 or 3 times depending on how strong you like your tea with good results and good flavor 
this is very good I ve only made it with added nuts but it always comes out moist on the inside somewhat crunchy on the outside It has a nice strong chocolate taste and the ingredients are mostly or all organic It didn t come out as high as the picture on the box but that s okay for a brownie 
does what a cereal should do This is a delicious choice for breakfast I thought it wouldn t hold me from hunger for long because it was flakes but it really does a good job It stays crunchy considerably well and has just the right sweetness Tastes healthy but not in a gross way 0 You feel like you are making a good decision to eat it Definitely worth it because of the volume of cereal you get 
Healthy but hold the sugar The price of this product and many others via Amazon is excellent compared to the Whole Paycheck types of healthy supermarkets I m totally pleased with this cereal It tastes great but surely the sugar content boosts its taste appeal Organic or not sugar is sugar and many have been advised to keep their distance from it Nature s Path should consider using alternate sweeteners such as organic of course brown rice syrup or raw blue agave syrup The macrobiologists would be jazzed 
Great for Celiacs I really LIKE this cereal as opposed to well this is something I can eat safely without gluten I put all those extra bags in the freezer but will definitely eat them up Another popular GF cereal is so HARD and extra crunchy that is beats up my tongue This is quite tasty and just the right normal flake texture 
Great wheat free cereal Sometimes there is an unusual aftertaste in wheat free foods from the grains that are used as wheat substitutes but I don t find that to be the case with this cereal It gets a little soggy if you don t eat it quickly enough and I add dried cranberries to give it a little more interest but overall it is good I do not find it to be too sweet I d say it s slightly sweeter than plain corn flakes 
Great when mixed with fruit or a little something extra First remember that you ll be getting a lot of cereal when you order this value pack months worth if it s just for one or two people Fortunately it doesn t have too strong or strange of a flavor so you shouldn t get tired of it I suggest adding a sliced banana or apple or even a shake of a honey sweetened cereal as it s not the most interesting cereal to eat on its own My biggest recommendation do NOT eat it plain with soy milk as the grain flavors reinforce each other to the point of being a bit nauseating 
Great tasting I was so happy to see Amazon carry this product It is very good very healthy and uses minimum packaging 
Not my first choice This oatmeal tastes great but is higher in calories than I expected Even though I liked the product there are others that I like better All the instant oatmeals are wonderful for a quick easy breakfast 
Excellent popcorn This is by far the best bagged popcorn I ve ever eaten The smoked gouda flavor isn t really subtle but who wants subtle in a snack like this It comes out and whacks you on the head HEY I M POWDERED GOUDA and has a great full bodied flavor 
Holy Cow so good I recently tried Oogie s Smoked Gouda White Cheddar and Sundried Tomato popcorn WOW I ve never tasted anything like it Very tasty with just the right amount of salt And to think these snacks are heart healthy My kids loved Oogie s It s great to have such a healthy delicious snack to feed them after school I will definitely buy Oogie s again and serve at parties too If you love popcorn do yourself a favor and buy this stuff 
Bruschetta is the perfect appeitizer This bruschetta topping is the perfect appetizer to throw together when guests drop by This balsamic vinegar tomato based recipe is perfectly prepared with chunky fresh never from a can tomatoes and plenty of imported greek capers We prepare our bruschetta toppings in a traditional way by hand prepping chopping picking and visually inspecting every ingredient so that they taste like they were just made fresh we then prepare them in small batches so you taste every delicious ingredient WARNING May have urge to consume the entire jar upon opening Buon appetito 
Given the price of gas And how far I would have to go to purchase this in a store Well it s not a BARGAIN but on the other hand it s not unreasonable if I take pains never to specify free shipping and it gets brought to my door 
Serve it hot This is really good soup all thats missing is a good piece of bread and some butter but I guess then it wont be healthy anymore 
Tasty tea I recently gave up coffee made the switch to teas I ve tried all the usual suspects Lipton other grocery blends were bitter or weak I purchased the loose tea leaves from Amazon at a fair price quick shipping English friends suggested PJ Tips Tea which we ordered from another online site Twinning s blows it away The Earl Grey Irish Blend are great both on the pallet to the nose 
These are not your mother s Grape Nuts Grape Nuts Trail Mix Crunch are great I remember the regular grape nuts that my mom had yuck she added almost as much sugar as there was cereal to make them taste good But Trail Mix Crunch is a different story they are great nothing more needed They added a little honey almonds and raisins for more flavor and there are 5g of fiber per serving to boot These are also easier on the jaw than plain grape nuts they are not as difficult to chew but still crunchy almost like a granola Definitely a family favorite I would have to say that the only downfall is the price they could be a bit less expensive which is true of most granola like cereals 
Outstanding Service I order this product all the time from Amazon It s an excellent cereal delicious great for your diet and digestive system I m actually writing this review to commend Amazon on their customer service I have ordered this many times and each order has come quickly and with no problems My last order however did present a minor problem I contacted Amazon and IMMEDIATELY received the BEST customer service I have ever received from any company both on line and off I would never hesitate to order anything from Amazon You can count of them to handle each and every order with the upmost consideration and superior service Sometimes there might be a slight delay if a product is backlogged but aside from that you can trust Amazon to give you the BEST SERVICE POSSIBLE Thank you Amazon 
Yummy This stuff is GREAT I love all the varieties that I tried Great snack for work High quality and excellent taste 
Crunchy and satisfying For a great low fat snack these crackers fit the bill They are very tasty and have a nice crunch I love eating them with Fuji apples 
Chick soup Product fine how ever on web site when we purchased this product label showing the ingredients doesnt show this to have any soy or dairy in it When we rec it checked label and it does have both soy dairy in it as the party this was for cant have either could not use it Amazone was great gave instant refund gave to a friend to use says it very good 
Not as bad as I thought it would be I normally love nice fruit combo s but have found that most mixes especially powder mixes don t cut it This one honestly was not bad Now mind you it still has that Crystal Light Taste but if you are a fan of their other mixes then you should be ok with the taste I would say that it is worth the Money 
Great Licorice product This is an awesome cotton candy Great black licorice flavor in a decievingly white cotton candy A definate must have for any black licorice lover 
Better than chocolate I have been a long time lover of black licorice and dark chocolate But since recently discovering RJs I would have to say if given a choice between a piece of the best dark chocolate and a piece of this licorice hands down I d be going for the latter I was astonishly surprised with my first bite wonderfully soft and intensely flavorful I enjoyed the fact that it didn t stick to me teeth or make me feel that I was having to give my mouth a workout to enjoy it Amazon offers this at a great price too I ve paid considerably more 
My favorite licorice I just love this black licorice It s soft it s chewy and oh soooo good I ve loved black licorice since I was a child This is the closest licorice to what I had when I was little When I was a kid there was a little store around the corner of my grandmother s house and they used to sell little boxes of soft licorice I haven t been able to find that licorice since the store closed I keep stocked up with this licorice too It s the only candy I eat 
good product This is a different type of licorice than I was used to It was still pretty good though 
The Dad s loved it I purchased this candy for my father and my father in law They both thought it was some of the best licorice they had ever tasted They liked the fact that it was soft and easy to chew but the outstanding characteristic was the flavor Both of them could not stop talking about the natural old time flavor of the candy I think they will be disappointed if I don t buy it again 
OUTSTANDING Hands down the BEST black licorice I have ever had From New Zealand Texture is quite soft not rubbery like others I have had Flavor is full and bountiful Hooray 
Real licorice You can get real licorice in New Zealand Australia Germany France The Netherlands Sweden England Finland and even Denmark But not in the US We use anise oil Real licorice is found in RJ s and it makes a huge difference The flavor is akin to dark chocolate and very nice if you are a licorice fan 
Another brilliant invention ask anyone who percolates their coffee I have an old rather beat up percolator that I bought for 1 from the neighbor lady during a garage sale It is terrific Easy to make the coffee the coffee tastes great and it takes up little counter space But I would get these grounds in my coffee cup and I didn t like it Enter the percolator filter These are great because the grounds really have no where to go My grocery store used to carry but have stopped which isn t good the disc filters which just sit under the grounds but don t wrap around them in any way So the grounds can still sneak into my cup though it is better than nothing Also these make disposal easy Just tip your percolator basket thingie I have a percolator but am clearly not an expert on them upside down the filter falls out and you are ready for another pot of joe Thank you Melitta 
Delectable This is perhaps the best coffee I have ever had I know that sound cliche but it is the damn truth The only coffee that I have found that comes close is Distant Lands in Tyler TX If you are looking for an amazing coffee any time of the day make no other choice than this 
Wonderful tasting and super nutritious Here is proof that a cereal can be good for you Nature s Path HempPlus Granola Cereal is Low in Fat 5 grams per low in carbs about 25 grams per vs 45+ for a regular cereal moderate in fiber and very low in sodium PLUS is has healthy omega 3 fats from the Hemp seeds Nature s Path HempPlus Granola Cereal has a mild sweetness that is very pleasant and is not over powering It is easy to chew and not hard like a lot of other granola based cereals In milk is is very tasty and doesn t get soggy for quite some time It is ever delicious right our of the box Bottom line this is one great tasting and healthy cereal 
Delicious this is the best granola i ve ever had it s hard to find in grocery stores so i m so glad i can get it here 
Good anyhow Agreed there s no reason for these people to put in so much salt On the other hand there s no way I d confuse this stuff with Campbell s Like most cream soups it benefits from a bit of added milk but we like it a LOT 
Baxter soups are tasty comfort food for the tummy I buy Baxter Soups by the case because I am disabled and can t get to the grocery store These soups are restaurant quality and with a dollop of sour cream you have a real treat Smooth as velvet they will have you either gulping them down and wanting more or savoring every spoonful 
Make it taste even better My kids love their Macaroni Cheese but one day all we had was a generic brand They didn t eat it all that well Kraft really is the best so I decided to try to make it a little better for them Follow the recipe on the box with a couple exceptions Put one slice of velveeta chees in while melting the butter I melt the butter while the noodles are draining so as to melt the butter and velveeta faster and add 1 3 cup milk What you ll have is a less expensive version of the really creamy macaroni and cheese that Kraft sells for a lot more money By adding extra milk and cheese they re even getting more calcium My kids love it when I throw in hot dogs and even peas so feel free to throw in other things since it s so cheesy the extra cheesy sauce will take things like peas that kids don t normally eat and make them taste good Give it a try and see what you and or your kids think 
Late July Mini Cheddars the Best The crackers are the best Great for lunches or a mid afternoon snack 
very tasty These sandwhich crackers are very good The whole family loves them and they are healthy compared to what is in the store 
Tasty for all ages Everyone in my home and then some enjoy this particular flavor of Redenbacher s This is my absolute favorite along with the Movie Theater Butter a close second If you make alot of popcorn give this a try you won t be disappointed 
Can t get this locally anymore My wife first was buying another Orville Redenbacher brand locally called Honey Butter it was nationally discontinued so when this came out she was happy again Now it s no longer carried locally This merchant has a good price and it shipped fast 
Mmmm Mmmm by jordan This pudding is delicous No I m not on a diet but wow I tastes delicious and sweet 
Hmmmm Yum Similar VERY to Oatbran Flakes I prefer the latter but this is more nutty I think they re both 10s on the FILLING scale And both since they are from Nature s Path are fantastically wholesome deliSH 
Great for breakfast These are tasty on their own but i especially like them crushed tossed into some yogurt with some blueberries or bananas The only problem with this is that even in bulk Amazon is expensive When they are on sale it s usually 2 dollars per box so the equivalent quantity to what they offer here is 12 boxes which would be 24 dollars Amazon is selling it for 33 dollars 
Yummy cereal This cereal is delicious I will continue to buy it Very creamy and yummy 
perfect for making seitan the wheat meat I use Bob s Red Mill wheat gluten flour for making seitan a wheat gluten meat familiar to vegans and vegetarians It is very easy to use is obviously high quality and keeps well I ve found Bob s works the best out of all the brands for this use I just wish that it was organic and that they made bigger bags the case comes with a lot of packaging which seems like a waste 
Absolute deliciousness I just got a case of these last week and I am back ordering today I purchased these because I am a diabetic I look for lower carb high protein high fiber products These are the best snacker that I have found yet I have tried genisoy kay s and others but none compare to the fabulous texture crunch and perfect seasoning I was so impressed I shared with my 23 year old son for his opinion He asked to have a bag to himself because they were so good He compared to a ranch style corn type pringle chip without all the greasiness I am also ordering the bar b que style because the ranch was so good 
tasty and convenient relatively guilt free snack Though I m not into so called guilt free foods and eat mainly fruits vegetables whole grains beans and low fat dairy I have days when I need to make sure I get enough protein in a pinch These soy chips often fill the gap as with a new baby in the house who is cared for full time by his mom in lieu of various mechanical and other devices such as swings bouncers teddy bears with womb sounds etc I m not cooking quite so much Plus I don t have much taste for meat though I m not a vegetarian I don t eat many processed foods and these soy chips are on the lower end of the processed side of things in my opinion as they don t have a bunch of dyes perservatives etc just the soy flour rice oil salt spices one could do much worse In particular I have found them helpful for road trips when you don t know when you ll encounter something decent to eat and don t have room for a cooler and for plane trips Along with a few pieces of fruit I ve been carried through many a dicey food situation with these non perishable soy chips A 2 hour ride to the airport 2+ hour flight and average 2 hour luggage retrieval and dash to hotel or other lodgings is a long time to go without something to eat in these days of superb airline service Besides who ever really liked or much less could argue the sound nutrition of airplane food anyway The chips pack a lot of heart healthy soy protein about 24 grams per 385 calorie bag are low in fat and in sugar Also the bag can be compressed in to a much smaller size for carry on economy if you don t mind some crushed chips They may not be a salad and healthy entree cover page meal but they are a giant leap up from the vast majority of vending machine convenience store and grocery snack aisle trash The downside to them is that they do have relatively high sodium but if the rest of your diet is pretty low in salt and you aren t having trouble with blood pressure you re probably ok there I really love the new amazon com grocery venture because for one I can get these soy chips in 12 packs The price works out to be just over 50 of the cost per bag that I d pay in any grocery store where I live When I two cases at a time to get over the 25 barrier I get free shipping which really seals the deal My dad kids me that I m an amazon com junkie and whenever he sees a package from amazon com in his box he knows who s sent it This is not a prompted plug for amazon I just really like their service grocery especially 
Very easy to prepare and tasty Very easy to prepare much easier than grating potatoes and going through all the work for freshly made potato pancakes and tasty too Excellent with applesauce and sour cream A good meal for almost any time of the day Will buy another case when needed 
Blueberry Bars Good fruity taste and good tasting all around I just wish the bars were a little bigger so I wouldn t have to eat two of them to curb my appetite 
Great pasta Great price I originally discovered this pasta at my local QFC supermarket at 4 49 per 12OZ unit The price point being a little rich for my blood I only bought it on certain occasions Buying it from Amazon in 6 packs at 2 33 per 12OZ unit and the free shipping option along with the 5 00 off promo code that cuts back the per unit price about 25 cents makes it a much better buy and now a regular addition to the dinner table Thanks Amazon for the fair deal and stocking Al Dente Pastas 
thank heavens for corn flakes I was recently diagnosed with celiac disease so I turned to Kellogg s corn flakes for my breakfasts because I figured corn was safe Little did I know that malt flavoring contains gluten These were a serendipitous substitute SO natural and tasty It s refreshing these days to find a food with only three straightforward ingredients corn grape juice salt I ought to buy them in bulk 
Yummy Flakes I enjoyed this brand of corn flakes cereal This was the first time I tried them Such an excellent way to purchase dry goods in bulk at a great price I ll buy more when the kids visit in the spring 
Healthy crunchy tasty snack My title pretty much sums it up The are light crunchy little nuts with just enough salt to add a little punch My husband and I love these A great way to add healthy soy protein to your diet Great for on the go and at your desk snacks Won t fill you up but will satisfy when you just want a little something 
Great on the go snack If you are into a savory crunch this is the snack for you It s delicious yet guilt free Also protein packed if you are interested in that sort of thing 
Guilt Free Popcorn I think that some people have complained that this popcorn is bland but that s what it s supposed to be It s a product that is as healthy as you want it to be you decide Although I do like to add salt I have found that I don t really care to add a lot of other flavors to it This is probably because my mom used to air pop popcorn when we were kids and add her own flavors and it kind of reminds me of that I guess she didn t add very much It seems to pop better than other varieties I ve tried and it doesn t leave you with greasy fingers Good job Newman 
The Best Popcorn for your Health Out of every microwave popcorn I have ever tried Newman s Own is the best ever Just look at the ingredients and you ll know why it s 1 on my shelf Enjoy Carl 
Illy Decaf Espresso is Mighty Fine We love the taste of Illy coffees when brewed in our espresso machine smooth never bitter You cannot distinguish the flavor of the decaf from the flavor of the regular espresso AIlly s vacuum packed canister has a unique design and is reusable 
Illy Expresso Coffee is Great I began using Illy Expresso Coffee because it was the only expresso that I could find that carried decaffeinated expresso It is sold in air tight cans that keep the coffee fresh It has a very good flavor and is finely ground A very good product 
the very best coffee I was recently at a very nice restaurant for dinner and this was the coffee they served It was so rich and delicious We raved about it so much that our server gave us some of the beans to take home I ve been addicted ever since 
Adventurous White Tea Experience I enjoy Numi s Moonlight Spice Orange Spice White Tea It has a distinctive orangey taste and a light spicy taste from the cinnamon cloves allspice and ginger sort of like a light subtle orangey chai tea It is different and unique and all of the flavors are much more subtle than a chai type tea quite adventurous It brews for a lengthier time 7 8 minutes and is worth the wait Moonlight Spice is kosher certified organic and contains amazing ingredients organic cinnamon organic orange peel organic cloves fair trade certified organic Pai Mu Tan white tea organic hibiscus organic allspice organic ginger organic schizandra berries organic lemongrass and dried lime The schizandra berry is a major tonic herb in Chinese medicine used to assist the body in dealing with stress to improve memory function and to assist with many various physical issues There are no oils or natural flavorings used unlike many teas it is also sustainable in that all packaging materials are biodegradable and recyclable the carton is made of 100 post consumer waste and cello wrap is not used Numi says that all their tea bags are made of natural fiber paper not the trendy silky see though nylon tea bags On the box the manufacturer writes Numi s Orange Spice White Tea is like no other We use an abundance of all natural organic ingredients for an authentic cup without using oils or flavorings This sublime tea ingeniously blends premium Organic White Pai Mu Tan tea with orange citrus and spice Pai Mu Tan is exclusively the top two leaves and a bud of the tea plant and can only be picked the day before the buds unfurl White tea is the least oxidized and processed of all teas making it supremely healthy Smooth and delicate Moonlight Spice balances citrus notes of orange schizandra Numi s own Dry Desert Lime and luxurious spice for the most divine experience Transcend into a peaceful moment through its luminous hue and enchanting fragrance The price is perfect a big savings over single boxes If you like Numi teas get it you won t be sorry If you are new to Numi but enjoy white tea this will probably be one of the best you ve ever had 
TASTES LIKE PEANUT BUTTER and I like peanut butter This goes really well with jelly if you put them between two slices of bread It s like a sandwich MM MM GOOD 
I love this stuff This is the best stuff in the world I can t find it anywhere so I order it in bulk online But it is AWESOME 
Better than GeniSoy My husband and I were fans of GeniSoy soy crisps but I ordered these because they were less expensive We are never going back Robert s cheddar soy crisps are delicious The cheese flavor and crisp texture are the best we ve had in a soy crisp A wonderful snack I can t wait to try the other flavors 
DELICIOUS Delicious Healthy Plus Amazon is cheaper than if you buy them on Mrs Mays actual website 
This is quite possibly my favorite snack After trying to be a vegetarian and possibly a vegan for a few months I found this to me my favorite snack It is nutrious tastes good not too sweet and it is very light won t make you feel sleepy I recommend it to everyone 
we re mostly nuts about this snack a local gourmet shop sells these for 3 50 each and just can t keep them on the shelves so I have to visit that store every week in hopes I catch the day he gets fresh stock since these sell on the web for over 5 each I was thrilled when Amazon had them for almost 2 each when you buy a 12 pack carton I have only tried a half a dozen nutty flavors thus far with my favorite being the Pumpkin However I stocked up on the Almond because they are very dense in healthy high fiber toasty almonds just a hint of sweet and coconut and you need only a few of these 1 2cm almond cubes as a snack to tide you over between meals 
Pretty Darn Good Everyone s tastes differ but I really like this product There are a variety of well blended flavors in this granola They use quality ingredients so I think it is priced right I prefer this brand to any that I ve tried at the grocery store 
Highly drinkable Twinings was founded in London England in 1706 and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas English Breakfast tea is a mixture of black teas from Sri Lanka which are blended to produce a smooth yet flavorful tea Though often served during breakfast this tea tastes excellent all day long OK let s get down to brass tacks this is another great tea Harder to over steep than some of the teas I have known it consistently produces a smooth and highly drinkable cup Highly conventional in its taste English Breakfast tea has a robust flavor that stands up well to lemon and milk which makes it a favorite among those who like to accessorize their tea Plus I must say that this tea is wonderful iced add some lemon and sugar and you ve got the right tea for a hot afternoon And that s my review If you want an excellent all round tea hot or iced one that goes well with any food then English Breakfast tea is for you If you want tea from a great tea producer them Twinings is for you I highly recommend Twinings English Breakfast tea to all even those not normally into tea drinking Or perhaps especially to those not normally into tea drinking 
English loose tea Loose tea is so much better than tea bags I have two cups every morning and sometimes want more Even the second cup doesn t get bitter or harsh Of course you have to drink it with no sugar or cream 
Good tea Nice robust flavor Tastes very good with cream and sugar or black I will continue to buy it 
Great Value I bought these as gifts For the price you can t beat it 
good gift I ve given this gift to a number of friends and I can never remember being disappointed by the reaction I received The metal on the side is raised up to match the picture and is not stickered When the tea is gone This converts into a piggy bank Good tea quality also 
Best Tasting Bar of Its Kind I ve tried many of them This one doesn t leave a bad aftertaste as many do It is as close to a real candy bar as I ve experienced My problem is I eat too many of them 
My favourite mainstream tea great fragrance and flavor more than English Breakfast Can t beat the price either 
Great value for my favorite tea This goes for 6 99 per tin in my local grocery store so it was a great savings on something I buy often 
a pleasure to spoon out I have no regrets buying this product in bulk I will buy in bulk again when i run out This yeast must be at 115 degrees F to bloom so a thermometer is a necessity 
Good consistent coffee I ve shifted to drinking Pura Vida coffee after searching for some time for a rich blend that is not too bitter or burnt This batch worked great for espresso and gets strong recommendation for that use I often drink coffee made with espresso roast to get a very dark cup of coffee and it was not terrific for that My preference is the Pura Vida French Roast for drinking coffee and this one for espresso 
good tasting and nutritious I add this granola to my yogurt every morning It adds the perfect texture and is incredibly good tasting and good for you Enjoy 
Great for fruit cobbler This fruit is great for a quickie cobbler Just pour a can in a 9 by9 pan Add cobbler topping mix together cup sugar cup flour 2tps baking powder and 1 egg Sprinkle over fruit Pour melted butter over top sprinkle a little cinnamon over top and bake at 350 for 30 minutes Try it I ve gotten lots of compliments on this and it s simple and fast If you really want to have more fruit try adding a can of rasberries to the mix 
Great Crackers I like these crackers so much that I have to buy them by the case They re also healthy no hydrogenated oils and no trans fats 
Great crackers Quite a few broken in shipping though We really like these crackers I was a bit disappointed that about half of the crackers were broken by the time they arrived at our door I think I may just have to buy them from the store next time 
We Should All Go bAck to Nature I love these crackers for several reasons They are absoutely delicious to begin with And they do not use ingredients like partially hydrogenated soybean oil They are hard to find in stores It s a hit or miss thing here in the Northeast So I ordered from Amazon Propmpt delivery and ease of purchasing will keep me coming back 
DELICIOUS Delicious and good for you Orginially purchased for my toddler some of the pieces are a little large and hard for him so we just share a bag 
I received the non organic variety twice My son eats an organic diet and I thought this would be a perfect snack Oops I received the non organic variety Contacted Amazon no problem keep those and we ll send you organic The label said organic on shipment 2 but upon opening the box they weren t organic Amazon decided to refund my money I really wanted to try the produce and found another vendor no problems and my son enjoyed these snacks If Amazon could get their act together I would order these again 
Yummy crunchy Add to cereal or eat out of your hand Each bag has an apple plus other fruit Nutritious nothing added 
Froot Loops 75 ounce one serving bowl 96 pack I bought these for a snack for my five year old son to bring to kindergarten per his request for fruit loops at snack time I needed to find a single serving size for each child in the class Of course the children eat them dry With this it allowed for him to bring them to school 4 times and serve everyone in his class His teacher tells me they are one of the class favorites at snack time easy to serve easy clean up economical everyones happy 
looking for good bold coffee I love really bold flavored coffees and so far I ve found that this is one that I like to drink Though just a little stronger would be great 
These muffins are awesome The muffins are plain without add ins but the box is a plain muffin mix so you know that before you bake it I ve added apples and apple sauce and cinnamon and they turned out great I ve also tried blueberries and those turned out good as well The muffins have a nice nutty flavor and don t need any butter to taste good I m a butter fanatic by the way 
They re So Good They Evaporate This product is excellent It s also a nut snack that my wife who has celiac disease and is allergic to wheat and glueton can enjoy I however can eat anything and this is the tastiest and most unique nut snack I ve ever tried Al Virginia Weatherly 53996 Luzerne Dr Macomb Mi 4804 
DELICIOUS Delicious healthy plus Amazon is cheaper than if you buy them from Mrs Mays actual website 
Sweet nutty Love these snacks They re a little bit sweet loads of crunchy almonds Am looking forward to trying the other varieties too 
Great Taste without High Fructose Corn Syrup If you like nuts and you re looking for a healthy great tasting snack you can t go wrong with Almond Crunch My husband and I recently eliminated high fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated soybean oil from our diet and we feel so much better Trying to find tasty snacks that don t contain these products is not easy so we were thrilled to find Mrs Mays Naturals We love the Cashew Crunch as well 
Wholesome Simple Product These organic kamut puffs are simple goodness If you like puffed cereal then you will like these Very good alternative to wheat rice and corn cereal products 
This is a bargain I was surprised at how much saffron I received for the price If you buy saffron from your local grocery you will feel as if you have hit the Mother Lode 
great product wonderful high quality saffron PS the description has been changed to reflect the proper package size 
A Richly Satisfying Healthy Gourmet Snack When I stumbled upon Sahale Valdosta Blend I was in heaven It s healthy with a wonderful combination of flavors It s high in antioxidants and low in sodium and I can actually eat it with all of my sensitive GI issues I actually eat it for a meal when I m on the road You ve got to try it 
one of my faves This is one of my favorite soups It s very thick and filling for only 100 calories per serving 
Perfect For Small Toddlers These are soft not leathery which is perfect for small children There are no worries about choking and they are very delicious I gave these out at Halloween and at parties and the little ones and the parents loved them They are also great crumbled up into hot cereal and yogurt instead of sugar 
Good product prompt service Gnocchis were delivered promptly and are very good Would buy them again 
rich full bodied Both my husband I loved this coffee It was rich full bodied 
Very Good These are delcious They have a good strong ish compared to what you can get in the US slightly salty taste I can easily eat a whole tub of these 
Licorice Drops These are great but I had originally ordered the coins and love those best our whole family does 
Delicious Last time I had licorice like this is when I visited Holland and got hooked on it 
Unique and Delicious I discovered these nut blends when Costco carried the large bag of Valdosta Blend Being a nut lover the combination of pecan pepper cranberry sounded like a different twist probably good on a salad Boy howdy They are great on salad but are perfect straight out of the bag as well Yummy Yes they are spicy Yes they are different Don t be afraid of the spices they add a whole new twist on a boring chicken dish or plain salad Enjoy 
Yummy The Sahale snacks were tasty They were nicely packaged but the quantity was very little 
Best new snack around They re delicious nutrious and far more flavorful than most healthy snacks on the market For those who like spice and exotic flavors these are sure to quickly become a favorite I also really love the 2oz size as it is just enough to really feel satisfied and not so much that you eat more than you should I am hooked 
Nice Mild Mint tea Very nice mild mint tea Mellow with a nice rounded flavor I highly enjoy this and have it often 
Millstone Foglifter Every one at work loves it It has a wonderful full flavor without being bitter 
Pumpkin Seed Delight These are a great snack The pumpkin seeds are fresh and lightly marinated in Tamari They satisfy a salt craving without being too salty or damaging to the diet They re also a great source of fiber for those who are improving their diets We love them and have even introduced them to other family members who were surprised by how good they were I was also pleased by how quickly they were shipped to us We had them within 4 days even though we used standard shipping 
Real Strawberry These toaster pastries are very very good These are filled with real strawberries and not that sugary sweet junk found in poptarts You can feel good about letting your family have these for breakfast or a snack 
Incredible These pastries are one of the most delicious I have ever eaten The strawberry taste is incredible and the final appearance is excellent It is appropriate for guests and private parties The amount is quite a lot and you may indulge for a long time especially because it is organic and healthy I am very very pleased with this purchase 
Fabulous I love these cookies They have such great flavor texture and are moist 
Delicious but beware of expiration dates These cookies are great a perfect breakfast when you re on the go My only concern about ordering them from Amazon again is experation dates I ordered a 24 pack of Oatmeal Raisin and a 24 pack of Fruit Nut The Fruit Nut s expired 3 weeks after shipment and the Oatmeal Raisin expired 5 6 weeks from shipment I don t plan on eating them quite that fast so I ll have a bunch of expired cookies on my hands I ve got them in the freezer so hopefully that ll do the trick but beware nonetheless They re much cheaper here than at the Baker s website 12 for 15 vs 24 for 18 so if you don t plan on eating 2 a day order them one pack at a time Baker s site does have a vastly wider selection so maybe try them all first then order from Amazon 
Chewy and fruity I m usually wary of food billed as all natural as that often means tastes kind of gross and has a weird consistency and mouth feel but I decided that if I didn t like these I could leave them at the office so I ordered them anyway Fortunately they re very good chewy and sweet without being overbearing It s a good alternative to those super tiny breakfast bars it s not filling but it s not insubstantial either One or two of these a yogurt and a cup of coffee or tea could be enough especially if you re not into eating much for breakfast Otherwise it makes a very nice snack The only downside is that I got these on 11 21 06 and the expiration date stamped on the first one I tried is 12 10 06 I plan on eating two a day so I should run through 24 quickly enough and if you re feeding a family it won t be a problem but if you re just getting them for yourself and plan on only eating them every now and then you may end up with a few that will go stale or expire It s just something to bear in mind when ordering them so that you don t order too many at once and then have them go bad on you 
Excellent breakfast food or snack I first ordered the chocolate and oatmeal raisin cookies but we really like the fruit and nut Altogether a great product to keep in the freezer for a quick breakfast I have eaten them in place of my normal breakfast bar 5 points on weight watchers my kids enjoy them as a healthy snack 
Absolutely Delicious After visiting a local store happen to buy a box and try it out It was absolutely delicious Proceeded to hop online to see what prices were available and Amazon had the lowest free shipping too and bought 16 boxes Use it for everything from the topping on pies oatmeal cookies to just bake it in the oven and stick it in a bowl for substitute popcorn 
Very good Consider cooking in milk instead of water I m not ashamed to admit it I like my rice pudding creamy and decadent My first batch of this had the right texture but I found the taste somewhat lacking It had a sugar water quality to it not very creamy at all despite the fact that the mix contains milk ingredients So with the next batch I substituted 1 milk for water and the result was much more satisfying thicker richer and more pudding like I also made mine in a double boiler which I would recommende Takes slightly longer to cook but you re much less likely to scorch the product I think it makes for a thicker pudding also 
Light pleasant taste It s light pleasant taste makes it easy to drink Delicious hot or cold Healthy I highly recommend it 
Melitta coffee pods Very nice flavor and of course they stay fresh Nicer flavor than I got from my Flavia machine 
Very handy Our son is an extremely picky eater and almost never wants to buy the school lunch These make a really convenient substitue for sandwiches every day We pack a cereal a fruit and extra milk money He can pour the milk right into the cereal container and throw the whole thing away when he s done eating Takes 10 second to pack his lunch which is great for the morning rush 
USDA Organic and made in Finland Best licorice on the market I don t normally like licorice but I was looking for organic products that I could eat and this stuff is good Normally when I think of licorice I think of real sticky or overly chewy This is really tasty and has just the right tecture If I had to nit pick I would say that the pakaging could be of the new aluminum bags that a German company develops that is non plastic because plastic may not be safe for packaging food products but as far as what s available I recomend it with the highest rating No cancer causing anti caking agents that they use in salt at least that s what der label says Again it has the highest standard of Organic which is USDA certified Placing 2nd order 
Yummy Licorice Great stuff True Licorice with Molasses These are a good value however I noticed that the bars went up in price since I put them in my cart I m just too slow to order I suppose 
The best licorice I have ever tasted This is real licorice not the licorice flavored candy you get in US supermarkets The flavor is very strong compared to what you find in the supermarket and it is more dense and chewy If you love licorice you will love this This Finnish licorice is NOT salty 
perfect Purfect for my cookies salads and cakes They are our favorite for cooking because they are attractive enough to decorate baked goods as well as tasty when crushed and stirred into foods 
BEST EVER THE DELIVERY WAS FAST AND EVERYTHING WAS IN PERFECT ORDER WHEN I RECEIVED MY ORDE 
Great Crackers I like these crackers so much that I have to buy them by the case They re also healthy no hydrogenated oils and no trans fats 
Great crackers Quite a few broken in shipping though We really like these crackers I was a bit disappointed that about half of the crackers were broken by the time they arrived at our door I think I may just have to buy them from the store next time 
A great discovery I was just sent four of the Sahale nut mixes I really enjoyed the Ksar blend I like the use of ingredients it s fun to see what tastes good together that you wouldn t normally eat I have one more to try but I think this one is my favorite Very good 
Shopper Online These nuts are great for a quick snack My husband really likes them 
Delicious and Fast HEALTHY CHOICE SOUPS WHICH ARE MICROWABLE ARE VERY DELICI0US AND NUTRITIOUS AND QUICK TO HEAT UP 
Perfect Good soup taste just like the canned healthy choice Easy to use and is plump full with noodles and chicken 
It is not a candy The product may look like some kind of sweet treat but it is not Taste is somewhat bitter from cocoa and somewhat sour from fruit there is a very little of sweetnes I think it is not tasting like you would expect from the looks and that is why all the disappointment comes from It is just different We call it fake candy and enjoy with tea very nice healthy un desert 
Delicious Healthy filling this satisfies the craving for a truly rich dessert Craving chocolate Something chewy Sweet It absolutely hits the mark The nuts do not overwhelm the taste of it they are chopped small and just enough to complement I am so glad I ordered this box I am sending one home to Mom too More proof that vegans can have it all 
Delicious These dry roasted almonds are absolutely delicious and make a nice addition to any gift basket christmas stocking or everyday lunch bag However this product will not meet the needs of someone looking for an All Natural product The Amazon ad should be updated to exclude that sentence If you re looking for a delicious savory snack that s high in protien but is a little different than run of the mill almonds you ll enjoy these 
My favorite I have tried lots of different K cups but I always come back to this one It is my favorite I like my coffee strong rich tasting and that is what San Lorenzo is 
A surprisingly good coffee Amazing for a pre packaged K cup coffee Forms a light frothy head when brewed and has a deep strong flavor devoid of any bitterness or burnt taste Strongly reminiscient of coffee you might order in a Parisian cafe 
New to kcups I have tried about 10 different kinds of kcups and this is our favorite 
Simply Super Succulent Salivating Strawberries These get five stars Can t believe how delicious these strawberries are Use them on my cereal every morning and love the flavor and consistency Am now going to purchase more 
long time consumer We re always looking for healthier alternatives to carbo and sugar loaded snacks for ourselves and our kids Jerkey is one they seem to really like as do we I have been a long time consumer of SnackMaster s Turkey and Beef Jerky Unfortunately my grocery store stopped carrying it so I decided to order it online If you check the ingredients of SnackMaster s Jerky there are fewer chemicals and preservatives then other leading brands of Jerky That s why we continue to be satisfied customers 
Greatest Turkey Jerky Ever Love this stuff I was delighted to find it available on Amazon It s excellentjerky and even a healthy snack Delivery was fast and accurate 
Excellent R C Bigelow Inc was begun in 1945 by Ruth Campbell Bigelow a tea connoisseur who wanted to offer even more taste opportunities to American tea drinkers Among the teas that Bigelow presents is their wonderful Green Tea Green tea is now very popular due to its antioxidants and other health benefits Overall I found this to be an excellent hot tea with a wonderful smell and taste But that s not all Bilgelow s Green Tea also makes a great iced tea So if you are looking for a delicious and healthy green tea one that tastes great hot and cold then get this one I highly recommend it By the way check out the interesting recipes on Bigelow s website 
A very tasty variety of peanuts The product arrived promptly and in good condition I liked the convenient sized containers The peanuts were fresh and not broken into small pieces I am enjoying them daily and highly recommend them to those who like peanuts Bill Lebu 
Good low calorie dessert This pudding is very easy to make done in about 5 minutes The texture is not as good as a cooked pudding but it s acceptable The chocolate flavor is very good better than the regular chocolate flavor The combination of low calories and simple preparation makes it a winner in my book 
Pudding This is the 3rd case of Jello Instant Sugar Free Pudding I ve purcased in the last month and it continues to be the best quality and price of any supermarket that I have shopped I will continue to purchase this item from Amazon com jaypaul 
Crunchy with fiber Spelt pretzels with fiber are hard to come by Organic to boot My family used to eat Vita Spelt until I realized there was no fiber in them and they weren t organic Much cheaper on Amazon than in Whole Foods 
All Gone Everyone loved these pretzels Very flavorful not too salty I plan on buying more from Amazon best price I ve found on this brand 
Great Pretzels and I love pretzels These Pretzels are great I needed an alternative to wheat and found these spelt pretzels I had them prior to ordering them on Amazon so I knew to expect they d be awesome Several family and friends have tasted them and can t tell any difference to pretzels made with wheat However I like these spelt pretzels better than your average wheat pretzel I don t like too much salt and I found these pretzels average on the salt factor Like every other bag of pretzels the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me The only thing I don t like is that in the ingredients list they say made with Organic Spelt and also Spelt While they meet the standard to label their product organic they should use ALL Organic Spelt 
Protein and Fiber and Taste Really Good I was attracted to these because they have more fiber than most along with more protein I think they taste great 
I was missing one of the three cans I ordered I e mailed customer service and told them my problem and they wrote back telling me they could not ship just one can and they would ship me three more and I could return the two I had gotten They then said to go to a site and print a return label which the site would not let me do as none of the items I bought on that order were returnable They then asked me to tell them whether or not their answer solved my problem I checked no and have never heard from them again on the subject 
Smart Money packs in the flavor Smart Monkey is my favorite brand of raw food bars They have so much flavor compared to the brands you find in the grocery store Well done to whomever came up with the recipe you ARE a smart monkey 
Great taste I recieved the variety pack today and tried this flavor first I buy natural snacks for my kids freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar but I find them bland So I ordered these and I love them In fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it it wasn t too spicy for her You can tell they used hot spices but they are very well done so as to not be too much The nuts are big and crunchy and the fruit is small and chewy There is about equal of both nuts and fruit They do use evaporated cane juice and organic tapioca syrup but these are healthier than alternatives and there are still only 5 grams of sugar per 1 4 cup serving 
Pizza On The Go I love Jack Links they are a wonderful high protein snack and are very portable This particular flavor is awesome if you bite the pepperoni and cheese at the same time it tastes just like pizza 
Amazing I bought these for my daughers bday party But my husband and I wanted to try them first I may have to buy another box they are that good We both think they are better than conventional gummy bears Very soft and flavorful Perfect for young kids and us growns ups 
Great Cereal For a gluten free cereal the price and the taste are worth taking a look Taste great 
Gluten Free Excellent corn tast and crispy We like tese better than regular corn flakes 
My Favorite Tea Four cups every morning The taste texture and aroma cannot be beat especially at this price 
Start your day off with a kick I do not like coffee so this tea is a perfect way to jumpstart my day The price offered through Amazon is great too 
Twinings English Breakfast Tea Is the Best We were first introduced to Twinings when we lived in Australia for a year and one half As uncultivated Americans for us tea was tea We learned otherwise in the company of those who knew Now Twinings English Breakfast Tea is all we will buy It does not have the bitter taste common in most teas As the Aussies say It is smooth 
Tried and True My favorite tea and it is sometimes hard to find at the grocery store Now I have a stockpile with this big package I am in heaven 
English Breakfast Tea My husband is from England and Twinings is his favorite tea We have never found the larger boxes and occasionally our grocer is out of the smaller ones so we were delighted to find them on Amazon 
great service I can t always find this product in the stores and when I saw the new amazon gourmet I did a search Saw it and ordered 3 cases Thanks for the great service Would order again 
Awesome When I was younger the only tea readily available in my area was Lipton orange pekoe It was okay but not great and very easy to over steep causing a bitter cup of tea One day while traveling in Canada I tried Twinings English Breakfast Tea It was so good that I purchased a large amount of it to take home Now it is readily available and the English Breakfast Tea is still my favorite Every other Twinings tea has been very good but I always return to my favorite You can read in the other reviews about the flavor It is a robust full flavored tea that only turns bitter after grossly over steeping There are some very bad brands of tea out there and a lot of good brands but as far as I am concerned Twinings is by far the best 
my step son thanked me My step son is in the USAF and we got this for his birthday He actually called and said thanks He said they were very good 
Can t afford Illy Try Lavazza Great coffee great price go for it Espresso lovers 
Awesome coffee As its decaf twin great coffee for expresso machine or works great with normal coffee pot too Give Starbucks a good bye for a good buy 
Good Italian coffee at a low price I first tried Lavazza Oro in Italy and I really loved it I bought this because I didn t have a coffee grinder at the time and this was the only one that was preground and shipped through Amazon It tastes very good much better than Charbucks and much cheaper too and imported straight from Italy 
A great way to start the day I think this brand of espresso T Discs trumps all the others through taste body and color I usually have a double to get me going in the morning and this system is much faster and way cheaper than going to the corner starbuck s I recommend buying the Tassimo T Disc Coffee Machine System first and stock up on these bad boys for this great price Plus these are not widely available yet in my area and I ve got to go to a specialty shop to find any 
We Love our Machine We got our machine for Christmas and use it all the time We really like the expresso 
Green Tea Slim Life I like this tea as well as other yogi teas Delicate flavor and it does help me not to snack between meals 
Snacker crackers I have 3 kids and was looking for crackers for my kids and my snacker husband that have no additives no sugar whole wheat and are suitable for snacking I love these crackers and can safely leave them out on the counter for snacking No sugar means they don t get devoured They are very crunchy which can be kind of weird at first it also keeps you from eating 50 but there is nothing like a plate of these with a tiny slice of swiss cheese All my kids eat them but my mom doesn t really like them Everyone else seems to like them I should warn you that my kids are good eaters A super fussy eater probably won t eat them 
Great Flavor Natural and Crispy This is a great snack or entertaining product You gotta love the crunch 
Average Deal SLOW Shipping If you like stocking up on cereal and hate carrying all of those groceries in Then this is for you My ONLY complaint is shipping was a little long for this item 2 weeks 
IF YOU USE IT RIGHT YOU CANNOT GO WRONG I used this gluten substitute to make the best sugar cookies my kids have had since they were diagnosed You only use 1 part of the gluten substitute to 5 parts of gluten free flour My first batch I used the same amount as for xantham gum and they did not come out right then I did the math 20 grams substitute 100 grams flour and realized DUH 1 part to 5 parts and tried again OUTSTANDING RESULTS Naysayers read the directions do the math and try again you won t be disappointed 
Shock Coffee is an Eye Opener For me Shock Coffee has a fine roasty flavor It certainly DOES give you a boost and a large one I am an Arabica bean gal but I really don t taste the common Robusta bitterness Not at all What I do get is a full bodied start with a smooth finish I really like it The Shock a lots are awesome too 
Very Tasty But Not What I Expected This product is very good but my wife and I agreed that it was impossible to tell you were eating sweet potatoes rather than regular potatoes I expected the flavor to be distinguishable Oh well The only other caution is to not overcook this product It will start to get mushy That may be characteristic of any gnochhi but I thought I would include this point as well 
whole wheat gnocchi Wow I cant beleive this find Whole wheat gnocchi with sweat potato what a great combination Cooks fast can add white sauce red sauce or plain with a spinkle of vegan parmasean cheese The price is great for a case Free shipping cant beat that 
one of the Best Sahale makes several nut mixes but the Valdosta blend is one of the Best Just enough pepper and sweet to satisfy with a small handful We always keep it on hand 
I love this stuff and I am addicted so fresh and flavorful I will buy this over and over and try some of the other varieties the Valdosta blend sounded strage but tasted like heaven 
EXCELLENT NUT BLEND UNIQUE FLAVORS These mixes are very tasty as well as healthy I d rank Valdosta the number 1 variety The price is high for just five ounces My rating is based strictly on the product itself not the price 
yummy this is a perfect snack for a person who is on the go I m pregnant and I am addicted yummmmmmm The pecans have a wonderful glaze with a peppery finish and the cranberries are a sweet chewy compliment DELICIOUS 
Good Stuff We have really enjoyed these unusual snacks We first got the variety mix and they were all pretty good but this mix is off the chart No need to put these in a resealable bag they just don t get that far I keep thinking how good they would be added to a meal as garnish or a salad We truly love them Thanks Guys 
Love this flavor I bought the variety pack and tried this flavor third see my reviews for Socorro and Soledad I buy natural snacks for my kids freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar but I find them bland So I ordered these and I love this flavor In fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it it wasn t too spicy for her They use black pepper which is flavorful but I wouldn t call it spicy The nuts are big and crunchy and the fruit is small and chewy There is about equal of both nuts and fruit Valdosta has 7 grams of sugar in a 1 4 cup serving 
Truly delicious decadent coffee I was skeptical at first could we commit to three bags of a coffee we d never tried but the Organic Mocha Java won us over at first taste Rich but not overpowering dark but not bitter it is among the very best coffee we ve had the pleasure of drinking I ll never crave Starbucks again 
Numi Morning Rise Breakfast Blend Tea This is an absolutely lovely tea blend I drink it with milk and a little splenda and the taste holds up beautifully It has quickly become my weekend and special occasion tea because it costs more than plain old Lipton I m thrilled to find it here on Amazon 
A smooth subtle blend Numi has created a breakfast blend with four of the most popular black teas Keemun Assam Ceylon and Darjeeling The aroma is a fine grassy floral tea blend The leading flavor is Keemun a malty slightly smoky flavor This is a smooth subtle cup of tea without some of the more characteristic robustness of most Breakfast blends However it is still a very stimulating blend fairly high in caffeine I would guess from its effect Unfortunately Numi does not list caffeine count on the box Numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging The boxes containing their tea is made from 100 recycled paperboard from 100 post consumer waste they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2 040 trees reduce landfill by 131 200 and prevent 184 000 greenhouse emissions Numi uses only 100 natural ingredients without added oils or natural flavorings 
Superb Black Tea Blend Caffeinated Numi Tea s Morning Rise Breakfast Blend Black Tea is a premium Numi tea both certified organic and kosher The ingredients are fair trade certified organic Keemun black tea fair trade certified organic Darjeeling black tea fair trade certified organic Ceylon black tea anfair trade certified organic Assam black tea A powerful black tea blend indeed There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea On the box the manufacturer writes Numi perfects the classic breakfast tea with this organic black tea blend Morning Rise Four of the most extraordinary black teas compose this hearty complex and exciting morning cup Ceylon gardened in the small and exotic country of Sri Lanka bestows its strong yet smooth profile while Indian grown Assam imparts a malty and robust depth Keemun from China offers deep burgundy notes that complement the natural floral finish and fruity Muscatel of Darjeeling cultivated on the mountain peaks of India This rich bold black tea blend has an unrivaled smoothness and a magnificent aroma resembling dawn s early warmth Let the morning greet you through the radiant daybreak of Numi s superior Breakfast Blend It tastes strong and and is perfect for people who want a black tea that is not flowery or herbal y but tasty complex and superb high quality in the morning The price is perfect a big savings over single boxes If you like Numi teas get it you won t be sorry If you are new to Numi but love black tea this will probably be the best you ve ever had 
Lucious sweet Many blueberries fresh frozen or dried are pretty tasteless So I always buy a bunch when I find some that taste good And these are consistently great Lots of sweet blueberry taste Not as organic as I claim to like in that they ve added blueberry juice and sweetner but the effect is wonderful 
great product but a little sweet it would have been better if there was no sugar adde 
Taste s GREAT I love this Rasberry Lemonaide Crystal Light I have tried all the flavors to date and this one tastes best by far 
Great chili from a can Or from scratch for that matter The turkey is tasty I didn t miss the beef a bit I mix it with brown rice for an easy meal 
rishi tea The delivery was so efficient and prompt The tea itself is fabulous It will be hard to get back to a regular tea bag There is no comparison Thank you I will be a regular customer of this product 
The only difference is the price What can I say about Diamond Walnuts They are sold everywhere and these are just what you would get in the grocery store only cheape 
Diamond Walnuts 16 oz pkg Honestly I was a bit skeptical on ordering nuts online Mainly for fear they would not be as fresh AND they would be broken via the shipping process I am a baker year round and quality is of highest inportance to me I am THRILLED to tell anyone else with these concerns these nuts not only arrived quite fresh with a long expire date but so well packaged breakage was of normal expectation quite minimal no more than if you picked them from a shelf at a grocery Even though I chose free shipping which can take a bit longer they arrived in no time at all I will not hesitate to continue ordering my baking needs from Amazon com 
good walnuts good quality no problems with product or delivery in fact they arrived quicker than I thought they would Economica 
Almost like candy tasty These are really delish It s like eating one of those peanut candy rolls with the nouget If you love peanuts you will enjoy these I didn t buy them for sports but just because I felt they were healthier than cookies as a snack I would still be eating them if I hadn t discovered they have wheat in them I m allergic to wheat 
Me likey I m a granola bar fan and I tried these recently and really like them Had one for breakfast about five minutes ago as a matter of fact I can imagine a better granola bar but it s pretty dang good If you re like me you like to pack a variety of bars for camping hiking road trips so as to not fall victim to monotonous granola These are definitely a good addition to your bar repertoire 
Almost as good as chocolate I love this item The strawberries and bananas are nice and crunchy and sweet with the tang of the strawberries complementing the sweetness of the bananas Eating this is addictive but at least you can rest assured you re addicted to something healty low calorie and delicious 
Great dried fruit Excellent used in cereal The strawberry flavor predominates A great combo of 2 fruits A satisfying taste sensation 
Healthy Start I am a firm believer in the benefits of herbals This tea has a pleasant taste and is as easy to prepare as any tea It gives me the ability to cleanse from the inside out 
A Welcome Change I wasn t sure about this tea at first because I had tried several other teas that contained licorice that were just too sweet for me However I m pleasantly surprized by the light tangy flavor of this tea The sweetness is there but it s not overwhelming I m not certain that it s done much for me in relation to detox but I certainly like the taste especially after lunch It seems to settle my stomach and help me digest 
great aroma I just recently started drinking this tea and thoroughly enjoy the taste and the aroma It is very strong and different from the other teas I drink I recommend it heartily 
Fantastic I love sesame seed oil it taste FANTASTICALLY good If you like japanese seaweed salad you like fabulous taste and smell of the dressing this oil is for you 
La Tourangelle Toasted Sesame Oil this product has a rich and nutty taste and is a versatile cooking aid I ve used it to make salad dressing frying vegetables and enhancing other flavorings and sauces It s uses are endless and I m happy to add this to my kitchen needs 
excellent with fish This is a great oil and works well with asian style cuisine It s an excellent addition in a marinade with worchestershire sp maple syrup chiles and seseme seeds 
Delicious Cheese Crackers made without hydrogenated oils which is a good thing since it s difficult for our bodies to absorb trans fatty acids that come from hydrogenated oils box These are definitely natural snack crackers to bounce around about I mean it is so rare to find even natural foods without hydrogenated oils I can t count the times I ve read labels only to be disappointed to find that natural does not always mean healthy Ingredients Certified organic wheat flour expeller pressed safflower oil aged cheddar cheese contains milk salt enzymes cheese culture salt yeast extract paprika annatto extract for color ground celery seed onion powder yeast I ve made my own cheese crackers and these really do taste homemade About 24 tiny crackers will satisfy any cheese cracker craving and that is about 70 calories These crackers are Bernie the Bunny Annie s beloved mascot approved They are also made with only vegetarian ingredients Each cracker is the cutest bunny shape The Rebecca Review 
A fun healthy snack My 6 year old my 1 year old love these bunnies They are a much healthier alternative to Goldfish without the transfats colours The pricing was also good when compared to the supermarket price if you are able to get free shipping 
Kids Love These My kids love these They are a great alternative to goldfish I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it used a healthier oil instead of safflower 
Yummy gluten free cereal bar Although I didn t LOVE this product I don t like cereal bars anyway it was a good substitute for those on a GF diet My son 15 mos old loves these bars and eats them almost every day Very good healthy and you cannot tell it s gluten free 
Excellent My 5 y o daughter loves these Pricey but these are so good for on the go snacks They taste great too They are a little thicker than Nutra Grain bars but after going 8 months w o them my daughter doesn t know the difference We always have these on hand for car trips or feild trips 
Very Good Me and my brother have PKU so we are on a low protein diet We really liked these pizzas 
Amazing french toast bread My boyfriend has Celiac s and hasn t had french toast in years I made the bread in the bread maker the day before and it was absolutely perfect I don t have any problems with gluten but I still think I would prefer this bread for french toast any day It cuts better than fresh baked regular bread as well meaning it won t collapse in on itself I am looking forward to making more of it and experimenting with other receipes 
Real Bread This bread deserves rave reveiws Reliable results even texture Makes a beautiful classic grilled cheese on white Success with bread machine Watch out for the metric to standard conversion on the liquid amount We almost put in half the liquid on the first loaf we adjusted it roughly and the loaf still came out I think in some areas desert high altitude the liquid my need to be fudged up a little Experiment have fun Tucson Danny Sonoran Desert Elevation 2800ft 
Great gluten yeast free bread that actually rises Wow It s so nice to have a bread mix that tastes good and is spongy My 6 yr old son loves this bread 
YES Finally available to us celiacs Very nice springy bread a bit bland but who cares THANK YOU to ORGRAN and THANK YOU to AMAZON for carrying it Works beautifully for hotdog and hamburger buns as well I only wish I had known about this six years ago 
Absolutely delicious and addictive One of the best store bought cookies I ve ever tasted and I m a very choosy chocolate lover 
Delicious Don t be turned off by the healthy label These cookies actually taste good 
Good crumbs These have a pretty good texture IMO It is nice for me to find one without some of the other things I m allergic too I usually add some seasoning and use them for chicken nuggets 
The BEST saltines hands down These crackers are the best tasting saltines we ve ever had We LOVE them They are light not too salty with a delicate smattering of olive oil The ingredient list is short only four items I buy them by the case for our family of four and they don t stick around long enough to get stale They are GREAT to take along to a party if you re serving crackers and cheese I strongly recommend them 
Great organic crackers at a good price I ordered these crackers about two weeks ago not knowing how they would be Turns out they are delicious A little plain tasting which was expected with just the right amount of salt for my tastes and a subtle but pleasant hint of olive oil They seem to go very well with several cheeses soup and on their own too I recommend them to anyone who likes Saltines or other plain salted crackers however I find these to be significantly less salty than Saltines Enjoy 
I ve been waiting for this I am a dark chocolate lover and have long wished that there were an instant cocoa mix flavored with dark chocolate I was very happily surprised to find Dark Chocolate Sensation at my grocer s last week but after actually having a cup I began to get very worried So many times in the past I have been disappointed by the unexplained disappearance of a product which I loved and purchased faithfully I do not want this to happen again but just in case it does I am stocking up all the Dark Chocolate Sensation I can find Whenever I go shopping I go to every store in the area just to get all their DCS cocoa mix PLEASE KEEP PROVIDING IT FOR ALL DARK CHOCOLATE LOVERS WE ARE LEGION 
tasty and nasty Good flavour easy to use way too much food colouring It stained fingers tongues mouths and clothes quite badly 
Pretty tasty I bought these without trying this particular flavor Aren t I brave You get a pack of 60 no less This is a thick and somewhat tasty blueberry flavored fruit bar Much thicker than a fruit rollup but not as thick as a granola bar the texture is quite pleasing and very chewy Flavor is decent and complex not just blueberry With the product tag line of an apple in each bar it s no wonder I taste apple along with some other flavors I can t put my finger on This would be good for a snack or when craving something sweet But I don t expect it to tide me over until a meal I hope it replaces my need for chocolate to satiate my sweet tooth It better I have 60 no wait 59 
yummy and healthy they re a quick fix and they taste incredible best protein bar around 
Very Good Tastes too good to actually be healthy Sound too good to be true I thought so but it is really true Nice job Kashi If you have never eaten Kashi products you are in for a treat There are some I like better than others but for food that is good for you it is a pleasant surprise 
Add your own fresh fruit to Special K rather than eating these colored apple pieces I have always liked Special K Nowadays it is all about brand extension So they add some things to the basic cereal so you don t have to add your own banana or berries While I enjoyed the taste of the sample I was given my advice is to go with the basic cereal and add your own fresh fruit The fruit here and the box shows pictures of berries is really made of apple pieces that are colored and artificially flavored to taste like some kind of vague berry taste If you find adding your own fruit too troublesome well this is a good and tasty choice 
Crunchy Yogurty Goodness My girlfriend has been eating Special K and I decided to start the Special K diet too We recently both tried the Fruit Yogurt variation and it s definately my favorite of the variations On a side note I seem to be pooping less and feeling less full Which is great I spend way too much time in there reading books anyways Im happy my girlfriend is happy and everything is fine and dandy Life is great but Special K is better

Best berries I use freeze dried strawberries to make Strawberries Romanov candy and these are the best ones I have ever used They are all uniform quality and taste wonderful 
Gone in 60 seconds The dieter who couldn t eat a whole package in a day must have been eating these tasty little gems one by one with a break inbetween each bite Not my family We would each take a handful for a snack and before we knew it the bag was empty But enough about the bag These things are tasty and provide a concentrated strawberry punch of flavor which makes strawberry flavored items taste lame With these you get the whole range of flavors in a strawberry sweet without being too sweet and none of the acidic taste that you sometimes get in an underripe berry The dried fruit is very crunchy without any of the gumminess that shows the manufacturer removed them from the dehydrator too early My only beef is the price although I understand why they are so expensive When I dried fruit it took many pints of cleaned stemmed and sliced berries to come up with a respectable amount of food My family was always finished with one batch long before the next before the next was ready When I consider the effort involved these snacks are probably underpriced But it still hurts to see an expensive packet gone before the commercials are over 
Great alternative to Rice Krispies Both my 2 yr old and my husband like this cereal a lot And I didn t even mind it when I had to eat GF for a short time I love to use it as a bread crumb for chicken nuggets or fried chicken I just pop it in the blender and get it really fine It has a nice sweet taste to it which makes it perfect for breading I only wish that it had some more nutrients in it 
Nice smooth espresso My favorite coffee changed their beans and I no longer liked it so I have been looking for a new brand Out of 4 I tried this one is the best Some of the brands I tried just didn t have that real Espresso flavor This one does 
EXCELLENT TASTE SUPERB DEAL ON THESE COFFEE BEANS Delicious are these fresh and beautifully roasted dark coffee beans with free shipping This 5 pound bag of strong coffee will go a very long way A great bargain too 
The best vegetarian seasoning so I thought As a fussy vegetarian I have tried many vegetarian seasonings to use with my homemade soups and this is the BEST Update One star I had based my previous 5 star review on the taste and the natural ingredients Well after receiving my shipment and reading the label I was disappointed to find Nutritional Yeast Extract as the number one ingredient From my research Nutritional Yeast is good for you but Nutritional Yeast Extract is not good for you in fact Nutritional Yeast Extract has the same negative effect on your body as MSG So even though the taste is great I won t be recommending this product any more 
Good Stuff I ve been using this for a couple of months I usually have a small mug of broth in the evening with slightly less than a teaspoon of mix in 8 10 ounces of boiling water Very refreshing and only about five calories a serving I haven t counted how many servings per cannister I get but I would guess that it is at least the 40 indicated on the label so this works out to be a very inexpensive as well as refreshing drink I ve also used it a couple of times in rice cooking water and it is very tasty if not quite up to my home made vegetable broth for this purpose It s a lot easier of course 
we enjoy the flavor and convenience my wife and I enjoy cooking and we found this to be a convenient alternative for our pantry shelf 
Excellent flavor could be a little more sour In the last year I ve developed a real yen for these sour chewy candies I ve sampled about a half dozen varieties of sour worms including the bulk tubs sold at the grocery store Blockbuster CVS etc Some taste quite synthetic but these Harmony worms immediately impressed me with their pleasing almost fragrant fruit flavors However they barely qualify as sour quite mild on that scale so I nicked them one star on their rating Be careful to never leave these in a car on a warm day even slightly warm day They melt into a solid mass very easily 
22 25 for 8 cans I love boysenberries blackberries and mulberries Mm mm Mm the darker the gentler The light syrup is not too sweet so I don t mind spooning it in along with the berries The berries are mushier than firm but not mush and still somewhat shapely It was not difficult to finish a can 
Fruit heaven One can sells for 3 39 at my local grocery store so with this special it s about 2 16 can for 2 8 packs What a bargain w FS The fruit is soooooo tasty I usually buy frozen but this canned is better so I ve converted I confess I eventually ate a whole can during one evening as a healthy plain fruit dessert since I kept going back for seconds a few times Truly the next best thing to fresh 
Delicious Not too coconutty I bought these based on the great reviews and I can say I am not disappointed When I brewed my first cup there was an overwhelming scent of coconut so I was a little worried it would be too coconutty I m happy to say that it s the perfect blend of chocolate and coconut neither taste outdoes the other I will definitely buy this flavor again 
Excellent Delicious Very delicious chocolatey tasting coffee K cups are great A one cupper has never been easier 
Coconut In coffee YES I didn t know if I d like it but the coconut makes this coffee just a little sweeter than the average brew It s very subtle Great mid day snack without the guilt 
German Chocolate cake k cups Robust flavor Make the medium size and add heavy cream as it pours into cup Wonderful aroma also Great cup of coffee 
desert and coffee all in one My husband drinks this every evening after diner He says it is like a desert without the calories I do not drink flavored coffee as I don t like it but if you are one that does I urge you to give this one a try 
Great Caramel hull less popcorn Very good snack to take to work with your lunch or pack in your child s lunch box Fair price for item 
Delicious caramel corn snack Wow this stuff is good If you like caramel corn you will love the Caramel Booty It s got a good amount of sugar in it so this is definitely not a low cal treat But compared to the heavy duty sugar on regular caramel corn this is much better not to mention easier on the teeth The caramel coating is much lighter so doesn t get all stuck to my teeth No added vitamins either like some of the other booty products have 
Great Cookies Wrong Time of Year The Lemon Iced Cookies are really yummy but don t order them during summer months My order melted in the hot summer sun or in transit into one big lump of iced cookies still edible but had to be chopped up in order to eat them I would rate them 5 stars otherwise 
My kids love these I have to admit I love these cookies too It s a crunchy lemon cookie in the shape of a polar bear covered in a white icing They are sweet and very yummy We took them on a picnic once and the icing got pretty soft but that still didn t keep the kids out of them 
Wonderfully easy transcation quick shipment This was an easy quick transaction This is my husband s favorite rice I will reorder 
Diabetic 4 yr old loves them My 4 yr old was recently diagnosed as a Type 1 diabetic As with most 4 yr olds she likes very few foods and wasn t getting an adequate supply of protein With the diabetes diagnosis it was evident to us that we had to find something fairly nutritious low in sugar and high in protein that she would eat or she would become hypoglycemic SHE LOVES THESE This is one of her daily snacks and she s now beginning to thrive 
Reboot your snack processors I wanted to give these soy crisps more justice than just the 5 stars and ordering them all the time I bought a bag of these Sea Salt flavor crisps and a bag of BBQ crisps about a month ago in a bid to eat more healthy food I ve always loved BBQ chips especially Ruffles and Lays K C Masterpiece chips but they ve got to be killing me slowly right So I busted open the BBQ soy crisps and gagged How could this be BBQ They tasted like cardboard and I gave them to my friends who will eat anything I begrudgingly opened the Sea Salt bag and though more palatable I was still disappointed I know I thought you said 5 stars It gets better Anyway I had sworn off chips and midday snacking so for two weeks I saw nothing on the counter but Genisoy Soy Crisps I d eat two or three here and there and when I ran out I bought 2 bags of the Sea Salt flavor again What happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive my body forgot what those strong BBQ flavored chips were like and I started craving Soy Crisps I began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars which I had completely missed before apparently because it wasn t a sweet red crusted overbearing BBQ powder I polished the next bags off in three days Now I m ordering 12 here on Amazon 1 cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food My advice is this give these soy crisps a chance but don t mix them in with your regular Doritos and BBQ Ruffles or you ll think they re awful Stop eating for a month the oily BBQ chips that have deadened your taste buds for years and reboot your taste buds with these markedly healthier chips You ll feel better about snacking 
Great Snack food I eat these when I m craving a crunchy salty snack instead of eating potato chips or popcorn They are a great guilt free snack when you are watching your weight Very tasty too 
I usually get these at the Health Food store but only on sale The every day Amazon case price is about the same as the sale price I ve been eating these for years and they are a very good source of protein Soy protein is about the best you can get LOw fat and carbs In 17 crisps you get 120 calories 25 from fat 17g total carbs 2g dietary fiber and 7g of protein ZERO Trans fat 0 Saturated fat and 270mg of sodium Much better than steak in my opinin After all you ll never hear of Mad Soy Bean desease 
Excellent Tea This brand of Jasmine Pearls is just as good as the brands available at Teavana and Whole Foods for 4 6 per ounce Absolutely no difference in taste or quality Highly recommended 
Heaven I tried this tea in the flowering combo that came with the teapot box Now I m here to buy it on its own It s the best in the assortment in my opinion Just as you take a sip the sweet scent of jasmine combines with the lush flavor and WOW A real delight The tea is very light and subtile yet strongly jasmine Then there s the flowering effect This is my favorite bloom of them all All these tiny little tea balls slowly unwind dancing under water swimming and growing until the pot is full of delightful little flowers Absolute perfection \ And it s good for your body and the planet o 
Bentley s White Tea We had wanted to try white tea so we chose a Bentley brand It is a wonderful tea and being on sale made it a great deal too My husband is now hooked on white tea and we will definitely buy it again Super service and packaged very well 
healthy bar that will leave you satisifed sounds nasty tastes good the bar will leave you feeling full or at least not starving without the nasty aftertaste 
Yummy This tastes really good The texture is unique light airy but crunchy at the same time It has 5g of protein per serving and 2g of fiber Great healthy snac 
Great taste This is an awesome tasting snack The cheapest place near us is Trader Joe s and they sell it for 1 50 Amazon is even cheaper You cannot just eat one we finish the whole bag each time we open it 
Green different and completely yummy If you judge this snack by the packaging you might never try them Baked pea pods don t exactly sound like the most appetizing or satisfying snack but these guys really deliver As one of the other reviewers said they are crunchy and light with a texture similar to Cheetos possibly a little more dense They have the taste of lightly salted snow peas only light and airy While they might not be as healthy as a raw or steamed vegetable they re a good alternative if you don t want all of the chemicals and sugars in most packaged snacks These guys have no sugar at all and the ingredient list is wholly recognizable I usually buy two bags at a time because they tend to go so fast Both flavors are delicious though I prefer the original Since it appears that Amazon is no longer carrying them you might try Wild Oats Trader Joes or Whole Foods if any of those are nearby 
I heartily agree with the other positive reviews This is one addictive snack and healthy to boot My kids love them as well I recommend both the original and the Caesar flavors 
Yummy GF cereal My first experience with this cereal was with a CASE of it from amazon so thank goodness it was good You d think it be hard to mess up gluten free rice cereal but believe me there are some awful ones out there This with the welcome addition of fruit is wonderful I ve never had freeze dried berries before either and they were tasty please make one with more blueberries I also bought the Erewhon brown rice cream if you re missing oatmeal for breakfast because you re sensitive to gluten try the brown rice cream with brown sugar and raisins it s actually pretty good I highly recommend this cereal 
The best no really it is Having purchase a box of the all american beef n cheese i have to say that it is by far the best jerky in all the land go links 
Good quality good taste I was a little wary about ordering jerky off the internet since I have never tried this brand before Not to worry this buffalo jerky is good quality and tastes great I will be ordering this again 
Healty Choice Soup Vegetable The soup is very tasty and offer a satisfying meal with bread and butter With white rice on the side you become creative by fixing a meal in less than 15 minutes Save time because I take care of the mentally ill 
Healthy Choice Vegetable soup I sent the case of soup to my daughter at college She loves the convienence of having her favorite homey soup to warm up in her apt Nice to send to college and no shipping a plus 
Greatest Soup Ever This is the best soup ever it has a classic taste to it You ve gotta try these but remember to follow the simple directions on how to make it 
Great Snacks I come from North Western part of the us Oregon we don t have these here I ordered one from another company and i loved them so I bought a case from amazon com They taste alot like funyuns they have a good crunch to them they are a good snack if your looking for a cheesey crunchy snack like i say they do taste like funyuns if you like funyuns you will definately love these chips 
I highly recommend this product for a healthier life I have tried so many artificial sweeteners I think they are all horrible Someone finally convinced me to try Splenda last year and it has made a huge difference in my life I just use Splenda in my coffee instead of sugar now and I have lost 20 lbs in the past 4 months At first I admit that my coffee didn t taste exactly the same as with sugar but it wasn t bad and it didn t taste like an artificial sweetener at all After I continued using nothing but Splenda in my coffee for a few weeks I couldn t imagine putting sugar in my coffee again I have now used it for about 4 or 5 months and I even carry a few packets around in my purse in case I need them when I m out I would highly recommend Splenda to anyone that uses sugar on a regular basis Just stick with it for a couple of weeks and you ll wonder how you did without it 
My favorite new sweetener At one time in my life I used the sweetener in the little blue packet then switched to the pink packet but NOW they tell me the yellow packet containing SPLENDA is the healthiest Since diabetes runs in my family I don t want to risk getting that disease or gaining too much weight so I hope they are right in promoting this product I ve been using it for about a year mostly on certain brands of cereal and my hot oatmeal It actually enhances the flavor of things I sprinkle it on and actually tastes like it s suppose to LIKE SUGAR And it leaves no artificial aftertaste which is a big plus with me I don t drink coffee and use no sweetener with my hot tea but it certainly helps to sweeten a big tall glass of iced tea on a hot summer day in California I recommend this above all sweeteners until someone else comes along proving they are wrong This seems to happen every other week in the food industry so how are we consumers supposed to know for sure the safest things to consume 
Tastes great and helps me maintain my weight I like using less sugar since I am using Splenda in my coffee most days It tastes like sugar but has no calories and it helps control my calorie intake 
better price than 400 count This 700 count box is cheaper to use than the 400 count splenda for big time users of Splenda Or share with a friend and save money Amazon does it again Convenient things all in one place 
Wonderful Green Tea Being an avid tea drinker I have found Numi Monkey King to be the best green tea It s smooth with a hint of sweetness comforting for the body and mind The price is probably the best I have found compared to everywhere else Definitely a tea worth stocking up 
Excellent Green Tea This Jasmine Green tea is one of the best I ve found Very smooth and round Best to use water that is not boiling hot and not to over steep Enjoy 
Just as good as I expected Jasmine taste is pronounced tea is refreshing it is as good as any Jasmine Green I have trie 
Exquisite Jasmine Tea Not To Be Missed Numi Tea s Monkey King Jasmine Green Tea is a premium Numi tea both certified organic and kosher The only ingredient is fair trade certified special grade green tea that is scented with real summer jasmine flowers from China There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea On the box the manufacturer writes Jasmine tea is the oldest known scented tea and ours begins its life in the gardens of Hunan Province The rich soil and fluctuations in daily temperature yield a fragrant leaf which is further scented with delicate white Jasmine blossoms During summer these are gathered daily by the banks of the Min River and repeatedly mated each night with the prepared tea naturally embracing all of the flowers scent When brewed this smooth organic green tea has layers of subtle fragrance and hints of moonlight It is a most romantic tea and like a bowl of fresh picked flowers will bring the joy of summer to your every sip It sounds quite romantic and it tastes wonderful It is a true jasmine tea and the taste of jasmine predominates in a both strong and lovely way The price is perfect a big savings over single boxes If you like Numi teas get it you won t be sorry If you are new to Numi but love jasmine green tea this will probably be the best you ve ever had 
The best macoroni I ve had yet on our Celiac diet This is very good The secret to cooking it is lots of water double what you would use with wheat macaroni Bring to boil then on low aprox 10 15 min taste it It also freezes well 
My three year old son loves them I have a three year old and a seven year old and they ask for one of these every day at snack time and love them I like them very much as well The peanut butter ones are a bit better than these but my son likes the pumpking better I m very excited to have found something healthy that the kids love to eat for a snack 
Edges out the other two variations by a hair This is the last of the three elbows with four cheese shells with aged wisconsin cheddar that I tried and I think it s better than the other two In all each variation is excellent but this white cheddar sauce is excellent and has a very distinct flavor My favorite addition to this is mushroom slices or whole small mushrooms seared in butter and garlic After letting them pick up a golden brown in the frying pan I douse them with vegetable broth just to get the flavor stuck to the pan off it and mix all that into the rotini and cheese sauce Mmmmm 
YUMMY After tasting a bowl of this Mac and Cheese i will never buy Kraft or any other big corporate mac and cheese again This is delicous and wholesome The white cheese is creamy and the organic grown noodles taste very fresh Me and my kids love it and will definitly be ordering more Highly recommend 
The Best Macaroni and Cheese ever I absolutely love this mac and cheese it is different from any other squeeze cheese style of mac and cheese i ve had as the cheese is white The cheese is soooo good I highly recomend this pasta And i really know my macaroni and cheese i consider myself something of a macaroni and cheese conesiur i ve tried nearly every kind of macaroni and cheese there is and this is by far my favorite This is excellent and i ve turned my friends onto this macaroni Now when they go to the store they are also buying it Just give it a try you won t regret it 
A Rich Flower Garden in Bloom A Ming Dynasty AD 1368 1644 creation believed to lower cholesterol and promote longevity jasmine tea consists of Chinese green tea leaves usually green teas from Fujian province which is also home to the semi fermented Oolong and smoky Lapsang Souchong scented with jasmine flowers Traditionally the flowers are harvested during the day and stored in a cool place until nightfall when they develop their full fragrance They are then layered over the tea leaves which have previously been steamed or heated to prevent their oxidation The tea s quality is determined both by the quality of the green tea used as its base and by the effectiveness of the scenting process Brewed it has a delicate silvery color and a rich fragrance reminiscent of a flower garden in bloom 
22 25 for 8 cans Canning and preserving is cheaper than farmer s market produce I like having this on hand instead of fruit cocktail for summer ices These are too tart to eat as easily as the boysenberries 
Wonderful Tea The tea included in this is wonderful Without a picture I didn t know what it was going to arrive in what kind of container and the little box is nothing to brag about so I wouldn t order it again I will order the tea again and the bamboo boxes which I have also received are a lot nicer than this little box 
Quick crunchy goodness This is a great snack that my husband and I both love I try to keep a variety of snacks at my desk so I always have something healthy on hand rather than going after the pizza donuts etc that seem to lurk in our office For someone eating on the go these dried fruits are great because they aren t perishable sticky or messy come in a super handy little pouch and the crunchy texture is a really nice change compared to most preserved fruits which typically are chewy or gummy 
Portable low calorie flavorischus These fruit snacks are the best low calorie extremely flavorful snacks in the world I eat the Orchard and Cherry Berry for breakfast at my desk every day The fruit is dried to a crunch not a gummy chew and the flavor has no aftertaste or funky smell Overall I love these snacks more than any other pre packaged food I carry them with me on trips and eat them at my desk or in my comfy chair at home Try them 
Better than I expected How can these taste so wonderful The ingredients are all fruit No sugar They are crunchy and so sweet My husband 16 year old son 2 year old daughter and myself all love them I was skeptical so I only ordered 1 case but now I will be ordering case after case 
AAA+ OUTSTANDING QUALITY TASTE AND CONVENIENCE I am especially pleased with this Rice I can t imagine how any food item could be more convenient to store or prepare And most importantly it taste quit good But taste is always very subjective Another recent reviewer didn t like the taste and I personally think that it s great It s also worth mentioning that it was delivered in only 3 days I placed my order Online on Monday night and UPS actually delivered it into my hands on Thursday morning Highly recommended 
Viva la Rice The flavor texture and ease of cooking 60 seconds WOW make this a product that my family uses a lot Rice to me needs to have the right texture and Viva La Rice has it It can also be brought to work as it doesn t have to be refrigerated and heated in a microwave 
Sweet mesquite Pretty good texture this jerky is made from whole pieces of buffalo and vary in tenderness I think the mesquite flavor is a touch too sweet though Overall a good product 
Dip them in chocolate and wow your friends These cookies are superb all by themselves Far superior to that other sandwich cookie in every way But if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence melt some Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Chips in your double boiler and dip these cookies then remove to a rack to dry Your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store and beg you for more Keep out of reach of children 
Leaves Oreos in the dust Been eating these for some time and couldn t pass up the good deal on Amazon as they can be pricey in the grocery store Rich chocolate flavor 
Great cookies at a great price Everyone in my family from 3 to 64 years old loves these organic cookies I purchased these cookies at several local stores before I discovered that Amazon had them I sent a package to my grandson who is in the Army in Iraq and he raved about them Newman s has another big winner 
High Sodium Tasty Cookies These high sodium ginger cookies are too tasty to have around you ll easily surpass your RDA of sodium in one sitting The nutrition facts that Amazon neglected to post are Serving size is 2 cookies 28 g Each serving has 160 mg of sodium 4 5 mg of fat 2 g saturated 0 g transfat 19 g of total carbs 10 g sugars and 0 g of cholesterol The ingredients in these Made in U S A cookies are organic unbleached wheat flour powdered sugar organic palm fruit oil organic molasses organic sugar sodium bicarbonate leavening ground ginger soy lecithin an emulsifier salt monocalcium phosphate leavening and nutmeg There are no hydrogentated oils or trans fats On the back of the package is an Ode to Ginger O s which reads You might m lady tweak my nose You could m lord step on my toes But Heaven help those poor bozos who try to filch my Ginger O s Again these high sodium cookies taste too good in order to effectively exercise self discipline to limit the quantity eaten 
Try the Ginger O s I do not like store bought cookies especially Oreos too dry and greasy for me But upon the recommendation of several people I tried the Ginger O s and was pleasantly surprised They have excellent flavor and the cream does not have that greasiness to it If you like ginger cookies don t hesitate to try these 
Original is great Wheat dairy free is a bit tough I love the Original Vanilla Creme Newman s O s so when I saw the Wheat Free Dairy Free on sale one day I picked one up I figured it would basically be the same as the Original The chocolate and vanilla tastes are great but I found the cookies themselves to be rock hard So unless you have an issue with wheat or dairy products I would recommend the Original Vanilla Creme and not the Wheat Free Dairy Free variety 
Good healthy granola bars Basically these are good granola bars and the cholesterol reducing ingredients are a side benefit for some They re chewy and the taste is comparable to other Nature Valley bars good but nothing amazing Since the price of these is also comparable to similar Nature Valley bars package contains 5 bars rather than 6 but they re each slightly bigger it s a pretty painless way to take a small step against high cholesterol The oats barley and raisins are all good healthy foods especially for those with high cholesterol This alone doesn t make them far healthier than many other typical bars They re special in the addition of plant sterols from my self education I understand them to be plant derivitives that have been shown to lower cholesterol if you eat enough I don t think they re particularly advised if you don t have unhealthy cholesterol levels though These aren t incredible but I m giving them 5 stars since it s hard to find something so convenient with health benefits still enjoyable and not much more expensive 
Ummm ummm good cherries These dried cherries are absolutely wonderful Wonder on oatmeal on cereal in cookies or anything else where raisens would do These cherries are better 
Simply Excellent Generally I don t care for the taste of dried fruit These cherries were a happy exception They are simply excellent a perfect combination of sweet and tart I enjoy eating them right out of the bag 
Best dried cherries I ve ever tasted Try them added to salads or in a baked chicken dish with a little soy sauce and toasted sesame oil Dried fruit is very different from fresh so don t expect it to taste the same these are kind of like a natural gummi Healthy snack Thanks 
Best meal of my life i LOVE Hamburger Helper Creamy Stroganoff it is the most delicious most satisfying heavenly treat i ve ever tasted it calls for a pound of ground beef you can put more or less to taste though of course it comes out best when you use 7 or better ground beef two pounds cause you are gonna have to make two packages yumm in my house we eat this three times a week when it s on sale sometimes i ll be so hungry i ll eat a whole package to myself i swear it s that good the only thing is if you follow the directions is doesn t come out looking like the picture to make it look like the picture you need to BOIL THE NOODLES FIRST then mix them with the flavor packets milk and cooked burger by the way leave at least a cup or more of the water don t completely strain the noodles this will only make it too dry 
Great Product Great Price As the title states this is a great product for any type of sugar replacement and the Amazon price is Great 
Excellent Among Raw Organic Sugars Turbinado s Raw Sugar is the best out of the many other brands I ve tried This product adds a natural sweet taste especially whith coffee Not overpowering just a smooth natural flavor 
The crystals do not melt I make the crunchy shortbread cookies from the recipe on the bag constantly This is a clean tasting sugar but it won t melt in brownies 12 packs is a lot but I am nearly half way through this order and have no regrets buying in bulk 
Very Pleasant I am not an expert on tea but I have quite a collection always looking for something good Having said that this tea is very good The flavor is sweet reminds me of dates honey and has a very slight malt flavor I m drinking some right now actually This tea is not bitter at all There is nothing exotic oe odd tasting about it a nice everyday tea like Earl Grey but it doesn t taste the same My father is a doctor and just came back from a medical conference about dieting He said that Oolong tea is very good to lower your blood sugar and help you lose weight when you drink it regularly So it s more than just a great tasting drink it s an aid to help you stay healthy 
Good eats even for a vegan My wife got some of these and loves em 
Great great stuff wonderful snack Looking for a late night snack that s not disgusting for your waistline Then be SURE to grab this This stuff is fabulous to just munch on in the evenings while watching TV on the computer whatever and it s inexpensive great for you and even reduces your cholesterol I like mine washed down with a diet Lime Coke but you might want to try some milk too Just give them to the kids sraight out of the box they just love to eat them too Beats potato chips and all the other fattening foods out there plus it s full of vitamins And at 110 calories a serving that s incredibly hard to beat Mix a few nuts and raisins in there too and well it s just great Highly highly recommend 
Name says it all lesser evil black and white This sweet treat is as they say a lesser evil It s not health food in that it s a sweet combination of vanilla and chocolate but it is much hearlthier than other carmel and chocolate popcorns out there just check the ingredients Other reviewers complaining about the nutritional fact panel or the health benefits of this product don t quite get it Some reviewers have noted that this is not kettle corn are correct Others who say this is half caramel corn miss the black and white across the front of the bag it s not caramel it s vanilla The chocolate half is delicious cocoa laden and therefore perfect when you want something light not chocolate dipped which would be overwhelming heavy and creamy The vanilla half is also not dipped heavy or overwhelming It s a lightly sweet plain corn taste to cleanse your palate for more chocolate People who love the New England tradition of black and white cabinets milkshakes frappes can t we all just get along will adore this popcorn People trying to avoid nasty chemical ingredients will appreciate this corn People who love subtle flavors will love this treat People who think Oreos are really good won t get this snack nor do people who weigh and measure every kernel because they re watching calories It s a sugary albeit natural sugar with no hydrogenated oils snack It s the lesser of all the evils out there and makes being nutritionaly bad feel really good 
Kettle Corn is salty The quality of this good but the Kettle Corn flavor did not do much for me I have had other kettle corn and liked it This was less sweet and more salt than what I prefer It s not bad I still manage to choke down the entire bag but it s not what I was hoping for Think I may still try the cinnamon though I hope I like that one better 
Highly addictive The chocolate is mild enough not to overwhelm but strong enough to sate a chocolate craving The kettle corn part really is just caramel corn but it s really good ESPECIALLY considering there is no corn syrup preservatives trans fats artificial flavors or gluten Compared to other snack foods I feel no guilt in eating this 
Mmmmmm Yummy I don t usually buy these kinds of things but couldn t pass it up when it was on sale a while back These tasty healthy treats are perfect for on the go I snack on them while I am at school Some fruits have more flavor than others Raspberries are probably my favorite Mmmmm my mouth is watering just thinking about them My only complaint is the price is a little pricey My girlfriend however doesn t like the tastey treat May not be for everyone Taste testing them somewhere could be advised although I am not sure where you could test them out 
MMM Crunchies Delicious Just what I was looking for Wishing to find its full panoply of offerings in stores so I don t have to buy in bulk 
Yummy For those of you like me who care These yummy snacks have about 140 Calories per package and one package is too much for one sitting Very yummy and sweet lo cal food to snack on 
Great Tasting I tried these at the local corner store and they taste great Since its a whole cashew and chocolate no artificial anything it is a nice snack treat Looking at Amazons price its cheaper per bag than if I bought them in the store and no tax a good deal 
booty Excellent Perfect size bags lots of booty always a good thing and not so much so that it goes stal 
GREAT COFFEE This is my husbands favorite coffee in our Keurig brewer I drink it black and it s never bitter and not too strong with the hazelnut taste Just right 
Great coffee Not entirely sure on how hyper caffeinated the coffee is but it does make a wonderful cup every morning Very satisfied with the produc 
KICK HAS A LITTLE KICK TO IT AND AS LARGE AS THE BAG IS A PERSON WOULD HARDLY RUN OUT 
When in college This coffee gets me through my 8am econ class The taste is much better than I expected too Highly recommended Plus the bag is enormous 
If you like coffee like i do Back in college I lived on coffee Drank cappucino til 2 in the morning to keep moving Would have been nice to have had this back in 94 
Yum And it s good for you too First time trying this and it s delicious It s super soft and chewy and tastes great It s almost as good as a rice crispy treat but it s better for you healthwise And to top it off it s organic One reviewer asked why add coconut It s hard to imagine apricot and nut and coconut but I love it It s not a strong artificial coconut flavor It s real organic coconut It s subtle and adds a nice smell and taste I will add a closeup of the nutrition facts in the customer images link above right underneath the main image Make your own educated purchase I haven t tried the other flavors but this one s so good I ll have to try a different flavor next These are great as breakfast bars 
Simply Delicious I am deployed to Iraq so I needed some healthy snacks I could take with me that were semi perishable I ordered these bars and couldn t be happier They are soft chewy and taste great The fact that they are organic and made from whole grains and other wholesome ingredients is a big plus These are a good substitute for a dessert especially when you are craving something sweet and chewy The only negitive for me was that Amazon will not ship to APO addresses so I had to ship these to my parents first for them to ship them to me 
Love these These are fantastic Not dry or bland like some granola bars They re very chewy kind of like Rice Krispy Treats with lots of flavor I have these for a mid day snack My 3 and 4 yr old love them too I also have tried the peanut butter version and found them to be equally as good I had been buying these bars at our local health food store Not only was I paying more money than Amazon sells them for but they were not as fresh as the bars I got from Amazon 
My whole family loves these munchies The fruit mixture is a great mix of tart and sweet fruits My 18 month old son and husband can practically finish the entire tub in one sitting 
A great way to let little ones snack on healthy fruit All of the fruits in the Just Fruit Munchies were perfect for the little ones except for the raisins which were too tough and crunchy amongst all the softer pieces But overall having picked out the raisins my kids just love to get their fruit this way and so do I 
Great Taste I purchased the dried strawberries and they tasted great The price is a little prohibited but otherwise a great product I hope they offer discounts for return customers 
Great Green Tea but how many bags are in this order I really like this green tea I find it to be much better than the other brand I add a little lemon and splenda to mine and enjoy it hot or cold What I wonder is if it is 6 40 count boxes like the title reads or 6 20 count boxes which is in the description Hmmm If it is 40 counters then this is a great deal 
Excellent If you love ginger or any of the other Destrooper cookies you will like these They are light and crispy not at all like a chewy ginger snap Not too strongly spiced and with small bits of delicious candied ginger Very good 
Just what I was looking for My daughter loved chocolate graham crackers but I hated the trans fat These are the perfect alternative She calls them bunny meal and they are delicious The price here is great over 1 box cheaper than my local market 
tasty maui coffee Try this one great decaf and maybe it ll help make you think you re in the tropics 
Yummy in my tummy Great texture does not get gummy or mushy in the water Nice vegetable taste Fun to cook with 
They taste pretty good Pringles Cheezums Potato Crisps just do cut it They are good on my breath too Honestly they taste pretty good I would get them again 
Overall Great but the Packaging is Fragile As a Cubicle Commando Pringles often find their way into my bottom left drawer They are a staple food in this environment I suspect Dibert would derive almost 30 of his nutrients from these I love pringles However I ve come to the conclusion that I need to buy them in the traditional tube because whenever I buy them in the convenient snak pack I m lucky to get half of them that aren t broken or crumbled What s the point of Pringles if you can t eat then whole Packaging makes a difference Maybe you ll have better luck than me but that is my take on it 
Hmmmm what a way to start the morning Even though this is a medium roast coffee it tastes darker almost bitter at times Smokey bold flavor My favorite wake up brew 
Echinacea Complete Care This is the most wonderful tea for fighting off and shortening the duration of colds and coughs I usually prepare it with lemon and honey and it s a very soothing blend with hints of mint and eucalyptas The echinacea and zinc combined help me fight off the nasty little bugs that seem to float around the office As soon as I get a sore throat I head straight for this wonderful tea 
Finally toaster pastries that are good for you It is very hard to find organic products where I live I had bought a box when I was travelling and my kids loved them I was so happy to be able to order a case through Amazon We just finished our final box and my kids want to know what flavor we re going to order next Thanks for making it so easy to purchase 
Loved by kids of all ages My children love Pop Tarts but I just can t bring myself to let them start their day drowning in sugar and sometimes sprinkles and icing I bought these pastries and handed them out half expecting groans of displeasure from all three children as I had when trying to sneak in turkey bacon and sugar free syrup But my children love these I tasted one and they are quite sweet and the blueberry filling actually tastes like blueberries I cannot stand the taste of a Pop Tart but these actually have a pleasant flavor from pastry and filling 
Great flavor at a great price I just love this stuff The texture and flavor are just right and best of all its organic Even though six boxes seems like a lot you will go through these within a few months and the experation date on my boxes was about 9 months away when I received them 
don t get tired of this cereal This is one of the better cereals How do I know Well I practically look forward to eating it every day What I do is mix all bran into the box because that could be kinda well I don t have to tell you but unfortunately also very healthy I also mix pumpkin seeds and WOW what a great combination A little strawberries blueberries or something of the sort and it is a great way to start off your day ENJOY 
Great tasting granola This is probably one of the best granolas I ve tasted What I like most about it is the texture Too many granolas just about break your teeth when you eat them but this one has a firm ie not mushy but pliable texture The next thing I enjoyed about this cereal is the taste not too sweet nor too bland just a perfect balance Too often sweetened cereals are much too sweet or on the flip side the healthy cereals are too bland Finally this cereal is just plain healthy What a great combo Flax and Pumkin seeds We ate up this cereal in record time and are ordering more today 
No Wheat Cereal This is a great whole grain cereal that is delicious and perfect for a no wheat diet 
Fantastic chocolate Great down home manufacturer Having read there was no need to buffer the chocolate with oil I was sold almost instantly After reading the reviews I had to have it My husband and I used this in our Rival chocolate fountain for our wedding and the results were divine Guests couldn t get enough of it and I was having so much fun I didn t even mind when I accidentally wiped melted chocolate on my gown I simply turned to my photographer and asked You can edit that out of the photos Right We used the dark chocolate and we have no complaints whatsoever We actually purchased quite a lot of it prior to the wedding as we weren t sure how much we would need We had enough left over for our Christmas party here at the house and we were thrilled with the results Another note I have a dear friend who is highly allergic to tree nuts and was afraid to use this chocolate at a post wedding party she and her husband hosted for my husband and me I called SF Chocolate before our Christmas party and actually spoke with a very kind lady who immediately went to check on this for me When she got back to the phone she said I just spoke with the lady who processes the chocolate and she said she doesn t process it on any shared equipment She checked with the lady who processes the chocolate WAHOO How often does THAT happen Come to think of it how often does a gal get to talk with a living breathing person when she calls the manufacturer of ANYTHING Oh How does it taste We got the Dark Chocolate and loved it The flavor is wonderful and the consistency is smooth as silk The chocolate fountain is a bit of a pain to set up and tear down but it s worth it for the reaction of the guests and the exquisite flavor of the chocolate itself Just say no to regular chocolate chips and oil 
Excellent source of fiber that tastes good This is the best high fiber cereal I ve tasted It was refreshing to eat a breakfast cereal that doesn t taste like cardboard Smells delicious too It doesn t need milk on it so if you don t like milk you don t need to add it For those following Weight Watcher s it s 1 pt per packet

Can t tell it is sugar free This licorice was the best sugar free I have ever had Loving licorice and being diabetic was terrible Now that I have discovered Gustaf s it isn t so bad anymore 
Flaky pie crust Learning to bake without gluten is a new process for me I thought that working with the dough seemed more like making a cookie dough than rolling out a pie crust Without gluten it lacks the elasticity that I am used to Once I got the knack of working with the dough and doing some patching I was very pleased with the results The flavor and appearance of the pie were not distinguishable from a crust made with wheat flour In fact the crust was flaky and even better than many pie crusts that I have eaten 
Jerky Fans will Love this I have tried every GoldenValleyNatural com Jerky product By far the best are all the Sweet N Spicy and Peppered Flavors Beef tends to be smoky and fatty while Turkey is dry and flaky making their Buffalo meat varieties the best of them all Avoid their Low Carb Jerky unless you are willing to bite off tic tac size bites and chew for a minute each time All the Teriyaki Jerkys have the texture and taste like sweet Corned Beef so I d skip them as well If you want to try different flavors instead of 8 of the same from Amazon just go directly to their web sight and buy them for only 15 more than Amazon s sale price
