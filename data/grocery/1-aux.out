This product was so disappointing that I discarded the entire box after trying one bar. There are much better raw food bars on the market in terms of both nutrition and taste

Sickly weak queasy stomach after eating the bar for 4 hours or more. I havent felt so yuky and sickly in a long time. You cannot return these or any food items to Amazon.
The Coconut was moist and tender, yet no good flavor. Taste, smells of cheap food grade oil.The Spirulina is too try and chalky, too much dried Spirulina in one bar.Again bad taste no good alive flavor.
Spirulina and Cashew,Coconut Agave Nectar,

Silly me! I assumed that these bars would taste like spirulina and cashews, but the only ingredient you can taste in them, or any of their other "flavors" is DATES. If you really love dates, go for it. Otherwise, forget it

I agree with the person who said it's hard to chew and here is why.

Disect your slim jim length ways...there, do you see the hair?
It is (allegedly) all made of cow hair...gross! That is the beef part I guess.
Trans-fat (partially hydrogenated veg oil) and some really long word chemicals to make "mechanically separated" beef and chicken what looks like hair taste "good"? no thanks, glad I did not buy 100!

My dog really likes it but then again she eats other dog's p..p

Slim Jims may taste ok but that's because they are so greasy. That's what helps the flavor. I can't figure out why anyone would like these as I can't seem to chew them to a point where I feel comfortable to swallow. It's like eating a really really tough piece of gristle meat. The amount of fat, cholesterol etc is also higher than beef jerky. I'd rather eat beef jerky than this stuff. At least I can chew the beef jerky

I had bought instant miso soup in the past and the taste was very similar with what you get at your usual sushi restaurant... so I ordered this one and... I shouldn't have ordered without trying because the taste is very strange... not pleasant... now we're stuck with 12x4 of something we don't like... hopefully someone else can avoid our mistake..

Scant vegetables and beef. Surprisingly little barley. Gloppy texture. Much too salty. Does not taste fresh. Needed addition of fresh vegetables to be edible. Hard to believe, but Campbell's is better

I really enjoy organic foods, so when I came upon this item I was thrilled they were making organic popcorn- especially Newman's Own, a brand I've liked in the past. I have to agree with the other poster, the flavor is bland and almost flavorless. There are other brands of organic popcorn that I've found more recently that are far better. Don't waste your money on so many of them!!

I ordered a 12-pack of this broth, and so far, I've received a total of 3 bottles: 1 original order, and 2 replacements. Amazon still hasn't sent me the 12-pack, and now instead of correcting my order, they want to cancel it and refund my money. I've been on and off of hold for over 20 minutes and they still haven't helped me. I strongly recommend you find somewhere else to buy this product

I tried it also as a less expensive alternative, and won't be ordering again. The flavor just tasted "off" to me.... kinda like old coffee that's been sitting in pot for a couple of hours.. didn't have that "freshly brewed taste"

A Million Little Pieces...an Unnecessary Portable Variation of the Old Pop-Tart

Call me a traditionalist, but I prefer the original, jam-filled Pop Tarts with none of the overly sweet frosting on top. As a child, I liked it right out of the toaster and would take it with me on the way to school. This portable variation seems to me like a misstep from the outset. The moment I ripped open the flimsy packaging, the Go-Tart bar crumbled out of my hand and onto the floor. Apparently the manufacturers at Kellogg's decided to use the same bread-like consistency they use for their standard Pop-Tarts on this bar. Especially with the shipping aspect introduced by Amazon, I think this is a mistake since I assume the whole idea behind this iteration of the snack is the portability aspect.

On top of the bar is the same execrable, sprinkle-laden white frosting I avoided once it was introduced as an enhancement so many years ago. Without the ability of toasting the bar, I find little point to the frosting except as a purposeless sugar-rush. Consequently, I cannot agree with its description as a "ready-to-eat bar". One bar, a little over an ounce, is 140 calories, thirty of which are fat. Even though there are more fattening bars you could eat, it still has an excessive-sounding 140 mg of sodium. I only tried the "Frosted Strawberry" variation because it was part of a free promotional package I received from Amazon to promote their new non-perishable grocery line. I think I'll just stick with a granola bar if I get the kind of munchies this bar is targeted to satisfy

Because of tummy troubles, my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet. Well this stuff is JUST what the doctor ordered, as it is almost completely tasteless. I can't give it a one star which qualifies as hating it, as I can't hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients, but it is not good. It makes Kraft Mac and Cheese seem very exciting! I would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from Annie's. This would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it

I bought both the Ahi Tuna Jerky and Salmon Jerky. Both were dried out and brittle. Absolutely the worst.

Incredibly, the Salmon Jerky was worse (i.e., drier, harder) than the Ahi Tuna Jerky

Most of the strip were either hard and brittle or so tough they could barely be chewed. They put no expiration date on the bags so I don't even know if I was given old product or they allowed the salmon to leave the processing plant this way. On top of this, they were too spicy. My dog seemed to enjoy it though.

The Ahi tuna, on the other hand, was great

This salmon jerky is so unbelievably tough, it is pretty much inedible. And when you do painstakingly gnaw on it, it doesn't release much flavor, but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks in your mouth. I had the misfortune of ordering this, and 7 of the 8 bags are still untouched, and I'm not sure what to do with them. I even tried soaking the jerky, and tried boiling it with some macaroni, and NOTHING seems to soften this stuff up! What a waste of money. Go for some beef jerky instead, and if you need salmon, eat it fresh or canned. This product is a joke

Melitta coffee is certainly one of the better brands, and I really like that each pod is individually wrapped. I bought this because the Senseo Hazelnut was not in stock at the time. Caution Senseo coffee maker users: The Melitta pod does not fit well in the Senseo pod holders. The single pod holder is too small for the Melitta pod, and the double pod holder is too big for one Melitta pod, too small for two Melitta pods. I found the coffee to be just a bit on the weak side, but this may only be because I used it in a Senseo machine.

Maybe I'm daft, but I can't make a decent espresso with these pods in my machine. I've tried tamping them, which doesn't work well and I've tried just placing them in the filter. In both cases I get watery dribble but no espresso.

As with other European products (think IKEA) there are no printed instructions in English, just line art drawings. Perhaps I'm just doing something wrong.

I like the concept of pods, but I'll stick to beans instead

I was very disappointed in the taste of this item. Not at all what I expected from Splenda. It is much too overpowering, strong and when added to your beverage, that is all you can taste. For instance, if added to coffee, you will not detect ANY coffee flavor, only the Splenda flavor. Much too strong. I prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this Splenda product - without question!

We've enjoyed these cookies for months as they were available for purchase at our local Costco Warehouse. Just purchased them in bulk here at Amazon and were terribly disappointed to find that they arrived hard as rocks and stuck together. They don't expire until July, 2007, so we're guessing that something happened to them in storage? We opened several packages and they're all the same.

The reason I am even taking the time to write this review is to say that Amazon's online policy states that grocery and gourmet foods ARE NOT RETURNABLE. Are you kidding? I have a case of $30 cookies that are simply not fit for prime time snacking. I've e-mailed customer service regarding my delivery. It's doubtful I'll order grocery items again as I assumed the return policy for defective goods would be the same. Just not worth the hassle.

Update: Amazon shipped us a replacement order. Unfortunately, again, all twelve packages are hard. Each package has three rows of cookies, each row is stuck together and each cookie must be pried from the next. Actually, it's a mute point doing this as the cookies are simply inedible as they are hard, hard, hard. The date on the package is: 11 Jul 07 X, I suggest a problem exists with this batch, either from storage or from the manufacturer.

...who said that the texture of this product is somewhat strange. I love beef jerky, especially peppered and hot spicy varieties. But this jerky lacks the chewy-ness that I expect in a quality beef jerky. This stuff kind of breaks down a little too easily and takes on a mushy, grainy consistency. The flavor isn't bad, but after reluctantly finishing the first bag, I can't bring myself to open the second one. Perhaps I wasn't paying proper attention, but I was somewhat surprised to learn that this product originated in Brazil. I would not have purchased it if I had known this

Although this is a good coffee, I was expecting something that tasted like a cappuccino. This coffee tastes nothing like it, it doesn't even have a hint of cinnimon flavor as the package suggests. If you want regular coffee, then this is the coffee to buy, but if you're looking for cappuccino, save your money

I was excited to try this product as I love Oreos, but don't like all the garbage that goes into them. We tried Newman-O's Originals...my wife went first, and the look on her face said it all. Still, I had to see for myself. We both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as Oreo cookies. For some reason, others seem to think they taste great. Just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large..

I picked up a bag of these at my local health food store a few months ago after hearing that Pirate's Booty was a great product. These tasted rather odd to me and I wound up getting rid of the bag as quickly as possible. Puffed corn and a chocolate type of taste just don't go well together in my opinion. It might have been ok if the cocoa was all you could taste, but that was not the case here

These coffee selections should be pulled off from your web site. I know you guys can not refund my money on this order, but I am going to write to the products manufactorer and let them know how I feel about their coffee products. The taste of the coffee makes you sick to your stomach. If I were you I would post this commit under your customer's reveiws to let other buyers beware of this terrible tasting coffee

I bought these pods on Amazon because they were a dollar cheaper than at the local grocery store. Now I know why. When I opened the package the Senseo Watermark was faint or hardly visable and it took me 3x the amount of pods to make a decent cup of coffee. Buyer beware, I am back to buying pods at the grocery store.

Be cautioned when ordering this product.

What happened was I ordered this product a month ago, and was sent the flatbread version instead of the clear tub of bite-size version. I called Amazon, explained my problem, they promised to fix it by sending me a replacement.

Well, the replacement came last week, and it was still the flatbread. I'm not going to bother to call Amazon again because I know it will just result in them sending me the flatbread once again.

The flatbread itself was tasty and crunchy. I think the seeds really helped to put more complexity into the flavor. You can eat just the flatbread as snacks or maybe put a bit peanut butter or jam on top. It tastes very different than wheat, and I like the taste of spelt quite a bit.

So please be prepared to receive the flatbread version when you order. You may as well just order the flatbread version to start with and save yourself couple of bucks as well as having to call Amazon to straighten things out

These cookies were ok, just ok. I may have been inclined to give them three stars had they arrived as whole cookies, every last cookies was broken. I understand this is probably due to poor packaging. The consistency was a bit grainy and dry though. And milk did not help. Next time I'll purchase a chewy brand or Mrs. Fields

I received this tea chest as a gift and am just now getting around to trying the teas. The chest is beatiful and will be great for future use; however, I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the tea. Although the bags are highly aromatic, the tea is very bland, as if the bags were old. I am sure Bentley teas are usually fresh and tasty, just not the box I received.

I had trouble getting the cups to function properly without getting grounds in my coffee. At first I thought it was my coffee maker but the other brand of coffee I use worked fine. Sometimes it took 3-4 cup changes to finally find a cup that would work correctly without getting grounds in my coffee. Most of the time I would just give up. Again, the other brand of coffee I use NEVER does this.

Not getting this coffee anymore - I would comment on the taste, but I never got to really taste it with the grounds and all.

I've tried this coffee with all size settings. It is too weak for my taste even at the smallest brew size. And if it was stronger I still don't think I would care for the flavor. It just doesn't taste like good Colombian coffees that I've had, not even close. This is definitely one I would not purchase again

I thought this product had reasonably good taste, but I have two major issues with it.

First, they describe this as a Kettle Corn. It is not Kettle Corn - not even close. This is a caramel corn with a thick sweet coating. Real Kettle Corn is a slightly sweet, slightly salty popcorn.

Second, each very small bag has 1.5 servings in it. When was the last time you opened a small bag of snack food and only ate 2/3's of it? They purposely made the serving size unrealistic to make it look healthier. The whole point of paying for individual size bags is that it limits you to a set portion. Remember when a can of Coke had 1.5 servings in it? The FDA made them change the label. If you eat the whole bag, you are eating 200 calories of popcorn. No better that a bag of potato chips or a few cookies, so this is not a lesser evil - it's just the same old junk food with a new name.

I won't buy this product again. It's the same stuff you can get anywhere

After extensive research on grains and nutrition, our family added Amaranth to our staple diet. There's not a wide range of suppliers for Amaranth and we started purchasing Bob's Red Mill Amaranth. Well, to be honest, our experience with this product is that it's been of pretty poor quality. Out of 8 packages we've bought so far, we've had to return 3 to the outlet we purchased them from due to the amaranth being mouldy. And I mean "open the package and you can smell that it's off right away" mouldy. In addition, one of the packages didn't smell mouldy but after we'd cooked it and added it to the baby food we were making, the mouldy smell of the cooked amaranth was very noticeable. Not good, particularly as we're using the amaranth for making baby food for our toddler and mouldy grain is not really something you want to include in the ankle-biter's diet.

In addition, we found we have to hand pick stones, grit and dirt from each package very very carefully. Seems that they are included as a bonus. (Note that as the grain itself is very small, the stones, dirt and grit are very small too - but big enough to damage teeth if they slip through the cleaning process - particularly toddler teeth). This cleaning and sorting process involves a lot of work, which we wouldn't mind so much if the amaranth was consistently good quality, but it hasn't been.

I have to say that while, after our research, we'd recommend inclusion of amaranth in anyone's diet, Bob's Red Mill Amaranth Grain is NOT a product we would recommend. If you have no choice but this, be very careful about cleaning it and hand picking stone, dirt grit out before you use it, and make sure you check very carefully for evidence of mould both before and after cooking. In addition, I'd recommend checking with the retailer that they will refund you the purchase price if the product you bought is off. So far, we've been sucessful in getting our money refunded (when we had the receipt - we didn't once and we didn't get the money back that time, but that was the first time and after that we were poorer but wiser....

Great idea poorly executed with an extremely unappetizing presentation. This is from someone who makes flavored rice a few times a week. That being said, this is the worst review I have ever given anywhere, so bear with me.

You know how sometimes the rice sticks to the bottom of the pan if you overcook and you have to boil it out and it turns oddly clear but covered in carbon water? Yeah. Like that. The rice came out sticky (not it the palatable uniform Japanese steamed rice way) and was an almost alien kind of translucent brown that was nothing like the picture. Nothing. If you look closely, you might be able to tell it had once been rice.

Yes, I followed the instructions.

My husband, who wanted to try having fresh rice at work, described it as an abomination, which was a relief to me because when it was cooking it stenched up the house with a horrifying yet familiar odor that when I put my finger on it smelled exactly, EXACTLY, like Onondaga Lake in Syracuse NY is the summer back when it was the most polluted lake in the world and people were warned never to eat the fish they caught (assuming there were any alive in there) and kids weren't allowed to wade in it. It smells like raw sewage, dead fish, rotting feathers and chicken soup.

It was 45F out and I opened the window.

Sometimes you buy a case of something and it turns out to be something you don't care for, maybe it has too much onion or whatever, but you know someone else will like it. Normally I donate these things to a needy family. I think in this case it would be cruel. I can't imagine anyone who has made rice on their own mistaking this for rice. Do yourself a favor and just drop a boullion cube in a pot with your stovetop rice. That's what they're trying to do here and failing at miserably.

I can't sell the rest on an auction site because I'm afraid that even if I am completely honest about the smell I will get a bad rating. The only thing I can think of to use them for is to smoke out people in the breakroom with the odor next April Fool's Day

I opened one packet (which was quite large for a serving, and shared it with 3 others in my office. We all took one spoonful and in unison said it was terrible. No one could continue eating it, and I sent back 8 of the 9 packets. Not edible, in our humble opinion.

I am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids. 4% Iron and no other vitamins?? With childhood obesity at epidemic proportions, why would ANYONE feed their children all of these empty calories?? It is like giving them Coke or Pepsi for BREAKFAST!! OK ORGANIC Coke but still Coke!! I am sad because I have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species!! But they are not thinking about their target consumer CHILDREN

First of all, the Tea Chest is disappointing to say the least. The chest is made of cheep compressed sawdust and then coated with a plastic like 'finish' which makes the box look like it was constructed from cardboard and plastic.

The tea its self is alright, sadly nothing special.

This item arrived a good 6 weeks after it was ordered, all of the tea packets were wrinkled and crushed and the box broke after I opened it a few dozen times. Needles to say, this product way disappointing all around.

I was really looking forward to these pods based on the reviews. Starbucks is good, but I prefer bolder taste.... imagine my surprise when I ordered 2 boxes - both were expired! One expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes. I admit that Amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping, but geez, 2 years expired!!! I'm hoping to find local San Diego area shoppe that carries pods so that I can try something different than starbucks

My sister worked at Starbucks, so I used to get their unground espresso beans for free on occasion. I have a pump espresso machine, but only a cheap blade grinder, which should tell you that I'm only about mid-range on the coffee-snobbery scale. That said, I prefer the starbucks espresso to this, in spite of the drastic difference in price when I buy it retail. Again though, I'm not one of those people who examines this stuff overly much. I only know what I like the taste of. In fact, I only drink it in lattes. 4 shot lattes, but lattes none the less

I brought this tea thinking it was a great deal. Then while steeping my tea I noticed something in the bag. At first I thought it was a rock, but it looked like a garden snail. I cut the bag open and it was a garden snail! YUCK! I checked several bags and approx 50% of them had snails in them.
This is the worst tea experience I've had

I was very disappointed in this product. I wanted to use them for snacks and pie crusts, but they are too stale to use. They are NOT crunchy as advertised since moisture has definitely entered through the packaging. Unfortunately Amazon will not let me return them, so I'm out $20. I was going to try some other products by this brand, but now I will not

I tried this once. You can get the same thing by buying some popping corn in your local grocery, popping it, pouring it into a bowl, and adding milk. This made me reluctant to try other Kashi products.

Frankly, I don't see why people continue to pay an outrageous price for what amounts to popcorn.

PS. Amazon should add a zero star rating

I absolutely agree with the two other reviewers. I had very high hopes too as I use McCann's Brown Bread mix ALL THE TIME - I don't think I could live without it, so I was very disappointed with the Fruit Scones Mix. There is a very weird taste, to me it seems like 'soapy' or something, but definitely not a pleasure to eat. I've got tons of bags left of this mix which I will have to throw away. I would definitely NOT RECOMMEND this product, sorry

We are huge scone lovers and were absolutely disappointed with the taste of these scones. The mix was easy enough to assemble and bake but the scones have a decidely odd smell and very caustic after-taste. My husband, who will eat just about anything, threw the whole batch in the trash after trying his first one. We had high hopes, but sadly, this product just didn't deliver

I bought about a million of these pods for my single serving senseo machine. They don't fit. One is too big for the single brewing well, and two are too big for the double. Your only option is one pod in the double brewing well, and the coffee comes out very weak. Just like this product

We have been buying the Melita Buzzworthy Dark Roast pods for over two years and were quite satisfied. Recently, they increased the diameter of the pods to enable them to fit other machines. I also understand thet they have increased the diameter of the pod holder in the new machines they are selling. At the time Melita made these changes, I believe they also reduced the quality of the coffee in their new pods because it just does not taste nearly as good. Accordingly, I rated the old pods with 4 stars but the new pods deserve only 2 stars. We are now sampling pods from other companies to find a good dark roast coffee

When I think "dark roast" I think full bodied and DARK. Melitta pods are the worst I've tried. I've tried Senseo pods too which are only mediocre. I did find the Target brand "Archer Farms" pods to be the BEST. The French Roast really does rival Starbucks home brewed. Its cheap too...3.99 for 18 pods. If you like a full bodied, rich, dark and strong cup of cofee, don't do Melitta. I found Senseo and Archer Farms pods fit in my Melitta pod brewer just fine

"Highest quality, wholesome ingredients" my Aunt Ida. Seriously. HOW do companies get away with this nonsense??? The first ingredient is corn syrup, followed closely by sugar. That the "Harmony" line would even consider masquerading as a "healthier foods" company and then try to pawn off this rubbish... it's revolting. I say don't buy from them just on principle.

I bought a case of these from Amazon because someone on some candy forum claimed these were of "excellent" quality and that they were comparable to premium brands like Haribro.

Don't believe it. These are cheapo gummi bears, no better than whatever cheapo junk your local drugstore/supermarket/bigbox sells. Pretty squishy (not very chewy), and a variety of bland flavors that all taste mostly like sweet.

There's no point in buying these

OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty. They also have a burnt flavor. You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order. On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good. This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags). Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon

While you could do a lot worse with other snacks, much of the health benefit of eating "fruit" in this product are outweighed by the chemical additives. High Fructose Corn Syrup and Dextrose are in many, many grocery products, but they are not "Natural" as this manufacturer claims. Both are chemicals manufactured in labs and are not easily digested by the body. HFC as it is called, has been linked in high quantities to escalating the onset of diabetes.

I have not tried this product, so I can't comment on the taste. I would like to try a dried fruit product, one which is truly natural and not laden with chemical additives.

I had bought this before as a snack at the store and i love the combination of the beef and the white cheddar. I figure i would try to buy it bulk instead of paying $2 a pack at the store. However, I'm not sure if it was stored too long in the warehouse or if it was too hot in the warehouse, but the cheese was disgusting! it was dry and crumbly and had this awful taste. I even opened a second and third pack to see if it was a fluke, but all of the packages were like this. The beef stick was good, however, if i had to order again, i'd order the product without the cheese. It just was not fresh. (and yes, i did check the expiration date and it wasn't expired

I was really disappointed with this item, especially as it's nutrition info is really amazing. It's very gritty and strong tasting and did not blend well. It's also dark green, which isn't a big deal for a lot of items but can turn things a very weird color depending on what you blend it with.

I am returning them as there are better tasting and equally nutritious protein powders available.

I had tried almost all the hemp protein products out there, and love eating the powder raw. But Nutiva's product does not taste good at all, compared to the other products it tastes like dirt, and its not milled to a fine powder, its very coarse so it will be crunchy if you decide to blend it with anything. The only thing going for this product is that it packs in more fiber than other brands. If your looking for a good tasting hemp protein go with Living Harvest, Manitoba Harvest or Ruth's Hemp Protein. I eat hemp religiously so trust me, take my advice and avoid this one. Bottoms Up! Hemp powder is the most complete source of protein out there, and easy to digest

Anyone who really loves a gourmet cup of coffee will HATE this! It's burnt, bitter, weak, battery-acid! And, as consequence, those coffee lovers may begin to hate their new Senseo -- but take heart! Many online coffee shops now offer decent to delectable coffees at prices that rival this cheap swill. I don't specifically want to endorse any one product or online retailer but do a google search for "senseo compatible pods" and you'll find several on the first page. Also, please note that while these may initially seem pricier, most third party pods work with JUST ONE to make an 8-ounce cup instead of the two pods that Senseo brand products demand. You do the math and it works out to be a comparable costing cup of joe.

Pretty OK coffee. Nothing special, but I suppose its a fair deal for the price. We picked up the pack of 3 as an emergency stash, and it has worked well for that, but its not my caffeine deliver system of choice ;-) Of course, my coffee of choice is over three times the cost of this stuff, so the comparison is not very fair

Okay, yes, I know the brand is Dr. Kracker and maybe that should have been a clue as to the texture of this product. However, I have had flatbreads made by other companies that were actually the texture of a pita. These are VERY crunchy and don't have a whole lot of flavor. Additionally, they were shipped and arrived expired. If you are shopping for a super-healthy cracker, this may be it. If you are looking for a whole grain flatbread with the texture of a pita, keep shopping - this is not it. My next venture for this product is to grind it up and use as bread crumbs on top of broiled tilapia

I purchased these the other day. I received them on the 11th of Jan 2007
I ordered some other ones before, 100ct box slim jims which were very good but unfortunately, they kept revising my order from Dec 19th until Jan 10th so, I canceled the order because it was taking way too long. I thought these would be just as good. ($15 dollars more than the 100ct box, But just as good there's 180 of them, instead of 100). WRONG!
These are really bad. They were all dried out hard as rocks, and to top it off, They expire on the 24th of Feb. Less then a month from now. I've never had this problem with Amazon before. Usually their stuff is fresh. You will not be able to return them either. Once they are opened you are stuck with them. I contacted Amazon about this problem they gave me a little of my money back. I will not be buying these in the future. Amazon must have had these for quite some time for them to be so bad.

While I personally love and eat tons of organic and natural foods, I have to say the $30 I spent on this case of cookies was a waster. Neither of my children will eat them, nor will I. They have a smell that once you get in your nose hinders any attempt at enjoying the very small bit of flavor they have. Nature's Path makes great cereal and energy bars but fall short with these cookies. Stick with the chocolate or peanut butter and you are okay. The honey grahams will sit in your cupboard until trash day

I was really looking forward to these pods based on the reviews. Starbucks is good, but I prefer bolder taste.... imagine my surprise when I ordered 2 boxes - both were expired! One expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes. I admit that Amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping, but geez, 2 years expired!!! I'm hoping to find local San Diego area shoppe that carries pods so that I can try something different than starbucks

"No sweeteners" on the can, yet the first ingredient listed after carbonated water is "White grape juice concentrate", which might not be sucrose, but since when is that not sugar? Each small (8.4 oz) can has 170 calories and 41 carbs. I was so excited to find a healthy fun drink, but this is not it

The flavor? A lot like Mountain Dew. Mostly sugar, yes there's some lemon in it, but it's hard to tell it's Meyer lemon as opposed to some other type. Another example of food manufacturers slipping a very unhealthy drink into the market as "100% juice, no preservatives, no sweeteners, all natural" -- Better they should say "drink this to make SURE you get fat and type 2 diabetes!!!

I have been an avid senseo fan for about a year. However, I was getting a bit bored drinking the same Dark Roast every morning (I found the other flavors too mild). So I was very happy when I saw the new flavors (Sumatra, Colombia, Kenya and Brazil). Sumatra and Columbia are the two that I liked. I found the Kenya blend to be mild and sweet. Even my wife, who previously used Hazelnut did not like it too much

I had to throw out almost all of these raisins because they contained crawly things and/or what looks like the droppings of crawly things. I must say I generally love Newman's products, and I was willing to give these raisins the benefit of the doubt. With natural products, sometimes bugs get in them. That's part of the territory with organic matter. But I found white grubs and little brown dots that weren't a part of the raisins in box after shrink-wrapped box. Some boxes were fine, and I ate the raisins in them, but the majority were tainted. I'll need to be assured there's been an improvement in quality control before I try Newman's snack-pack organic raisins again

I think they must process this stuff on the same equipment as other wheat cerel. Somehow it is getting contaminated. I wish I could send it back. It is too bad because it is a good product, it's just not gluten free

I had thought this would be full of dried fruits and nuts ( in other words, healthful) but it's really just sugar laddened bits of hard fruits and only flavorless peanut pieces. I have given the local food bank all but the one package I opened which made me feel so unwell that it's now in the rubbish. I am truly very disappointed in this product. It's description belies it's reality. If sugar is contraindicated in your diet....steer clear of this product!! It's low in salt and low in fat but so over sugared as to be actually nauseating. It's too bad because it sounded delicious and so nutritious. All I can say is YUK!!! I suggest you leave this product alone unless you think high sugar is good for you

I didn't like this at all. I found it chemical, and not nicely redolent of the ginger I O so, love. I just gave it away, cute little tin and all. I am adventurous, so I do happen on things I feel aren't what I expected from time to time. This was certainly one of them. I'm sure some of you will like like it, don't let me stop you from trying out your own personal tastebuds. Mine said: "This tea is not a real peach, either.

I have tried all there fruit products and absolutely love them all.
However this Sweet Corn is all but Sweet. I would say it should be called Salty Corn.
I think they would have a Great Product if they did away with the Salt also, or change the Name to Salty Corn. Cause if this was the first product someone tried from this company-- I dont think they would give the other products a try from there line. ** My
Favorite is : Cherry Berry and Orchard Blend ..

I can hardly eat this for all of the salt, it leaves you thirsty it's so bad. The ingredients list reads, literally, "100% organic sweet corn, sea salt, and nothing else". They need to make it "100% organic sweet corn and nothing else", and they'd probably have something really great. As it is I'm stuck with 23 1/2 bags of salty corn that I'll have to give away

I beat this mix longer than the 10 minutes suggested, and it was still too runny to even stay in my angelfood cake pan. It baked flat a disgusting rubbery texture, and was completely inedible. When I very nicely wrote about my concerns and to request a product refund, the Customer Service person said they could not give me a refund, and said "thank you for your understanding" -- huh?? I'll never purchase any more of their products

I have been disappointed with this product. We have always enjoyed Annie's products have never had a problem, until now. The "cheese" was so solidly clumped that I was unable to make a sauce without lumps. I have used 3 different packages from my order have had the problem with all of them. I am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse. Either way, beware

I was really excited about ordering this set and thrilled when it came. I have noticed something unexpected about the teas, however. With the teas I have tried from this set I have noticed an unpleasant dry aftertaste. Another taster noticed the same thing without my mentioning it.

I really like the glass tea pot. It is very nice to watch the tea fill the glass orb with color and flavor. Whether the flowers are beautiful or look more like sea urchins will be a matter of personal taste.

I had high hopes for the Starlight Rose Tea (white tea leaves with rosebud) and found it far inferior to Rose Petal Black Blended Tea by The Republic of Tea, which is excellent. On the other hand, Numi's Moroccan Mint is one of the finest teas I have ever tasted, superior to an old favorite of mine- Stash Tea Moroccan Mint.

After tasting this tea I am surprised by the number of reviews rating the tea that comes with the set as quite good. Maybe I got a bad batch or have strange taste buds- but there it is.

The bamboo box is quite charming

Flavored peanut butter was a short-lived and quirky product line from 30+ years ago. It was a bad idea that was buoyed along for a few years by a cute name, a catchy jingle, a generation of sugar-addicted children, and adolescents with "the munchies." Now, PB Max is trying this idea again.

As far as i can tell, there's no good use for, nor nutritional value to, this product. It has a phony, overly-sweet flavor that doesn't taste like Snickers or peanut butter and is not good on any kind of bread unless you have really weird cravings. Come on, would you take a real Snickers bar and make a sandwich out of it with peanut butter? If so, you might find this product a convenient if inferior-tasting alternative.

This doesn't melt evenly so trying to use it as a sauce will prove frustrating. It gets oily and separates and doesn't work well for dipping. Yes, you could spread it on apple slices or eat it straight up if you are so inclined. I'll go for a real Snickers bar or plain apple slices, thank you very much. You could also get this for your kids to eat, but please try to be better parents than that!

Note that you are buying 6 jars of this at once, so even if you do find a niche use for it, you'll have quite a bit of it to use up. I'm betting that you'll get tired of it long before it's gone

I bought these simply because I wanted an easy snack, and the reviews were pretty good. I took two bites and stopped. The second bite was because I really couldn't believe that I disliked something that much.

The odor is pretty bad, too. These smell very medicinal, almost like a commercial disenfectant. Next time you're at a doctor's office try licking the counter, it's like that. Not that I've ever done that, but I can't describe it any other way.

Please try one of these locally if you can, I wouldn't suggest buying them if you can't.

I got this as a gift and as a person who appreciates fine teas, this is undrinkable. In fact, it's unsmellable. I opened the tin, and the smell was overpowering and clearly not natural. Smelled and tasted like handcream. Yes, I actually tasted it. Furthermore, the tea was practically a powder and the teabags were cheesy - the quality you'd find in a no-name tea from the dollar store. The tab simply said Ceylon tea. It looks like "Bentley" got stuck with a load of crappy teabag seconds, sprayed them with jasmine perfume and stuck them in a fancy tin. I gave it one star for the tin. If you have even the tiniest discrimination when it comes to tea, don't buy this one

I ordered Teriyaki, Original and Black pepper flavored ones. The other two flovors are quite good but this one, teriyaki, is really sub-standard. It has sandy texture and quality is very uneven compared to the others.

Ok,

I bought their 4 bag combo special which feature all their flavors back when their site was taking orders direct. This jerky is not very good. In fact, I threw away about half of it because some of the pieces where very thick and hard. Kind of like eating leather and plastic mixed in together. Trust me when people say this : there is MUCH BETTER jerky out there. I even e-mailed the company and told them that I was very unsasfied with thier jerky. They offered me a refund and I should of taken it, but I decided not to

I've purchased this locally and it was delicious, so I was happy to see a deal offered by Amazon. Unfortunately, it never made it to my door. UPS reported that the sauce was leaking out of the box and returned the package to Amazon. This seems to match what many other reviewers said.

first, quality tomato products should never be packed in plastic. The high acidity may cause the plastic to leech into the food. Then, these are pooly packed by Amazon, 2 orders--both arrived cracked open as Amazon just throws them in a box, so they crack and make a nasty mess.
As for the sauce, well it tastes fine, but i think it is not well balanced, very acidic, we feel horrible after eating it for hours. Simple good ingredients, so i'm not sure what it making us feel sick

but I may never know. I ordered this item on October 27. When a shipment finally arrived, there was only one container of this inside! I ordered a four pack I'm sure. So Amazon offered to try again sending the item, but it's now November 30th. The item has been in stock the whole time so I'm not sure what has caused the delay. I'm just thankful I ordered it just to try it out, and that I didn't actually need it by any certain date.

While the flavor is unique, three of the five packets of nuts were rancid! To say I am disappointed is an understatement. Unfortunately, this is not the first time I have had problems with the freshness of food products purchased from Amazon.

Now, one to the two non-rancid packets. I got through one in a few days, and I was working on the other ... them I realized I had a major head-fog, you know, like a hangover, but without having had anything to drink. I gave up the nuts it went away. For me, that's a tell-tale sign of additives in food. Not a good choice for someone with chemical sensitivities.

I purchased this on a SD recommendation. But it was a complete utter waste of money for me.

Got a deal on the machine, and love the concept. But every senseo coffee I have tasted has been absolutely horrible. I've tried 4 oz with one pod- way too bitter so 8 oz with 1 pod...still the most awful coffee I've ever had. Normally I drink Gevalia, but I use Folgers sometimes or Millstone...
I don't think I could drink this stuff on a regular basis if someone paid me. Of all the purchases I've made at Amazon, this has been the first time I've ever felt compelled to give feedback. That in itself speaks volumes

I ordered the Chocolate Mint variety. Amazon had them for a great price and shipped them quickly. However, I ordered the cookies in early November, and they arrived with a "Best When Used By" date of December 4, 2006. They will expire less than a month after they arrived!

I'm not sure if this is Amazon's fault or not. The cookies are shipped in the manufacturer's Back to Nature box, so it could be the company is unloading older cases of merchandise on Amazon.com

Ok, these tasted good although they were much tougher than the sugared brand. I ate about a serving and a half and so did my husband right after we got them. That evening we both had bloating and terrible flatulence. It was the holidays so I didn't immediately attribute it to the vines. I brought some to work to satisfy my afternoon sugar cravings and ate another serving sitting at my desk. Later that afternoon I was in an important meeting bloated beyond belief and trying not to embarrass myself. I have since thrown out all my other bags--these things create at best a very embarrassing and uncomfortable several hours and at worse a terrible health problem. I think they should be taken off the market or at least labelled with a warning "may cause significant distress to your digestive track and embarrassing flatulence!

I'm sorry to give this a poor review, but tea has to taste good in order for me to drink it. I often drink a large variety of bedtime teas and have never tasted any tea this awful. I can't speak for how well it works because I couldn't drink the whole cup even though I attempted to force myself. Yogi makes some good teas, but this I just couldn't stomach.

The sell by date on a package was less than a month. So that they would not go bad, I felt like I needed to personally eat more than I would have. I have a retail store and I need a bit more time on new products. This was a costly mistake. Also, the "wholesale price" from the business itself was the same as Amazon's price except Amazon gave free shipping AND a discount coupon worth ten bucks! Cool deal beans Amazon! As a retailer, I would think that I would be able to get a better deal from Betty Lou's or get a reasonable sell by date. Very tasty and addicting

I am a huge Special K fan. Especially Red Berry, but at heart I am a chocoholic. I was so excited to hear they had a chocolate version and I ran right out to try it. It is your average Special K flakes but with the addition of "Chocolate Pieces". The problem is they leave a horrible waxy coating in your mouth because of the poor quality chocolate. I am sure this is because it has to stay healthy but I would rather have a Fat Free Chocolate Jello 100 calorie pack then deal with the feeling it leaves in your mouth. So back to red berry for me

This is a STRONG blend. When I want a cup of decaf, I usually want a milder blend. And, after a cup or two of this blend, I still seem to get "jittery." I question whether or not it is TRULY decaffeinated

Home and Beyond and True Value offers this 12 pack of coffee filters with 40 in each pack. I ordered two 12 packs of 40 coffee filters each and Home and Beyond only sent two packs of 40. Not the 24 packs I ordered and paid for. My advice is do not do business with Home and Beyond or True Value when buying these coffee filters because they do not ship what the listing says. Until Amazon starts enforcing Home and Beyond and True Value to honor what they list in their offerings, IMHO then the buyers need to go somewhere else. Weight says 4.20 pounds. Are they trying to say one tiny pack of 40 paper coffee filters weighs 4.20 pounds??

The product is fine. But the description is misleading. Each package contains "40 count," that is, 40 filters. But this is not a "(Pack of 12)," as you would think from the description, from the price reduction (from $23.88 to $1.93), and from the shipping weight (4.20 lbs). It's just one box of 40 filters. And you'll pay, as I did, $11 for FedEx to bring you this one box.

Soon after I submitted this feedback, I was issued a partial refund of $7. Product description still needs correcting, but at least customer service was responsive

The oatmeal tastes okay but the purchaser should be aware that this IS NOT an instant version of McCann's Irish Steel Cut Oatmeal, the oatmeal it is famous for. I thought McCann's only sold steel cut oatmeal but it also apparently sells the regular type of instant oatmeal that is flavored. I would not buy this again since the steel cut oatmeal is what I prefer and is much better for you

In Amazon's ultimate wisdom they will NOT return or exchange items from their grocery store even though it is in Beta status. I ordered the Apple Cinnamon in good faith as they appeared to be the normal packaging but be warned that these contain Splenda and so may not be suitable for everyone. I'd avoid the Amazon grocery store at all costs going forwards

I tried really hard to like this stuff. You know, organic and all that. The elbow macaroni is fine but the sauce is gummy, pasty and tastes like Cheez-Whiz. If you like Cheez-Whiz, you will love this mac cheez. If not, pass it by. I'd have given it to Mikey but he doesn't live at our house anymore. My recommendation is to make your own from scratch. It's not that difficult and it's so much better.

There are bugs in the tea bags. Now, these aren't the 'organic' bugs you find in your garden when you plant veggies. These are the bugs that dig into expired produce. There are about 4-5 bugs in each bag. If you want some protein boost while relaxing before you go to bed, this is the product to buy. Also, the tea bags aren't made from organdy. It's some sort of plastic/polyester. I burnt a bag and it melted, turned black, and glued onto itself. Horrible, unethical company

I've found Timothy's K-cups to be consistently good, better than the Green Mountain varieties I tried (I haven't found a Green Mountain that I like yet!) But Parisian Night is the first Timothy's offering that didn't impress me. I bought two boxes of it from Amazon and have tried using different brew strengths, but it always tastes bland. It's bold and strong as advertised, but plebeian. To someone who's just bought a Keurig and had this blend as their first cup, it might taste pretty good; but compared with all the other, better K-cup varieties that are available, this one is better off skipped. I think it's just a fancy name for a boring blend that has nothing distinctive about it at all. Their "Midnight" dark roast is definitely more tasty, and even better than that are their Columbian and Italian K-cups, which are very smooth. I think Timothy's has the best Columbian K-cups on the market. But Parisian Night, well...let's just say that everybody makes mistakes

Last time I order this sort of thing online. I realize that 'raisins' was the first ingredient, but they weren't even *good* raisins, and the raisins outnumber everything else by a good margin. It's basically raisin and banana with a few other things thrown in. The coconut is an afterthought and completely tasteless. The sunflower seeds settled to the bottom. It's edible, but it doesn't taste especially good and 'tropical' is definitely misleading

Go to Trader Joe's for real natural peanut butter at $1.69 per pound. Yes, you'll need to stir it and that might seem strange at first if you have grown up like we all did on commercial junk. That junk that they add, which always contains heart clogging "partially hydrogenated oils" (read heart clogging) turns the nutritional value of your peanut butter to garbage. You might as just well eat a snickers bar if you're going to eat skippy or peter pan or jiffy or whatever.

Your local health food store may have a peanut butter grinder (and "butter stock" peanuts) which would be uber natural and fresh, doubly delicious AND cheaper.

From THE ADA (American Diabetes Association):

"Are some fats better than others?


Yes. Monounsaturated fats are the healthiest for your body. Nuts -- like almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, and peanuts -- and avocados contain this type of fat. Choose olive or canola oil for cooking. Polyunsaturated fat is the next healthiest fat. This is found in corn oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, and mayonnaise. Use small amounts of foods that contain saturated fats like butter, lard and meat fat, bacon, and shortening. There are lower-fat versions of foods that contain saturated fats, like sour cream and cream cheese. A healthy diet includes less than 30% of calories from fat, with less than 10% of these from saturated fat.

This peanut butter tastes even worse than regular creamy Skippy. A lack of flavor and dry texture makes me wonder if by "palm oil" they meant to write "socks". Thoroughly disappointing, I only finished the one jar I bought because peanut butter is a staple in my diet and I wasn't about to waste it. Buy the real all natural peanut butters or even the cheap store brand which contains Fully Hydrogenated oils which are fine for you unlike Partially Hydrogenated ones

Skippy pulls the worst kind of nonsense with this product - claiming it's all natural, which is technically true, but also implying that since it's natural, it's healthy, which is false for this product sice they ruined it. Real peanut butter contains one ingredient: peanuts, and maybe a dash of salt. Nothing else. Real peanut butter is very good for you. Skippy adds palm oil, a tropical oil which, while it's slightlybetter than soem other tropical oils, still contains saturated fats and is completely unnecessary, to this "spread". Why? So the poor widdle you doesn't have to spend a whole four seconds stirring it. Of course, this would all be a lot more clear if amazon actually had the nutrtion labels available, but they don't - nor do they carry ANY kind of actual all-natural peanut butter.

Skip this, skip all the so-called "peanut butters" carreied here, and go to yoru local store to get soem real natural peanut butter. Look at the label - if it has any other ingredient than peanuts and salt, put it back on the shelf. Nothing else is necessary

This is not a natural peanut butter. The listed ingredients are peanuts, sugar, palm oil and salt. Natural peanut butter, such as Smucker's and Whole Foods contain only peanuts and salt. Palm oil is not a healty oil and is not recommended for cholesterol patients.

I ordered the loose tea in tins and received 6 boxes of tea bags. The only labeling on the box was a barcode sticker with for tea in tins, which was incorrect. When calling customer service I had only two options -- return the tea bags or keep them and be overcharged. There was no follow up, so there was no way to know if I would receive the correct product if I ordered again. The price had gone up 20% in the mean time. Rather than be without tea (I can't buy that brand where I live), I kept it. You can't get your money back if you are over charged, and you can't complain about it to anyone who cares. I will never use Amazon Grocery again if I can help it, and I suggest you do the same.

I bought this tea because my job was stressing me out and causing a lot of anxiety, indigestion, etc. and I use and love the other flavors of Yogi tea. Unfortunately, I can't handle the taste of this one. It's just too strong - almost burns your tongue because it is so spicy. I normally like ginger but this is too much

I've only been on a gluten free diet for four months, so maybe my palate has not yet become accustomed to things that taste horrid. The worst part is that Amazon has left me stuck with six loaves of this. I'd put it out for the squirrels but I'm not sure they'd eat it. If you're expecting something that tastes anything like bread, you're in for a shock

I wanted to like this bar because it's high in protein and fiber, but it is also unfortunately high in added sugars (31g!). It's much too sweet. If they took away some of the sugar, it might be edible.

Although the product claims to be a viable additive for shakes/drinks, our experience is it won't dissolve without a blender.

Simply put it clumps.

The taste is fine, actually good, so my recommendation is to look elsewhere for a drink supplement

"without any sulfites, preservatives, hydrogenated oils, artificial colors or flavors."

...but not without a great deal of sugar and high-fructose corn sweetener. Like the previous reviewer I bought these at Costco. Brought them back due to the sickly-sweet taste. There was so much added sugar it was getting a little difficult to taste the berries.

If you prefer berries au naturel or with just a little extra sweetness, watch the ingredient list on these. Sugar is the second ingredient by weight - and corn syrup is the fourth

The quality of this tea is not very good, especially compared to other superb teas by Two Leaves and a Bud. Mostly powder inside the bag, and has a very strong "grassy" smell and somewhat bitter aftertaste.

On top of that it took 2 weeks for Amazon to deliver it.

I was excited to try this product as I love Oreos, but don't like all the garbage that goes into them. We tried Newman-O's Originals...my wife went first, and the look on her face said it all. Still, I had to see for myself. We both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as Oreo cookies. For some reason, others seem to think they taste great. Just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large..

I was so very disappointed with this cereal. It's taste is very sweet.

If you look at the ingredients, it's filled with sugar, corn syrup and and more sugar. I counted 12 ingredients that were really just forms of sugar! It is also loaded with salt. I would give this ZERO stars if I could, because it has more sugar than most "sweet" cereals. Why mislead the public into thinking they are making a healthy choice when all you are doing is serving sugar with a new label and adding a little bit of soy to the package?
Absolutely ridiculous

As another viewer pointed out this product contains CORN SYRUP not at all organic. In fact the only organic thing in this product is the Fig. For those of us trying to maintain a healthy organic eating lifestyle you MUST read the list of ingredients before assuming the front label is accurate. This goes for all products not at all an attack against Paul Newman products which my family does consume we enjoy their products that are truly organic

Contrary to the maker's claims, this product is not made with whole-grain flour. Instead, the first-listed ingredient is "organic unbleached wheat flour," an unhealthful, refined carbohydrate. The product is sweetened with common, refined cane sugar and corn syrup. All things considered, this product is nutritionally equivalent to common grocery-store fig newtons, except for the claim that it's "organic." Snacks like this could be made with healthful, nutritious ingredients; unfortunately, this one is not. I would not choose to buy it again. Instead of this junk snack, I would choose Barbara's Whole Wheat Fig Bars, which are made with real whole grains and sweetened with fruit juices

I was very disappointed in the taste of this item. Not at all what I expected from Splenda. It is much too overpowering, strong and when added to your beverage, that is all you can taste. For instance, if added to coffee, you will not detect ANY coffee flavor, only the Splenda flavor. Much too strong. I prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this Splenda product - without question!

I'm afraid I disagree with the other two reviews. I thought this pasta was extremely bland and not very close to what wheat pasta tastes like. It does take longer to cook and you have to add oil to the water and stir it quite frequently or it clumps and sticks together terribly. It's an OK substitute but there are much better gluten-free pastas out there. Although the Glutino is cheaper, I personally like Orgran pasta 100 times better

The almonds are slightly seasoned with a 'barbecue' kind of flavoring, which is subtle but nice. The cashews, on the other hand, are hard to believe. The taste conjures up images for me of them being stored in semi-pervious containers in the paint-and-finishing room of my high school industrial arts class. They are REALLY awful, and any lover of cashews will be appalled

I wouldn't describe this jerky as shredded but instead as powdered. It's not something you can tap into your hand and eat like a snack. The best use we found was to pour one of the little tubes onto a salad for added protein. Still, it had a fairly short shelf life for jerky; the unopened tubes had gone bad (mold? or something? ick) within about 3 months

It's not the regular, strong Earl Grey Twinings I come to love. This version lacks strength and flavor - two teabags are needed for regular strength tea. It's even states on the box - Light Flavour Strenght (2 leaves out of five). Beware!

The newly re-packaged Twinings Earl Grey tea (has the word "CLASSICS" on the package) is much, much weaker than the previous Twinings Earl Grey tea. If you used and like to the old teas, then you won't like the new version. I wonder if they have weakened the Britsh version of Twinings Earl Grey Tea

I love most Jack Links jerky products,however, I was disappointed with this product though it had all the heat - the flavor was lacking true pepper taste. It tasted like a bunch of powdered old HOT spices not a true fresh pepper cure. I think the mistake most people make with hot peppers is not removing the seeds before using, as this can give a bitter as well as hot taste. I have not given up on Jack Links - just ordered their turkey jerky

I thought these would be slightly sour, like dried cherries I have enjoyed in the past. No--HFCS is High Fructose Corn Syrup--so these taste strangely sweet, like weird raisins. They are OK if I cook them in oatmeal or if I'm really hungry, but I wouldn't buy them again. If you are looking for tart dried cherries look elsewhere

Although I love the Nana's brownie mint, and peanut butter flavor cookies, I found the ginger cookie disappointing. It was too spicy to be enjoyable, and more crumbly than the other cookie flavors. (The crumbliness is due to the gluten-free rice flour.)

Also, the ginger cookies are more fattening than the other flavors I've had: 360 calories per cookie, compared to the peanut butter at 316 per serving and the chocolate mint at 300 calories.

Note that Nana's cookies lists the calorie count as 180 per serving, but they count a serving size as half a cookie.

I purchased two of these packages in mid Jan 2007. I have only finished one box (of four) and am finding about 1 out of 4 packets have caked. Due apparently to a small air leak in the packet so moisture can get in (only my personal theory). I just pound on the packet with a knife handle to break it up and use it anyway but it is a problem. And they have known about it now for a long time, seems like they would have solved the problem....

5 Stars for the Stevia product...natural, delicious! 0 Stars for Amazon's inability to correctly store this item in their warehouses. I experienced the same trouble as other reviewers, packets showing up hard and useless. When purchased in the store, I have never had one hard or brittle packet. Don't bother purchasing from Amazon, instead head to your local Trader Joe's where you can purchase 100 packets for $5.99. Not the fiber supplement type, but doesn't clump and more per packet. Amazon really shouldn't even bother selling this product if the Stevia shows up ruined

I ordered enough Stevia packets to last me for 1 year. Most of the packets have the sugar hardened. Every so often I am finding one that is powder as it should be. The others must have gotten some kind of moisture to them because they are hard. I will never buy Stevia from the company I purchased from again. I don't have the receipt or I would have returned them asking for a refund. I have been upset about the way they came.

I drink Lavazza coffee nearly every morning at a local restuarant. When I saw this on Amazon, I assumed it would be great -- but it isn't. Even though this is sold as "drip grind coffee", the grind is way too coarse for a drip coffee maker. The result is that you need to use nearly twice as much coffee to get a decent cup. And decent is as good as it gets -- not great, not even very good -- just decent.

Illy's (admittedly much more expensive) drip grind delivers a much nicer, smoother cup using 1/2 as much coffee -- so mabye it's not all that much more expensive in the long run.

I should have known that there was something fishy when the product details said that the product dimensions are 13 x 10.5 x 2.5 inches and 3.8 pounds when the shipping weight said 2.15 pounds. In actuality it is 12 X 10 X 2.5 and comes in a CHEAP (do not even know if it IS wood) box AND it weighs 1.14 pounds on my postal scale. However, to be fair, I have not taken the plastic wrapper off because it is a gift so it could be very, VERY thin wood. In addition, the container opens like a box rather than a chest. There are no hinges on the back. I am very disappointed with this tea "chest" AND it's price

These are excellent graham crackers. We love 'em, and the kids do too, and it's not often that we agree. But you'll be sorry if you order graham crackers -- or any other food that can be damaged in shipping -- from Amazon.

Our recent order arrived in the original box from the factory, containing 12 boxes of New Morning Honey Grahams. That was it. No packing material. Nothing to shield the crackers from the drops and shocks of being shipped to us.

So we didn't get graham crackers. We got graham crumbs, and a few graham cracker fragments.

By all means, order these crackers. Just don't order them from Amazon. Instead, find a retailer that knows how to do it right, or buy them from your local grocery. Unless you really want graham cracker crumbs..

I recently tried this cookie and the Ginger flavor. They were both disgusting. The texture was similar to a protein bar. The flavor of the chocolate one was very weak, contrary to the label, which states that it has a rich chocolate flavor. The other one was very spicy, with no sweetness to cut the spice. Not a pleasant experience. I didn't finish either of them

This stuff tastes great but after doing some research, it's got a bunch of fats that are not considered healthy. The first item on the list (which means that it is the highest mass ingredient) is partially hydrogenated oils. If you have any problems with cholesterol, I suggest talking to your doctor..... Or maybe you might want to be like many Americans and just increase your Lipitor dosage so we can enjoy these tasty but potentially unhealthy creamers. Godspeed

$17.00 For Dehydrated Dingleberries? I Don't Think So...

My wife bought these for me and I was just putting them on my morning Cheerios like a madman and I said, "Hey, these are good...where did you get 'em?"

"Oh, from Amazon...can you believe they were only $17.00?"

Silence.

I just looked at her, "Are you nuckin' futs? Gimme those things. I'm going to put them into our safety deposit box with our bonds, our living trusts, and my favorite Hot Wheels..."

Blueberries are good for you and I would suggest to eat them on a regular basis, but the price for these things is simply absurd. Do I look like I'm wearing my shirt that says, "STUPID"? I don't think so. I'm sure you can get frozen blueberries for less and hey, fresh is always good, and if you can't get frozen or fresh, get a Hostess Blueberry Pie. Sure it's sugary and will feel like you've got a leadweight in your stomach after eating it but the pie is only .50 cents..these little blue suckers are $17.00. That's more than my whole wedding cost.

Just kidding. I'm not that cheap. Actually, I'm not cheap at all, but I do like money and I refuse to pay $17 for some humiliated looking berries...

Amazon never sent the correct order. I spend 2 hours on the phone trying to get them to send the right item. I eventually had to decline the order on the 3rd time not getting the correct amount of pop-tarts. They kept sending once box when i was supposed to get 12

Wish I would have paid attention to this one, the the previous review. The cost for what you get is OUTRAGEOUS. Only reason I gave it one star is because there was no place to give is ZERO starts. Don't waste your money like I did!!! FIND A MORE ECONOMICAL PRODUCT (plenty more choices on Amazon BTW)

The price for this and all other 100 calorie packs is for one box. This means you are paying almost two dollars per ounce. This is the most ridiculous sham I have ever encountered. The difference in price between this item on Amazon and this item in a grocery store is outrageous. (THIS COSTS OVER TEN DOLLARS MORE HERE THAN AT THE GROCERY STORE!!!!

Sorry guys, I don't know if I wasn't tasting REAL Miso Soup at my local restaurant, but the thing is I didn't like this one bit, and I still have lots of packages left! haha.. I gave it a chance because I love the soup from the Japanese restaurant I visited and I wanted to taste this soup whenever I wanted, at home. But, I didn't like the flavor, don't know if I'm missing something, but better buy one (ONE) a see for yourself

I had the exact same experience as "Heather" shown below. They sent me the less expensive NON-ORGANIC version of this product TWICE and then informed me that they couldn't guarantee when the problem would be fixed.

Remember that strawberries and cherries are on every list for crops containing the most pesticide. Now add that freeze dried snacks are concentrated. Finally, take these concentrated levels and place them in a small child or toddler's body and their pesticide exosure goes through the roof. Do the math.

Note to Amazon: This is a great product with fruit "and nothing else" in its ingredients. Please retain it and get it right to benefit the scores of us that enjoy providing healthy treats for our kids.

These things are just plain disgusting.
If you are ever in need of emegency rope, get these, but otherwise I doubt they are fit for human consumption.
It feels and tastes like eating soft plastic, and I would hate to think what they do to your insides.
I have battled to even give some of these away, so they ended up in the trash can, where they rightfully belong

I'm sorry, but WHAT on God's Green Earth are these people talking about when they say "the highest quality wholesome ingredients???" The first ingredient listed is corn syrup, followed closely by sugar. God. I'm livid. Corn is a subsidized crop in this country and corn syrup is a MAJOR culprit in the obesity epidemic. Spare yourself. Eat a damn piece of fruit.

Many Thanks,
The Food Zealo

This purchase was done by my husband.(Need I say more, ladies?) This soup(if you can even call it that) was a waste of money. There was hardly any seafood in it at all, and what little there was, it was in small pieces. It was more like 'cream in a can'. My son and husband are both big soup eaters, and love chowder. Let's just say that he bought a case of the stuff and 10 cans are still sitting in the pantry awaiting the next garbage day! I will admit that I didn't try it...it didn't smell or look appealing. But if my husband (the human garbage can) says it's awful stuff, I take his word for it....and so should you!

It almost seems like I received a different soup based on the other 5 star reviews. The broth is thin, mostly cubed potatoes and very fishy smelling. Don't get me wrong, it was edible, but I won't be ordering another case of this flavor. I'm still waiting to receive the mushroom and blue cheese flavors

Edited Review: My first order came with leaking jars. Amazon replaced and the second order arrived in good condition. The one star, which I can't seem to change, reflected that fact. My updated review is three stars.

I was mildy disappointed in this topping. Out of the jar, the black olives and the artichokes provide a flavor that has definate sour notes. The texture of the ingrediants was pasty (as opposed to chunky). I would have given this only two stars if this was supposed to be a pasta sauce. However, I followed the directions on the jar to create their version of Bruschetta. It is acceptable. Since this is billed as a "topping" I am willing to give it three stars since in that capacity to performs at a pleasurable level.

The Vodka sauce is much more to my liking.

Although the product is very easy to use and the rice sticks together perfectly to make a sushi roll-----the rice is tasteless because it has neither mirin vinegar nor sugar nor salt in it (commonly called sushi vinegar)--------the nori wrappers are too small to make any decent sized roll and too thin to withstand any handling-------I have had better sushi rolls at the worst japanese restaurant---------the soy sauce is OK but without wasabi mustard you cannot achieve the taste of real sush

If you really like Chinese food, you might like this chicken stew. However, it was much too sweet tasting for my tastes.

The main reason that I give it 2 stars is that it contains the artificial sweetner Splenda (see "sucralose" in the ingredients), but that is not advertised anywhere on the package besides the small print in the ingredient list.

I personally don't eat or drink products that contain artificial sweetners for various reasons, and had I known the product contained Splenda, I wouldn't have purchased it honestly. It has the typical Splenda "after taste.

I too like the old smucker's filled strawberry better (aka fruit wheats), this is OK, but fruit filling is better. They probably switched because it got to expensive to make unless they starting making in china, thus you now have this nestle quick artificial strawberry tasting stuff

It's not quite as bad as I expected, but the Strawberry Delight flavor of the Frosted Mini-Wheats suffer most from how it looks, the unnatural pink color dyed into the wheat biscuits in such a way as to make them wholly unappetizing. Otherwise, it offers a sweetened taste that barely reminds me of real strawberries, at least to the point where you wonder what the point is to this variation from Kellogg's. One 42-gram serving, a mini-box, equals a higher-than-average 140 calories but only five are from fat. The other good news is that there is no measurable sodium and cholesterol to the cereal. I would think adding real strawberries or even dried berry variations would be preferable to this cereal, so I think I'll leave this as a pass

My product should have been delivered a month ago. This is very bad buisness to think that you can ship something whenever you feel like it. I am a paying customer that should have been reinbursed in some way for the mistake that your copany made.

I bought two flavors of Gloria Jeans k-cups. I loved the price. The coffee is wonderful(!), but I hate getting grounds in my coffee! I've had about 1 in 5 cups that have coffee grounds *under* the filter, so when the coffee brews they end up in my cup--about a 1/2 teaspoon per cup. Lower price = poorer manufacturing standards.

These were a sticky mess in the bag - the fruit juice leaked from the lollypops and leaked out of the plastic wrap. They were also soft and seemed stale. Great ingredients, but the final product was disappointing

I was trying these as a change of pace from the Turkey Jerky I normally eat. They taste ok (nothing special), but several of the medallions (in at least 3 bags so far) had 'crunchy' bits in them. I suspect it was gristle, or possibly small bone fragments. Not pleasant to eat.

I may have just gotten a bad batch (other than the crunchy bits, I'd give these a 4 star rating)

Not only is the popcorn incredibly salty, but they do not taste very crispy. Quite stale. Overall, disappointing.

I first bought Chipotle flavor and love that one. That is my favorite flavor. The Gouda flavor is much too salty for my taste, so I will not buy this flavor again. The quality of the popcorn and amount you get in this product is excellent. I will be trying other flavors in future, just not this one

I bought this just to try something new. I love peach and mango flavors, and this sounded very good. I do think it's a good drink, but whether or not I am able to think better because of it is up for debate. I doubt I'll buy these again if only because they are quite pricey. 12 small cans (the liquid volume is only a smidgeon over one cup) for over twenty dollars? It's close enough to $2 a can to make it not cost effective to get vitamins and minerals this way. The taste is good, but I have had lots of other healthy drinks that taste just as good for less than a third of the cost. But now I know, this drink is not for me. If you like good-tasting nutritious drinks that cost a LOT of money, this one's for you!

These are fine, if they weren't supposed to have blueberries. There are essentially none. Most pouches of the 24 don't even contain a piece of blueberry, when you do find one it's a very nice taste with the peanut, but sadly, that's very rare.
Avoid this variety

It is odd that my taste buds reported to me the opposite of the reviews here. I'm disappointed by that, as I paid this premium price based on the 5 star reviews.

I'm old enough to remember "old time" licorice that was sold for 1 cent (even 5 for a penny) and that is the flavor and consistancy that I was looking forward to when I purchased this licorice.

I have some anise spice in my cupboard for baking, and I just tasted it to make sure that I didn't have my spices mixed up. Based on that comparison; My verdict is that this licorice tastes strongly of anise (NOT licorice).

I thought it was much too soft. There was no "chew" to it. It was mushy. The only thing I can think to compare it with is a soft cheese, such as Havarti. It is even softer than a mild chedder.

Sorry... only 2 stars from me

The main ingredient should be SALT! 750mg per serving and there are 2 servings per can. Come on, we usually sweat or need more salt in the Summer, but we tend to eat more soup in the Winter. My first impression was "boy this is salty". It would be great as a gravy but so is a much cheaper Cambell's cream of mushroom.

Although I like to consider myself open to 'cultural cuisine', I found myself spitting this stuff out - after paying about $6 for it at a international marketplace. My significant other did the same. I like salty stuff, and I love licorice, but this was just plain nasty. Not only was it too salty, but it had a terrible rubbing-alcohol-type flavor that went up to my nose and made me wonder if perhaps the candy had been tampered with or manufactured incorrectly. I went online and read some other reviews...other people have had similar experiences. I guess it's one of those acquired tastes that has to be developed early. Oh, those Dutch!! I love 'em (but hate this "candy")

I gave it one star for the concept.

I'm a fan of Dave's hot sauces. His combination of smoky barbeque flavors and straight heat always gets my saliva going. But this spray had disappointing heat. In fact, there's nearly none that I could even discern. It also had poor flavor. It tastes like bad watery vinegar. So why buy the stuff if it doesn't taste good or get your endorphins pumping??

The oleo-resin from the habaneros which are supposed to give the spray heat like to come out of solution and pool up at the top of the bottle. So instead of a homogeneous red color, you get a blood red color floating on top of a pale yellow color and you have to shake furiously to get the spray looking normal again. I called Dave's about it and they told me that's typical behavior!

I was excited about this sauce because I always wanted a way to evenly disperse sauce onto pizzas, but all I got were over-priced spray bottles filled with something I really can't describe as edible. I'd fill it with another sauce but it'd probably just clog the nozzle.

It's also intended for use as a natural pest repellant. Dave's suggest spritzing some on your garden to keep the rabbits at bay. I've never tried so I wouldn't know if it works as claimed. I hope it does or there'd be no need for this product to exist at all

I ordered both this and Honey Nut version. I wish I had paid more attention to the Low Fat part of this version. This version is hard and too cinnamon/sugary which seems to happen w/ some low-fat cereals. They compensate for the low fat by sugaring it up and end up w/ a hard less tasty and less filling product. However, the Honey Nut version is very good. It has good crunch, but is not too hard and has tasty almond slivers in it. It's sweet, but not overly for granola, and no cinnamon taste at all. I understand many products w/ raisins add cinnamon and I typically like cinnamon, but this version is too much and the raisins too dried out and hard. The package is very convenient though.

I now have to mix in the regular version w/ this product to help me get rid of the Low Fat stuff.

Some label info: Low Fat w/ Raisin (LF) has 180 calories per 1/2 cup while Honey Nut (HN) has only 20 more at 200. There are 12 1/2 cup servings in the HN while the LF only has 10. Product weight is HN 24 oz and LF 20.5 oz. Finally sugars are HN 11g while the LF has 15g

I would LOVE to have the above item. Actually really wanted it so much that I called about it twice. BOTH times i was sent 6 oz. PACKAGES of pecans that I could have (but probably would not have) bought in any store. My husband is extremely fond of the CANNED pecans and was very excited when i told him i had located them on line. I don't have to tell you the disappointment when we were sent the others. Sorry but i'll have to really research the product before i order again.

I thought these muffins tasted like white rice bread which isn't very tasty. I've made my own muffins mixing brown rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch flour and they are a million times better. Won't buy these again. I expected these to be as close to the real thing as the Glutino crackers are to regular crackers(not the tomato basil but the plain ones) but they weren't

These apples are coated in sugar and other gunk (like sunflower oil) which gives them a strange taste. I was very disappointed when I tried them. I was wanting nice dried apples that taste like apples instead of oil, sugar and preservatives. Now I'm stuck with two bags of a product that is not very good. I also got stuck with the dried strawberries which are even worse. I will not be trying any more Stoneridge Orchard products. BE AWARE!!, these products cannot be returned to Amazon so be sure before you order

Soft, chewy, a little grainy but a good flavor. Mine were expired a week after I bought a whole 12 pack :(

Don't expect whole berries. Basically everything is ground together. Odwalla bar is much better. Definitely try the spirelina balls, though a little bit of a green flavor the energy/ginsing one is well worth the cost here- And NOT almost expired..

I purchased Diamond pecans in their shells in December '06 (note, not these, already shelled ones) and discovered AFTER the kids were eating them that they were all rancid. Be sure and check the dates (if you can, there weren't any on the in-shell nuts) because there's not much worse than ruining whatever you're trying to make with rancid nuts. I have learned to only purchase pecans from places with dates on the package or where I can smell and taste them

Perhaps it was just my microwave, or cooking it too long, but the two different types of this soup I have tried (Chicken with noodles, and chicken with rice) have both left a nasty metallic taste in my mouth that is very hard to get rid of.

I would have thrown it out, except it was the only thing I brought for lunch. I do NOT recommend this soup

I do agree that the quality is nothing to sneeze at. These fill me up, I know that they're pretty good for you, and I like the nutty essence too. I guess that I really was disappointed in the taste, though. The chocolate was slightly bitter-tasting, and took me by surprise. I love the other flavors, but this one is my leat favorite. I would recommend the almond butter balls before this one, they're soft and a little more on the sweet side

I eat pretty healthy and I'm always looking for new healthy snacks, especially sweet ones!! But this purchase was a real disappointment. The quality and quantity were fine, but the taste was totally lacking. If you've ever had "Dr. Fuhrman's Date Nut Pop'ems" this product is nothing like those. I would say the primary taste is "ground flax seed", not a bad taste, kind of mild, but certainly doesn't satisfy a sweet tooth

I was disappointed with this product. I love dried fruit but this product is overly sweet and does not have much strawberry taste. They have a strange smell but not a nice strawberry smell. They are very dark in color and moist from sunflower oil. Simple dried fruit without the oil and fructose additions would be much nicer. You should also know that this food product cannot be returned. I would have sent it back in a flash if I could have

OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty. They also have a burnt flavor. You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order. On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good. This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags). Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon

I thought these Gummi Bears tasted funny, like there was perfume in them. I have eaten other brands of Gummi Bears (or Gummi Bear wannabes), and these did not taste anything like those. The flavors were not very distinct or fruity. The texture was also very different and not very palatable. I know that these are vegan Gummi Bears and do not contain gelatin, and I assume that is why the texture is so different. However, I have eaten another brand (Sunny Bears) of gelatin-free "Gummi Bears", and their texture was very different, more like jelly candy. I would buy the regular Gummi Bears, but I am allergic to dyes and I can't find any that are dye-free except these and the Sunny Bears.

After I wrote to Amazon customer service about the product and explained to them that I could not stand to eat any more and wanted to return them, they immediately refunded my money - no questions asked - even though the product is not eligible for return because it is a grocery item. I was impressed

This type of machine just cannot make good espresso. Espresso must be made with a fine grind of beans, correct temperature of water, and high water pressure to extract the right amount of flavor from the beans for the right amount of time. With a quick/no-fuss machine like the Tassimo, some of these ingredients are missing from this machine's process, so the espresso turns out rather sour. Adding the latte milk covers up the worst of it, but it's not a great latte either. Stick with regular coffee in the Tassimo, and although it's not wonderful either, it might get you through the morning

"contains 50 percent more caffeine than other gourmet coffees "

This is because it is not arabica beans, which are the beans of quality coffee brewing. It is Rubusta, the cheap mostly vietnamese "filler" coffee mostly found ihn supermarket blends such as Folgers, Maxwell House, etc.

The flavor of burnt twigs but you get more caffeine. That's pretty much Robusta.

I guess it's ok since most people who go into starbucks ask for vanilla caramel almond suger drinks rather than caring about the coffee... or is it because they've never been told that there is big flavor a difference between arabica and robusta and they incorrectly believe that if they order without all of the suger flavoring they'd taste Folgers (Or Shock)?

If you like coffee - good coffee - stick to arabicas. If you like good coffee flavor and also lke more caffeine then just find a lighter roast of arabicas.

If all you want is caffeine you'll look smarter if you avoid the markeing silliness of Shock and buy NoDoze.

Two of the six packages were beginning to mold, but not even close to the expiration date. One other package was visibly torn. I was curious to see if any of the packs were still sealed air-tight, so I placed them in water. Five of the packs were exposed to air with small opening around the seal. I imagine that they burst somewhere in their travels from changes in altitude/pressure. I cannot vouch for the actually taste of the product as I did not eat them. The silver lining: Amazon has GREAT customer service

Do not be fooled by this sugar coated seemingly delectable pastry! I have been a long time fan of the original Pop-Tart and the Go-Tart just seemed like the natural progression of things, so I went along with the newest technology in mass produced baked goods. The Go-Tart offers you a Pop-Tart on the go, because everyone knows this is the 21st century and we are on the move. I'm venturing to guess that Go-gurt was a success so why not make a Go-Tart? Well, there are a number of reasons. Actually just one. You can already eat a Pop Tart on the go.
It's too bad the Go-Tart ruined everything I loved about the Pop-Tart. The greatest hope I had for this flop of a product was that the frosting (or what you'd like to call that sugary stuff on the top) would reach the corners of the tart, unlike the original Pop-Tart. Though the sugar covers the corners, there is barely any frosting at all on this tart! It is but a thin line of the sugary goodness we would all expect from a normal Pop-Tart. The filling has a gooey consistency, and worst of all, the breading part crumbled in my hand. I had to eat my Go-Tart in pieces. This is clearly not on the go. This is worse than a Pop-tart, and is probably more fattening than one. Save your money, boycott the Go-Tart

My own fault for not reading the ingredients - but the marketing info on this product is extremely misleading.
Basically, it's a $10 bag of blueberry candy. High Fructose Corn Syrup is the second ingredient - oil and flavoring also added. I don't have anything against candy but this stuff left my teeth tingling for hours after I ate it - I actually had to brush my teeth twice. This product should not be in the natural and organic category - don't waste your money

I love blueberries, both fresh and dried, but these have sugar added which makes them far too sweet for my taste. Dried fruit is always naturally sweet, added sweeteners just turn them into pure candy, instead of a naturally healthy snack. Thumbs down for this one

I was excited to get these but did not read the ingrediants before purchasing. Big mistake. To me they are far too sweet and almost sappy tasting. I dont feel like im eating something healthy rather some of those chewy snakcs they make for kids. The high fructose is insane and really i feel they would be better off with a fraction of what they add.

Beyond the glaring fact that most of their products aren't tomatoes, this one is a blight on the Just Tomatoes ethos.

"Just." But it has two ingredients. It's not "just" anything if it includes both bananas strawberries. They don't call Cracker Jack "Just Peanuts, Popcorn, and High Fructose Corn Syrup."

Nor is it "just" something when it comes in a package of 2. They don't call a variety pack of cereal "Just Grains and High Fructose Corn Syrup."

The Just Tomatoes folks deserve credit for their aspirations to purity but this just goes beyond it. It goes against the mimalist and reductive concept to the absolutely roccoco. It's just not right

There is no doubt that this tea does it's job, but the smell of it is awful. I normally don't have any problems eating or drinking mildly offensive things, but I have such an aversion to the smell of this tea. It has a top note of moldy, dank earth with a base note of acrid peppers gone bad. The box says that it contains "delicious sasparilla". I don't taste anything like sasparilla or rootbeer in it at all. If you can bear the smell and aftertaste then go for it

First, let me say that Ahmad tea is great tea for the price. This is not quite the same thing as great tea, but given the "price/performance" of Ahmad tea, I should rightly rate it four or even five stars.

So why only two stars?

Amazon claims you'll get the following six teas in each pack: "Ceylon Orange Pekoe; English Breakfast; Earl Grey; Darjeeling; English No. 1; Jasmine Green"

But instead of Jasmine Green, I got English Afternoon tea.

What you might not realize is that Ahmad's English Afternoon and English Tea No. 1 contain Bergamot. This is a citrus oil used to make Earl Grey, which is also included.

English Afternoon and English Tea No. 1 are both Earl Greys. The bergamot might be slightly weaker than in a traditional Earl Grey, but it's still obviously there. So half of this package is Earl Grey.

I don't really like Earl Grey tea.

If you really like Earl Grey teas, you might enjoy this. Otherwise stay far away

I've tried several brands of gluten-free pizza crusts, I bought the Ener-G as my latest product exploration. Being a huge fan of many of Ener-G products, I thought this one would be a slam dunk hit. How wrong I was. The Ener-G pizza crusts are too thin, dense, and heavy, with very little taste. You would think "thin" and "heavy" would be contradictory, but that's what I really mean to say. By contrast, the Kinnikinnick pizza crusts are light and fluffy, with such an outstanding declicious flavor. I would strongly suggest buying a single package of the Ener-G pizza crusts from your local health food store first. I made a mistake trusting Ener-G on this product before I bought a whole case of it. It was an expensive lesson. But, nonetheless, a huge thanks to Amazon for offering so many gluten-free products. Here in the US, we are just starting to become familiar with how many people are affected by gluten

I made the mistake of purchasing this 12 pack without testing it at the stores first due to glowing reviews on this site. I have a sweet tooth but these were so sweet that it was nauseating. I couldn't taste any caramel or other flavor, just straight sugar. If you are considering this product and haven't tasted it before, I highly recommend you purchase a small bag first so you don't waste your money

The quality of this tea is far below that of other matcha's I have tried. The packaging alone is careless and does not bespeak of the tender care that is typically given to green tea, particularly the fine powder. I would not purchase this product again. The quantity that I do have, I will cut with other better tea rather than waste it. If you do try this product, use care opening the package, because the tea is inside without any barrier to keep it from spilling

I was excited to try this product as I love Oreos, but don't like all the garbage that goes into them. We tried Newman-O's Originals...my wife went first, and the look on her face said it all. Still, I had to see for myself. We both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as Oreo cookies. For some reason, others seem to think they taste great. Just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large..

These dried cherries are more like candy than dried fruit. I was expecting a chewy, tart treat and got an instant sugar high instead. I will use the rest of the cherries in salads or on cereal, but I won't buy them again

I was very disappointed when I received the dried cherries. I did not realize that they included sugar and sunflower oil. When I opened the package you could feel the oil on the cherries. I had to rinse them in hot water before I could use them. This information is not included anywhere in the description

In Amazon's ultimate wisdom they will NOT return or exchange items from their grocery store even though it is in Beta status. I ordered these in good faith as they appeared to be the normal packaging but be warned that these contain Splenda and so may not be suitable for everyone. I'd avoid the Amazon grocery store at all costs going forwards

I thought this product had reasonably good taste, but I have two major issues with it.

First, they describe this as a Kettle Corn. It is not Kettle Corn - not even close. This is a caramel corn with a thick sweet coating. Real Kettle Corn is a slightly sweet, slightly salty popcorn.

Second, each very small bag has 1.5 servings in it. When was the last time you opened a small bag of snack food and only ate 2/3's of it? They purposely made the serving size unrealistic to make it look healthier. The whole point of paying for individual size bags is that it limits you to a set portion. Remember when a can of Coke had 1.5 servings in it? The FDA made them change the label. If you eat the whole bag, you are eating 200 calories of popcorn. No better that a bag of potato chips or a few cookies, so this is not a lesser evil - it's just the same old junk food with a new name.

I won't buy this product again. It's the same stuff you can get anywhere

I thought this would be a great-tasting, healthy snack after reading the reviews. Mine arrived safely and crunchy, unlike the other reviewer who got a bad batch. However, they were not sweet and tasty. My sister described it as tasting like cardboard. Now I have 5 whole bags I don't know what to do with. Maybe I'll put in a recipe and hope it turns out better. If you can, I'd recommend try before you buy

Do not buy Crunchies products in the Hot summer months. They are heat sensitive. As the packaging states "IMPORTANT- STORE IN COOL DRY AREA". The two cases I purchased arrived chewy and clumped together. They probably cooked during shipping and are not a "Raw Food" and not as "Nutritious" anymore. Two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened. Amazon.com does not accept grocery returns. It was a waste of $40.

I bought two flavors of Gloria Jeans k-cups. I loved the price. The coffee is good, but I hate getting grounds in my coffee! I've had about 1 in 5 cups that have coffee grounds *under* the filter, so when the coffee brews they end up in my cup--about a 1/2 teaspoon per cup. Lower price = poorer manufacturing standards

It is a quick meal when you need it, but hopefully you won't need it too often. I guess you can't expect too much from a two-minute meal, but it would be nice if you could expect more than this. It is an easy kosher meal when you don't have a kosher microwave

If you dont like mangos, you will not like this drink. It does not taste like an "organic" mango, but rather, it tastes more like the "essence of mango" you would smell from an air freshener. This does mix pretty well with cold rum.

I would suggest you find this brand locally to try it before you buy it. This water does not taste like the water you would get from the Asian countries. I cant really explain why either

Zico Coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut. If you never had coconut water before I would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12. Some people may say it's an aquire taste, but I think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised. I started drinking coconut water ever since I was a baby. It's very healthy and low in sugar. Currently I give it to my [...] son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices

This is unlike any other "bar" I've tried. I like that it's gooey green--I'm tired of the drier oat-like bars. It's satisfying tasty. May not be for everyone, though. I only wish more ingredient percentages would be listed on the Amazon descriptions--most of these things are pretty high fat. Ok for a meal on the run

These are by far the best tasting Spirulina bars in the market. The whole line is more desert like in concept, so of course they are sweet chewy. People with IBS probably should not eat finely chopped raw nuts and should read ingredients before buying!!

The food is safe for celiac, and most food allergens (AGAIN READ THE LABEL BASED ON YOUR DIETARY SITUATION!)

The bars travel very well and although they may bend and mush, because they are naturally moist and chewey, melting? Never. All the bars in this line travel great and can sit for months in hot or cold.

These are particularly good for athletes and people on the run.

Oh, and the price, come on, there is nothing else that even comes close for the size and quality

I've tried virtually all of the Back to Nature products and each and every one is sensational. Do yourself a favor and try this product. Highly recommended

Back to Nature Apple Strawberry Granola are an excellent product for a healthy breakfast or snack. Each flavor of the Back to Nature Granola is tasty.

I would be careful before ordering this product in bulk. My order of 6 bags came in this week and they are due to expire on September 15th. I did not realize before ordering that this product was getting ready to expire and would not have placed the order had I known this. As this is a food product it is not eligible for return.

So while this is an excellent product, I would not recommend ordering this from Amazon Grocery unless you are prepared to have a bulk order of food that is getting ready to expire

I have been using the Navitas Natural Organic Raw Cacao Nibs for four months now and it gives me a feeling of happiness, well being and energy for the day. We add it to our fruit smoothie in the morning. I don't eat chocolate with dairy and sugar as it gives me pimples. However I can tolerate the nibs.

These little nibs are very bitter. I wouldn't recomend poppin them straight from the bag. They were fabulous melted in a pan with some sweetner, dip with chunked fruit, lay on tray covered with wax paper, and refridgerate for 20 min. The chocolate hardens. Raspberries are my families' favorite but any fruit works! Also, very good sprinkled in warm milk for a homemade hot chocolate. This is a great product for experimental food people. Straight out of the bag... disappointing

I have become rabid about avoiding trans fats and any product with partially hydrogenated oils that calim to have zero trans fat. This led to me shopping in health food stores/Whole Foods for anything in the cracker/cookie/snack category. I once searched for graham crackers and vanilla wafers with no partially hydrogenated oils in 3-4 supermarkets and couldn't find any, so I went to Whole Foods near my job. I saw these crackers and bought the Cheddar flavor and loved them. I have since bought the wheat and ranch flavors.

Who doesn't love a snack with a serving size of 50 bunnies?

I have enjoyed "Goldfish" and other cheese-based snack crackers since I was a child, but no more. I tried these Cheddar Bunnies as I have enjoyed other products by Annie's, and have now found my all-time favorite snack cracker.

From a nutritional standpoint, they are better than many competing products as they have no hydrogenated oils or artificial flavors, and are made from organic ingredients, including real Wisconsin cheddar cheese. The packaging does an excellent job of preserving freshness, the taste is natural and very refreshing for a snack food, and the price is comparable to other non-organic products.

I am completely satisfied with these crackers: the are a good value, they compare favorably in the nutritional realm with competitors (although they really don't qualify as "health food," of course,) they taste fantastic, and last but not least, they're fun

Bear Naked All Natural Granola (Apple Cinnamon) is a delicious and nutritious way to start or add a little treat to your day. As a breakfast cereal(it also is sold in larger 12 oz packages of 6), you'll be scraping the bottom of the bowl to get just that last little bit more. It's sweet enough so you do not have to add sugar. Just use with low-fat milk, soy or "Lactaid"(another great product for those who are lactose intolerant) for a low-calorie, high energy starter. Nice chunk-size pieces that are both chewy and crunchy and don't get all soggy.You can really taste the apple-cinnamon in this one. The ingredients(which are "Bearly Processed and Utterly Naked") are: whole grain oats(good carbs), wildflower honey,expeller pressed canola oil, walnuts(smart fats), apples, coconut, almonds, oat bran, crisp rice(rice an barley malt), natural flavors, whole grain flax, sesame seeds and cinnamon. There are 7 gr fat, 1.5 sat. fat no trans fat, no cholesterol, no sodium, 17gr carbs, 3 grms dietary fiber, 5 gr sugar(probably from the fruit and honey) and 3 gr protein. 140 total calories per serving(1/4 cup, which I think is a little small for breakfast)),of course that is before you add the milk, so don't forget to add that in if you are counting calories.

Makes a great pick-me-up snack or dessert too! Eat 'em right out of the bag. There are plenty of good size chunky bits. The only problem is that no matter how much you shake it up, after the chunks are gone, there is only crumbs, which are hard to eat as a snack, could get a little messy. But..You can always add those crumbs to a carton of Yogurt or a topping for frozen Yogurt, for a little extra flavor.

This 12 pack of 2 oz bags is a really good deal price wise, compared to the grocery store. There are a good variety of different tastes and flavors.We also liked the banana nut quite a bit, but found the "peak protein" package bland. I only wish that there was a variety pack for purchasing them in these bulk deals.

Click on the Bear Naked Link to see other products.
The package has a zip lock to maintain freshness and prevent spills. Throw 'em in your car, purse, backpack or gym bag.

Remember to breathe, eat healthy, and enjoy....Laurie

I bought the natural flavour. Didn't find it very palatable the first time. But the next time was much better and now I am hooked on to it! An acquired taste, indeed! The 11-ounce is difficult to down in one go, though.

If you dont like mangos, you will not like this drink. It does not taste like an "organic" mango, but rather, it tastes more like the "essence of mango" you would smell from an air freshener. This does mix pretty well with cold rum.

I would suggest you find this brand locally to try it before you buy it. This water does not taste like the water you would get from the Asian countries. I cant really explain why either

Excellent. One of the few food items I've found on here that I think I'll buy again. Remember that it's best chilled/ice cold, if you're ever gonna sample it. Not so good when not so cold, great when actually cold. Very refreshing feel either way, though, after you've had a drink

Zico Coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut. If you never had coconut water before I would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12. Some people may say it's an aquire taste, but I think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised. I started drinking coconut water ever since I was a baby. It's very healthy and low in sugar. Currently I give it to my [...] son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices

If you have ever had trouble with leg cramps, be sure to drink Zico. It will relieve your cramps almost instantly probably because it is so high in potassium. I have recommended it to others and it always works. Pat Rampolla

Bear Naked is my favorite granola and Fruit and Nut is by far my favorite flavor. I came across Bear Naked because one of my favorite breakfast's is granola mixed with banana and yogurt. When I went off of refined sugar I was having the hardest time finding a granola without sugar added. Bear Naked uses all natural sugars like pear juice and maple syrup. My favorite part of this flavor is the dried cranberries and the coconut, plus the almonds add crunch to an overall chewy texture. I recommend this brand to all lovers of granola and to anyone looking for a healthy treat

Bear Naked Granola is just fabulous. I've tried every granola around, and Bear Naked strikes the right balance between crunchy, sweet, and ostensibly, good for you. And Amazon's price certainly beats what you'd pay at the store.

I hesitate to write a review about a food because, well, one man's meat is another man's poison ... I like the not-too-sweet and minimally processed taste of this brand; the Banana flavour is our favourite. The Fruit and Nut flavour lacks a little oomph and the fruit inside is too tangy for my taste buds (so maybe TOO minimally processed?). Also, remember that 'All Natural' is NOT organic, even if you find this in the health food section of your grocery store. Our local Target also carries this brand of granola and has the best price for it

I love granola and cereal in general, but I have to say that this is the very best granola I have ever had. The people at Bear Naked have a philosophy that I love, and which is on the back of every bag: "we believe food should be hand-made from wholesome and natural ingredients you can actually pronounce." Although I do eat processed food, I appreciate the appeal of the more traditionally prepared foods, and this granola tops the list for nutrition and taste.

Like most granola, it is high in calories and fat, but take note that the fat comes largely from the nuts contained (it also contains expeller pressed canola oil), and it has no trans fat, and only 1.5g of saturated fat per serving. This cereal is softer than most granola, though not soft enough for me to consider it chewy. It does have large chunks of nuts and also contains cranberries and flax seed, for optimal nutritional and digestive health.

The six-pack sold on Amazon makes the price per package reasonable (the ingredients are quite expensive), so as a value proposition, I think this is not only a great product, but a great buy.

Delicious and nutritious: a great combination that I recommend highly

This is the second time I've bought these for my dog. Although they are not dog treats, my dog loves them. She is very special to me, so I get her the best. This is a great price for these slim jims. If I buy them in the store I pay alot more for them. I've tried them also their very good. They come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time. Just like the ones they sell in the stores. If you buy them one at a time at .25C a piece you pay $25.00 dollars for them. I think this is a great value!

I bought the natural flavour. Didn't find it very palatable the first time. But the next time was much better and now I am hooked on to it! An acquired taste, indeed! The 11-ounce is difficult to down in one go, though.

If you dont like mangos, you will not like this drink. It does not taste like an "organic" mango, but rather, it tastes more like the "essence of mango" you would smell from an air freshener. This does mix pretty well with cold rum.

I would suggest you find this brand locally to try it before you buy it. This water does not taste like the water you would get from the Asian countries. I cant really explain why either

Zico Coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut. If you never had coconut water before I would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12. Some people may say it's an aquire taste, but I think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised. I started drinking coconut water ever since I was a baby. It's very healthy and low in sugar. Currently I give it to my [...] son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices

If you have ever had trouble with leg cramps, be sure to drink Zico. It will relieve your cramps almost instantly probably because it is so high in potassium. I have recommended it to others and it always works. Pat Rampolla

I personally like the taste of this product, but I can see that others may not. The taste is unusual, with natural tones.

I definitely like the packaging. Standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time, but a box of Zico survived a 2-week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine.

I've been wanting to try Spirulina, the superfood that everyone in the health world swears by, and figured this would be as good an opportunity as any to do so. The bar is a medium sized green rectangle. It smells interesting and is very moist and chewy. I'm not a big fan of sour foods, so I didn't like that it tasted a bit sour. My [...] brother however LOVED this bar more than all the others we tried. Has a lot of cashew and is very sweet and packed with good fats. VERY FILLING! Overall if you like sour and sweet, this bar is for you

I have become rabid about avoiding trans fats and any product with partially hydrogenated oils that calim to have zero trans fat. This led to me shopping in health food stores/Whole Foods for anything in the cracker/cookie/snack category. I once searched for graham crackers and vanilla wafers with no partially hydrogenated oils in 3-4 supermarkets and couldn't find any, so I went to Whole Foods near my job. I saw these crackers and bought the Cheddar flavor and loved them. I have since bought the wheat and ranch flavors.

Who doesn't love a snack with a serving size of 50 bunnies?

I have enjoyed "Goldfish" and other cheese-based snack crackers since I was a child, but no more. I tried these Cheddar Bunnies as I have enjoyed other products by Annie's, and have now found my all-time favorite snack cracker.

From a nutritional standpoint, they are better than many competing products as they have no hydrogenated oils or artificial flavors, and are made from organic ingredients, including real Wisconsin cheddar cheese. The packaging does an excellent job of preserving freshness, the taste is natural and very refreshing for a snack food, and the price is comparable to other non-organic products.

I am completely satisfied with these crackers: the are a good value, they compare favorably in the nutritional realm with competitors (although they really don't qualify as "health food," of course,) they taste fantastic, and last but not least, they're fun

Bear Naked All Natural Granola (Apple Cinnamon) is a delicious and nutritious way to start or add a little treat to your day. As a breakfast cereal(it also is sold in larger 12 oz packages of 6), you'll be scraping the bottom of the bowl to get just that last little bit more. It's sweet enough so you do not have to add sugar. Just use with low-fat milk, soy or "Lactaid"(another great product for those who are lactose intolerant) for a low-calorie, high energy starter. Nice chunk-size pieces that are both chewy and crunchy and don't get all soggy.You can really taste the apple-cinnamon in this one. The ingredients(which are "Bearly Processed and Utterly Naked") are: whole grain oats(good carbs), wildflower honey,expeller pressed canola oil, walnuts(smart fats), apples, coconut, almonds, oat bran, crisp rice(rice an barley malt), natural flavors, whole grain flax, sesame seeds and cinnamon. There are 7 gr fat, 1.5 sat. fat no trans fat, no cholesterol, no sodium, 17gr carbs, 3 grms dietary fiber, 5 gr sugar(probably from the fruit and honey) and 3 gr protein. 140 total calories per serving(1/4 cup, which I think is a little small for breakfast)),of course that is before you add the milk, so don't forget to add that in if you are counting calories.

Makes a great pick-me-up snack or dessert too! Eat 'em right out of the bag. There are plenty of good size chunky bits. The only problem is that no matter how much you shake it up, after the chunks are gone, there is only crumbs, which are hard to eat as a snack, could get a little messy. But..You can always add those crumbs to a carton of Yogurt or a topping for frozen Yogurt, for a little extra flavor.

This 12 pack of 2 oz bags is a really good deal price wise, compared to the grocery store. There are a good variety of different tastes and flavors.We also liked the banana nut quite a bit, but found the "peak protein" package bland. I only wish that there was a variety pack for purchasing them in these bulk deals.

Click on the Bear Naked Link to see other products.
The package has a zip lock to maintain freshness and prevent spills. Throw 'em in your car, purse, backpack or gym bag.

Remember to breathe, eat healthy, and enjoy....Laurie

Zico Coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut. If you never had coconut water before I would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12. Some people may say it's an aquire taste, but I think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised. I started drinking coconut water ever since I was a baby. It's very healthy and low in sugar. Currently I give it to my [...] son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices

This is the second time I've bought these for my dog. Although they are not dog treats, my dog loves them. She is very special to me, so I get her the best. This is a great price for these slim jims. If I buy them in the store I pay alot more for them. I've tried them also their very good. They come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time. Just like the ones they sell in the stores. If you buy them one at a time at .25C a piece you pay $25.00 dollars for them. I think this is a great value!

I have to say that this 100-count box is a great deal for your money. Although this isn't a "full size" Slim Jim but rather a shorter one, it's the perfect size for a lunch box surprise or a mid-afternoon pick-me-up. Slim Jim has managed, after all these years, to still provide the same taste of slightly spicy/slightly salty goodness, and you won't go wrong with the 100-count box.

These crackers are an excellent quality snack food. The classic cracker is a crispy, (Ritz-like) buttery cracker, with peanut butter inside, as described. I bought a box at our local supermarket, before committing to the 4 boxes, and the kids husband loved them! To save money, I bought them on Amazon. Each packet has 4 cracker sandwiches in them, so if you are like me, you'd like to know that your kids will eat the entire package! Most of the other brands have 6 in a pkg, so sometimes kids will toss what they can't finish during lunchtime. The cost is about 0.62 each, and convenient. I also purchased Back to Nature Mini Classic Creme Grab Go, and they are 0.52 each pkg. We eat ORGANIC, and (natural also) and the food lookslike other kids at school, but without the chemicals, GMO's, and hydrogenated fats...yuk!Eat healthy in 2007

These crackers are great for the natural, health-conscious family as well as anyone else who loves "goldfish" or other cheese crackers... They taste great and are all natural with organic wheat. Nothing weird - you can actually understand what every ingredient is! (how refreshing)

Plus, I love this new BIG box -- 12 oz instead of regular 7.5 oz. Not only does it save packaging and cabinet space, but it's a better price per ounce! Great for us because we go through them so fast. Now that these are available here, I also don't have to go to the store (some of my local stores don't carry the big size anyway).

These are really expensive at the leading national overpriced healthy food supermarket, and they are worth even the higher price. Don't worry about buying too many with the six pack - I was a little concerned about that when I bought here a few months ago, but my wife and I ate all of them easily. I'm not even the biggest fan of pumpkin seeds by themselves, but in these Euro-style flatbread crackers they add something really good to the flavor

I'm a vegetarian and although my husband isn't, he enjoys this soup just as much. The tofu in the mix creates a creamy texture. If you're expecting a "potato au gratin" flavor, you will be disappointed... However, if you've made homemade miso soup from scratch and like the taste, this product makes an excellent time-saving substitute. The tofu serves a source of protein and the seaweed provides medicinal minerals. This soup is excellent to drink when sick and remarkably soothes a sour stomach. My local health food store charges $5.30 per box of 4 packets. Amazon sells it for $2.66 a box. Substantial Savings

My wife and I have slightly different tasates in coffee, I like mine darker and she like a milder coffee. This one however is just right for both of us. I drink it daily without cream or sugar (which I only do when I actually enjoy the flavor of the coffee). And we are on our second 5 pound bag! I wish we had found this coffee sooner, it is great

For anyone who needs a shelf-stable, quick lunch option, this is the one! The soup is delicious and the prep couldn't be easier, plus I love that you can prepare and eat it right in the bowl. I always make sure I have a few of these in my desk drawer at work, so I never have an "I forgot my lunch" issue, and the portion is big enough to actually constitute a full meal (for lunch anyway). I love the Udon flavor, and my husband swears by the Miso

Authenic but a little bland for me. I add Ponzu sauce to taste and make sure it gets really HOT in the micriwave. If steaming when you take it out, it tastes better. Pre Rinsing the noodles (as directed) is nonsense. Just cover them with good clean water (I never use TAP) stir in the sauce and toppings and nuke it about 90 seconds, uncovered. Stir and serve. It had everyone in MY OFFICE drooling with questions! Best price is on Amazon, just order 2 so you don't pay shipping.

I've tried several of the Annie Chun flavors, and I liked most of them, but the Kimchi soup is just unbelievably delicious! This is the BEST packaged soup product of any kind that I have ever tried, and I usually dislike canned or packaged soup products. This is even better than my favorite canned Brunswick Stew that I have loved for so long!

It is moderately spicy, but if you don't mind a bit if spice, this one is just too good to pass up. I could practically live off of this stuff!

Thank you, Annie Chun, for making a packaged meal worth eating

This Annie Chun's udon soup is very easy to prepare. I don't think the first step is necessary either. Just add the water to the noodles and dried vegetables, cover it with the lid and microwave it for about 3 1/2 minutes. Add the sauce packet. The noodles loosen up after you stir it. If you what a more filling soup, add meat/vegetables. My kids and I really love this soup! I just purchased more from Amazon, because it's a better buy here than at the grocery store

I moved from Northern California to the Ozark Mountains of northern Arkansas. I can get Starbucks at the nearby grocery stores or more expensive "gourmet" coffees, but that's about it. I have been on the lookout for robust,full flavored whole bean coffees at reasonable prices. I tried Pete's espresso blend and liked it, but it wasn't available the last time I checked. So I tried this Fogbuster and I like it even more. Good thing, since it comes in a 5 lb. bag. If you like Starbucks French Roast, this compares quite favorably

This sparkling juice really holds up to the description. It has the perfect amount of carbonation (not too much, not too little), is crisp to the taste, and is very refreshing. The 8 oz. cans sounded pretty weak, but it turns out that one can is the perfect amount for a sitting.

Since first tasting Martinelli's sparkling apple cider at a New Year's celebration over a decade ago, I've been a huge fan of carbonated apple drinks, but none have been "just right." Naturally, I've tasted the types that I've come across over the years, including: Martinelli's sparking cider (which is kind of sweet tasting and not generally bottled for everyday consumption), Martinelli's sparkling apple juice (a bit under-carbonated), Apple Beer (non-alcoholic, good but has a slightly odd taste), Appletiser (UK only, good, but UK only), and a few other local organic brands.

All of the aforementioned beverages are good on occasion, but seriously... none compare to essn's Sparkling Fuji Apple Juice. Yeah, it is a little pricey, but its worth it

Check the company's website. They select cook their tuna differently, and that's what makes their tuna the best. It has the lowest possible mercury (same as salmon and much lower than regular tuna) plus they cook it only once, after it's canned, so all the healthy vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids are still there in the can! Plus, Amazon has it for a great price

This is just what I've been needing for a power lifting diet, or optimal health in general. The flavor of the meat is not masked by salt. Yet, the aroma is not as overpouring as other brands. Great stuff! Four stars only because it is $3.75 per can.

I bought this jerky at a Xmas lot a couple of years ago and everyone raved about it. This year they were sold out but I was lucky to find it on Amazon..even less expensive! This is the best you can find..the ones in the market to do not even compare. Believe me...it does not last long in our house! Would definetly recommend the original and other flavors...they are all great

My packaged arrived much quicker than I had anticipated. Since living in the Midwest the last 5 yrs I've had limited access to beef jerky. I accidentally ran into 'Oberto' beef jerky which was fine just extremely salty and overly seasoned. World Kitchens beef jerky tasted very natural and delicious, I purchased it based on reviews and cravings and I would definitely purchase again. Superb beef quality, texture and flavor. Thank you

I've used this product for recipes such as chicken pot pie and shepherds pie. To get height, I whip the batter in my stand mixer to ensure lots of air bubbles are trapped to support the mix as it cooks. They've turned out great and you can't tell it's gluten-free. I've had less luck making biscuits out of it -- came out hard -- but that seems to be a hazard in any gluten-free flour mix

They were thick, like Bisquick biscuits. They tasted great. Would be WONDERFUL in Chicken Dumplings...
The only thing I did wrong when making them, was using Bob's Red Mill sAll purpose gluten free flour to roll the biscuit dough in. It made the outside of our biscuits taste like raw beans... yuck! I used White Rice flour, and they tasted great ;)
For a "buttery" flavor, put butter (or, if you are GFCF a non-casien containing margarine spread) on the top for a taste similar to KFC. Taste great with jelly in the middle, too. :) I froze the unbaked "left-over" biscuits, and they turned out well 2 months later. :

I take these to work along with little minature milks I pick up at the convenient store. They're quite filling and get me through to lunch just fine. And they're not too bad for you either. Considering they're all the "sugary" cereals your Mom complained about when you were a kid. In fact the one with the highest calorie count (280) is the Rasin Bran, and that's something that would actually be considered "healthy". All the rest fall into the 160-220 range

I like Pop-Tarts, as does my family, and I was thrilled to see Go-Tarts and even more thrilled when we tasted them. You do not need to put these little guys in the toaster; they are ready to dance about in your mouth without any heating and this is a good feature. I often look for little snacks that I can take with me on long or short trips. Sometimes a nibble keeps mouths occupied and stress down just when you need a little quiet in the car; these are great for that or any other time you want a quick snack. I tasted the Frosted Strawberry and it is very good. Give them a try, great for a quick snack at home or on the go

Man, these things are good. I used to eat Pop-Tarts all the time, but it eventually got to the point that a) I got tired of Pop-Tarts and b) they seemingly just stopped making them like they used to. Instead of being good and soft like they're supposed to be, Pop-Tarts morphed into hard pastries that felt and tasted like they had been left out in the air for a couple of days. These new Go-Tarts, at least the frosted strawberry ones, are just right - soft pastries with just the right amount of strawberry inside them to give you that elusive strawberry twang taste (some of you may know what I'm talking about here). These things are ready to eat right out of the pack - so "ready to eat," in fact, that there's a message on each package stating that you should not put them in a toaster or microwave. If you're the daredevil sort and insist on breaking Kellogg's prescribed rules, I can't stop you - but don't blame me if your microwave explodes or something.

Of course, one little 1.2 oz. bar isn't enough for anyone bigger than a Chihuahua puppy, so volume is an important factor here, which is where these multi-pack boxes come in so handy. With 140 calories per bar, I don't guess these things will be making any of Jenny Craig's diet plans any time soon, but I say life's too short - eat all you want. And, with these individually wrapped bars, you won't face the classic Pop-Tart dilemma of having to choose between eating two pastries now or putting one back in the box, knowing that it will taste even more stale later because you've already freed it from its freshness-preserving little tinfoil wrapper thingy

This is a great product. The golden flax is slightly better tasting than the brown. Its good enough to put in muffins and (for us) toppings such as apple bake where you can taste it. We actually do consume enough to justify buying it buy the box. We also consume it in shakes but its best when baked- works great in cornbread too. We also get stone ground flours and cornmeals, and these three make up a lot of value in this department. Flax oil of course is very high in short chain Omega 3's. Fish oils are better, but if you have the other nutrients and enzymes in your body you can make the long ones from the ones in flax- hence this product fulfills this need very well (flax is very concentrated in short chain 3's). Did I mention it actually tastes great in baked goods? Bob's Red mill is a quality product

I have tried to lose weight for a long, l o n g, time. Also for a long, l o n g time, I have seen newpaper advertizements for this tea. It seemed ridiculous to me at first.... I mean, lose weight by DRINKING TEA? This idea had just about as much credibility to me as some of those sauna belts, (which can help you lose weight for a full 24 hours....after which time it comes back again!)

Well, last year I was getting pretty desperate. I had somehow managed to lose 40 pounds....by drinking only regular tea, instant coffee, and home-made lemonade, and eating only Bird's Eye Vegetables and turkey. (In fact, I have invented the "Turkey Diet"! It's very simple: Eat Turkey, Fall Asleep (from the tryptophan!).....and if you fall asleep, you can't eat, you see. A variation, I guess, on the "Hollywood Diet", which can be used only on weekends....because most people need to stay awake during the week to go to work!) Anyway, this diet worked for me....but it was pretty boring....took most of my free time away, and....turkey is expernsive! I gradually stopped this diet, and gradually got back 20 of those 40 pounds. I looked desperately for another way to lose weight....but drinking tea to do it just didn't logical....

However, no other method presented itself that was as inexpensive as drinking tea....and after all that expensive (but delicious!), turkey, it seemd a good way to go. Now, this particular tea itself IS quite expensive -- $43 for 4 ounces, (on sale....ouch!)....but the 4 ounces of lose tea would make at least 60 6 ounce cups, (360 ounces...and I'd of course be adding my own water and sweetener)....so I figured, why not? (Well...because of the possible bad taste, that's why not. I've tried herbal teas in the past, and -- with the delicious exception of Jasmine Tea -- thoroughly disliked each one.) But even so, I decided to risk it...I've tasted far worse things than herbal tea, after all....

So, about a year ago, I sent away for it.

When the Wu-Long tea arrived, (in a lovely little transparent green plastic bag, lined with aluminum foil, giving the impression of a crushed green diamond), I made it and drank it. Hmmm, (or rather, "Mmmm!") Not bad tasting at all! It tasted like the best black tea...the kind, (other than Jasmine), that I like the best. But,,,,as the tea was SO expensive, I decided not to drink it too often....

As the owner of a "healthy refrigerator", (one LOADED with vitamins, which I take only in emergencies, because I can't afford to keep buying them), I now had this "healthy tea", which I put in the refrigerator to keep it fresh), to sort of keep the vitamins company! I did throughly read the literature that came with the tea, however....and noticed that many people had praised the MEDICINAL qualities of this tea, along with it's weight-loss abilities. Hmmm.... I decided that I had happily gotten more than I bargained for....a weight-loss tea AND one which helpoed with other health problems. Nice to get such a bargain -- but, at $43 for 4 ounces of lose tea, it was still quite expensive. And so, after that first cup, I restrained myself from drinking it, for quite some time.....

Actually, I didn't drink another cup until about two weeks ago! I was beginning to feel as if the minor cut I had gotten the week before had somehow let an infection in, (though the cut itself didn't look infected.)
Anyway, I was beginning to feel very, Very, VERY w....e....a...k..... Two years ago, in fact, I was hospitalized with an infection....the very same infection that killed my mother the month before! My mother, in the hospital, had said that she "felt like a vegetable", and, having gotten the same infection, I knew how accurate that description really was: I was SO weak, then, in fact, I had had trouble raising my arms above my head! And now I felt it was starting to happen again! My first thought was to call 911. But my second thought was, strangely, concentrated on those glowing testimonials I had read from other customers who had used Wu-Long tea. I figured I'd try to make myself a cup....if the tea didn't work, I could always call 911.... After all, though I felt very weak, I didn't feel totally paralzyed....yet, anyway. But I knew I had to make and drink that tea fast.....before total weakness engulfed me. Did I feel up to doing so? Yes....I F...took my time, I F...I was very careful, and...I F.. I stayed very near the telephone as I made the tea....just in case....

I managed to make myself the cup of tea....to wait for it to cool down a bit....and to drink it. Within an hour, the feeling of weakness had left me! And, as of this writing....taking place a full two weeks later....the weakness, (and presumably the infection), have not come back!
(OH, IF ONLY I HAD HAD THE COURAGE TO BUY THIS TEA ..T W O.. YEARS AGO, AND GIVE IT TO MY WONDERFUL MOTHER!!!!!!)

Now, I'm not saying this tea will work miracles for everyone, and in every circumstance. The tea did NOT transform my looks to those of Princess Grace, (whom I consider the most beautiful woman of all time), and have NOT cured me of a very slight case of Myasthenia Gravis...a neuro-muscular ailment which I have had since the age of four. I DOUBT very much that it has made me immortal, and I know for a fact that it has NOT granted me super-powers, or the ability to fly, or to transcend time.
(No one has ever accused me of not having a good imagination! : ) HOWEVER, UPON DRINKING THAT TEA, MY FEELINGS OF INFECTION, (a feeling of weakness quite different from that of Myasthenia Gravis), DID GO AWAY! I don't remember what the other testimonals for this tea were....but I'm sure, now, that at least 98% of them are true!

Perhaps there is no real "fountain of youth". But this tea...which seems to cure many ailments, and most probably helps one lose weight as well, if taken often enough, seems a very close second. Ponce de Leon would have been happy with it, I'm sure. I don't know if it will help everyone...but I do know it helped me, (and probably the other people who gave testimonials, too.) And that second cup of tea -- even the whole 4 ounces of lose tea -- are certainly less expensive than going to the hospital! For those on a budget, like me, Wu-Long tea is, it seems, destined to be used as a luxury, and/or in an emergency. But I really feel it belongs in every home.....just like aspirin does. And -- for emergency use...PLEASE take the same precautions I did: 1) Be sure you do have the energy to actually make and drink the tea, and 2) Be near a telephone, so you can call 911, in case the tea doesn't work for you.

The tea did work for me, in the above circumstance, anyway. An elixir of life? Perhaps and perhaps not, depending on the person and the circumstances. All I know is, that for me, and under the circumstances described above, it certainly seems to have saved mine!

For people with who need to eat something between meals to keep their blood sugar levels up, these Peanut Butter Balls are a godsend. Many's the time I've felt the familiar lightheadness and oncoming headache from low blood sugar and been saved by these things. I always carry one in my pocket or purse, and keep one in the glove compartment.

This snack is superb in several ways. First it is very good tasting. The flavor is very much like a soft peanut butter cookie. Nutritionally, it has quite a bit of protein, very very low in simple carbohydrates (or sugars) and is high in fiber.

I carry these with me to work and eat one in the morning and one in the afternoon to help me keep away from junk foods and excessive caffeine.

These would be excellent to carry with you on a hiking trip

Although I was a little put off by a prior review that indicated this product was nearly inedible, we had purchased this salmon jerky at Trader Joe's in smaller packets and really liked it, so we decided to purchase here at Amazon much less expensively. Yes, this product is very dry, but it also has none of the preservatives included in some of the more moist jerky products out there. My family liked it, and we are placing a second order. That other reviewer should send her inedible seven extra packages our way

Even though I know it's important to eat breakfast, I seldom do it; I'd rather sleep a little longer. These breakfast bars are a nice easy way to solve the problem. I keep a box in the car and munch on them on the way to work in the morning...they're whole grain, nice and filling, and taste good to boot. They're also a nice treat on the way home. The Oats and Honey are my favorite, but the variety pack provides a nice change. All of the flavors are tasty: peanut butter, cinnamon, maple sugar - all yummy

Excellent green decaf tea at a great price. We love this tea. It has a strong delightful green tea taste and its decaf too. By comparison, many other green teas are too dry tasting for me. And I like the convenience of the 40 tea bag size boxes as we drink a lot of this tea. Its great hot and good iced too

Add Mayonaise to anything and I love it. That is espcially true of this white albacore tuna. Being packed in water lowers the calories and it's fat free but it needs something to moisten it.... like mayo. It's delicious and totally clear of any dark tuna meat if you abhor even the slightest amount of dark tuna meat in your salad. The tuna are supposedly wild caught in dolphin safe nets so are therefore hopefully lower in Mercury content. Plus there is nothing added to the product so it's truly all natural. I happen to like dark as well as white tuna but if you only like the white like so many of my family and friends then this is the brand to buy

I love eating a lot of cereal in the morning. Like anybody, I really don't choose a cereal that is just good for you, I really choose it for taste. I loved Special K before when it was plain flakes, but I absolutely love it even more with the addition of red strawberries. This cereal tastes even better with each morsel and bite with the addition of strawberries. I like how delightful the strawberries taste after I add the milk into the cereal. This is a great buy for anybody who loves Special K cereal, or for anyone who just hasn't considered that special challenge.

I like sardines, much to my wife's dismay. I can eat them right out of the can. However, skinless and boneless they have to be and that is becoming an expensive variety.

How nice it was, then, to find that Amazon is selling the Reese brand at very attractive prices. I've tried both the 3.75 and 4.375 oz cans, in olive oil of course--purchase 30 or 40 cans at a time--and have been quite well pleased.

I prefer the larger can. In my experience, the 4.375 is packed with smaller sardines that tend to have a more delicate taste. At least that was my opinion respecting those that are netted and packed in Morocco, as most sardines that I have been buying are.

That brings me to the single problem I encountered in a recent purchase of the 4.375 oz Reese product. While the web page for it called it out as a product of Morocco, what arrived was a product of Portugal. The box graphics as shown on the website was different, too, and the sardines were larger and firmer than those of Morocco.

Although, still tasteful and a great value, too, I prefer the Moroccan variety. It's that more delicate taste that I seek. For most and for me, as well, the product source is certainly a minor point, but I did call the issue to Amazon's attention.

Amazon is great when it comes to feedback and actually seeks it, but I do not know how my comments were ultimately dealt with. The website still shows the product as Moroccan and package graphics different than the packaging that I received.

Of course, the website includes info and pictures that Reese provides. Reese probably shipped the Portuguese variety without advising Amazon of the change. It could be that I will not know what is actually being shipped until I make my next purchase

For a working mom, these are the best. Quick, easy - heck, my four -year-old can make them! Price-wise? I'm a cheapskate and only bought these when they were on sale for $1 a bag. Amazon offers them for less. The garlic cheddar biscuits, BTW, are the closest things I've found to the Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuits...and SO EASY

Flavored coffee creamers have been a guilty pleasure of mine for a long time now, but even if you buy the sugar-free kind, you're ingesting a whopping 1 gram of fat per tablespoon of creamer. As if that weren't bad enough, it's partially HYDROGENATED!
Splenda Flavor Blends is a wonderful alternative if you're like me and just can't face black coffee. Please note that this is not a creamer. It sweetens/flavors coffee. If you find you just have to have creamer to "tame" down your coffee you can add a Splenda Flavor blend and a splash of skim milk or if you like things more creamy, buy some powdered non-fat milk and add that along with the Splenda Flavor blends.
Lots of times, I find products with Splenda already in them to be too sweet but I didn't think that was the case with this. All three of the available flavors (hazelnut, mocha, vanilla) taste great without being overpowering.
Finally, now I can kick that fatty creamer bad habit!

Finally a flavored sugar! Splenda is awesome (does not create sugar imbalance in your body, which is the #1 weight gainer)! The mocha is absolutely the best of the three offered, and I am a French Vanilla fan, usually. The French Vanilla is a close second and the Hazelnut is a distant third. One packet of flavored and one plain packet is perfect for one travel sz. mug (14oz). No need to use two flavored packets as one packs a pretty good punch, which is good since they are a little pricey. The only "con" is that they are difficult to open since there is no small start-tear on the top. You have to open it with your teeth and they are the tall plastic packets Vs. regular sugar size paper ones. A stupid "con", I know, but nothing can be perfect, can it?

Of the several brands of agave nectar that I have tried, this one is by far the best. It has the least "taste" to it - it is just sweet (very similar to simple syrup that you would make with sugar and water)

I've been using Agave in my tea, coffee, cooking and on pancakes for over a year. I'm a type 2 diabetic, and need something with a low glycemic index. This product is the best - and it tastes wonderful. My kids don't miss honey on their pancakes any more, and this keeps everyone from having sugar highs and crashes.

Highly recommend

I tried Pure Bars after seeing them reviewed on a health website. The site waxed poetic about the flavor, as well as the extremely high quality ingredients, but I figured "right -- these bars all end up tasting like dates no matter what flavor they are". Well, I stand corrected, the flavor on these bars is excellent and is by far the best I've tasted (and I've tasted quite a few). That's a real bonus, considering the fact that the ingredients are completely raw and organic and the whole bar is relatively low on the glycemic index. To those unfamiliar with raw food bars, take note: if you're expecting any of them to taste like "granola" bars or candy bars, you'll be disappointed. Think fruit sweet instead and your expectations will be met. I can also vouch for the fact that my 2.5 year old daughter loves them. On to the chocolate next...

First tried this tea from a specialty store in Buffalo, NY where it sold for close to $60/lb. Love it, even though it was only 2 oz. Search the net for this tea and found it Amazon.

It's a light delicate flavorful tea that can be brewed 2 to 3 times by refreshing it with more hot water. It is non-acidic like some other teas. It need no addition of cream or sweetner. I'm currently drinking 5 to 6 cups per day as it is so delicious and light. It's not exactly a green tea when brewed but a light amber color, with the hint of a flora or fruity taste. The added plus at Amazon is the price and very quick shipping.

I would strongly recommend getting this tea for any tea lover and I'm sure they would be pleased if they enjoy a good quality chinese tea

I got into various oolong teas from a great New York importer. They really know their teas!

But this year, the Numi Ti Kuan Yin is available at quality and price that bests the experienced importer. I dunno, maybe they got lucky at an auction or somthing. But we've been enjoying this tea!

You can spend 3 times as much and get better tea. But then it's too expensive to drink every day. Buy this

I ordered both the Brown Sugar Jerky and the Peppered and both were absolutely fanstastic. This jerky has a slightly tender consistency which makes it easy to chew. The flavor is sublime, not too salty, just the right amount of sweetness, a real taste treat. I am on my second 2lb order. I am totally hooked

The wife looked incredulous, but I had the last laugh as I pasted a beefy, juicy kiss of sugary goodness on her cheek last night just as she was dozing off to bed. Seeing the drooly goo drip off onto the pillow made the night on the couch all worth while.

Thank you World Kitchens for two pounds of steer delight.

This jerky is not just an excellent value, it is by far the best jerky we have eaten. I buy it every year as Christmas gifts (and ofcourse, save one pkg for us) and everyone raves about it. My family always looks forward to Christmas because they know jerky will be there for the holidays. You can't beat the price, and the jerky is actual strips of lean beef that is flavorful. The brown sugar has just a hint of heat with the sweetness. I would highly recommend this product. Value and quality can't be beat. A+++ Thanks!

My husband and I like the Newman O's better than Oreo's, and our 3 year old son loves them! As we did as a child, he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling, just like an oreo. Also, the Newman O's do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have

These cookies are superb all by themselves. Far superior to "that other sandwich cookie" in every way. But if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence, melt some Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Chips in your double boiler, and dip these cookies, then remove to a rack to dry. Your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store, and beg you for more. Keep out of reach of children

Everyone in my family (from 3 to 64 years old) loves these organic cookies. I purchased these cookies at several local stores before I discovered that Amazon had them. I sent a package to my grandson who is in the Army in Iraq and he raved about them. Newman's has another big winner!

I do not like store-bought cookies, especially Oreos (too dry and greasy for me). But upon the recommendation of several people, I tried the Ginger O's and was pleasantly surprised. They have excellent flavor and the cream does not have that greasiness to it. If you like ginger cookies, don't hesitate to try these

My children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream. These are a bit softer than the O's we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat! =) We purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too - YUMMY

I love the Original Vanilla Creme Newman's O's, so when I saw the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free on sale one day I picked one up. I figured it would basically be the same as the Original. The chocolate and vanilla tastes are great, but I found the cookies themselves to be rock hard. So unless you have an issue with wheat or dairy products, I would recommend the Original Vanilla Creme, and not the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free variety

The variety blend coffee pods are simply the best coffee I've had in a long time. I drink up to three cups of coffee a day, but the one I look forward to the most is the cup I make in the morning on my Senseo machine. The origins pods are the best of the best. These pods have a rich, full bodied flavor that surpasses the other medium and dark roast pods that are available. Get the variety pack and try them all. They are all wonderful

We first bought these crackers in a local store, and loved them. Nutritionwise they are really good, and have a great flavor and are oh so crunchy. Never attempt a conversation while partaking, you'll never hear the other person :-) After our first purchase we bought directly from Dr Kracker. Then they told us of the great deal we'd get buying them thru Amazon. And that's what we've been doing ever since. Aways good for an in between meals snack with butter or peanut butter. Then we'll have something more substantial on them for our lunch from time to time

I saw this bread in my local health food store, and it looked so good I decided to try it. I must say it taste just as good as it looks. This is by far the besting tasting cracker I've ever tasted.

Made completely from certified organic ingrediants, this product is an excellent choice for the health conscious. And the price here at Amazon is a great buy in comparison to any local retailer.

I'm looking forward to this replacing the breads I usually use

The title pretty much says it all. I reserve 5 stars for what I consider the best of the best. I wanted a gluten-free cereal that was different from the few I've been eating over the years. This is definitely NOT like the usual "crispy rice." It's much more substantial (not "90% air"), has a nice, though not too strong, cocoa flavor, and doesn't get soggy in the first two minutes after milk (or other drink product) is poured on it.

Another rater talked about empty calories. I'll be generous and assume that reviewer is not particularly familiar with reading (and comparing) nutrition labels. If a high quality rice is also considered "empty calories," that review would be valid. But comparing the Koala Crisp nutrition label to the nutrition label on a high quality rice reveals almost identical nutritional values - perhaps because Koala Crisp IS a high quality rice. Just as rice has never been claimed to be a fully balanced meal, neither is Koala Crisp. What it is, is a high quality product made with high quality ingredients (none of the artificial vitamins and minerals added to "grocery store" cereals to make them look better). And it's designed to be used as part of a balanced diet.

With that out of the way, It's just plain good. I buy it by the case, and eat it several times per week for breakfast, I like it that much. And no, I have no connection with the company at all - I just love their products (many of them - not just this one). Now, if they'd just add this one to their line of Eco-pak cereals (large, bulk bags), I'd be even happier

When I searched the net for pods there were lots of warnings that the senseo brand wasn't so good. Granted I am not an avid coffee drinker,however I really look forward to a good morning cup of coffee that won't burn a hole in my stomach. I usually run one senseo pod through twice and have a perfect cup. If anything - needs a little more of the flavor (i.e. hazlenut, vanilla) added to it. But still very good.

Good quality granola, not too sweet, would give it 5 stars, but it doesn't have enough nuts. "Super Nutty" it is not. It is worth the price though. My wife would give it 4.5 stars. She is mildly gluten intolerant and can eat this because it contains no wheat.

Dr. Krackers are fantastic. They are different from any other cracker I have tried. They are very crispy, which is what I love about them. They are delicious plain or with cheese and dips. Because of their crispiness, they hold up great for dips. I cannot say enough about these crackers. They come in several flavors, while classic 3 seed is my favorite, they are all very good

This coffe is so delicious! It is bold and smooth. There's no bitter taste even when brewed strong. If you're looking for a great coffee, with a smooth flavor and nothing bitter, you' won't be dissappointed with Timithy's Colombian La Vereda

I use K cups all the time- at work, at home, etc. There are a handful of good k cup brands out there. This is one of the best. Both decaf and regular Timothy's Columbian are smooth and rich in flavor. Add some creamer and sweetener, and goodbye to any other coffee!! You won't be disappointed. Believe it or not, the home brewing K cup machine(Keurig) gives a better cup of coffee versus the commercial K cup machine(also Keurig), because the hot water does not blast too quickly through it. FYI

I really feel like this is the best overall coffee that I have tasted. As the name suggests, it is intended for espresso, but it makes an excellent cup of regular coffee. I love this roast for my lattes because it is so easy, smooth, yet full-flavored. If you are in the midst of a decision for what bean to purchase, make this your choice. You shall not be disappointed

I've always loved smoked oysters but most brands come packed in cottonseed oil, which is vile to say the least. The Crown Prince oysters are packed in olive oil -- a huge step up in health and taste. They are convenient little bundles of protein that can be packed in a lunch, etc. They taste wonderful added to soup or stew. Great for last minute entertaining. Last but not least, I like to have a case on hand in my disaster supplies

So these are basically Ritz Bits, but with three differences:

1. The crackers are better; they taste more buttery and flavorful.
2. The cheese is better; it actually tastes like something that's met cheese in passing, and maybe even shaken its hand.
3. They're all organic 'n' stuff, so make you feel ever so slightly virtuous, and less like a slave to Big Food.

If you're packing lunches for kids (or snacks for yourself), these are great

Some people can tolerate spelt but not wheat --and if you are one of those, spelt flour makes a great bread. It substitutes well, but be aware that spelt requires less kneading (it has a shorter gluten fiber and breaks down if kneaded too long. We knead bread about three minutes.)

Spelt also makes lovely noodles and is fine in cakes. It seems easier to digest. It does have gluten and is a relative of wheat, so if you are gluten-sensitive, this is probably not an alternative

We love Cinna-Raisin Crunch for breakfast. The clusters are larger than average and hold up well in milk. The cinnamon and raison flavor is right for me. Given few minutes to digest, and it keeps me comfortably sated for hours. If you prefer small bites or smooth textures in your breakfast cereal, the usual cluster size in this cereal might not be right for you

These 6 oz packs of organic California prunes have more flavor than the non-organic brands. They are also drier and firmer, which I wasn't sure I liked at first. I quickly grew used to it and now I prefer them this way. They are sweet and chewy.

The freshness date is 16 months in the future, so these would make a good addition to any emergency preparedness stock one might have.

You can't go wrong at this price for 12 bags. This is one brand you can trust

I got a few packages of these... used some for my daughter (for the Omega-3 fatty acids, as they help with brain function... she is speech impaired) and for my grandpa (who has high blood pressure had a stroke.)
You simply add a few spoonfuls to your oatmeal... my grandpa's cholesterol went down 50 points in one month. (None of his medication had been able to do that.)
My 5 y.o. daughter didn't notice this in her oatmeal... I tried it, and there is no added taste, just health benefits :)
Great product. We always have it at our house

My wife and I have adjoining offices, and we keep a variety of soups and snacks on hand so we can eat in together when we don't both have time to eat out. This soup is one of our favorites. We like the flavor and the texture (creamy, with nice chunks of potato, lots of corn kernels, pieces of carrot and bell pepper). I keep a bottle of hot pepper on hand to spice it up, but my wife prefers it as it is. We microwave it in the envelope and then pour it into two mugs. There's just the right amount in one evelope for the two of us when I have a sandwich to go with it. Without the sandwich, I find one envelope about right for me.

This isn't the healthiest of the Pacific Foods soups that we've tried in terms of fat/protein/carbohydrate content. The beef stew is better in that regard, but we don't like the beef stew without considerable extra seasoning (and it's very thin for a stew) and we like the creaminess of this chowder. We eat a balanced diet, so that really isn't an issue. This is very satisfying, and it's the one office food item we order again and again

This is *awesome* soup!! I was a little iffy about it (about any soup coming from a can or bag!) but ordered it anyway, it sounded so good. My hubby, toddler and I *love* it and could eat it every week if we had more money to buy it! We took some on a camping trip and shared with all of our friends that we were with, and everyone agreed how great it was. Not as good as home-made, but really really good! I'm not sure about the taste buds of the reviewer that gave it 1 star, but we all thought it was worth getting again..!

These bars are filling, which is what I look for in my snacks/breakfast foods. They're nice and sweet, won't fall apart on you like granola bars, yet don't require too much jaw pressure to take a bite--it's the perfect consistancy. A great way to get some portable protien if you don't want to carry around a bag of nuts/seeds with you

My favorite things are often the most simple: A healthy alternative to Kellog's Rice Krispies - with the benefits of organic ingredients, rice syrup instead of cane sugar, and an incredible company behind it all to boot - and this tastes even better! Also, rice syrup won't give you the 'spike' and 'crash' of conventional sugar, and in fact supplies a steady stream of energy

I bought these because I have a corn allergy and wanted to substitute them for the LA Weightloss bars that list corn syrup as the first ingredient. I was pleasantly surprised that they were pretty tasty! My favorites are actually the Fudgie Filberts that taste similar to a Little Debbie brownie if Little Debbie's were diet. Following that I would say Almond and Coconut are tied for second. Third is the Peanut Butter which is the highest in protein but not as good as the others. My husband didn't like any of them but could tolerate the one I liked least, Peanut Butter. Over all I think these are great as a healthy snack for people with food allergies or other dietary restrictions. I think I would have picked a different name than Betty Lou's Nut Butter Balls. Nut Butter Balls doesn't sound as appetizing as what they actually are!! Nut Butter Balls.....Mmmmmm

We have been using Meyenberg's powdered goat milk for several years. We used to buy their milk in cartons at Walmart and it was good. The only problem was that we live so far from a Walmart store that we would run out of goat's milk between trips. We decided to try the powdered and found that it mixes and stays mixed very well and tastes exactly like the liquid milk in the cartons. Of course it stores easily and indefinitely and we highly recommend it to anyone who wants or has to drink goats milk

I started using goat milk when my daughter was 1 because she did not digest cow's milk that well. This product is great, has equal or more nutrition than cow's milk, has a good flavor, just slightly different than cow's milk,is easy to digest and best of all the powder form is great if you are on the go, I don't have to worry about it spoiling I just mix and give it to my daughter

I prefer this powdered milk to the condensed form that Meyerberg sells. The condensed has a more sour flavor to it. One has to realize that goat's milk is not cow's milk in that it is richer or creamier in flavor so it does startle one until your palate get's used to something which tastes "different". When it is warm, it honestly tastes about as close to what a milk product should taste. Cold it has a slight powdered milk processed flavor.
I actually made ice cream from this powdered milk and it turned out pretty good. It is like ice milk as this is milk, but it was different and enjoyable but quite sweet.
The recipe was 1 quart milk (8 scoops of powdered milk made warm and allowed to chill)
1 cup white sugar
1 tsp vanilla flavoring (you can try other flavorings like banana)
1/8 tsp salt
My electric freezer will freeze this in 20 minutes.
I like the powdered for it's ease and it keeps well. I can make up a quart and it will keep 2 weeks, so it is on hand and not wasting or forcing someone who has limited use to drink a gallon of milk. Granted one is used to cow's milk, but this is something one can get used to if they have allergies and I am glad it comes in a nice metal can with a plastic lid to reseal after you pop the top and a plastic measuring scoop to get it right.
One can will make 3 quarts of milk

I used Meyenberg Powdered Goat Milk with my first litter of pups five years ago, and was very pleased with it, so made sure to stock up before my second litter was born. I supplement the mother's food with it, and mix it with ground puppy food to make a puppy gruel to transition the pups to puppy food. The pups and their mother seem to love it, and have suffered no digestive problems at all. It dissolves quickly in warm water and is convenient and easy to store. I recommend it as a nutritional supplement for nursing mothers and pups both

The roast is more smooth and mellow than Starbucks. I prefer it to Illy. Produces ample crema. It's a good value. After trying the first bag, I ordered several more. The Lavazza has become my daily espresso bean -- at least until the 8.8 pounds runs out! FWIW I grind with a Rancilio Rocky burr grinder, and my espresso machine is a Rancilio Miss Silvia

Espresso beans can be roasted in different ways. Lavazza and Illy represent the best of two different approaches to roasting beans for Italian espresso. Illy roasts their beans for a longer time, but at a lower temperature, than Lavazza. As a result of its higher roasting temperature the Lavazza is darker, and according to some people more robust, than Illy is.

At its best, when properly ground, tamped, and brewed, Lavazza espresso is a bit stronger tasting and also a little bit more bitter than Illy. The Lavazza espresso also has a very pure black color once brewed and when it is done properly it has a hint of licorice in the aftertaste. Personally, though, I prefer the Illy approach which is why I am giving this coffee four rather than five stars. But, even so, I certainly recognize the high quality of Lavazza. In my opinion Lavazza represents the very best of the widely available dark (as opposed to medium like Illy) Italian Espresso roasts

This is a terrific espresso. I got hooked on Lavazza in Italy and haven't found any other espresso blends to knock it off it's throne. This is my first time purchasing Lavazza whole beans and I think I'll continue to buy the whole beans for the freshness factor. Would highly recommend!

Great taste! very creamy espresso with a natural sweet aroma, does not need any other cream or sugar to ruin such a rich taste.
The reason why your(to the previous reviewer) coffee tasted sour is because you failed to use a decent and suitable home espresso machine.
If you had used the right method and machine it would have been nearly impossible for you not to enjoy the great taste this coffee can offer.
These are very high quality espresso beans with a taste so full and rich that you would want to keep going back to it after tasting other coffees.

This is my favorite of essn's juices. It is unique and has a beautiful color, which you see when using it as a mixer in cocktails. Also, a HUGE hit with kids. Can't beat 100% juice. Worth every penny

I discovered this in our local QFC grocery store, which is the only place I've ever seen it, and Amazon's price is much better as I paid $8 for one package.

Growing up, my mom used to make us bowls of pastina as comfort food. I call this whole wheat orzo my "adult pastina". :) Cooks up really quickly and is versatile in recipes and tastes wonderful. I highly recommend it

The pods are great. They taste great and brew great coffee although in my two different pod machines they brew coffee that tastes very different. The one thing to be aware of is that the pods are slightly thicker than many other brands and they may not fit right in some machines. The problem only occured with the double pod configuration for a bigger cup of coffee.

Great flavor, light and fluffy, and good texture. Only down side is that the bread tends to dissolve with to much moisture, and has a tendency to be a little dry but great for sandwiches. Unlike other gluten-free breads that tend to be so heavy that they over power anything you put in the middle.

I ordered a case of sardines through Amazon Grocery last month and they didn't travel well, the box arrived soaked in oil. 4 cans had popped open and seeped fishy oil all over the rest of my order. Upon inspection I could see that the design of the seals on the cans and the way that they were packed in their box made it a simple matter to pop the seals, and any bump in transit could do it. Sardines are not returnable items. Imagine the mess of shipping them back? Amazon handled my complaint in excellent fashion regardless.

So, I thought that I had better try it again. I ordered a totally different kind-same brand. These sardines are not quite as tasty as the others but they are quite acceptable. My cats like them and most essential: they arrived in perfect condition.

That being said, if you don't have Amazon Prime shipping you might consider getting it. It pays for itself quite quickly and it is SO darned convenient. I live in the country and I work at home. It's a pain to go to town to shop for groceries, books, music, whatever. Amazon provides so many products I need. Amazon Prime gets them to me quickly and usually, painlessly (those leaky sardines were my only problem among dozens of shipments).

Amazon does a tremendous job! I'm one happy customer

I have been buying this brand of boneless and skinless sardines for years and still love to just open a can and eat them for a snack. I know that being boneless and skinless lowers the calcium level but I've never liked the crunch or taste of eating a whole sardine right from the sea. And they are packed in olive oil which is loaded with Omega 3's too so it's as good for you as are the sardines. However, I am not so sure about their actual mercury levels. Buying them from Amazon with their $10. off sale on $49. purchases is a great price. I've even found that many of the local grocery stores as well as Costco and BJ's NO longer carry this product. Or their price has skyrocketed. It's great to be able to stock pile them from Amazon. If you like sardines, you'll love these! And they are just so nutritious for us all

We have served this coffee at our Sunday morning church services for 8 years... it is wonderful to know that we are not lining the pockets of some mega corporation when we buy from Pura Vida...but helping children and families.

Though resembling nothing like the common graham crackers found in most grocer's cookie aisle, these small squares are quite delectable and relatively guilt-free

Newman's Own Organics Alphabet cookies are very chocolatey and very crunchy. The first time I tried them I was hooked! My two children also think they are fantastic. If you are have not tried organic cookies before, these cookies are a good starting point.

I love this cereal; I eat it every morning with maple syrup or honey, raisins, and walnuts. It is never pasty for me, as it is for the other reviewer, unless I let it cook way too long or let it sit to cool too long. I cook it for five minutes, turn off the heat and let it thicken a couple of minutes more as I add my raisins and walnuts and maple syrup. Then I stir in rice milk until I get it to the consistency I like. Though I don't like rice milk by itself or on any other cereal, it does taste really good on this rice cereal, with the added benefit of making the whole thing easier to digest. Rice cereal is the easiest cereal to digest, anyway, but adding rice milk instead of cow's milk makes it even more easier

Forget the white tea at Starbucks--Clipper is the real deal! Quick to make--requires just 30 seconds to steep. I do it with non-dairy creamer and a couple of tsp of sugar, but this is pretty sweet by itself. But bmake sure you get the six boxes advertised here--or get them for pretty much the same price at Whole Foods

These are quite good tasting! Even though you have to buy several boxes rather than just one at a time, the individual boxes are manageable enough for use over a period of time. It would be nice, as with most things, if they were a bit less expensive and also didn't have to be bought 'in bulk,' but overall they're very good especially compared to some other 'organic' offerings

Summary:

Peanut butter, plain: A bit "rubbery". I cooked them a little longer in microwave and added chips. ;^)

Peanut butter, choc. chip: Crispy, crunchy, crumbly, rich and VERY addictive! (Yes, they always arrive broken up somewhat, but you won't care.)(Like other chip one, only 5 oz. box)

Swirl shortbread: Too heavy and buttery for me. Nice texture.

Choc. Chip shortbread: If you like shortbread, this will taste decadent! Rich choc. chips. Crispy and yes, also addictive! (Note: only 5 oz instead of 7 oz. box)

Butter shortbread: Couldn't really eat these. Too heavy and buttery. Least favorite.

Haven't tried others yet.

I have a wheat allergy and never tasted shortbread again until I found these wonderful delights at the store in the health-food section! The shortbread choc chip I tried first has not only the unique taste of shortbread, but has chocolate chunks also! They are crunchy and light.

In comparison, they weigh less than some other Pamela products. They are not as "buttery" as the Butter Shortbread or Swirl (a good thing in my opinion). I love the pecans also!

Recommend to any wheat-allergy sufferer, or gluten intolerant person. :^

I tried Betty Lou's Spirulina-Ginseng Balls because I read the nutrition
information and you get 40% of your daily requirement for vitamin A in
one serving. At this point in my quest to eat healthier, I've read lots
and lots of nutrition labels, finding this much vitamin A in a snack is
rare. Finding something "deep green" in color that actually tastes pretty good is rare. If you're looking for a yummy, sugery snack this
is not for you! If you are looking for a healthier snack to replace grabbing for that cookie, this snack is worth checking out

These are a great substitute for granolia bars and much better for you. They are not based on grains but on greens instead. Taste is a tad bit green but if you eat whole foods at all then you'll love these. -Plus they give a good energy boost throughout the day!

I tried this item just because it's a a ginseng snack. I found it to be not particularly tasty, but the overall effect of increased stamina is true. I'm not sure about spirulina in general, but one ball per day does the trick for me when it comes to increased stamina lasting several days

I definitely love a cup of freshly brewed coffee. Now that so many choose to have coffee numerous different ways, there are just those who need the right filters. Melita knows that with their coffee filters. They are convient and stronger in hold than any other filters on the market. They work great with #2 coffeemakers, and especially are convient for those who've purchased the individual ground coffeemaker Melita's Perfect Brew and Perfect Start coffee filter cups where all you have to do is just boil water and pour, and you will get a convient cup of coffee. I really recommend Melita a whole lot, they are worth the price.

Price: B+

Strength: A-

Overall: B

Some days, after the kids leave the classroom, I find myself reaching for the nearest available chocolate! Not any more...This is a great healthy snack that satisfies the cravings and keeps me going for a few more hours. And there are no hidden ingredients that set off my food allergies, which I really appreciate. They are maintaining their freshness well. I bought them for the price, but am now going to try the other items in Betty Lou's kitchen

This "Kracker" is just the absolute best. Eating it alone when you need something crunchy or with Healthy Choice Peanut Butter or low-fat cream cheese - it just is an awesome product and I buy it in bulk cause I never want to be without it! I'd love to see a "variety pack" - kind of a sampling of all the Dr. Kracker goodies available

I bought these crackers because I love cheese and seeds/nuts and am a low carb dieter. They are very good and I would have given them 5 stars except I actually liked the crackers without the cheese better. These are great for an occasional cruncy/crispy treat and I would purchase them again. They have a less "sweet" taste than the regular crackers and the cheese flavor is mild, not artificial or too salty. I highly recommend them.

I love Pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds, these are The BEST.
The taste great, are REALLY crunchy - a key requirement for me - and have just the right amount of salt. The Newman's Rounds are just as good - maybe even better.
And as an added bonus, Paul Newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity - an unbeatable combination in my book

These Pretzels are great!! I needed an alternative to wheat and found these spelt pretzels. I had them prior to ordering them on Amazon so I knew to expect they'd be awesome. Several family and friends have tasted them and can't tell any difference to pretzels made with wheat. However, I like these spelt pretzels better than your average wheat pretzel!
I don't like too much salt and I found these pretzels average on the salt factor. Like every other bag of pretzels, the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me.
The only thing I don't like is that in the ingredients list they say made with Organic Spelt and also Spelt. While they meet the standard to label their product organic, they should use ALL Organic Spelt

I was really impressed by the taste of this cereal. I was expecting the flavor to be like cardboard or something like this, but instead it was really good. It was sweet (but not sugar sweet) and crunchy. I'll definitely buy this again. If the price went down I'd buy it more

We initially discovered this cereal at one of the big warehouse stores, but they do not consistently stock it. We enjoy the flavor, the fact that it is made from organically-grown grain, and the health benefits of flax seed and high fiber. At the time of purchase, we found the Amazon price to be over a dollar cheaper per box than in our local grocery store. We bought two cases!

This is an excellent quality product--nice clean filets packed in olive oil instead of who-knows-what. I really like having little glass jars instead of a tin that can't be reclosed if you don't use all the filets at once. My first food purchase from Amazon was an excellent start

Ever since I returned from Spain, I have been looking for some decent anchovies to eat as tapas. These are just the right amount for a snack and the flavor is wonderful. If you have never eaten anchovies except on a pizza, you are missing a great treat. I highly recommend these, and even if you only eat them occasionally, they will remain fresh in the glass jars

Having moved from a state where this popcorn was always available, we were aghast that no one carried it in our new area! It appears that very few here like this wonderfully natural tasting, lightly salted, lower calorie popcorn, but preferred those that heavily tasted of thick butter with lots of salt and coats the mouth with film. This popcorn pops fully, leaving no kernels unpopped, and doesn't need any additives. Ease of ordering and prompt shipment make this a wonderful way for those of us who just have to have it! Thank you, [...]

If you like hempseeds like I do. This is your best buy. Amazon has the best price. The seeds came fast, fresh, and are terrific. To me they smell and taste even more fresh then the retail packages. The 5 lb bag comes vacuum sealed. I took 5 mason jars, packed them in and put them in the freezer. I have a big bag in the refrigerator. I toss these seeds all over my salads. :

I am a huge fan of tea. I have been drinking this one for years. I am astonished at the price -- such a great deal. Anyway, if you must buy tea in a box, this is one to purchase. I love the subtle flavors of this tea. I always feel better after drinking a cup. It's even better if you add a little fresh (organic) lemon juice.

Other than the Republic of Tea The People's Green Tea, I really like Yogi Tea Healing Formula. Not only is it 80% organic but the refreshing subtle taste of lemon grass with powerful antioxidant ingredient like grapeseed extract (protect cells from free radical damage and also promotes healthy circulation) should make one incorporate tea drinking in one's daily life. Other health benefits of green tea are for symptoms like headaches, body aches and pains, digestion, depression, immune enhancement, detoxification, as an energizer, and to prolong life. The only side effect is insomnia and I'm suffering from it but I know my immune system is thanking me for 6 cups of green tea each day!

I think Splenda is great, but I grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is, is to let a sugar addict try it. My husband happens to be one, and he cannot tell the difference between Splenda and sugar in his tea! As with other artificial sweeteners, you get an unpleasant after taste--with the Splenda there is none! You can use this to cook with too! It's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar

I love Splenda and I love getting it in a big bag. As a good ole Oklahoma girl, I live for my iced tea. And my tea MUST be sweet, but sugar isn't an option. So SPLENDA to the rescue. We use it in everything and are learning new ways to use it every day because my Daddy has developed diabetes. The big bags are often out at our local grocery store, so finding them at Amazon with our Amazon PRIME takes care of that problem

There is juvenile diabetes in our family and we have no other choice but to bake with Splenda. After couple tries I found excellent Splenda recipes and even guests could not tell Splenda cookies from sugar ones. If you still feel Splenda cookies are not the same, add a teasp. of molasses in choc chip or oatmeal raisin and they taste exactly the same

I'm a diabetic so I can't have sugar. In my opinion Splenda tastes alot better than sugar and has no carbs from it. So if you're a new found diabetic and you think life is over cause everything food wise sucks, just sub some Splenda in the recipe and you'll be good to go.

These are fresh and have just the right amount of licorice flavor. They are much softer than most black licorice and are easy to chew. This is the BEST licorice I have ever had, bar none! The bag is huge! Haribo really knows how to make candy

Agave nectar makes an exellant sweetner for cooking as well as for teas.
Agave is better for your health than refined sugars and other manufactured
sweeteners on the market today.
My only wish is that will soon be available in larger containers for bulk sales and use. Thanks, E

This product is the best. No aftertaste, it's organic, and has a low glycemic value.
I use it in beverages. It's lighter than honey. In this bottle it squirts out easily.
I seem to require a less amount than honey or raw sugar to gain the same sweetness.
This is for the "light".
Easy storage and does not change consistency over time.
The regular might be heavier and could require even less for same sweetness.

Since going on the candida diet, I've had to find sugar substitutes for most things, and this agave has been a fantastic replacement. We've even used it instead of sugar in some baking and it's worked out great.

I adore this light version of the Madhava agave because it is so versatile. I use it in hot and cold drinks to sweeten without any sort of aftertaste. It mixes easily into both. It is the perfect compliment to tea or coffee, especially yummy in a vanilla rooibos! I also use it in place of sugar in various recipes, especially any dressings. I prefer it to honey because it does not crystallize and it has a very low gycemic index. When you eat honey it is like injecting sugar straight into your bloodstream but agave, while high in fructose, is slowly released into the bloodstream so you don't have that after sugar crash. Use the amber variety in place of maple syrup but use this light version for any other type of sweetening! From one sweet tooth to another, agave will satisfy! I'm off to make some tea..

I like the Nutiva Hemp protein. A great protein source that is easier to digest than whey and also provides half of the daily required amount of fiber. Can't beat that! It won't leave you feeling heavy and bloated like whey sometimes can. I like the taste and texture too. Mixes great with cranberry juice/cranberries, stevia, ice and water! I add some Berry Green for extra energy and nutrients! It's my morning breakfast.

I love the taste of this hemp protein Powder. I love to mush up bananas with a fork, add some dried figs with raisins and pour this hemp protein all over it with the Nutiva Hemp seeds. It tastes great and satisfies me on every level.

I also sensed there was much more fiber in the powder compared to other brands. I couldn't believe when I saw that there was 14 grams per serving. Considering that 90% of Americans are lacking in fiber, this Protein Powder can be a great service to millions

I mix this with orange juice, berries and a banana in the blender and it tastes great. It took some time to get used to the grainy texture, but it is much better than soy or whey protein.

My son loves this cereal!!! I always had to buy it at a health food store where it is usually almost $5 per box, so when it was on sale I would stock up. I finally started buying another peanut butter cereal that also did not have gluten ingredients. He said he didn't like it as well, but I thought he was just imagining the difference. Well, I decided we would do a blindfolded taste test to prove he couldn't really tell the difference. He was able to identify the Panda Puffs as his favorite every time no matter how we switched them around! He has even asked for a case of this cereal for Christmas! Guess that convinced me that there must be something to this cereal to make him like it so well.

When I received a $50 gift certificate through the Kidzeyes program as a prize, I used it for some gluten free grocery items from Amazon. I liked the items we tried so much, I started an astore to promote the great tasting gluten free foods that are available at reasonable prices from Amazon com. In fact, that's the name of my astore: Great Tasting and Gluten Free. Here is the link: [...]

I have several items listed, including EnviroKidz Panda Puffs, with personal reviews of each. We have five people in our family eating gluten free and quality is very important to us! All the items I have on my page are personal favorites.

Now I order gluten free items from Amazon about once a week for my family. Sure beats going to the health food store over an hour away and paying much more for less selection

I loved the idea and ease of the Senseo, but I was never that crazy about the way the coffee tasted. The grocery stores do not offer much in the way of variety, so I decided to take a chance and order the Columbia Blend from Amazon. I have been very happy with the flavor of it compared to what I had been getting.

If you are up for a change and want a smoother flavor, but still a strong tasting coffee. Give it a try!

I will note that the bag only comes with 16 pods vs. 18 in the regular bags

Blends well in smoothies. Taste is, to me, neutral which is a plus for whey. Difficult to find plain whey from "Sports" sources and when I have the taste is not pleasant. The others do contain whey isolate which is supposed to be superior so perhaps that is the difference. Elderly relative was drinking bottled nutritional mixes (Ensure etc) when she felt bad or had trouble keeping food down. They helped but smoothies are better. Make them with whey, egg whites (Deb-El Just Whites here on Amazon sells whites in smaller packages), natural chocolate (Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Cacao Powder), bananas and other fruit. She loves them. The whey and eggs whites give her all the protein she needs in a day in one drink (the egg whites lighten up the drink too but aren't really necessary unless you really want a protein boost). On bad days when she can't eat solid food, I toss in a few tablespoons of Deb-El powdered whole eggs to add fat and boost her caloric intake.

These snacks are crunchy and mildly peppery. The taste resembles that of cottage cheese. A little under salted for my taste, but still great. Watch out for blobs of undissolved jalape�o mix, you probably do not want to bite into those.

My doctor ordered me to eat heart-healthy food, saying that raisin bran is one of the best for bulk count. He said it's a good idea to not only eat it for breakfast, but to also eat a small bowl before dinner, especially for those over the age of fifty who might tend towards constipation. It sure beats the "prunes" of my mother's day!

I have always liked raisin bran, and this packet of 70 individual boxes will last me a little over a month ... if I follow my doctor's advice.

I also enjoy the convenience of Amazon's new store for staple groceries. The only drawback I see is finding the extra storage space if I order everything to last a month.

I bought this tea chest for my father. He loves it, and it's a good deal for the money. It's the perfect storage solution, and a pleasant way to select your morning teabag, too.

This cake mix is absolutely awesome. Very easy to prepare and is OHHH so good. For those of us who have to avoid glutens in our diet sometimes baked goods just aren't at all tasty, but this one is so good my husband, who is not gluten sensitive, eats it and says he can't tell any difference from the regular spice cake mixes. Will definitely be buying more of these

I have bought these krackers before at our local health food store and was delighted to see that they could be delivered to my door. I received my shipment of these delicious spelt flatbread krackers this week. However the "sell by" date on each package is a week old. They seem to be fresh enough now, but I am wondering about how long they will keep past the sell by date. It also makes me wonder about other Amazon orders and the sell by dates on them. I will be wary of ordering other items with a short shelf life

In Europe, you find a bowl of dark flaxseeds to the side of the muesli set out on a breakfast buffet. A great source of Omega-3 oil, you can improve your health by eating these tasty, nutty seeds. They are good for the gut and good for the heart.

The golden seeds are an attractive alternative to the nut-brown seeds. They look nice in baked goods like lighter breads. They taste the same as the dark seeds. Ground, they don't show up in white bread, so you can bust some up in the blender and throw then into your standard bread recipe and add needed nutrients and fiber.

We like them sprinkled on oatmeal, muesli or yogurt

This is a good price for this amount of quality licorice. This is the traditional Dutch concoction containing a strong salt taste and smell.
Not for everyone, the taste of this product is less sweet but more long lasting than the licorice candies we are used to eating in America. If you know you like this strongly flavored licorice this is a bargain

Double salt licorice is a very scary flavor for the uninitiated. People don't like it the first time, then start to crave it if they stay with the taste. If one doesn't like this licorice, it's great to serve to unwanted guests

My kids like these just as much, and I feel better giving them organic products. (The chemicals and pesticide/herbicide residues in non-organic foods make me nervous. Why take a chance when organics aren't that much more expensive anymore?) Yes, the cereal isn't artificially fortified with vitamins/minerals, but my kids get a high quality multi-vitamin every day so there's really no worry. Add a serving of fruit to increase the nutrition. I also add a little protein powder to the milk since getting a protein boost in the morning is very important for sustained physical and mental energy

This is a wonderful (and healthful) snack. Crispy and tasty and low in calories. Each bag equals 1/2 cup of fresh fruit, and the dried crunchiness of these seems to intensify the flavor of the fruits. There is also enough substance to meet the munchies moments. I highly recommend these

I tried to order this here but was sent Tang instead. When I informed them of the problem, they resent the order and again I got Tang. Their system seems confused by the TANGerine description or they're just not very bright at the warehouse.

I've had this flavor before and it is good: not too sweet and a bit tart. Refreshing

The stores near my house charge over $2 a box for the organic type. Half of me thinks it's great to have it avail on demand through Amazon for cheaper - the other half is ashamed to waste the fossil fuel on a special trip to my house.

I think Annie's should be able to make their product a little cheaper by now - it's pretty dang popular. Oh Well, the Alfredo variety isn't avail thru Amazon right now anyway, so I'm stuck (again) watching for sales and stocking up - which makes the formerly-ashamed half of me happy

Once I tried Illy, everything else tasted just OK. Truly an excellent coffee flavor - smooth, not bitter of overly strong. And the price is lower than any store I've check and even better than ordering directly from Illy. At a price of $13 per can, I was ordering five cans at a time to get free shipping. I love that I only have to order two at a time and it's delivered to my door!

Good texture, good taste on the Ahi tuna. Almost as good as beef jerky.

Avoid the salmon jerky. Most of the strips were hard and brittle. Some were so tough they were barely edible...more fit for my dog. Also the salmon was too spicy

...and I've tried quite a few. I tried over 30 varieties of green tea bags searching for a good cup, and this one takes the crumpet! The flavor is strong but mild, the color golden brown, and the aroma is light. I threw out all the others (or rather I gave them to my father-in-law who also like tea) when I found this one and I bought a case of it..

This is a great change from the canola oil and shortening!! When I first got it, I pan fried some fish in it and it was really delicious. Doesn't add a lot of extra taste that you might think. Also, think it's not as stinky when frying as other oils.
Then I had to try it on my popcorn. Oh, that is really wonderful.
Only problem I had is in delivery. The oil wasn't sealed well enough and it got warm enough during delivery to become somewhat liquid. Some of the liquid leaked out in the box. Just a warning if you live in a warm climate area

I wont go into the quality of this product or the nutritional benefits as I think the 4.5 stars and the customer reviews speak for themselves. However, I think you will find the 54 oz for 20 bucks is the best deal on the Internet, especially when you buy two and choose the super saver shipping option. I would challenge anybody to find a better deal for pure coconut oil of the same quality

This is 100% organic, unrefined coconut oil. Yes, it tastes like coconut, but it is supose to. A food should taste like what it is!

The nutritional value of this food is outstanding. It contains a lot of lauric acid which is also found in mothers milk and is both antifungal and antimicrobial. It is stable at room temperature and does not become rancid quickly like other popular cooking oils. It requires very high heat to release free radicals (I do prefer red palm oil for high heat cooking options because it does not release free radicals at all).

My Suggested Uses: smoothies, slow cooked baked goods, sauteed foods, mixed with maple syrup over popcorn, homemade cosmetics, and as an occasional conditioner for dry ends of long hair.

I was pleasantly surprised that this product had pop-top lids. The chicken is packed in water, but not soupy. It was a pretty good buy, because I also bought another product and got a $10 discount on my $49 purchase.

I actually bought this chicken to mix with my dogs' dry food from time to time. I was buying canned dog food, but it stank and I was finding shards of chicken bone in it. After reading about dog food ingredients on Paul Newman's "Newman's Own" website, I switched to his dry food. I have to mail order it, so I don't buy his canned food.

Despite the fact I bought it for the dogs, I did try a can of this myself. It was better than I expected. I was afraid it would have a funny taste to it from the can, but it didn't. It has an expiration date of 9 months from my purchase date.

The cats liked it, too, so I'm sure I'll be buying it again

I've been eating gluten-free for 5 or 6 years, and mostly made my own bread, cookies and crackers because GF food was hard to find and about as tasty as cardboard. Thank goodness for Nature's Path; their corn flakes are tasty (but don't make a good coating in recipes that call for "regular" cornflakes, sadly), I love the Panda Puffs and Koala Crisp (yes, I'm a grown-up and I eat these cereals), the kids love the Gorilla Munch, the Organic Crispy Rice Bars with peanut butter are a favorite, and these vanilla animal crackers don't last long in my house... even the non-celiacs love them! I haven't tried the other flavors, but these have a pleasant smell, a crunchy texture like a "real" animal cracker, are not crumbly or gritty, and have a nice cinnamon-y aftertaste. I buy these by the case

These are truly good gluten-free cookies. We have recently made the switch over to a casein-free (milk free) gluten-free diet for the sake of my son. He is already a picky eater, so I was worried about the transition. These cookies provided him with a yummy replacement snack for snack time that competes with the snacks that are being served (ie in church school etc). He is particularly enamored with them because they have kid-friendly animal imprints. Being gluten free, they do tend to break more, which can be upsetting for young kids, but they taste so good, he has been able to overcome this fault and is even willing to eat the broken pieces.

over the course of one day while at my work desk. As other reviewers noted, they are light, buttery and delicious! I'm using the second box for homemade (sorta') ice crem sandwiches. They are so tasty they really are fine plain. Now I wished I had ordered several cases when they were on sale for $12, but maybe then I'd eat too many

Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of all things swedish, from Lingonberries to salt cod to Lutefisk to those yummy red candy fish. When I saw that Jules Destrooper had invented yet another Swedish delectable, I could not wait for my package to arrive!
After assaulting the UPS driver and absconding with my "butter waffles" (which are more like cookies), I went into my kitchen and sat down in my breakfast nook to eat them. A hearty glass of milk was all I needed to drench the entire box and consume it. In reality, I ended up saturating the cardboard box and must have eaten that as well, because when I was done there was nothing left save for some soggy nuggets stuck to my ceiling. I assume they are from my delicious waffles and not from my earlier experiment of stuffing a cornish game hen with popping corn to "make its own stuffing." I am still picking bits of hen from my bushy, inappropriately dark eyebrows.
Also, some recipe ideas for these waffles include topping them with olives, tuna salad, anchovy and pretzel (an old Slavic favorite) and peanut butter. Sometimes I give these to the neighbor children when they behave themselves, and actually I have only given one out to one neighbor child. My neighbor's kids are usually misbehaving and absolutely do not deserve any of my tasty cookies! Anyway, it turns out the one kid I gave it to was actually a lawn jockey statue, which makes sense because my neighbors, the "Davenports," have very light skin. They are actually quite pasty and I am waiting for the day when one of them develops melanoma, because they are always out in the sun, in their pool, having a "heck of a time," under the sun's deadly rays, oblivious to the cellular damage they are inflicting on themselves. I prefer to stay inside during the daytime and nighttime hours, usually venturing from my house every fortnight to collect my mail. However, when I know a delivery of Jules Destrooper Butter waffles are arriving, I am on "high alert" and spring from my rascal mobility scooter whenever I hear a car door close.
Overall, I LOVE these waffles. Buy them, and If you don't love them too, send them off to me!!

These butter waffles are very tasty- very light, yet rich and buttery. They're hard to resist, couldn't help but eat a whole box.

Only downside is that it uses vanillin, rather than real vanilla. However, it goes great with ice cream and fruits

Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams. This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect. Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.

Before this I was taking harsh medicines like Tylenol PM's and such and always woke up feeling worse than before I went to bed! Not with the tea!

We've enjoyed this Sparkling Meyer Lemon juice enough that we've reordered it. We love the Sparkling Blood Orange and Cranberry juice combo but it's nice to have some variety. The Meyer lemon flavor comes through very clearly and is quite refreshing. We also like the light sparkling quality of the juice. This juice makes an excellent mixer for drinks.

One reviewer writes that these are Oreo crackers without the creme--and they are right! These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.

These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray! There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!

These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.

I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.

I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol.

Buy some and enjoy them today! SMILES

Having tried Senseo pods, Millstone, etc. I was surprised that good old Folgers is just as good and in some cases better than Senseo's newer flavors. While made for the Home Cafe these fit Senseo coffee makers and give you a good cup for a lot less than the more upscale brands

If you have a small child who is hard to get to bed at night, put them in a routine. Make them some sleepytime before bed (you can add splenda or honey to make the tea sweeter). This will calm thier nerves and make for a restfull night of sleep. This has also shown to me to prevent a fight from a child who does not want to go to bed. With a cup or two of this tea they should be off to sleepyland.

This tea does have a distinct taste which can be hard for some to get used to. I add honey or splenda to my tea to calm the bitter taste down. This tea is like chammomile - with little to no taste. So you'll need to add lemon juice or honey to make this tea taste good.

This tea can also calm you after a hard days of work if you've been over worked or stressed out.

I give this tea to friends and loved ones who are going through stress, or issues to remind them to relax

I don't know a whole lot about coffee, but I do know that I really like the taste of this. Some of the Senseo coffees I have tried have been chemically and harsh (specifically some of the flavored ones) and required a lot of cream and sugar to become palatable. This however, requires just a drop of cream and less than a single pack of sugar. The flavor is a little bit weaker when it first hits your tongue as a result, but it strengthens over the next 5-10 seconds. It never gets overpowering, but it is very pleasant. If you need a quick boost of caffeine, then you can drink it fast without killing your tongue. If you want to sip it, then you might want to make it a little bit stronger than they recommend, but it is still very good

As with all Newman's Own products, you find great quality with what you've purchased, and also good value. Paul Newman has given over $150 million in thousands of charaties worldwide, since the establishing of the Newman's Own line. One box of these raisins is 130 calories, with zero fat cholestrol. It's a good "healthy snack" to have around and enjoy from time to time

I've been making holiday turkeys for over 30 years. This year for the first time I used Turkey Perfect...and without a doubt this was the best, moistest, most flavorful turkey I've ever done. I told a friend about this product; she called me to rave about her absolutely delicious turkey. Even relatives who don't really like turkey went back for seconds...and thirds... For the first time ever we had NO turkey leftovers this year

Small, no sugar, a bit harsh tasting (might end up better diluted a bit with club soda). This is pretty well true of the four I have tried.

But in some ways the harsh tasting is good--the 12 pack can be doled out at one per day per person.

Does act as herbal medicine? I have no idea.

But it's very nice to have a treat that I don't really want to consume all of in one sitting. Like, for instance, Gummy Bears.

We bought these because there was an online coupon for them. My children (ages 11 and 14) take lunches to school and I was looking for something beyond the usual chip choices. The price was right and with the free shipping when going over $25, it was hard to resist. The fries are light and airy, like a thin cheeto but with a more delicate flavor. They are a nice change and we're really enjoying them

The other review was strictly from a nutritional standpoint, and did not address taste. Where I agree nutrition is very important, when you have a child with celiac disease, or food allergies, finding something that they will like to eat is a huge challenge!! This cereal is excellent for taste consistancy, and it is gluten free! If you need something for breakfast before school, give them this and a multivitamin!

This granola is delicious. Being that it's gluten free is a bonus since it's so hard to find acceptable healthy foods within that diet. But my family can eat whatever they want, and they couldn't stop eating it! The cranberries bring a wonderful touch of sweetness to the nuts and crunchies. This is a great treat to keep with you when you want a more substantial snack

I feel better serving this mac cheese than all the others out there - no artificial colors or flavors, and it tastes great! Cheese sauce is on the salty side, so i throw a bit of my own pasta in with the shells to cut sodium content.

I would have never bought this stuff but a friend was making it one day and I tried some. It was sooo good.
I had always just made Craft* before this stuff but now I'd say I eat this just as much. It's a great way to change up the normal macaroni taste. And did I mention it's really good too. It's kinda salty tasting with a creamy white cheddar texture. My favorite is when you get a noodle full of undistributed cheese..MMMMM. I also love it because it's organic. With each day of my life I'd say i'm eating smarter and this product was the next step in my plan. I can't wait to try out the other flavors and different products.
I'd like to see this being sold in Ralphs market soon. As of now I can only find it in Vons/Safeway

Tastes very good in my oppinion and in the oppionons of two of my friends who tried this product too. Not exceptionally great (hence the 4 stars) but good enough to enjoy eating. Big pieces of meat and plenty of it. Plus it's all natural including the beef which was not from hormone-fed cows, which is also important in my oppinion. Would buy again

I loved the taste, but the beef was quite dry. It's very easy to heat up, and probably would be great for a college student as an emergency meal

If it were not for the fact that these nuts were not packaged properly they would be rated at least a 5. I called the manufacturer and they told me it must have been at the factory. They were not full cans. None were full to the top but two of the cans were not even half full. The manufacturer sent me two coupons for the two cans that were about half full. I felt the whole order should have been replaced but two cans is better than none. As I said, the product was excellent, but I would not spend the money again to possibly get the quantity I got.

Well all I can say is "nuts to that".

I had read other's reviews about how great this coffee was, but I was using another coffee that I thought was really wonderful. I tried this one and now I am hooked. It is wonderful if you like bold coffee, which I do. I also like the fact that it is Organic. I don't drink a lot of coffee each day, but the cup or two I have, I want to be great. Just wish they had a decaf for my evening coffee

None of that super-sugared [candied] dried fruit or flat tasting candy [e.g., chocolate] chips to mess up a yummy, but healthy snack. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE chocolate--the darker the better--but what they put in trail mixes is worse than nothing. If I want candy, I'll buy the good stuff.

Thanks, Amazon. My local market no longer carries it

I don't normally review items, but I had to write something on this because all of these "it's too salty" comments are driving me crazy. These are hardly salty at all.

There is far more salt in potatoe chips or popcorn or basically any other snack food. My bag says its only 8% of your daily sodium, which is much lower than you would think from the comments people are leaving. I'm a man, so I personally think these could use MORE salt

This Annie Chun's udon soup is very easy to prepare. I don't think the first step is necessary either. Just add the water to the noodles and dried vegetables, cover it with the lid and microwave it for about 3 1/2 minutes. Add the sauce packet. The noodles loosen up after you stir it. If you what a more filling soup, add meat/vegetables. My kids and I really love this soup! I just purchased more from Amazon, because it's a better buy here than at the grocery store

I started to love Annie Chun's udon soup in March 2007. Although it was on my AMAZON GROCERY LIST for many months cause i read a very bad review from a guy that did not know what is great. I just ordered many A. Chun's soup noodle bowls. And i will order more again in future. Annie Chun is a cute and talented woman and she is the 1st Asian female that i admired and read her story about her soup noodle for second time on Amazon.com

Ever feel like you want that "little something" with your tea or coffee, but you abstain because you're on a diet? That was a problem for me, at least. I've been trying to avoid white sugar and white flour in an effort to lose weight. Well, just when I'd about given up finding a suitably healthy alternative, along came Dr. Kracker spelt muesli crackers! They are all natural, contain no white flour or sugar, DO have some dried fruit for that right amount of sweetness that makes them satisfying as an accompaniment for coffee or tea! Highly recommended

Everyone of us usually loves to make a fresh cup of coffee in the morning. Nevertheless, getting the best quality filters are definitely the biggest hastle for your coffeemaker. These Melita Cone #2 coffee filter are one of the best made filters around. They are woven tight, and completely seperate the ground coffee from spilling into your carafe, or your mug if you use Melita's Perfect Brew mug coffee makers. I like these a whole lot because they really help make the best coffee around. If you want to make a great cup of coffee, than you'll definitely want to get some of the best filters available. I definitely suggest you buy these #2 Coffee Filters. It is a definite buy, so drink up!

Having to get a mindset and change eating habits due to health issues, has proved to be a challenge, but with so many snacks that can be had that are actually good for you and that taste good, it has been pretty easy. This item for one, we LOVE!!! What they are not: Airy, super sweet, empty calories. What they are: Please read the nutritonal chart (so I don't have to type it all out,) the sodium level is a good choice for those that have to limit salt intake. Calories are not outrageous. They have a slight taste of caramel that comes from the rice syrup/peanut butter. They were not overly gooey. They are a bit more weighty than the 'others', but it's because there is some substance here. We have learned to eat and enjoy our food at a slower pace so one will suffice vs 2-3 of the 'others' we use to scarf down in one sitting.....I give 5 stars as product was in date, tasted fresh, has a GOOD taste, nutrition worthy, packaged conveniently.

Even non-celiac people should switch over. Here's an amazing gravy for chicken or pork chops. Try it next time and serve next to mashed potatoes: 2c. water and 1/2c. mix. Bring to gentle boil over high heat. Remove from heat immediately. Stir in 1/4c sour cream. Pour over meat, browned in a skillet. Simmer on lowest heat until meat is cooked through, turning and stirring often to prevent skorching. Hmmmm. I'm getting hungry

I've been gluten free for 5 years (due to my son, 1-1/2 personally). I always had trouble duplicating my favorite casseroles because of them needing cream of mushroom soup, concentrated. With this mix, I mix double the amount to the water, so each container makes 3 instead of 6, and it tastes just as good as the gluten variety! I haven't tried it as just a soup, but it's the only thing I'll use in casseroles

I have used this cake mix many, many times. The first time my daughter made it for me for my birthday. She said she thought it would be difficult to make it with a hand mixer but was a "snap" with my large stand mixer. I have since made it many times and it is a favorite for birthday parties in our office even though I am the only gluten-free person. I add fresh orange juice and peel instead of the vanilla and serve it with strawberries or fresh fruit and whip cream...yummy

I HATE to bake, but this cake is so easy to make. I didn't have the problems the others did, and I followed the directions on the box. However, I have a very old and POWERFUL stand mixer. I beat it on the highest setting and this cake comes out great. I feel horrible that the others didn't get this cake to work - it really is incredible. I frost it with a light frosting and serve it with strawberries. Everyone loves it! I am the only person in my house on the gluten-free diet, and the others (husband and 4 children) think it is the best. The only difference I have noticed is that it isn't as high as a betty crocker cake mix, but it is light and fluffy. You really need a stand mixer to make this, but it is QUICK, easy and tasty. My stove is also older and the temp is a little hot. For gluten free baking I turn it down 25 degrees and bake everything a little longer. But, my mom uses this mix and hasn't had any mishaps. She has a newer stove and follows the cooking temp and time on the box. By all means, if it is not at the right stage (soft peak, if I remember correctly), beat it longer than the box instructs.

I am a big fan of Coffee. Other than water it's all I drink.

So when I found this I had to run with it. It's cheaper than red Bull, has more power than it. It's better for you than red bull, and it has a nice flavor that does not leave an aftertaste.

This was a very tender jerky. It's not the kind that wrenches at your teeth. If you're looking for hard-core jerky, look elsewhere.

Back in my youth, I used to love that sort of thing. But with the sensitive teeth I have now, I need to show a little discretion. This jerky was great. It was tasty. It had a little heat which I appreciated. The only drawback were the spice. There's something really hard in the spice mix that nearly broke my teeth on more than one occasion.

There's 2 bags, but it went fast. It was that good

After reading that Bentley's has the finest Ceylon teas in the world, I decided to give this as a Christmas gift to my husband. He says it is the best tea he's ever had, and since he is somewhat of a tea connoisseur, I would consider that a compliment. The box is beautiful, and it makes a lovely presentation

Wow, no wonder you can't get this anymore. They probably can't make them fast enough. This is such an unusual gift set. The pot is so cute as well as being a nifty display item. The teas are all individually packaged and ones that you wouldn't find anywhere else. Makes you want to drink tea all day. The box that it comes in (as well as the individual tea box) is reuseable and so pretty. I hope that this item is offered for sale again soon, as I would buy a dozen of these to keep on hand for gifts...and maybe one for myself!!

This is a great way to try the teas before you buy them in any type of quantity. The pot brews about 3 cups of tea. I don't drink the tea often - I prefer to have it as an infrequent treat to keep the experience special. I will update my review as I try the different teas.

The dragon lily tasted wonderful, but the flower was really ugly. However, I did buy a box of this tea and when I brewed it, the flower was more colorful and appealing. I was able to steep this flower 4 times for 12 cups. Although I admit that the last three cups didn't have as strong a flavor.
Starlight rose was disappointing. The flower never changed appearace, just got bigger. The flavor was strong and left my mouth feeling pasty.
Flower Jewel
Lavender Dream
Emerald Sun
Jade Fortune
Jasmine Pearls unwind to become long, thin leaves. The scent is heavenly. The taste is not quite as dramatic, but still good. I used approximately 1 pearl for each cup of tea to brew it (3 pearls per pot).

This is an incredible set for tea, and some incredible tea. At more than half the price it is a nice organic store you might find it at (no offense to organic stores, but a %200 mark up is a little much). this tea is the best ive ever had, great for a gift as well, id get one for yourself and a couple for birthdays and whatever comin up

Great for Novelty gifts. But don't give it to true tea lovers!!! Different kinds of flowering Tea look great very entertaining to watch bloom, but taste pretty crummy. I would say most of them taste somewhere between stale and tasteless. Nevertheless, it's a nice gift because of the experience, and the cool box glass pot you get to keep

When my kids started kindergarten they needed to pack a lunch everyday. My wife realized that this was a teaching opportunity about nutrition, making the right choices, and responsibility.

Each day the kids pack their own lunches from Lunch Box Central. Each lunch must contain a protein (usually yogurt), a grain (some form of cracker or grain filled bar), and a fruit (apple, banana, or fruit cup).

EnviroKidz Organic Crispy Rice Bars are a staple in Lunch Box Central. They're convenient, the kids enjoy them, and they're a reasonably healthy choice.

The kids are happy, they're learning, and they're eating well. My wife is pretty smart

Certainly there are more expensive teas, but I've yet to have a better cup than Twinings Earl Grey, which is a perfect blend of comfort and spice. It works brilliantly as a "Good morning, how do you do," or a "Rest well, sweet dreams" sort of a beverage.

Many other Earl Greys on the market struggle with the proper blending of the bergamot oil, which can be quite overwhelming if overdone; but, it is what makes Earl Grey unique, so one does want to be able to taste it. Too many other tea companies cannot seem to grasp this delicate balance, but Twinings has always gotten it just right.

The tea can be enjoyed au naturel or with a slight dash of cream...not too much, because you don't want to drown out the enjoyable, lively flavor of the bergamot.

For me, when it comes to a cup of hot tea, this is simply the best.

It is so good to taste popcorn that tastes as if it were taken right out of a pot of boiling water, buttered and salted to taste. The smell of corn on the cob runs throughout the house. Great summer smell all year long

This spread is way too good! My husband and I have both tried spreading it on toast, but it really stands alone. I like to eat it just straight out of the jar. The spread is a perfect blend of flavors. If you have a sweet tooth, and don't always have other sweets on hand, a spoon of this stuff will satisfy all your cravings. Unfortunately, this spread has no nutritional value to speak of, so I doubt I will order it again. 6 jars is plenty for us. You have to order it at least once, though!

Very good - not a rich dessert by any means, but a healthy, filling snack. My kids really like them, and while they aren't low-calorie or really low-fat, it isn't full of sugar, and it contains "healthy" fat. The 5-grams of protein per serving really help with making you feel full

I love the iced jasmine tea at our local Vietnamese restaurant. In fact, every Vietnamese restaurant seems to serve the same wonderful tea. I have tried many different brands tyring to find one like the one served in Vietnames restaurants--light in color, a light tea taste, and a strong jasmine taste and scent. I finally found my brand

I disagree with the other review that this tea has an unbearable scent. I would say that the jasmine scent is strong, but not overpoweringly so. If you brew it according to the producer's recommendation (steep it for 60-90 seconds), the result is good to great. The tea is very soothing and the jasmine taste is very comforting. The only knock is perhaps it leaves a little bit of an aftertaste, especially when the tea is cold.

I do not understand about the other reviewer's fascination with packaging, a bag of tea is a bag of tea is a bag of tea. Who really cares what is printed on the tab? Anyways, I have been drinking this tea daily and I am ready to shop for another can when this one runs out.

Recommended to: People looking for decent tasting white tea. Not recommended to: people particularly sensitive to the scent and taste of jasmine.

It lasts a while also.. it lasted me about 4 days at work just snacking on it periodically. I would definitely recommend this snack.. It's healthy too

Considering you get at least twice as much jerky per dollar than the other brands out there this is a good pick. I didn't find any grit in it. It might have a few pieces that are tougher but not really even that tough. This is a good deal

I've tried the Andy Capp HOT FRIES, REG CHEDDAR, and WHITE CHEDDAR. These HOT FRIES are the best. They're the best of the 3 products and best all on their own! I'm getting addicted to them (ordered a second carton before finishing the first). Definitely nicely HOT -- that's part of the addictive quality. And an enjoyable to eat with the good underlying corn flavor and non-greasy crispness that I like about the Andy Capp products

My wife hates hot food, but for some reason, loves hot fries. If her salsa has the tiniest spice, she won't eat it, yet these mouth-burning beasts are her favorite snack. They are sometimes hard to find - having them by the case helps solve that problem. The size offered here is the size that you will normally find (around here at least) printed with the 99c price, so you can also figure the price savings, somewhere around, what, 40%? Wow

Let me count the ways.

They're great for a quick energizing snack/ breakfast/ healthy dessert, and tonight I even had one for dinner. They are delicious and you feel good about eating them because they're good for you!

Plus you get a lot of bang for a deceptively tiny ball... they're very filling and only about 200 calories.

I thought these were amazing. My favorite is the Socorro blend. A review said they were soggy, but I'm not sure what they mean. They are very crisp with nice and chewy fruit. Despite the fruit, they aren't sweet but the sweet in the fruit really balances out the hotness of the other seasoning.
As for the price, these are expensive nuts and high quality ingredients. The flavors are unusual, but perfect. I am defiantly going to order more

Sahale snacks were a pleasant surprise. They're not over-sweet nor over-hot, and they've got a lot of flavor and texture. Over all I'd say they're among the best snacks you can buy, not only in terms of taste and freshness but because they're far healthier than a lot of the stuff you find on the grocery shelves. However the price is pretty high for the amount you get. Even at the substantially reduced price of the variety pack, it's a little high. However, for the occasional treat, it's well worth the price. It's just not the sort of snack you can dump into a bowl and pass around while watching movies

As a very frugal spender, I had observed this new design of coffee making in the stores and thought the process made sense - so I was ecstatic to receive an email of a promotion one day, I drove many miles to save some bucks and continue to be pleased beyond belief with every new kind of coffee we try. We didn't like the competing cheaper brands but we find Douwe Egbert's Senseo brands consistently delicious. The flavors are subtle enough that we don't feel we're drinking a cup of chemicals. If you like strong coffee, then stick to the 4 oz per pod suggestion. If that seems strong or bitter, we find we can get 2 or 3 more ounces from the pod and be very pleased. For the first time in my 30 year marriage, my husband doesn't make a point of commenting on the delicious coffee everytime we eat out - finally we have predictable great coffee at home. Being able to serve guests their choice of tea, flavors, or caffeine and have everyone enjoy the first cup out is a wonderful benefit

Not because they're rich, but they're a little on the dry side. I still like them so much that I quit buying them at the supermarket started buying them in bulk [...

These are wonderful cookies! However, the reason I couldn't give a full 5 stars was because so many of the boxes in the case had a lot of crumbled cookies. The boxes were not damaged in any way, so I am guessing they could have been packaged that way. Not cool! Otherwise, they are much better tasting than oreos in my opinion. I'll never go back to those

Beware though, I also ordered the peanut butter flavor in July06 and when they arrived at the end of July the expiration date on the case was Aug06. I didn't have any problems with the classic. The expiration date was Nov or Dec I can't remember off hand

Because of health problems, I've had to give up sugar. The agave organic sweetener in my morning cup of coffee has been a perfect substitute. I also use it with cereals and any other food or drink where I used to use sugar.

Thank you, Blue Agave

This is the perfect tea for breakfast or any time of the day. Numi's Yunnan Black tea has a distinctive aroma with a strong apricot top-note fortified by a nice oaky, grassy base. The brewed tea flavor is clean and yet complex, slightly rich. There is a an very slight edge of tannin which perfectly contrasts the subtle woodsy and floral flavors. Excellent with a dash of cream. Unfortunately Numi does not list the amount of caffeine it contains on the box. It appears to have less caffeine than the usual English breakfast from its effect on this taster.

Numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging. The boxes containing their tea is made from 100% recycled paperboard from 100% post-consumer waste--they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2,040 trees, reduce landfill by 131,200, and prevent 184,000 greenhouse emissions. Numi uses only 100% natural ingredients without added oils or "natural flavorings"

Full-flavored and smooth. Lingering winey aftertastes--never bitter. Tolerates higher concentrations very well, actually enhancing body and complexity of flavors. Those who are unfamiliar with bean coffee should be reminded to use about 1/3 more, by volume, to get the same amount, by weight, as with pre-ground coffees.

These might appease your sweet tooth while providing excellent nutrition in a 200 calorie natural food bar. They are not overly chocolately like those chocolate covered protein bars: the bar has delicious chocolate throughout with a terrific crunch of sesame, flax, and sunflower seeds. I'm hypoglycemic and they are perfect to keep in the car for the quick pick up to prevent the need for glucose and a true crisis. I highly recommend. Oh, I have ordered both from Nutiva and from Amazon: Amazon is less expensive and faster delivery

*****
This Bedtime Tea from Yogi Tea is an caffeine-free herbal tea that is relaxing and a natural sleep aid. Bedtime Tea is made from organic licorice root, organic spearmint leaf, organic chamomile flower, organic skullcap leaf, organic cardamom seed, organic cinnamon bark, organic St. John's Wort leaf flower, organic rose hips, natural orange flavor, valerian root extract, organic raspberry leaf, organic English lavender flower, stevia leaf, and passion flower extract. The taste is mild, delicious, herb-y, and very slightly sweet. It is subtle and lovely.

I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Bedtime Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.

There is a warning on the box that this tea is not to be used during pregnancy or while nursing. If you are taking MAO inhibitors or other prescription drugs, you should consult your physician or health care professional before use. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.

Best of all, it works...I love drinking it before bed to relax and drift off into blissful sleep. This is a great tea that I highly recommend.

My family and my healthfood store lady all say this is one of the best of Betty Lou's Nut Butter Balls. I do not have any problems at all with the taste, in fact, it beats the heck out of the coconut ones which are extremely sweet. Yes, they look green in the middle, but we found the taste rather "clean" and refreshing...not overbearing.

You will also enjoy the "lift" in your energy level these spirulina/ginseng balls provide. Now that I know about these little guys, I am getting ready to buy TONS for Christmas gifts! We would not be without them anymore. :-

We enjoyed this coffee. However, decaf may still contain some caffeine. I was watching a news report about disturbed sleep studies and the medical staff at the center stated that not all caffeine is eliminated in decaf. Good to know if you have trouble sleeping or with the jitters.

This is an excellant product. Cooks up very well, great with any sauces,mac'n cheese, and also makes a fantastic macaroni salad. The price from Amazon was really a bargain as all gluten free foods are so very, very expensive. I just wish we didn't have to buy so many packages as storage becomes a problem

Hearty, great-tasting cereal. Has a whole grain flavor. Originally looked at it because of lower carbs than other cereals (which is better for my reduced carb diet). But it has quickly become a favorite cereal and buying six boxes at a time through Amazon.com nets out at a lower cost per box than buying it at local grocery stores.

This is one of my favorite cereals! It appears to be nutritionally superior to the Heritage O's and less crunchy.
The only downside to this cereal is that it doesn't keep me full for long. I feel like an hour later, I'm hungry again. I've combated this by adding banana slices or blueberries to add some bulk to my bowl in hopes of more lasting power.
An upside to the 'downside' is that this makes a terrific between meals snack! I have no problem with polishing off all six boxes in a timely manne

Strong hint of horseradish caught me off guard at first, but I love horseradish, so this mustard is the best! I will never buy prepared mustard from the staore again! Thank you

Tin container not laced in the plasic crap.. The tea is very stonge and not a mixture so you have to add flavors too it but it taste good plain too and is very strong. Taste wise it's stonge with an inner spice like taste in it if you drink your tea how your supposed to -- not a gulper - chuckle. It was less than what I thought from the other reviewer but it is so strong you don't need as much and I'd still have to say it's a great deal. Just add a twist of your favorite herb like orange peal or ginger and this can be the making of a great exotic tea but the only thing it's missing is the organic seal of quality and then it gets 5 stars for proving it's grown under kosher conditions which is very important. The tins are very nice to look at and I hate to thow them away. Obviously they put a lot of pride in the product

I was a little hesitent to make a big order for so much tea, not knowing if I would like it. So I went to a local supermarket and bought a tin there so I might give it a taste test. This is quite a good green tea. Other than buying generic green teabags, I usually buy a Bancha tea. This tea is not as grassy, more bold with a slight smokey taste and more of a kickiness to it.
The cannisters are nice and their is an inside foil liner to keep the tea fresh. The only thing to be aware is that this is a lot of tea, altogether 21 ounces divided into six separate cannisters. Unless you really love this tea, plan on making some gifts

Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the "green pearl" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself "home of silk and tea" for its two primary natural products.

The name "gunpowder" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.

Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream

Someone told me to look on Amazon to locate this product. It's great as a broth but also for gravy and jazzing up beef and poultry entrees'. The taste is OUT OF THIS WORLD and so easy to make. I inject the turkey broth into the turkey before cooking and it enhances the flavor... added bonus since the holidays are just around the corner. Thank you for having this product on Amazon

to using bouillon cubes once you've used and tasted this great product.You'll also wonder why you've been taking pantry space for years with cartons and cans. This is an amazingly simple and easy-to-use packaging concept (no scissors, no can-opener) for a first-rate chicken broth with a really deep home-made taste. The Beef version is excellent too

The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I've become weary reading labels. I've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality.

Nature's Path Organic Apple Cinnamon Toaster Pastries do taste "slightly" healthy, but they remind me of some nutmeg cookies I make that are also made with whole-wheat flour.

Ingredients: Organic apple cinnamon filling (organic evaporated cane juice, organic apple juice concentrate, water, organic evaporated apples, vegetable glycerin, organic apple powder, organic corn startch, organic cinnamon, locust bean gum), organic whole-wheat flour, organic white flour, water, organic evaporated cane juice, organic palm oil, powdered organic eveaporated cane juice, organic invert syrup, salt, leavening, natural flavor, agar, tocopherols (for freshness).

Unfortunately these do contain palm oil, although I don't seem to be as allergic to organic palm oil. Makes me wonder what I'm really allergic to, as in what is in the additional element in the non-organic Palm Kernel Oil. Could it simply be that this is the non-hydrogenated version. Could be.

Each pastry is 190 Calories
40 Calories from Fat

They heat up fast in the toaster and are convenient for a snack.

Granted, this is not one of the better tasting cereals, but when you consider that it will provide the daily recommendation of fiber in just 2/3 cup, the trade-off is worthwhile. If there is an easier way to get 26 grams of fiber, I haven't found it. Just be aware that, if you prefer sugary sweet cereals, this definitely is not the one for you

This cereal is a wonderful (better) choice instead of the Chex line of cereals. It has more fiber, organic ingredients, and no BHT. Excellent as both a cereal w/milk and also when used as part of a homemade trail mix

I've tried 15-20 different k-cups and would rate Timothy's Parisian Night (can you say French Roast) in the top third. At the 7.25 oz setting it makes a full-bodied, dark brew with a nutty, almost earthy taste. It's very much a European-style blend, and with a dash of half and half makes a passable Viennese 'brauner.

Kraft Macaroni and Cheese beckons back to lonely days running home at lunchtime. As I lay heart-strewn and crying about the harsh rejection meted upon me by the fairest of the playground beauties, soft noodles in a cheese cream sauce would ease my ache.

Daily, at morning recess, I would smile weakly and say hello to Heidi, who, in return would grimace. There stood I, in a pile of sadness, swings and slides all around, alone, and she, having moved on, would toil no longer in my presence.

Today, all so many years beyond, I do not remember if it was her kickball skills, or the way she whispered, "Green Eggs and Ham," ever so flirtatiously, just within earshot. Her gentle words were never meant for me no matter how I thought her eyes caught mine, and with clarity, at recess, I was reminded of her tease.

Recess would pass into lunchtime, and as the bell rang, I blew out the door and ran the quarter mile home. Anger, grief, all inside boiling, looking to be purged, pushed me homeward. Second grade happiness would be found where my mom made lunch.

Resting on our kitchen table, steaming with freshly ground pepper, was the golden orange macaroni and cheese. A bit of butter and a few drops of milk converged with the cheese for the smooth-sweet-salty taste with which I could indulge my insatiated heart.

My mother, forever smiling, and me, upset at Heidi who was forever guiling, until soon, I, with my belly full, was no longer riling. Fair maiden was never won by macaroni and cheese, but my broken heart was oft-mended by its flavor

My kids love their Macaroni Cheese but one day all we had was a generic brand. They didn't eat it all that well (Kraft really is the best) so I decided to try to make it a little better for them. Follow the recipe on the box with a couple exceptions. Put one slice of velveeta chees in while melting the butter (I melt the butter while the noodles are draining so as to melt the butter and velveeta faster) and add 1/3 cup milk. What you'll have is a less expensive version of the really creamy macaroni and cheese that Kraft sells for a lot more money. By adding extra milk and cheese they're even getting more calcium. My kids love it when I throw in hot dogs and even peas so feel free to throw in other things since it's so cheesy (the extra cheesy sauce will take things like peas that kids don't normally eat and make them taste good). Give it a try and see what you and/or your kids think

This cereal really tastes good. I make it in the microwave, first heating the fresh cold water to boiling, then adding the cereal, stirring and returning it to the microwave to finish cooking. I let it boil and bubble for a bit in the microwave, which is when the cooking really occurs. I often let it sit in the microwave for a few minutes after it stops, to set up. Years ago a ham radio guy asked me (over the air!) whether I knew how to make gourmet microwave hot cereal. I said no - wondering how you could make anything gourmet, especially cooked cereal, in the microwave - but that I didn't express out loud... so he explained to me the above method, with emphasis on heating the cold water before adding the cereal. And definitely not using hot tap water, as that has the O2 chased out of it, or some such. So I guess that must be it!

I used to laboriously mix various cereal grains to achieve this kind of mix, but with this product it is all done for me. It's also good with raisins added.

I'm delighted that Amazon is selling some of these healthy food items that are hard to find in parts of the country. The special offers bring the price within reason.

BACK IN LOS ANGELES, I HAD DIFFICULTY FINDING IT IN TRADITIONAL HEALTH FOOD STORES. LAST OCTOBER I RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM [...], OFFERING FOOD ITEMS, AMONG THEM MY BELOVED CEREAL. RIGHT AWAY I ORDER 6 BAGS, EACH OF 32 OZ. I RECEIVED IT A FEW DAYS AFTER, AND EVER SINCE I FEEL VERY HAPPY TO GET BACK TO THIS WONDERFUL COMBINATION OF CEREALS. BESIDES THAT, I'M GETTING ECONOMIES OF SCALE WITH THE 32 OZ, COMPARED TO THE 13 OZ BOX I USED TO BUY AT THE HEALTH FOOD STORES.

This cereal meets three major criteria:

1. It is low in sugar - no longer a kid and hate cereal that is too sweet.
2. Stays crunchy - the best flaked cereal I have found for staying crunchy in milk, maybe because the flakes seem a little heartier/thicker than standard flakes.
3. Taste - last but not least, too many of the healthier flakes taste like cardboard, but this cereal is so good I can eat it right out of the bag like a snack.

This cereal is one item in my ultimate breakfast cereal mix. The other ingredients are Kashi's 7 Whole Grain Puffs, dried cranberries, pecans, and flax seed. With Heritage Kashi combined you get all the following grains in one breakfast:

1. Spelt
2. Quinoa
3. Kamut
4. Millet
5. Buckwheat
6. Triticale
7. Rye
8. Red Winter Wheat
9. Barley
10. Oats
11. Brown Rice
12. Sesame Seeds

Then I add the following to the bowl:
13. Flax Seeds - about a tablespoon
14. Pecans - about 2 tablespoons
15. Dried Cranberries - about 2 tablespoons

Then if you really want to go full-on healthy try Better Than Milk Original Flavor Vegan Soy Beverage, the best soy milk out there...see my review of it.

My favourite tea in loose leaf form... it just doesn't get any better than this. The tins are a good size (not so small that it's gone after four cups of tea but not so large that it'll be stale and moldy before you could possibly finish it) that fit nicely in my desk at work as well as on the counter by the teapot. The tea is fresh and flavourful with the quality I've come to expect from Twinings.

This Lady Grey loose tea is a sensory experience. It is light and citrusy with just the right kick of caffeine. The flower petals are pretty but I cannot taste any difference they might make in the steeped tea. It would make a nice gift for a woman who you don't know very well. All in all it is worth a try

I can't say enough good things about this variety and brand of tea. The bergamot and other citrus elements in the tea and the delicacy of the tannins make milk, sweetener or lemon completely unnecessary. The color and aroma are just lovely, making this a fantastic treat for the novice or experienced tea drinker, and it has just enough caffeine to get me through tedious afternoons without making me jittery. I carry the bagged variety everywhere I go

If you havn't tried Lady Grey, try it and then buy the loose leaf at this price. You won't regret it. This is one of the best everyday teas I've found, with a healthy dash of citrus and a flowery finish with no cloying flavors, it really is a good all around tea for any time of the day. Buying it on Amazon saves a lot of time trying to find it in stock and it arrived faster than the books I ordered at the same time

****
This Kava Stress Relief Tea from Yogi Tea is for anxiety relief. It's an unusual tea, slightly sweet (it contains stevia) and very carob-y. The good news is that it does not have any of the usual kava taste or smell that many people find offensive. The bad news is that I can't feel any of the anxiety relief effects of the tea, although it does say that there are 78mg of kava root extract in the tea. Still, it's a lovely cup of tea, and relaxing because it just tastes good. I can also taste the spiciness of the tea, which is very pleasant. I usually brew two bags in one cup, which is recommended on the package for a stronger and more relaxing effect; however, I even tried four bags once, but still didn't notice a relaxing effect. I am familiar with kava and the overall effect of kava is pretty subtle anyway, so this is something to be aware of. Your experience of the tea may be different.

Kava Stress Relief Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh) and has many organic ingredients.

The ingredients in Kava Stress Relief Tea are: kava root extract, carob pod, Indian sarsaparilla root, organic cinnamon bark, organic ginger root, organic cardamom seed, stevia leaf, barley malt, natural hazelnut flavor, natural cinnamon flavor, and natural licorice flavor. Amazingly, I can taste many of these in this lovely and complex cup of tea. I would rate the taste five stars for flavor and uniqueness.

Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make. Their tea bag tags have metaphysical sayings on them like, "Your breath is the voice of your soul" and "Your head must bow to your heart".

Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Kava Stress Relief tea helps you calm down as it relieves stress, anxiety and minor pain, as well as lending gentle support to the digestion and the kidneys. A member of the peppercorn family, Kava (Piper methysticum) is a highly prized medicinal and beverage plant, whose primary benefit is alleviating anxiety. "Kava-kava," native to Oceania and the South Pacific Islands, has been used and cultivated for its ability to calm the body and mind, and encourage a good night's sleep. A powerful antispasmodic, this herb promotes a state of "relaxed unconcern" while compromising neither mental functions nor clarity of thought when used appropriately. Furthermore, Kava has been shown to relax the uterus and relieve menstrual cramps and minor menopausal symptoms.* The Herb Research Foundation (2000) indicates that scientific data supports the use of kava for minor anxiety, stress, restlessness, muscle tension and mild pain. For added flavor, our formula has been complemented with Stevia, Sarsaparilla and Organic Carob. Enjoy a warm soothing cup of Kava Stress Relief, a delicious way to relax."

In addition to the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, there is a warning on the box, "Ask a healthcare professional before use if you have or have had liver problems, frequently use alcoholic beverages, or are taking any medication. Stop use and see a doctor if you develop symptoms that may signal liver problems (e.g., unexplained fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fever, vomiting, dark urine, pale stools, yellow eyes or skin). Not for use by persons under 18 years of age, or by pregnant or breastfeeding women. Not for use with alcoholic beverages. Excessive use, or use with products that cause drowsiness, may impair your ability to operate a vehicle or heavy equipment."

Note that the media scare about kava several years ago was not for the kava root, and it is my opinion that based on my own research that kava is very safe. However, I am not a physician, and if you have any health concerns, you should check with an appropriate professional.

I decided to give Kava Stress Relief Tea four stars since it didn't really work for me. Still, it is a wonderful and recommended tea, and may work for you!

is very similar to raspberry teas found at your favorite eateries. We found it necessary to drink with our sweetener. A refreshing drink, but has a slight after taste to it, maybe making this tea in large quantity is what did it (4 qts). I would have rated a 5, but taste was a little off.

These teas (both the raspberry and the blueberry) are priced lower than in the grocery store ($3.49 per individual box), where they are usually a seasonal item. This is frustrating since my husband and I are hooked on them and probably brew and drink a full pitcher per day. They are the best tasting cold ice teas and great for the antioxidant benefits. This seller shipped them promptly and they were very well packed. We will be a repeat buyer for sure. A+!!!!!!!!!!!

I really like this cereal by Nature's Path... It is very good and tasty. However, I just found a new favorite which is the Zen version with Cranberries and Ginger. I highly recommend both of them though. The Optimum has more fiber and has a completely different taste then the Zen so if you need to change it up go for this one too

This "Optimum Power" breakfast cereal contains wheat, oats, barley, soy, flaxseeds and something Nature's Path calls "Kamut" which look like puffed oats. Also there are freeze-dried blueberries, a few anyway, and a delightful subtle cinnamon flavor hits you. The ingredient list contains a few other things that are probably good for you. Now the third ingredient in the 16-ingredient list - and these lists are supposed to be in order according to percentage with the largest first - is something called "organic evaporated cane juice". Now what is that but organic sugar? This probably accounts for the cereal being somewhat sweet, as another reviewer noted. But it is nowhere near as sweet as those tooth-decaying, empty-caloried, mass-marketed cereals most Americans are feeding their children. No, this cereal is well within the tolerance of us "granolas" who don't dowse everything with sugar, ketchup and supermarket mayonnaise. (No, I don't mean on cereal. Just making a point.)

So when you pour this out of the box, you see a lot of extruded, elongated brown rod-shaped thingies, quite a few healthy-looking chubby flakes, some of those exploded oat-looking morsels that are probably the Kamuts and here and there a desiccated blueberry. Gawd, when I get started writing like this, I can't stop, I just get more so. Better not review anything else tonight. You'll never want to eat this. Actually, my description of the thingies could have been far more graphic and devilish. You'll see. Please do try this cereal, you'll like the heartiness, the cinnamoniness (new word?) and the relatively light sweetness. I did give it five stars, didn't I

Don't mind the reviewer saying it tastes nasty. It's quite good, and, as with any tea, you can brew it as light as you want. I don't think this tea is too strong at all, I brew it with the hottest water I can for as long as I can.

It's a very healthy, tasty, beneficial tea. Highly recommended.

High in protein, low in calories, and great flavor. I split them in half and eat the first portion as a mid-morning snack and the second portion as an afternoon snack. They keep me feeling full and prevent me from eating junk food, which has been great for my waistline. I can't say enough good things about Kashi

Tastes too good to actually be healthy. Sound too good to be true? I thought so, but it is really true. Nice job Kashi.

If you have never eaten Kashi products, you are in for a treat. There are some I like better than others, but for food that is good for you, it is a pleasant surprise

These are the only cookies I have found that I can safely eat without feeling poorly afterwards and which taste similar to a "real" chocolate chip cookie. I try to limit refined sugars, wheat flour, and dairy products in my diet for health reasons, but oh, how I miss cookies. The ones I bake myself just don't taste that great, but these chocolate chip cookies from Nana's help me keep to my prescribed way of eating. I don't know what I'd do without them! I like to freeze them, and sometimes I top one with a bit of Rice Dream "ice cream" on top. Yummy!

I found a package of these berries first at Costco in Arvada, Colorado and found these to be the BEST dried fruit I've ever had. I've since requested at my local Costco (Honolulu, Hawaii) that they carry these and I keep waiting and waiting. I was thrilled to find these on the Amazon website and ordered four bags right away.

Thank you for carrying it

This is a dream! Quick-brew _and_ blueberry! It's slightly slower brewing than plain Lipton quick-brew tea, but it does brew up in about three minutes. It's definitely blueberry flavored, and it's a little red in color. For we impatient flavored tea lovers, this is a great product

THESE ARE VERY GOOD BISCOTTI! I'VE ORDERED 4 BOXES OF 12 IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS. THEY WERE NICE TO GIVE AS GIFTS. THEY WERE GOOD TO BRING TO SOMEONES HOUSE FOR DESSERT. THE CHOCOLATE DECADENCE AND THE ONES WITH THE TOFFEE BITS AND ALMONDS ARE VERY GOOD. THE ONLY NEGATIVE IS THE SHIPPING AND HANDLING COST. IF I DID NOT GET THE FREE SHIPPING AND HANDLING; I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED THEM. THEY'RE GOOD; BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO SPEND AN EXTRA $20 TO DELIVER

Twinings Orange Pekoe tea is a delightful, smooth tea. It delivers a pleasing cup of tea without acid harshnest. Yet it is full of flavor and rich amber color. A good choice in the evening or anytime you want to pamper yourself with pleasure. It's a tea to be savored

Green is good, of course. But what's much better than green are these truly awesome cookies. PN Os beat the bootie out of any Oreo variation -- crunchier, more filling(without being smarmy), much better taste. (And this goes for the mint, the vanilla, and the chocolate.)

Fast Eddie Felson -- I love you.

These cookies are superb all by themselves. Far superior to "that other sandwich cookie" in every way. But if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence, melt some Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Chips in your double boiler, and dip these cookies, then remove to a rack to dry. Your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store, and beg you for more. Keep out of reach of children

These high-sodium ginger cookies are too tasty to have around - you'll easily surpass your RDA of sodium in one sitting.

The nutrition facts that Amazon neglected to post are: Serving size is 2 cookies (28 g). Each serving has 160 mg of sodium, 4.5 mg of fat (2 g saturated, 0 g transfat), 19 g of total carbs (10 g sugars), and 0 g of cholesterol.

The ingredients in these "Made in U.S.A." cookies are organic unbleached wheat flour, powdered sugar, organic palm fruit oil, organic molasses, organic sugar, sodium bicarbonate (leavening), ground ginger, soy lecithin (an emulsifier), salt, monocalcium phosphate (leavening), and nutmeg. There are no hydrogentated oils or trans fats.

On the back of the package is an Ode to Ginger-O's, which reads: "You might, m'lady tweak my nose. You could, m'lord step on my toes. But Heaven help those poor bozos, who try to filch my Ginger-O's ".

Again, these high-sodium cookies taste too good in order to effectively exercise self-discipline to limit the quantity eaten.

My children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream. These are a bit softer than the O's we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat! =) We purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too - YUMMY

These are a great deal...Cost $2.75 per box they are $3.99 per box at our local grocery store. They are also very tasty and a healthy snack. Our whole family loves them. I worried about buying a case just seemed like a lot but they are going fast and if you are box top saving people...there is one on every box! So they are good for schools too!

Now, one of the reviewers of this product complained about the sugar content of this cereal by only looking at the ingredients list, which is not how to determine the nutritional value of any product (especially when the reviewer cannot distinguish between nutritive and non-nutritive ingredients). This cereal has just as many simple sugars as Frosted Flakes, but the cereal does not claim to be low in sugar. What's important about this cereal is that it offers quite a bit of fiber and vitamins/minerals (not as much as some cereals, but since I have no deficiencies in this area, I didn't mind). Also, it only has 3 times the salt of a half cup of milk which is not LOADED. A can of healthy choice soup, now that is loaded with salt.

Now, I chose this cereal as a replacement for Frosted Flakes/Honey Nut Cheerios, which against my better judgment I continued to have every morning. I should point out that I don't drink coffee in the mornings and I don't drink soda (less than 1 a week on average). I also eat no sweets. Simple sugars (listed as just "Sugars" on the nutrition label) seem to be treated like carcinogens, while most people don't realize that aspartame (artificial sweetener in most diet sodas) really is one. If your diet is already low in sugar and you feel confident you can burn through those sugars pretty quick (since I don't drink caffeinated drinks, I need that jolt in the morning), then this is a good choice. If your diet already has quite a bit of sugar or your doctor tells you to cut down on simple sugars (or you also have a couple of cups of caffeinated coffee with sugar every morning), then go with another bran cereal without the oat clusters and syrups (which I really do not like that much). Also, if you are concerned about the total carbs, please note that a normal 2000 calories diet would include about 300g of carbohydrates (so yes, high protein diets contradict this).

Since taste is completely subjective, I won't put much emphasis on it. In my opinion, it tastes pretty good (but I don't consume many sweets during the day).

These should not be confused with dessert. As the name states, these are a breakfast cookie, originally developed for people in a hurry who do not stop for a cooked meal. This variety has chocolate chunks but is not a chocolate cookie. Other varieties are available. Cookie varieties are based on the original recipe. They are available in the full 3 ounce size, or as mini-cookies. They have a good nutritional balance. They do have an expiration date. Like all bakery products, they do not stay fresh forever. As other reviewers have warned, you need to check the expiration date, especially if you are not buying them direct from the bakery. Day old bread is also sold at bargain prices, but you get day old bread. I found that the fresh cookies are yummy and they do fill you up. I would recommend them for your travel bags (better than airline food which has often been reduced to yucky box lunches), for your desk drawer if you get busy and have to skip lunch, or for a convenient trail food if you are hiking. I used the Rocky Road variety (seasonal special) in Christmas stockings and the pumpkin variety (seasonal special) in Halloween bags

These things are great...I love Baker's Breakfast cookies. This flavor is pretty darn good, too, big chunks of chocolate and lots of flavor. Doesn't taste fake at all. I prefer a couple other flavors more, but this is definately a winner. These cookies taste like a treat but are really healthy for you. They will fill you up for hours, especially with a glass of water, juice or milk to wash it down

I recently decided to give these Diedrich K-Cups a whirl. For years, I've been a dedicated Green Mountain Coffee Roaster customer, and their K-Cup varieties are excellent; however, even at their "Cafe Express" discount rate, their coffees are more expensive by several dollars per 25 count pack than the current price Amazon is offering on Diedrich blends.

I'd been traveling in Southern California a few months ago and tried some Diedrich coffees then. Although the coffees I tried tended to exhibit the Starbucks/West Coast tendency to roast beans too darkly -- to the point of effacing some of the original regional characteristics of the beans -- they are fine for dark roasts and preferable to what I've had from Starbucks. Coupled with the Keurig brewer, this makes for a decent cup of medium-to-dark "West Coast" style coffee

My mother absolutely loves this tea, it's the only kind she will use. I received a container of it in a gift basket, and called bentley to find out where I could purchase more, and they told me they don't sell to the public. My mom was very upset... I then went on to Amazon (which was great for all my christmas shopping), who put me in touch with bently, so My mother had a wonderful christmas!!!

These cereal bars by Kellogg's are the best!

Well, actually, at first I wasn't that sure. It's rare to see a cereal bar on the grocery shelf that actually has 20 % of your daily requirement for fiber in just one bar! I was very impressed by that claim and so I brought a box home to try it out.

These cereal bars are tasty and quite easy to chew on when you're in need of a quick breakfast or snack that has some health quality to it. They aren't that expensive, either. Moreover, there are no trans fats although there is a very, very slight amount of partially hydrogenated oils in the bar. These cereal bars contain some vitamins, too, which is always a plus.

However, one caveat: be careful if you have any allergies to wheat, soy, milk and/or almonds. Stay away unless your doctor tells you it's OK to have this food.

Highly recommended! Enjoy! SMILES

I don't like plain coffee but even more, I don't need or like all the calories and fat that come with using flavored coffee creamers. Even the sugar-free creamers have a ton of fat, part of which is hydrogenated/partially hydrogenated.
Flavor Blends for coffee are a wonderful alternative to fatty creamers. Easy to use and they come in portable small packages you can take with you anywhere. This is not a creamer but more a flavored "sugar". One packet gives a yummy, subtle hazelnut flavor but without being too sweet the way some things with Splenda are.

My mom first sent my husband a box in his care package - he is stationed North of Baghdad, Iraq - and it was the best thing he had ever received. Being in the Army for 24 years, he has had his share of bad coffee, but he doesn't have to have wake up to that anymore. I sent him another six boxes of the Hazelnut, Mocha, and French Vanilla. He says the Hazelnut is his, but he shares the rest. It is a big hit with his unit and all have commented on the AWESOME taste and that the Army coffee is significantly improved! We won't allow him to run out a box or two are added to every care package my mom and I send. Nothing but the best for the Troops

This is a pretty good Splenda flavor, but the Mocha is best, in my opinion. The French Vanilla is a second favorite. Hazelnut is better than no flavor at all. I use one flavored packet and one regular Splenda packet in a large (14 oz) mug, and it's perfect. Not necessary to use two flavored ones, as it is a little pricey and one has enough flavor for an entire travel mug

Ever since I have tried this productI eat some everyday!! It is the perfect blend of savory, tangy, sweet, and a touch spicy. I know that sounds like a weird combo, but its sooo good, addicting even. I initially bought this prouct at a local natural and whole foods store, but amazon .com has the lowest price I've seen anywhere and u cant beat free shipping!! It's so conveniant. I have ordered this product from amazon several times and I must mention one order contained multiple expired items that were definitely stale tasting, so I let customer service know and they immediately responded and very pleasantly resolved the matter to my satisfaction. I do suggest the multiple 12 2 oz multiple pack only because this blend is so yummy portion control is helpful!!

My local Sam's Club discontinued the Nature's Path maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal due to lack of sales. I was bummed and did not want to resort to the highly processed Quaker instants - ick! Not to mention I'm tired of all the junk ingredients in mainstream food nowadays. Then I remembered Amazon selling a lot of easily shippable, bulk foods - including organics! :-)

The Nature's Path oatmeal absorbs water much better and the texture is heartier than other leading brands. It is also very flavorful. The variety pack is nice, since I used to tire of the Sam's Club selection of maple and brown sugar only. My kids love steel cut oats with a little pure maple syrup, but it's not the most convenient breakfast food. The Nature's Path instant oatmeal is quick and easy during the busy weekday mornings. And best of all, I can understand the ingredients label without having to take a chemistry refresher class.

I'm very satisfied with my first organic purchase from Amazon. We now peruse the selection of organic foods on Amazon before making local purchases

Most grocery store variety oatmeals have fillers and are from the rolled oats variety. The best tasting and most nutritious oatmeal comes from steel cut oats, but it is a chore to cook. You have to cook it very slowly and watch it carefully as it will easily boil over all over the place.

I was astounded to find instant organic steel cut oats at my local Costco. You simply open a packet into a bowl, add boiling water from your kettle or microwave and stir. There are many flavors to suit your moods. All of them are delicious in my opinion. Try this and you will agree.

My Costco stopped carrying this brand, so I found it here on Amazon. Apparently there were many requests at Costco and they have now decided to again carry this brand. It is cheaper at my Costco. $8.35 for 32 packets and 53.6 ounces.

You can't beat this for a quick breakfast

I ordered this sauce which is very good and VERY spicy. The only drawback is that when I opened the package, one jar had cracked and leaked (a real mess). Amazon sent a replacement and the same thing happened because they were not shrink wrapped first. They were loose in the box with just some bubble wrap

Typical of central Italy, this sauce has the characteristic of being hot, after all, Arrabbiata means "mad" in Italian. Although tolerance to spiciness is very subjective, this sauce will not overwhelm your palate. Enjoy this beautiful blend of flavors: the freshness of parsley, a hint of hand picked organic marjoram, and the "madness" of the habanero.

Recipe suggestions: Excellent as a dip for shrimp or chips; spicy and delicious over tacos, quesadillas or any Mexican dish. Unexpectedly delicious over chicken cutlet or poached fish, grilled vegetables au gratin or saut�ed portabella mushroom! We've also added it to a seafood bouillabaisse for a fantastic dinner party idea.

I love this mac cheese. It has all of the comfort food aspects of easy mac (warm and gooey, orange cheese) but without that vague chemical aftertaste. It tastes so cheddar cheesey and is wonderful to keep on hand for those days when there is just NO food in the fridge (you don't even need to add milk to this!). My favorite comfort food when I'm sick

Annie's Homegrown Deluxe Shells Real Aged Wisconsin Cheddar is the best mac-n-cheese straight out of the box I ever tasted. Kids and grown-ups agree.

A note to the other reviewers- don't try to ruin my mac-n-cheese comfort food experience with your cardboard tastin' whole wheat pasta and no salt sauce. If you're so inclined to have it just how you would make it, go ahead and make your own. It's just mac-n-cheese after all.

My children and I agree: this is the best tasting mac and cheese on the market. This is a great price, too... about 1.30 a box less than I usually pay. When kids are eating several boxes a week that adds up quickly.

I do agree with the other reviewer about the ways this mac and cheese could be even closer to perfection. But I have one child who is very careful about what she will and will not eat, and for her, this product is a gift. Highly recommended

I do not understand the bad reviews of this product. They smelled great, had a nice texture, and tasted like a dried cherry should. They did not clump at all like many dried fruits out there do. They also DID NOT taste like cardboard or were dried like NASA space food like some of the dried fruit out there does.

I use these in my tea, I chop them up and toss in my vanilla ice cream, and I eat them straight out of the bag. These are the best dried cherries I have ever eaten

This is an all-time favorite tea of mine. I spend hundreds of dollars a year on tea - and this tea really hits the spot in my favorite top ten list of teas. The only downfall about this tea is that it is not made with strings. I like to have strings on my bags of tea. But no matter what this is the best peppermint tea i've ever drank!

Celestial Seasonings is a great brand.

This tea will smell up your kitchen with a lovely invigorating scent. Perfect for the mornings.

I also use this tea when my stomach is upset, if my joints are sore, to help with cramps, and to help with gas! Peppermint is a natural reliever for IBS, especially if you have the flu or a bad cold peppermint tea really seems to bring up your spirits and relieve stomach irritations

This is Celestial Seasonings at their best-a plump bag of fresh tasty peppermint leaf, which brews up to a clean delicious cup of tea! Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet, clean taste.

Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea. Peppermint combats flatulence, promotes bile flow and digestive juices, and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion. It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension, soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle.

Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface

I use this mostly in my coffee and tea and find that it adds a kind of sweetness that I enjoy. I've had others try it and some have liked it as much as I do, and others said it wasn't for them. I remember reading years ago that Stevia has a slight licorice taste to it, but I don't detect any of that sort of taste at all. My online research leads me to believe that that might have something to do with inulin fiber (FOS) thats also a part of this sweetener.
I tried Splenda and didn't like it.
Everyone's tastes and body chemistry are different, but if you're looking to reduce the amount of sugar in your diet without feeling like you are suffering for it, then give this a try

I've been using SweetLeaf SteviaPlus for about 3 weeks now, and I'm so glad I decided to try it. I was worried about the research coming out about aspartame; and Splenda... well, it just does terrible things to my stomach. I simply can't use it. So I started doing some web-searching and learned about stevia. I liked the fact that it was natural and used extensively in other countries, such as Japan. But I still kept my expectations low... it sounded too good to be true and I figured it would taste awful. I ordered SweetLeaf SteviaPlus and to my surprise and delight, I love the taste. It's sweet, and no bitterness. Now I'm a person who is used to using artificial sweeteners, so someone who uses only sugar might have a different opinion, but I did share it with a coworker to use in his tea, and he really liked it as well. So, don't be afraid to try it if you haven't already. I notice that I'm feeling a lot better lately. Maybe it's the switch from artificial sweeteners to stevia. At any rate, I'm happy with it, and I recently placed another order for both packets and tablets

Twinings was founded in London, England in 1706, and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. The history of Darjeeling tea goes back to the 1840s, when Dr. Campbell, a civil engineer, planted tea seeds in his garden at Beechwood, Darjeeling. The result was a nice light tea with excellent color and aroma. Darjeeling tea gained a considerable following, and is now highly prized as the "champagne of teas!"

OK, let's get down to brass tacks - this is an excellent tea, produced by a great company, and a tea I will NEVER be without. The tea has an excellent aroma and flavor and is harder to over-steep than some other teas that I have known. Also, something of a surprise is the fact that this tea tastes at least as good iced as it does hot! As such, year round you will find me making Twinings' Darjeeling tea.

So, here's the bottom line: if you want a tea that is excellent hot AND cold, then Darjeeling is for you. If you want tea from a great tea producer, then Twinings is for you. If you want the best tea in the world, then buy Twinings' Darjeeling tea

Adding another Italian classic to our product line, Puttanesca comes from the expression puttanaio which, to put it modestly, translates into "a lot of things going on at the same time". The rich combination of flavors: garlic, black olives, capers and fresh herbs come from the tradition of southern regional cooking.

Recipe suggestions: Use it over pasta or to add some spice to chicken, fish...or your relationship - just heat and serve, or bake it in. Try mixing it in with scrambled eggs rolled in pita bread for a brunch alternative! The favorite? Grill or pan sear swordfish and pour it on.

This pasta is very good. It works great in salads, casseroles or regular pasta dishes. I've only been gluten free for a few months and I think this tastes very similar to wheat pasta. Granted, I've only tried one other kind of gluten-free pasta (made all of brown rice) but this pasta is FAR better and I like it enough that I feel no need to keep shopping around and trying other kinds

Dried Fruit? The point of debate here is dried fruit. These are delicious; I ate many, many handfuls each serving. Their more like gum drops because of the sugar added by "infusion". I'm suprised that the oil does not factor into the flavor at all.

Not a typical dried fruit.

HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!

Oh my good god. These are quite possibly *the* most delicious things I have ever eaten.

In my life.

I came across these raspberries last year at a Costco here in SoCal, and then - to my dismay - they recently stopped carrying them. I've since been searching EVERYWHERE, and I am THRILLED to finally find them here!

No other brand of dried fruit can compare. Their blueberries and cherries are also excellent (and I usually don't care for either).

Highly highly HIGHLY recommended!

Wished I had read the nutritional facts before I bought this as 100/120 calories per serving are fat; 5 serving to a jar therefore 500 calories of fat in one 20 ounce jar. Ouch. Good thing I work out as I can afford that from time to time.

Having said that, this does taste pretty good although I have had better when I have eaten out at good cafes. Taste is 4 stars for me.

I paired this with canned sockeye salmon and rotini and it made for a quick and good meal.

Note that the sauce is pinker in color than the picture on my monitor.

Overall, good enough to make me want to try some on their other mixtures.

Edit: Forced to update this as I later discovered one of the jars had developed a hairline crack and started leaking in storage. This makes the 3rd order of products from this company that has developed leaking problems. I won't purchase this company's products again, not because of the taste but because of the leakage issues

What a great line of sauces the Scarpetta brand brings to the table. I have tried all of them and the time saving of having these already in my kitchen is very helpful. I am able to put a what seems to be a different, slow cooked italian meal on the table each night in just minutes. The flavor profile of each of the Scarpetta brands is unique and tastes truly homemade. You can feel the love that went onto each sauce. Try them, you won't regret it

First I'd like to say that many of Nana's cookies are most delicious and I've tried most of the flavors. My favorites tend to be this one and the chocolate coconut chip. As one of the other reviewers pointed out you have to have a particular palate to enjoy this type of cookie. For those of use that try to limit our processed cane sugar intake or have particular dietary restrictions...vegan, sugar substitutes, etc. these are really delicious and allow a taste of that bad for you diet that we've been led to believe we want. Thanks Nana's for the natural foodie options

The chocolate crunch is my favorite of the gluten-free Nana's cookies, though the lemon is pretty good too. I have a feeling the person who gave these 1 star is someone who can eat a freakin' cinnabon if she wants to. For those of us who have dietary restrictions, it's a different story.

It does take a while to get used to gluten free fare, but these cookies are among the best I've had, which is pretty impressive since they don't even have sugar in them. And the fact that they don't have gluten, eggs, nuts, or dairy in them either is wonderful (yes, there are those of us out there allergic to all these things). I just wish more stores carried them. But now that I've found them on Amazon, I'll be ordering in bulk. ;

To have a picky eater eat all the fruits from this company is amazing to me. I love them too, great for a quick low calorie healthy snack

These are great: our vegan Golden Retriever seems to *love* them (and is very healthy); the cows, pigs, chicks are pretty-darn happy she's eating veggie-treats; the treats are organic; and Newman's donates the profits to charities! Now that's a win-win-win-win!

I only gave them 4 stars since the bags are so small and cause a lot of packaging waste which Newman's should be well aware of (why should we have to buy 6-packs of 10-oz bags instead of 30-oz or 60-oz bags)? When that's resolved, they're getting 5-stars from me

This is the best tasting shredded (= dessicated) coconut I have found anywhere in the USA. It is organic and sulfite free. This is the unsweetened, finely shredded, very small pieces of dessicated coconut which is used in South East Asia, Australia etc. This is not the same product as American style coconut, of which the most common type is Baker's sweetened angel flake coconut.

I like to buy finely shredded/dessicated coconut because I often bake Australian, British and European style cakes and cookies, which do not work well when made with flake coconut. I have also discovered that finely shredded coconut can be used to make your own coconut milk or coconut cream at home.

Flake coconut and dessicated coconut have a different taste and texture. A cup of sweetened angel flake coconut has about 2 tablespoons of sugar added to it, so it is very sweet compared to shredded/dessicated coconut, which has no added sugar at all. The shredded/dessicated coconut is drier and the pieces are very small compared to the flakes, so it has more surface area. Because of these two things, 8oz of dessicated coconut will absorb more liquid than 8oz of flake coconut. Some recipes will work quite well with either kind of coconut, but others will not, even if you compensate for the sugar and liquid. Its better, especially for baking, to use whatever the recipe originally calls for.

The coconut I received from Amazon tasted very fresh and had a good use by date. If you want to increase the shelf life of the coconut, throw the bags into the freezer or the refrigerator. They will keep there a year. Once a bag is opened, I always keep it in the refrigerator. I don't like buying this kind of coconut from health food stores, as it often comes in bulk bins and has been exposed to the air. Unsweetened organic coconut can get stale or even develop a rancid taste if it is stored open to the air. The sweetened flake coconut is much more stable because it contains preservatives and sugar.

If you are an Australian wanting to make things like lamingtons or coconut ice, you need to use dessicated/finely shredded cooconut. Flake coconut will not give the right results. Dessicated/finely shredded coconut is also excellent for replicating those little coconut macaroon cookies that you find in many Chinese buffet restaurants.

Shredded/dessicated coconut can be mixed with water to make your own coconut milk or coconut cream. I find this is useful because I rarely use more than 1/2 a can when I cook with coconut milk (curries, soups, laksa etc). Sometimes I only want a spoonful or two, to add a little flavor to a smoothie or a banana cake. I have tried making coconut milk from flake coconut, but for my taste, it was way too sweet and did not have a good texture.

To make coconut milk from dessicated coconut:

Method 1. Put equal parts of coconut and hot water by weight into a blender (eg 8oz coconut to 1 cup of hot water). Whizz in the blender for a minute or two. If desired, you can strain and press it through a cloth or a fine sieve when it has cooled down. This is not necessary for most recipes, unless you require a silky smooth texture for the end product. For a lighter coconut milk, use 8oz of coconut to one and a half cups of water, or you can use "lite" shredded coconut to start with.

Method 2.
Simmer equal parts by weight of coconut with hot water until froth appears. Do not boil. Remove from heat and let it sit until it cools down. If desired, you can strain it through a cloth bag or a very fine sieve, pressing out as much liquid as possible.

To make a thick coconut cream from dessicated coconut:
Use either method above, but use 4 parts of coconut to one part of water.

I thought the price from Amazon was excellent, especially for an organic product. At the time of purchase, it worked out at one dollar forty two cents per 8oz bag and in my case, shipping was free. I can't find organic dessicated coconut anywhere else at this price.

Overall I was very pleased with the taste, freshness, price and quality of this coconut. I don't think that I will have any problems using up the 12 packets in one year, especially as I won't be buying any cans of coconut milk.

I use plenty of this product regularly when making ice cream, cookies, cakes etc... I find that this product has a sort of natural sweetness or flavor on its own. Because of this much less added sugar is needed in baked goodies and in some cases added sugar is eliminated. To obtain this, i use this organic unsweetened coconut in combination with organic whole milk.

These are the perfect snack for on the go. Actual REAL fruit--No sugar! No "roll-ups" with 10% fruit! They are not dry or leathery and even little kids can chew them well. Just the right size for toddlers and small kids (and Moms too). Great to stick in the diaper bag or purse for an impromptu healthy snack. Works in any weather (won't melt) and even survives at the bottom of the purse! Comes in lots of flavors, an organic version, and bigger bars too for a bigger snack. Cheaper than lesser products at the grocery store. GREAT!

The taste is OK, but not great. The one thing about this that is somewhat annoying is that it's a two serving packet which means that it makes 16 ounces for liquid. I really only want to eat up 8 ounces at a time. That means I have to guess how much is half and then roll up the bag to save the remaining portion. Even if I did want to eat the entire packet, I don't have a bowl that is 16 ounces (and all my bowls are perfectly normal sized). The bottom line here is that there is nothing wrong with the taste of the soup (still, I'm not in love with it). I just wish there was a better way of packaging. I'm the only one eating it, and maybe that affects my opinion. If you have more than one person in your family then it won't be a problem at all, and you can ignore everything I've said.

This is a great alternative to chicken soup if you get sick. It will alkalinize you blood and help to get better much faster than you would normally do. Also try it in the morning instead of your regular cup of java - it will perk you up without the jitters of caffeine. True it has a lot of solium, but this sodium is from sea salt that brings with it much needed trace minerals. The seaweed veriety is the best. Open minded and adventurous folks will love it right away, for others it may take some time to get used to. Do try. Your body will thank you

Looks like it got squashed a little, and i guess somebody opened the package because i think there was supposed to be a seal there since this is new. But I checked everything inside it counted all of the peices and everything was there. I tried one and its great. This is a good buy for what you get. I just got a Damaged package but its not damaged that badly just the outside is a bit squased. Overhaull 4 stars out of 5 I will buy here again. Fast delivery. Thank

I recieved the variety pack today and tried this flavor first. I buy natural snacks for my kids (freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar), but I find them bland. So I ordered these and I love them. In fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it - it wasn't too spicy for her. You can tell they used "hot" spices, but they are very well done so as to not be too much. The nuts are big and crunchy and the fruit is small and chewy. There is about equal of both nuts and fruit. They do use evaporated cane juice and organic tapioca syrup, but these are healthier than alternatives and there are still only 5 grams of sugar per 1/4 cup serving

The product, if reviewed just on taste, would only warrant a two, but the convenience is worth a five. It is probably the best La Briute product that I have found. It is a two minute meal that is not completely objectionable, but it is way too salty

Unlike the December 2006 review, and much like the most recent reviews, there's not much in this soup, other than very small bits of seafood and some potato. I'm thinking that 1) the recent quality has gone downhill, or 2) the December 2006 review was a "plant." Anyway, the taste was okay, but it definitely doesn't rate up there with Legal Seafood (which I've had at one of the restaurants, and at the Boston airport, both much better than this)

I love soups and stews and I am in LOVE with this Seafood Chowder. It's the absolute best flavor and chock full of a variety of seafood. The taste is great!! I've tried many many chowders and this ranks the highest of any I have ever eaten....even Legal Seafood's or Wolfgang Puck's or several local Massachsetts seaside restaurants. And it's all natural with no artificial ingredients. I recommend this to everyone who loves seafood and chowders. Of all the Baxter Soups and Chowders, this is really the only one I recommend everyone try. I repeat...it's great!! It is a bit high in salt though.....~1,400 mg/can but if this is the only salty food eaten all day...it's OK. Try it....it's heavenly!

Quite tasty! No flavorings in the rice but still a very nice light lunch. Can be a bit messy for those of us who are not skilled sushi roll wrappers. I was planning on making this a regular part of my pantry but see that the price has just gone up changing it from a good value to not enough food for the money.If the price goes down I'll buy it again but not for 15 dollars a six pack

These are a definite time saver with a couple of faults which another reviewer pointed out -- no flavorings in the rice, nori cut too small. To get around the rice problem, just add a little rice vinegar and sugar to the rice and it comes out quite good. I don't particularly like wasabi but they should probably add a packet to the box for those who do. The nori sheets taste good and fresh if maybe slightly salty for my tastes. As stated before though, they are definitely cut way too small. You cannot achieve any kind of decent looking roll with them, but if you aren't picky about what the finished product looks like and if you pack any added ingredients pretty thin, you can get it to hold together long enough to eat it. Bottom line is for the ten bucks I paid for 6 packages, I'd say it is a definite winner for 6 cheap fast lunches that taste much better than they look. I can't eat one sushi roll at a local sushi bar for less than 8 to 10 bucks. Now that the price for these has gone up a little, I'd probably consider just buying the larger size Annie Chun precooked sticky rice containers (if Amazon gets them back in stock) and providing my own full size nori sheets.

Pretty good. Solid peanut butter taste and no digestive problem. I enjoyed them for hiking and biking. I don't recommend them near water, because when wet they taste not so good.

Good snack for kids when hungry and its better for them then sugarly things.

My husband is pre-diabetic and is on a medically supervised diet for his condition. He keeps Ensavor in his office for lunch, in his briefcase for meals out with clients, and takes it with him when he travels. It's a great product.

When mini-wheats first came out in the grocery store, I tried them. However, I found they were bland. It was like trying to eat sticks in milk.

Then came "frosted" mini-wheats. Okay, I decided to give it a go. Now I had sticks and sugar in milk. However, I did find out that if you forego the milk and just eat them straight from the box, like potato chips, they are excellent!

Now Kellogg's has added fruity flavors to the mini-wheat. THESE I CAN EAT IN MILK! Yippee! Finally!

I picked up the "Strawberry Delight" in bite size. Even though I can eat them in milk, I find that I still prefer just to eat them straight from the box, like potato chips, a type of chex-mix, or square wheat thin snack.

Each serving has 140 calories. Compare that to other cereals and you'll see it is about 60 - 100 calories less. No saturated fat. No trans fat. No cholesterol. No sodium. Total fat is only 0.5g according to the box. I don't see how, since zero and zero is, well, zero. But I can live with 0.5g.

Here is the bad news, the carbohydrates. There are 35g of carbs here. But that is about the same as all the other brands. Diabetics may want to pass on this due to the 10g of sugar per serving. And remember, a single serving is about the size of HALF a base ball. Not much. So if you are just pouring cereal into a "cereal bowl" without measuring, you are probably getting 2 or 3 servings in that one bowl.

All-in-all, unless you are diabetic, this mini-wheat is terrific!

It tastes great, has great farro or barley like texture and it smells heavenly and gets the appetite going

I use this mix on a regular basis. Both my daughter and I are gluten intolerant so we are always on the lookout for great tasting GF products. This mix makes a great sugar cookie,in fact, when I brought some for a party at my daughter's school, kids preferred my cookies to the other sugar cookies brought. This also makes an excellent chocolate chip cookie

This makes a great cake or cupcakes. I used a modification to make it a chocolate cake it was a hit, and also baked them in little bear molds -- the kids loved them. I have 3 little grandgirls and a daughter who are celiac, and these mixes are the best thing to have in the house. No one non-celiac can tell the difference

This broth tastes just like roast beef; rich, delicious and full of flavor. Some may think it's a little salty so taste your food before seasoning with extra salt. I'm definitely going to buy more because it is so easy to turn into broth and takes up much less cupboard space than the boxes of stocks. Excellent product

Last weekend as a volunteer at Vegfest, I had the absolute pleasure of getting to sample all three sauces. For four hours I worked alongside the creator of these heavenly cooking sauces. The wonderful thing about them is that they are not only delicious but are also so simply to use. Recipes are on the sides of the jars, and they allow you the freedom to choose your favorite foods. I can't recommend them highly enough.

Great substitute for high fat potato chips. Good amount of soy protein (6g per serving), excellent flavor, good crunch, and texture. These are actually pretty healthy and a great substitute for someone looking for a low fat diet. No trans or saturated fats. My wife and young daughter, who do not need a low-fat diet as I do, love these. Woohoo

I love black pepper and have only recently discovered sea salt as a very tasty addition to foods, and I like soy products - And I am, sorry to say, a potato chip junkie. So when I saw the description of these potato soy crisps, I had to order them to try them. Boy, am I glad I did! They are very good right out of the bag; but they are almost in the shape of little bowls, so dips and spreads, even cream soups can be scooped up in them. They go with everything! Nice, fresh taste, too. This one will be a staple in my pantry

I brought a few bags to a work day in May, and people are still asking me about them, because you can't buy them in stores around here. They're a cross between the soy version of rice cakes and potato chips, but people eat them by the handful like potato chips. But instead of making you sluggish like a bag of chips, the soy protein gives you energy

About a month ago, I noticed a new product at my local QFC. It was on sale and I actually did a double take and returned to check out the display. It was filled with bags of fancy nut mixes by Sahale Snacks. I had been trying to wean myself off sweets by substituting nuts and other trail mixes for candy whenever I got the munchies. Sahale snack mixes looked like the fancy, upscale "town mouse" to my regular, boring "country mouse" trail mixes.

The one that caught my eye was Sing Buri with cashew, pineapple, peanut, lemongrass and Chinese chili. The ingredients definitely made my mouth water, but the picture on the front is what sold me: a heaping bowl of delicious sweet and savory looking cashews and dried pineapple. The bag was pretty expensive at $5.99 on sale for 5 ounces, but I was definitely hooked at that point and decided to give it a try. I didn't even wait to get home, but opened up the bag in the car and started snacking right away. It was amazing!

The more I looked into Sahale Snacks, the more I liked. On the website, the story is told of the two founders hiking up Mt. Rainier in Washington State, dreaming of something beyond the regular peanut/raisin/m m combo that was their trail mix. What resulted was a snack mix that was indulgent and healthy.

These snack blends are a little pricy, but in my opinion, totally worth it. This would be a wonderful nut mix to offer to friends and guests when entertaining. This is a high brow snack that you or your guests will love.

The Southwestern Spanish flavor is pleasant but not overpowering, and the rice is fluffy, not "clumpy" like other brands. I always keep a pouch in my car and at the office for when I don't have time to get out for lunch, and in my suitcase for when I need a late night snack while travelling. We always take Viva La Rice when camping, backpacking or boating. This is an excellent product at a very fair price

My kids really like to eat this as an after-school or late-night snack. However, they like it best when it has been heated for 90 seconds instead of the 60 seconds recommended on the package. My oldest takes it to high school as part of his lunch because it is so quick and he has only 30 min for lunch

I was hesitant to buy this tea, since all of the Lipton brand teas I have tried have a musty taste and odor to me. But the idea of a mango and peach flavored tea (my two favorite fruits) was irrisitable to me. I am so glad I gave it a try. The scent was incredible and the taste just as good. With a little honey it was one of the best cups of tea I have ever had

Additionally, they seem to provide a little nutritional support beyond the comfort provided by functioning as a polite treat. I like this mandarin-mint flavor the most but all are pretty good. The small Red Bull style cans look chic in the refrigerator and are a lovely, rather special no-trouble hospitality offering for guests and visitors

I was a little surprised. I'm not a huge fan of packaged rice or noodle dishes, but sometimes I need to throw together something quickly. I was intrigued by the list of ingredients, and decided to give Fox River Rice Creole a try. I'm glad I did! This is seriously good stuff -- lots of flavor, easy to prepare, etc. Best of all, it's not overly salty, one of my pet peeves with packaged food. It's great as a side dish, but I think it would also be wonderful with a little dded sausage (maybe some andouille). I'll definitely be purchasing this again

Anyone who thinks cereal is boring for breakfast hasn't tried this one. It's so tasty, yet also healthy. It's my favorite, but lately has been impossible to find. Kellogg's is missing the boat by not giving this cereal a top-notch advertising campaign because once people try this cereal, they're hooked! Now if we could only get it back on the grocery shelves or the online grocery again (are you listening, Amazon??). In the words of another old commercial, "try it, you'll like it!

I was never big on cereals until I tried this one. Now I'm hooked. This
is a very flavorable cereal with a nice mix of strawberries and blueberries. It's great for anytime you have the "munchies" but don't want to eat empty calories. It's also the best of all the cereals that

This cereal is not quite as hearty as some muesli I am used to, but is excellent. Many characteristics on the plus side: is truly multigrain (contains wheat, oat, corn, rice, barley and millet), is sweetened only just enough to appeal to the palate - which is to say it is not horribly sweet like the common American breakfast cereal, is light and crispy with some of the ingredients powdery so they tend to combine with milk and make it thicker, and does in fact have a nice light blueberry flavor. The only aspect I'm not thrilled about is that the raisins and almonds are scarce compared to the excellent, less expensive muesli-type cereal I buy at the local Aldi. This Nature's Path cereal has a corn-flake-like chip predominant, as shown on the box

These brownies have a wonderful chocolate flavor, and I can eat them without worrying about hydrogenated oils, preservatives, unnatural colors or flavors because there aren't any! So far I have made two batches. Neither batch came out perfectly chewy. The first batch came out a little hard, but the 2nd batch was better than the 1st, and I think I'm getting the hang of it. This is better than anything else I've tried. I had given up on the other commercial mixes due to additives, so this is a great treat.

The number of palatable gluten free cereal flakes is quite limited and they are usually quite expensive. This cereal costs $7.00/bag at my local health food store. One needs a place to store a case of 26 oz bags, but it's worth it to buy from Amazon.com by the case

When it comes to prepared cereals, this has to be one of the best manufactured in North America in terms of value for money. That it is also delicious and that it doesn't go soggy as soon as you pour on the milk are two more good reasons to try and buy Mesa Sunrise. And if you are concerned about all that other stuff mentioned described with words like "organic", "kosher", "gluten-free" and so on, then by all means enjoy the extra feelings of vindication

I hate oatmeal. I am not an oatmeal person. I've tried lots of different brands and flavors because I like the health benefits of eating oatmeal. I bought this because of the flax seeds, and wanting to incorporate more omega-3 fatty acids in my diet but what I got was a pleasant surprize. This is a good tasting oatmeal. I heat it up and add soymilk at the end to the consistancy that I like

This bruschetta topping is made from perfectly ripe tomatoes and capers and has a full, baslamic base note. The chuncky texture is perfect for those who would prefer home-made, but the quality is as good or superior to the sauces I've made at home. I like the other flavors of pasta sauce, too, but the bruschetta topping is my favorite for its chunky texture, ripe fruit, and deft balance of seasonings

Unbelievably rich and chocolaty without sugar! No artificial sweetener aftertaste. I like that it's low fat AND high in calcium. Plus the canister (instead of individual packets) lets you vary the portion to match the size of your mug or your strength preference. Yummy on a cool day

This is in my opinion by far the best Earl Grey Tea in the Market. Loose tea is significantly better in taste than the tea bags from the same manufacturer. The 6 pack is a great deal

Earl Grey is my favorite blend of tea by far - no competition there. The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe's original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea's natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can't go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend.

(From the Twinings website: "When the mandarin's tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him. Twinings unique blend was the Grey family's long-standing favourite. When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey's tea by name.")

Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend's particular flavor. (But that's just me, of course.) Whichever way you have it, though, if scented teas are your kind of thing, Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley

These are great, the whole family loves them and they have 5 mg fiber per package. Really tasty, nice and crunchy. I have several boxes of them in the car for when the little ones need a little something when we are on the go. Other snack ideas include those little raisin boxes (but then raisins get everywhere) and packages of dried fruit (which seem to work pretty well since they are not as sticky as raisins). These All-Bran snack bites really go over well and they are much healthier than candy.

I sure wish Amazon would sell these online

Quickly became my favorite when it first came out. Tastes great and the milk doesn't turn orange like some of the new granola type cereals. I also use it on ice cream to add crunch. I would give it 5 stars but even though it think it's great it is overpriced. Price here is about the same as out local Safeway

This is a very high quality snack which combines a hearty, solid granola with irresistable double chocolate. I really love this product -- a chocolate lover's dream. Yet, it's surprisingly healthy and not too sweet. The fat/sugar content is comparable to most other granolas.

I've tried numerous granola's over the years, and this one is special. Probably not the most nutritious granola overall, but it's definitely a treat for the tastebuds and a welcome relief from ordinary granolas.

I would not have this as my exclusive source of granola, but I will buy this many more times in the future to satisfy my chocoholic cravings. In fact, I will probably always keep this product handy because it's highly satisfying.

Great for a breakfast, snack or dessert. Yummy

I purchased this product in the last week from a local store and was so suprised at 1.) How good it tastes and 2.) How much the texture is like real oat granola. I had seen the GF granola before but did not get it because I thought the flakes would make it more like flake cereal. I was definitely mistaken. Not only does it satisfy my texture cravings, it has some great ingredients like flax seeds and dried fruit. It actually had a good ratio of fruit to nuts and other contents, rather than having one or 2 pieces of fruit in the whole bag like some other manufacturers like to do. In all, I totally loved this product and now that I see buying in bulk from Amazon will save me $2/bag, I will be sure to buy it here next time

What I like most about these muffin packs is that the whole mix only makes 6 muffins total. Many other mixes make 12 or more, and, if you have a small household, you're stuck with way too many muffins.

These were better than expected - they are soft, flavorful, and baked perfectly. Also, use a small amount of cooking spray on your muffin pans and these will pop right out of the pan after cooking.

It isn't the healthiest food out there, but overall, I'd recommend this mix

The Granola bar has a high sugar content but not excessively sweet. However, the bar tastes good and the trace of honey is appealing. It has a crunchy texture. The manufacturers have added peanuts too the mixture providing a rich taste. The prohibitive price makes these bars less attractive. 12 bars go quick.

I recommending waiting until a coupon opportunity surfaces and then buying the bars in bulk. The bars have good self life and make a nice addition to your food storage. The bars are great for snacks for trips and a energy pickup mid-morning and later in the day

These bars have an amazing, mildy sweet and nutty flavor! The bars are very crunchy and hearty in texture and are therefore super satisfying as a snack at any time of the day! They've been around forever and I haven't found anything new that beats them yet! The Oats N Honey is our family's favorite flavor! We've tried others and always gone back to the true classic! I usually purchase ours at the local grocery store, but I am in the middle of trying to figure out if amazon offers a better deal. Try it, you'll like it

This is a very tasty, creamy hot cereal. If you're gluten-sensitive, give this a try -- after I switched to a gluten-free diet, I was missing oatmeal something awful. I thought I would give this a try as an alternative, and was glad I did! With some brown sugar and raisins and a little imagination, you can be satisfied with this cereal

These were absolutely delicious. I bought them as a treat for my co-workers, they disappeared very quickly. We couldn't stop eating them and will be ordering them again. They are not shiny covered almonds like we were expecting, rather they are hand dipped in a LOT of very good chocolate and have drizzles over the top and a flat bottom edge. Very fresh taste

I love swiss miss cocoa, especially the little marshmallows they put in the pack. The milk chocolate is great, the Rich chocolate has a little deeper chocolate/semi-sweet to darker flavor, and the Marshmallows are just cool. Great for the wintertime. Stock up and enjoy. Also great to use part of a pack in a cup of coffee, get the sweetness of Cocoa, and the kick of coffee, got me through a few late nights

I bought a case of these at the same time as I purchased the cheddar fries. These are smaller packages, so you get more in a case. These are white cheddar steak fries where the cheddar fries are thinner and longer. These white cheddar steak fries are white and very cheesey and salty snack, They have unique flavor, and don't taste anything like the cheddar fries at all. I gave it a 4 star cause I prefer the cheddar ones better

As anyone who has tried Bahlsen Hit cookies knows, they are absolutely yummy, despite the odd packaging and name. A nice crunchy cookie, not sickeningly sweet, good with cream and sugar tea. funny thing about the minis though, both sides of the cookie are facing the same direction, so that one of the sides is the "wrong" way, with the printed side towards the cream....just a sidebar--no detraction from how tasty these cookies are.

We love popcorn as an occasional treat at night, but don't like the salt and fat that usually comes with most microwave popcorn. We had been using a microwave popper to make our own plain popcorn, but with no oil whatsoever it lacked a little something. This is just right - low in fat, no salt so we can add seasonings if we choose, and organic to boot. I also feel good about buying Newman's products because of the causes they support and all the money doesn't go to corporate profits

I like these a lot. They are only slightly salty, with a bit of molasses sweetness, all balanced against a mild licorice flavor. They are medium-hard and very chewy, although they must be kept in an airtight container or they get too hard. Personally I would prefer a stronger licorice flavor, but these are still among my favorites.

Salty licorice is indeed a strange thing for those who haven't tried it before. If you've never had it before, don't start with a case (like what's sold here). And definitely stay away from Double Salt licorice until you've learned whether you like the saltiness.

If you want black licorice but don't want the salty flavor, try "Haribo licorice wheels". Those have more licorice flavor than these coins, and less other flavor. They're a bit sweet and a bit softer.

Note that these coins also come in bags. Buying them that way is slightly more cost-effective, but the tubs might be a little more airtight

First things first, you will not be treated to that classic 'cooking' smell. In fact, your appetite is better off not catching a whiff of that magnesium-salt concoction that heats your meal. Think happy thoughts, and be oblivious.

Why? Because the meal itself is actually pretty good (and has an airtight separation with the 'oven'). The package also includes plastic spork, knife, and napkin. Basically, the ingredients are on-par with what you would typically find in canned stew (and similarly need not be refrigerated).

However, the meal loses one star because the serving size is fairly small. 210 calories isn't a whole lot to go on, particularly if you must engage in strenuous physical activity under low-temperature conditions.

Pros: lightweight, keeps well, cooks itself, easy disposal, tastes good.

Cons: cost and storage space per calorie is somewhat high.

If you were creative, you might be able to figure a way to cook something else using the box oven

I received one of these meals after Hurricane Rita. They were being handed out by first responders to people in the area before our utilities were restored. Excellent product. I wanted more so I could stock up in case of another disaster or emergency. I found their website and discovered that they were not for sale over the internet. I was very disappointed...until today. I went back to their website and saw that the meals are now available from amazon! This is great news! I suggest that everyone stock up on these meals in case of emergencies. They really come in handy.

The mix was a little lumpy...had some hard chunks that would NOT dissolve, they were as hard as rocks and some had to be fished out of the batter. The mix was not expired, it was as if it had been exposed to moisture or improper temperatures during storage. Still came out o.k. and tasted great.

Twinings blend of Ceylon and Indian tea produces that more traditional hearty aroma and pungent flavor. In non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness, brightness, strength and flavor. Normally I wouldn't attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses, trucks, and stores for long periods of time. Yet Twinings seems to hold up well. I love tea, would drink 24/7 if possible, and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and Twinings is definetly one of them

I recently gave up coffee made the switch to teas. Lipton other grocery blends were bitter or weak. I purchased the loose tea leaves from Amazon at a good price quick shipping. English friends suggested PJ Tips (?) tea which we found ordered from another online site. Twinning's blows it away. Both the Earl Grey Irish Blend are great both on the pallet to the nose

Twinings was founded in London, England in 1706, and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. Irish Breakfast tea is a mixture of Ceylon and Assam (black) teas, well-known for its strong, malty taste.

OK, let's get down to brass tacks - Irish Breakfast tea is not for everyone. There's an old Irish saying that says that a proper cup of tea should be "strong enough for a mouse to trot on," and this tea is certainly within striking distance of that target! But, if you add milk and sugar to this fine tea, you will be rewarded with a smooth and full-flavored drink.

Irish Breakfast tea is in a class by itself among the teas I have drunk, in that it comes closest to being like coffee - that is having a strong taste that gets you up and going in the morning. Not all teas will stand up to a proper breakfast, but this one will. Overall, I have found this to be a wonderfully interesting tea, strong and robust.

And that's my review. If you want a tea that will round out your hearty breakfast, then Irish Breakfast tea is for you. If you want tea from a great tea producer, them Twinings is for you. I highly recommend this hearty tea

We really enjoy the crackers, just did not realize that we would not be able to consume 12 boxes between the end of August, 2006 and the expiration date on the product of November 10, 2006. Feel that the 12 boxes would last at least 6 months before expiration when you purchase a case.

Amazon, needs to let the consumer know what the expiration date is so you can make decision as to whether to purchase a case or not.

Otherwise they are great crackers

I first purchased these crackers because they have no soy in them. My daughter is allergic to soy, and soy-free crackers are very hard to find. I bought them, and to my amazement, my picky husband also loves them! He prefers them to all other similar crackers. I purchased a large number of boxes (which I keep hidden) as they tend to disappear rather quickly.

I like a cup of coffee with character, and thus far this Black Gold Extra Bold has delivered. The "Extra Bold" defines that this K-Cup carries an extra 20-30% of coffee per serving than the standard K-Cup, and as a result this delivers the extra kick that I tend to like. We only brew at the 7.25oz, and sometimes the 5.25oz volume on our B-70 brewer as we prefer a stronger cup of joe. This roast is on the dark side, and delivers flavor with intensity, and a nice smoky essence as described. I also find that this provides a hint of crema, much like a shot of espresso when brewed fresh. We like it, and if you like stronger coffee, we think you will too! Try it

These are as close to the real thing as it gets. I added chocolate chips to half of the batter and crasins (dried cranberries) to the other half. I have had celiacs for almost 2 years now and these are the best gluten free product I have eaten! I had to hide them from the rest of my family b/c they liked them as well!

I'm known to be nuts for nuts, and I've tried nuts from around the world, as friends bring them back for me as gifts. Very near the top of the list of the best nut snacks is Mrs. May's Almond Crunch. From the first time I tasted it, to every time I eat it now, I am amazed at the crunchiness, quality of the almonds, lightly-sweetened glaze which is very unbrittle-like, attention to healthiness in the ingredients, etc. As a side note, because of how much I was impressed by this product, I went on a tasting spree by buying about 12 different kinds of Mrs. May's products, from the peanut and cashew crunches to the various sesame crunches, etc. Perhaps I'm biased to the original, but none of the others have that same magic. I would rate the rest as 4 stars. But the almond crunch should get 6 stars

*****
Moroccan Mint is a premium Numi tea. This herbal tea is certified organic and is kosher.

On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "In the Moroccan spring, the snow melts off the Atlas Mountains, watering the plains below. As the days warm, some of the most soothing, refreshing and full-flavored mint flourishes in this ancient land of the Berbers. With a flavor as light and lively as a newly picked leaf, our choice organic mint will become your favorite mint teasan. An all-day or after-dinner delight, no wonder the Moroccans drink ten cups a day."

The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love mint teas, this is one that will not disappoint.

The kids love 'em and what could be better than that? I bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here. We tried the strawberry, frosted, and like other reviewers I agree: not too sweet, right amount of frosting. Can't wait to try the next flavor

These are our new favorite breakfast food. FANTASTIC!!!! We love them, and that's even after we're on our second set of 12 boxes. The strawberry flavoring tastes real, not fake like regular pop tarts. Overall, the taste is sweet but not overly so. This flavor is better than the apple cinnamon, which we have also tried. Definitely one of our best Amazon purchases ever

I must admit that although it was pretty good, it made me want to go and find a good Rice Pudding recipe so I can keep the needed ingredients on hand to make homemade. I made it with water but will try it with milk next time as suggested by a reviewer below. Great item to keep on your shelf to make something quick easy...and it makes your kitchen smell good!

Fox river rice pudding is incredibly fragrant, almost overwhelming when you open the package. The finished product is mellow and delicious, not too rich. I'm going to try it in the crock pot one of these days. Glad I tried it

This Fox River Rice Pudding ROCKS! Quick Cooking,and you can adjust the consistency,as I prefer it to be fluffy as opposed to creamy.The cinnamon stick is a nice touch...although I would not recommend this product for those of you on a High fiber diet(like myself)to lose weight,as the overall fiber content is low...it is a nice treat that is low in fat and is extremely delicious

My family really enjoyed this rice pudding. I loved the real cinammon stick, it gave the rice a rich flavor. The aroma in the kitchen had everyone looking forward to a real treat. Best of all is how simple it was. Boil the water, empty package, wait 20 minutes. Enjoy!

I am so glad I found these. My son (22 months old) is crazy about these apples and I can't find them at the store any more. They have a really great flavor and texture. They are very different than traditional dried fruit. The apples are plump and actually look like they came from an apple

The "Love at First Sip" pods brew a very good (but small) cup of coffee in the Melita one-cup coffee maker. The directions say that you can use the pod for two cycles (which would fill a large mug) but that is only if you enjoy your coffee very weak. This pod and system is perfect for people who only drink 1-2 cups a day and hate the waste and inconsistancy of a self-measuring system

We really enjoy the crackers, just did not realize that we would not be able to consume 12 boxes between the end of August, 2006 and the expiration date on the product of November 10, 2006. Feel that the 12 boxes would last at least 6 months before expiration when you purchase a case.

Amazon, needs to let the consumer know what the expiration date is so you can make decision as to whether to purchase a case or not.

Otherwise they are great crackers

I first purchased these crackers because they have no soy in them. My daughter is allergic to soy, and soy-free crackers are very hard to find. I bought them, and to my amazement, my picky husband also loves them! He prefers them to all other similar crackers. I purchased a large number of boxes (which I keep hidden) as they tend to disappear rather quickly.

I love these crackers for several reasons. They are absoutely delicious, to begin with. And they do not use ingredients like "partially hydrogenated soybean oil." They are hard to find in stores. It's a hit or miss thing, here in the Northeast. So I ordered from Amazon. Propmpt delivery, and ease of purchasing will keep me coming back

I bought the variety pack and tried this flavor fourth. I buy natural snacks for my kids (freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar), but I find them bland. So I ordered these and I love this flavor. In fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it - it wasn't too spicy for her. They use black pepper which is flavorful, but I wouldn't call it spicy

I love these nuts, I stock up on them whenever I can find them in the grocery store, now that Amazon is carrying them I can stock up whenever I go on a nut hunt. They are sweet and crunchy and so stasifying that I can not go back to the other brand. Actually I bought the "big" brand of nuts just recently and gave them away after trying a mouthful. These nuts have spoiled me for any other. These are GREAT!!

My whole family loves this tea, even our 5 year old. We drink it in the evening to calm and relax us. When we are fighting colds or sore throats we drink it with a bit of lemon and honey. We also put a couple of tea bags in our bath water for a soothing chamolmile tea soak.
It has a flowery/grassy flavor and is best a wee bit sweetened. It is one of the best tasting chamomile teas we have tried.
Used in moderation it is not dangerous to your health and is a long-standing, respected herb in natural medicine.
People with severe hay fever may not tolerate this tea very well, but it doesn't affect me and I have WRETCHED allergies and all season hay fever

Since I love Kellogg's Fruit Harvest with Strawberries and Blueberries I
thought I would try this one. It is good but not as flavorable as Kellogg's. It also has a nice mix of berries which includes raspberries as well as strawberries and blueberries. You can't beat the prices for
both Kellogg's and Golden Temple in the supermarkets. Amazon is the way
to go for the best prices

These are the best almonds I've ever had. Though it is true that the Amazon ad states they are all natural (an error on their part, not on Emerald), they are very close to it. The pricing here is a bit high. At our "higher end" market, I pay $5.49 for an 11oz canister. The pricing is better to buy at the store than through Amazon overall. But, if it is convenience that sways your buying preference, this comes fairly close (about $7-8 higher). I do highly recommend this brand

I ordered this soup along with a bunch of others on my goldbox special a few weeks ago. The soup comes in individually packaged microwavable cups that are easy to take to work or school with you. Upon microwaving, the soup flavor was very good but the dehydrated items inside (particularly the noodles and the beans) were hard and crunchy. After letting the dehydrated items soak for a few minutes, I tried it and it was perfect.

Very good flavor, but it has a very strong garlic component to the flavor, maybe a little too strong. I would recommend further diluting the soup down which would entail emptying the contents into a larger bowl for heating, defeating the point of the microwavable cups.

I would purchase this soup again if it was offered at the Goldbox price of nine bucks for the 12 pack. But at the price currently offered, I'm not certain I would go for it again. Nevertheless, the flavor is good and if you like strong flavor with the convenience of the individually packaged cups, it might be worth a shot ordering it one time to see if you love it

I love Pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds, these are The BEST.
The taste great, are REALLY crunchy - a key requirement for me - and have just the right amount of salt. The Newman's Rounds are just as good - maybe even better.
And as an added bonus, Paul Newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity - an unbeatable combination in my book

I drink this daily - I mix it with a regular green tea that I brew all night and then make ice tea in the morning. This tea is perfect for ice tea. My sister says that it is the only tea that soothes her sore throat when she is sick. This tea definitely has a unique flavor -you will either love it or hate it. I love it. I also love all the health benefits of Kombucha. This will be a tea that I drink for the rest of my life

I've been buying Nature's Path gluten free foods for a number of years, and have been fully satisfied. I've had access to somewhat lower prices than what traditional grocery stores put on their products, but am delighted that Amazon's price is virtually identical to the prices offered by the discount organic foods market we've purchased these from in the past. I doubt you'll find Nature's Path products any lower anywhere else, particularly when you consider no sales tax and free shipping if the order is large enough. Also, I contacted Nature's Path once with a question about one of their products (the Mesa Sunrise flakes). Customer service is excellent and very friendly (much nicer than we typically get "down here" in the States - they're a Canadian company up in B.C.). If this sounds like a commercial, it's not intended to be - I just have been entirely satisfied with Nature's Path foods for years and have no complaints at all. When a company does a good job, they deserve referrals - everybody wins

Anyone following a gluten-free diet knows how expensive it can be to buy the gluten-free version of anything - and when trying a product for the first time you hope it actually tastes good. This is one gluten-free product I am completely delighted with - both in taste and price. These corn flakes are crunchy and delicious (I like them better than the glutenated alternatives), and work well for other recipes. Candies, cereal crumb pie crusts, fried chicken, etc.

Twinings was founded in London, England in 1706, and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. English Breakfast tea is a mixture of black teas from Sri Lanka, which are blended to produce a smooth yet flavorful tea. Though often served during breakfast, this tea tastes excellent all day long.

OK, let's get down to brass tacks - this is another great tea. Harder to over-steep than some of the teas I have known, it consistently produces a smooth and highly drinkable cup. Highly conventional in its taste, English Breakfast tea has a robust flavor that stands up well to lemon and milk, which makes it a favorite among those who like to accessorize their tea. Plus, I must say that this tea is wonderful iced - add some lemon and sugar, and you've got the right tea for a hot afternoon!

And that's my review. If you want an excellent all-round tea, hot or iced, one that goes well with any food, then English Breakfast tea is for you. If you want tea from a great tea producer, them Twinings is for you. I highly recommend Twinings' English Breakfast tea to all, even those not normally into tea drinking. (Or, perhaps especially to those not normally into tea drinking!

Seriously folks, shop around all you like, but you cannot beat this Lavazza espresso for a full bodied not-at-all-bitter taste, whether you are making espresso or cappuccino. I've used it for at least 15 years in three different machines - Francis Francis! and my office machine, Rancilio Silvia and have never found a substitute. My office is right next to Dean and Deluca in NYC and I've tried super expensive espresso blends at over $20.00/pound, nothing comes close.

Amazon was recently out of stock (as they are often) and I accidentally brought the Lavazza Oro whole beans, thinking they were already ground. Yuk!, I had them ground in my local coffee dealer but they have No Taste compared to this. I gave them away and got hold of my favorite black can. Amazon's price can't be beat, believe me I've tried, I get 8 cans at a time and enjoy perfect coffee all day long just like in Rome!

Ciao

What can I say about Lavazza that hasn't already been said. I was in Rome two summer's ago and noticed it is in all the supermarkets. Decaf is usually not so great but this is. They must be doing something right

Excellent! I am thrilled about finally finding coffee that smells and tastes just like what you can get at good hotels and brasseries in Europe. I was previously buying Lavazza's SuperCrema, in whole bean format, because I had tried it at one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Beverly Hills and thought it was great. However, it would not turn out the same using my semi-automatic home espresso machine and my low-end grinder. Therefore, for those who do not own $12,000 fully automatic commercial espresso machines like that restuarant did, this coffee is a much better choice. The Caffee Espresso comes in perfectly ground cans ready for the home Espresso machine. The Italians at Lavazza definitely know what they're doing!
Definitely buy this coffee and enjoy

I LOVE my Tassimo! For years I have been searching for an economical and convenient way to replicate Starbucks lattes and mochas at home, and this is the system that finally achived it. I don't use the latte/ capuccino milk pods unless I'm in dire straights - it's better to steam real milk (search for "milk steamer" on Amazon - that's a great product too!) - but the espresso is great and I haven't been to Starbucks in weeks. Hands down recommended, no holds barred

I love my coffee machine but I normally do not buy t-discs from Gevalia due to price. But found this on Amazon = Wow 2 for 1!
Price is great, even when you add in any cost for shipping etc. Still beats "Bead Bath Beyond" with a coupon! Service and delivery were excellent

I know what excellent coffee is - I typically buy Blue Mountain coffee from Jablum at $40/lb and make espresso with that (4 shots at a time) because it's so smooth.

I bought 5# of this coffee (mainly because of the claimed hypercaffinated nature), and made my usual espresso pot with it. By the time I was through 1/4 of the cup (basically 1 shot) I was completely in orbit from the caffeine, and I was quite impressed with the fact that the coffee was smooooooooth - on a par with the Blue Mountain that I usually buy (but at a fraction of the cost...).

I didn't get the shakes like with other coffee - just a state of "extreme alertness" for the next 9 or 10 hours.. And while I was workin' on that first cup, I sent in a testimonial to the Shock Coffee website (yep, it's on there).

The beans are a blend of light, medium, and dark roast - they're selected for caffeine content, and it's everything they claim.

I took about 1# of the stuff, ground it up, and brought it in the office. We actually got quite a bit of work done that day :-) Unfortunately for me, I now have a bunch of Shock addicts running around asking me for some of my personal stash - so I have to buy some just for the office staff...

If you like coffee - get this stuff. It's smooth. Not "rip your lungs out" harsh like that Starbucks stuff that you have to add 500# of sugar and caramel to just so you can drink it.

Buy it... it works... *bing* *bing* *bing* Richochet Rabbit! :-

A trained eye would see that Shock Coffee is a blend of Arabica Robusta coffee beans!

Just like many other ingredients, there is good and bad Robusta Arabica beans. Wines are made from different grapes and it's the individuals' pallet that distinguishes between good and bad. In Europe the coffee bean of choice is Robusta as they appreciate a stronger and bolder coffee.

With that said, I'd recommend Shock for anybody who wants that extra kick with a better than average taste. I'd also like to reiterate that Robusta beans are given a bad rap but the truth stands that some Robusta beans have a great robust taste - no pun attended!

I LOVE this coffee. It has a strong flavor and aroma and gets you moving in the morning. I do not believe it is meant to be a fancy gourmet coffee, but rather what I would call Trucker or Cowboy coffee.

If you like strong coffee, buy it. If you like delicate coffee, buy something else

This snack blend is the best! I tried it on the recommendation of a friend, and have come to love it. It's perfect alone, but I enjoy putting the mix on salads. It definitely spices them up a bit, and the flavor is amazing. I have become a big fan of this product, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to add a little excitement to their everyday snacks

Bigger and more luscious than any other available dried blueberries. They make a huge difference and are worth the extra price. I substitute them for the raisins in our favorite Quaker Oatmeal cookie recipe and everyone loves the results. Hope the oatmeal and blueberry health benefits cancel the butter/sugar calories!

Why are people demonizing high fructose corn syrup ? the only reason it's cheaper in the US, is....America has ..lots....of...corn.

Eat more corn. Use more corn syrup.

unripe berries have less fructose, mass harvesting them probably places unripe berries into the mix and its compensated for

Lapsang Souchong tea comes from the mist-enshrouded Wuyi Mountains in the northwestern corner of China's Fujian Province (north of Guangdong [Canton] Province), whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the Taiwan Straits.

This tea has an unmistakeably smokey note, which for years made it a particular favorite with the "single malt and cigars" crowd of English clubs and drawing rooms. That aroma is created during the tea's smoking process, which involves the withering of the tea leaves in bamboo baskets hung on racks over cypress or pine wood fires, after they have been rolled and placed into wooden barrels until they emit their own aroma. The finished tea leaves are characteristically thick and black. Legend has it that this smoking process was discovered by accident during the Quing Dynasty (1644 - 1911), when an army unit camping out in a tea factory interrupted the processing of the recently-arrived leaves and the workers then resulted to drying the leaves over pine fires to make up for the disruption and get to the market in time, creating an instant sensation there.

Because of its potent aroma, Lapsang Souchong should not steep very long. The rule of thumb is that the paler its color, the more likely you'll truly enjoy it

I have never ordered anything such as this online. I was surprised that the nuts arrived in about half as much time as the site said it would take. I will consider ordering again once I have used these up. The walnuts were so fresh and nice, not all broken up, as some have been when I have purchased them at the grocery store.

I absolutely love the taste of this tea and so does everyone else I've encouraged to try some (even my coffee drinking daughter). I drink a lot of herbal teas and this is definitely my favorite. I can't tell if it's really detoxifying my liver and kidneys, but I do know that drinking a cup boosts my energy level and make me feel better.

Also, don't let the name of the tea make you think you can only drink it occasionally, the box states that it's mild enough to be used every day for up to 30 days. My only disappointment at the moment is that the six-pack on Amazon isn't currently available

I have tried all of Cherrybrook Kitchen Products and they are fabulous! Even without Eggs, Dairy and Peanuts these products taste even better than if I made it from Scratch. Their Brownie is deliciously Chocolately and if cooked for about 16 minutes, comes out fudgy also! I also like the Chocolate Chips right in the mix! I would highly recommend it

The first thing you notice about this cereal is the aroma. It's reminiscent of fish oil supplements. Having never eaten flax of any kind before, I don't know if the aroma is typical of flax. At first serving, I was sure I'd consume the rest of the box (eventually), but would not buy more. Yet, with each serving, the aroma is less and less noticeable. I enjoy this cereal and will buy it again. It has more fiber than any other cereal (organic or not) I've seen

I've tried a few types of vegan chocolate chip cookies and was always disappointed with how bland they were--and loaded with fat and calories. These are not only the least amount of calories that I've seen for a vegan cookie of this size, but I found that these double chocolate chip cookies were better than the non-vegan ones I've had in the past! They are so, so, so good. Whoever said that you need dairy and eggs in chocolate? I have my omnivore friends and family try these cookies to show them that I am FAR from deprived! Two thumbs up and highly recommended from this vegan chocoholic

Gluten free diets can be so much more varied with this product. It can be coating to chicken or meat, or can be added to juices/broths to thicken. It can even be used to make a perfect stuffing for chicken or turkey.

It has make my boring diet almost feel normal. No feeling of deprivation any more

Originally looked to buy the WASA Light Rye, but it was out-of-stock. So, bought the Sourdough Rye and Multi Grain instead, and glad I did because they have broadened my selection of favorite WASA brand crispbreads. And while I normally avoid products with yeast, I feel that the toasty crispness of the Multi Grain has neutralized any negative aspects (that yeast is a negative is my story, and I'm stickin' to it!) that may be derived from containing yeast. As for varied uses, it's equally great for strengthening the teeth (and should be a great weight loss adjunct because it is not easy to eat fast, and requires some mastication which should satisfy the need to have eaten) when eaten as a cracker, or mechanically grinding to a pouder for use to coat salmon coquettes. Oh, some more good news is that moths will try to eat through a package of rye crispbreads, which means what's inside is edible for humans too. I keep mine stored in the freezer because it is so valuable. Should be a good nutrient source in case of prolonged emergencies as well. Still my preference among all the WASA crispbreads is the light rye. Only 2 ingredients, rye flour and sea salt. Just give me the simple life... without the two accompanying airheads, that is.

I've never reviewed a food item before, but this delectable little bar was so heavenly I had to change my mind. At the time, it was a mere snack in between classes; afterwards, it earned a place in my heart, as well as my eternal devotion.

Toffee AND almonds + chocolate...

*sigh*

High in protein, low in calories, and great flavor. I split them in half and eat the first portion as a mid-morning snack and the second portion as an afternoon snack. They keep me feeling full and prevent me from eating junk food, which has been great for my waistline. I can't say enough good things about Kashi

I am one hardly to ever leave product reviews, and as much as I buy online, I should work on that. But, after trying the various Kashi products, these bars are by far the best and I feel the need to leave a review! I started off eating the Kashi Honey Almond Flax granola bars, which are very good, but definitley not as sweet as these (not a good OR bad thing, just a comparison). However, you will still get the protein, fiber and omega-3s if that's what you're looking for. If you love chocolate and almonds and are looking for a protein/fiber bar that tastes good and is more on the sweet side, this is definitely one to try!!! Whether you use them as a meal replacement or as a snack, they are absolutley amazing and I will definitely be a repeat customer

I like the basic Special K flakes made from rice wheat (though I really shouldn't eat gluten). Mostly I use cereal to snack on vs. with milk (boo lactose!). Special K tends to have more nutritional value than most cereals which I like too. But, I wasn't enamored with either the fruit or the yogurt parts of this particular cereal. Frankly, I think it would taste better without them or with something else. The yogurt pieces didn't seem to merge well with the cereal IMHO. But then, that's why there's chocolate vanilla

:: Davinci Multicolor Tortellini ::

Delicious tortellini from Italy. Great experience, like being delivered from a good italian restaurant! This product has great taste, texture, and appearance.

My only disappointment was just upon arrival, first opening the case. The boxes seemed so little. I mean, compared to the 12 oz packages of pasta I'm adjusted to buying. It says 7oz right on the web page description, very clear, but somehow that hadn't really registered in my noggin. However, things got better. I soon found out that 7 oz of tortellini cooks up pretty big, more servings than I'd have anticipated from the little boxes.

Very happy with the Davinci pastas I've tried so far. I'd be complete if only they also made some pasta sauces for AMZN to send to my doorstep along with the pasta.

Anyway, I recommend this tortellini. It's great hot...and come spring, will also give it a whirl for cold pasta salad.

It's hard to find gluten-free energy bars that aren't too sweet, and this totally fits the bill. You wouldn't want to eat these as candy -- there's some subtle truth-in-advertising in the "Choc-Bar" name (say it out loud) -- but I think I ate at least six of these on my last backpacking trip, and I am pleased to report that these are VERY tasty with plenty of water when I've been getting a serious workout and need the energy. Comparing labels, the nutrition and caloric content of an entire Choc-Bar is pretty similar to that of a Clif Bar. (The label says the "serving size" is half a bar, but that would be like eating half a Clif Bar -- there's no way I'm stopping after just a few bites when I'm in the middle of a nine-mile hike!

You've just located the most healthy, tasty and useful vegetarian broth manufactured today! As a long time user, I can tell you that Amazon offers the best possible price for this item. I use it for everything:
a flavoring for plain rice, as a broth for stir frying (instead of oil), as a base for complicated stews and soups. If you find it a bit too salty, just add more water. It has no mysterious chemical additives. It is perfect for heart patients, diabetics, vegans, and folks who just like a fast soup treat

Seitenbacher is a fabulous soup mix! One canister makes 40 cups of broth, which makes it incredibly inexpensive. It's also delicious. It makes a truly versatile soup base. People love my nabeyakiudon (Japanese noodle soup), matzoah ball soup (Jewish dumpling soup), golden lentil stew (Indian bean stew), all of which have Seitenbacher as the base. It works for people with allergies and food sensitivities (no gluten, no lactose, no MSG, no soy). It's all natural and vegetarian (no gelatin). And I can't emphasize enough the rich, deep flavor.

Thanks to our purchase of a Keurig, I am a converted coffee drinker. Timothy's German Chocolate Cake is my absolute favorite. A delectable blend of warm caramel and coconut gives this coffee a deliciously sweet note while retaining a medium-bodied blend. It isn't too sugary - it's just right! In fact, my hubby and his coworkers all claim this as their number one flavored coffee too. It is scrumptious

I was eager to try the Sugar Blend for Baking. I noticed a difference in the consistency of the cake batter and it did not rise as high and seemed to be more compact. The usage guide was helpful and included a recipe on the package. The flavor was comparable to regular sugar and those with diabetes are now able to enjoy some of the sweeter things in life.

This stuff is delicious! I've been buying it for years as a good quality, fairly nutritious snack food for myself (I feed the kids veggie booty, and hog the sweet stuff), and it seems to be a pretty good choice. It doesn't take a lot to satisfy, and it's not really that bad for you (sugar, sure, but not as much as some other treats).

I love these cookies too! They're crunchy animal cookies with a lemony coating that doesn't feel waxy in your mouth. The lemon taste is great and they're not too sweet. They're a perfect afternoon snack when you want a sweet treat but don't want to overdo it with calories or sugar. The box is a little skimpy on the number of cookies you get, but the taste is worth it

I love these cookies! The only complaint I had is that I ordered a case (12 boxes) and the expiration date was 4 weeks from the day I received the shipment. Yikes, I still have over half the case left and I've been eating them daily (and giving them away)! I probably will not purchase again from this vendor for this reason alone. However, if you're looking for a great, organic cookie without trans fats, this is a nice healthy option

I doubt if most kids would like this bar, but health food fanatics will love it. Subtle flavor mixed with chocolate. Bar is very filling. Dry, use with water

Okay, so I realize this isn't a real veggie... merely a veggie that's been pureed and turned into a pea pod shaped chip. But man they are GOOD. What's more, there aren't any bad ingredients in this product AND they're baked, not fried! Better still, my kid prefers them to chips. So while I don't totally win the "Make Your Kid Love Veggies" award with this snack, I feel I'm one step closer. Oh, and I love them too

These are a fun little snack. They taste good and are crunchy, so you can pass on the potato chips. They have two grams of fiber and a small amount of vitamins. They are not low in calories, so be careful of the amount you eat. My daughter likes them, which is a plus. The price was good at Amazon, but the shipping was steep.

Our whole family loves this snack. These make a great toddler snack (they're kind of puffy, so if you don't actually chew them, they'll just melt). My 2-year old has been eating these for a year now, and is constantly asking for his "Peapods?" A portable snack, far superior nutritionally to the typical cookie, cracker, goldfish, pretzel and other processed junk most kids are eating. These are just dehydrated snap peas, corn oil and salt (and there's still LESS sodium in these than Pepperidge Farm's low-sodium goldfish!). A great alternative to the usual snack highly processed of white flour, sugar, salt and/or chemical preservatives. They're better for you, and they taste great. We love them

I've been over here in Japan for the past 3 years and haven't made too many visits to the states. I will be returning next week though. However, this stuff is definitely one addictive snack. In Japan it's marketed by the same company as "Saya Endou". Not a strong flavor, just something to munch on. Not too salty and not too sweet. Kampeki (Perfect). A purchase of the snack is a victory against terrorism.

I'm excited to find these for sale on Amazon, and at a very reasonable price! I just tried them for the first time a few days ago, and was wishing there was a nearby store that carried them. Everyone I've given them to has liked them, even those who are not normally healthy eaters. These crisps are reminiscent of puffy corn snacks (like cheetos), but with a different light flavor. The calorie content is similar to other chip-type snacks (150 per serving), but these have the nutrition benefits of peas--protein (5g per serving), calcium (6% DV per serving), and iron (4% DV per serving). I haven't tried the Ceasar flavor yet, but intend to do so in the near future. :

I'm not a huge coffee fan -- most of the time, I find it bitter. Then there's the whole "language" you have to learn if you want to order it at one of the popular coffee joints. But occasionally I do feel like I need that little surge of energy.

This Kona Blend coffee is the perfect choice. It has a lot of flavor, but none of the bitterness I find in a lot of other coffees. This is the one I put in the coffee maker when I plan to spend the day cleaning house or working on my thesis. It makes great iced coffee, too

That's all that matters to me. I can't always find it in stock at the local store, and I want my husband to be able to enjoy it.

I'm not a real coffee drinker, but this Kona blend seems to lack the bitterness that first turned me off coffee years ago in the first place. So I enjoy some of it too occasionally. And, whatever blend he's drinking, my husband likes Millstone brand. I know it always smells wonderful

I've tried the Andy Capp HOT FRIES, WHITE CHEDDAR, and these Regular CHEDDAR. These have a satisfactory flavor and don't over do it. I find them a good snack with tasty underlying corn flavor and a non-greasy crispness that I like about the Andy Capp products. They are different from Cheese Doodles. Cheese Doodles are more about orange coatings and are uneven in texture. I think it must be the corn-potato combo in the Andy Capp products that makes them feel good to eat

Supposedly this is the safest artificial sweetener and it tastes fine too. Favorite uses: coffee, tea, and hot cereals such as oat bran and unsweetened oatmeal. I ordered two of these gegunda boxes and am grateful for the opportunity to save so much money vs. supermarket prices. Unfortunately, there was a terrible delay: I ordered on Feb 2 and didn't receive until March 20. Otherwise, no complaints and I'm fixed for sweetener for a good year

I think Splenda is great, but I grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is, is to let a sugar addict try it. My husband happens to be one, and he cannot tell the difference between Splenda and sugar in his tea! As with other artificial sweeteners, you get an unpleasant after taste--with the Splenda there is none! You can use this to cook with too! It's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar.

I have sensitive [to sugar] teeth and these are beautiful and healthy. Most "granola bars" you find in stores are full of sugar and have next to no nutritional value- no, thanks.

These are good for you and taste rather good, too. They are a bit bland but I like the texture... with what's in them and how they're held together, they're a bit like rice krispy treats, but taste....healthy.

Yum. I love taking these to work for a quick snack instead of vending machine

As an asthmatic with a sulfa allergy, I thought I was limited to naturally dried fruits, which are tasty, but not aesthetically appealing. I'd been looking for some way of getting my fix for dried fruit without running the risk of (at worst) a trip to the emergency room.

I'd found a number of other freeze-dried fruits, but most of them had sugar added, something I try to avoid. I ordered this product (Orchard blend) with the hope that it would be flavorful. Wow, was it!

Aside from being good as a quick snack for when my blood sugar starts to drop, it's also fantastic when mixed with plain oatmeal to give it a little something more.

I'm extremely pleased with this product and I would recommend it to anyone that has been avoiding dried fruits because of a sulfa sensitivity or allergy

Excellent taste and texture. The apples are the crunchiest, but even the pulpier fruits have a pleasing texture. If you really like your crunch, I'd go for the all-apple product.

My only disappointment is that you're not getting a lot for your money. I love the convenient portion-control packaging, but $1.10 for a 3/4 ounce, 70 calorie serving makes me more worried about my wallet than my weight when considering what to snack on in the afternoon.

So I'll order more, but these have become an "occasional" snack and not an "everyday" one

Green is good, of course. But what's much better than green are these truly awesome cookies. PN Os beat the bootie out of any Oreo variation -- crunchier, more filling(without being smarmy), much better taste. (And this goes for the mint, the vanilla, and the chocolate.)

Fast Eddie Felson -- I love you.

My husband and I like the Newman O's better than Oreo's, and our 3 year old son loves them! As we did as a child, he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling, just like an oreo. Also, the Newman O's do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have

My children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream. These are a bit softer than the O's we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat! =) We purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too - YUMMY

Nice chewy texture, not fossilized like the health food store bulk bin kind, and great taste. Packaged as they are (2 resealable packages of 20oz. each)it's a very economical buy, too. Just store one in the 'fridge or freezer until you finish the first. Our kids like these better than raisins

I've never been a big fan of dried fruit -- good for you or not, they are just too sweet for me. But these montmorency cherries are wonderful. It's the right mix of sweetness with tartness. I LOVE to eat these straight out of the bag.

This is great instant oatmeal, I eat it almost every morning. I used to buy the Quaker or store brand of the same flavor in the grocery store but I will continue to buy this. It is very convenient to order this in quantity even though I'm the only one in my household eating it, since I go through it pretty quickly

This delicious breakfast cereal packs a punch and it doesn't overload you with too many calories or fat, either. It stays crunchy in milk and the honey/nut taste beckons you to have another bowl.

The cereal is comparatively low in sugar, certified kosher and it contains no trans fats--hooray! It offers potassium and the recipe keeps carbohydrates as low as possible: 22 grams per serving (.75 cup).

It does provide folic acid and 25% of your daily recommended allowance of iron; but this is not a substitute for iron pills if your doctor wants you to take iron supplements.

This breakfast cereal contains almonds; if you are allergic to any kind of nut PLEASE ask your physician before eating this cereal.

Overall, this fantastic breakfast cereal is tasty and it stays crunchy in milk--unless you leave it in milk for over 20 minutes or so. It contains important nutrients but this cereal alone cannot be a substitute for any vitamins your doctor may want you to take. It is priced about right; and the sugar and iron will give you just enough of a kick to start your day. Pick some up and enjoy them as much as I do!

I've tried several different cranberries and these are by far the best on the market. I received these today and had another brand available to taste test/compare. The ingredients listed on each package were the same but Bob's has fewer calories and a much sweeter taste. The berries do cost a little more but they are worth every penny.
The following recipe is great:

1/2 cup Bob's Red Mill Extra Thick Rolled Oats (Only brand I use)
1 Cup 100% Juice Apple Cider
1-2 Tablespoons dried cranberries
Brown Sugar to taste

Cook Oatmeal, Apple Cider Cranberries in microwave approximately 5 minutes. Add brown sugar, stir allow to sit 2-3 minutes. Add additional cider after cooking if you like a thinner oatmeal. If only Amazon sold Bob's Rolled Oats.....

I bought this on something of a whim - I like some of Genisoy's other products - and was worried that it would be terrible. But it really isn't bad!

The instructions read: For best results, add 1 scoop of powder to 8 oz. of protein fortified nonfat milk and mix in an electric blender, or in a shaker. Can also be mixed with water or other beverage of choice.

I didn't want the extra added calories of the milk - plus I'm lactose intolerant, so I went ahead and mixed it with water, worried it would be bland. It was pretty tasty. The reason they say to put in a blender or shake is because it's difficult to mix - it gets very thick.

Kosher status isn't clear here on amazon, but it's got a circle-K hechshar, if this is relevant for you.

And this particular product has many more vitamins and mineratals than the Genisoy Ultra XT product.

I'm going to go out and get the vanilla, too. Definitely recommended!

I usually hates granola bars. They tend to be too sweet and I am not crazy about the texture. My 3-year-old son's daycare requires all new kids to pack an earthquake emergency kit (yet, we live in California) and one of the required items is 10 granola bars. I bought this just to prepare the kit, hoping that he would never have to eat them. Since the product comes with 30 bars, I took some to the office as my emergency stash. They are actually quite tasty. My son also likes them as a quick afternoon snack while we are out and about. Never thought we would actually consume them when I bought this but it looks like we will reorder soon. And it's organic

The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I've become weary reading labels. I've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality.

Nature's Path Organic Blueberry Toaster Pastries are made organic wheat flour and they are absolutely delicious. They heat up fast in the toaster for breakfast with a cup of tea and are convenient for a snack. I'd go as far as to say these are better than cookies.

This is my favorite cereal, I recommend it to everyone I can. I eat a bowl every morning at 9 am and am still full at lunch time. Best of all, it tastes great. I agree with previous reviewer that the flax seeds are tasty, but probably useless as the body can't break down a whole flax seed to obtain the Omega-3, but it adds nice texture and nuttiness. Also, Amazon has a great price on this vs. grocery stores

I first tried this granola when they had it at Costco, and since then, I was hooked. I was never a huge fan of granola to begin with. I usually liked the taste, but a lot of granolas were very hard and crunchy, even when eaten with milk. A lot of them were also either too sweet or not sweet enough. So when I tried this granola, it immediately blew away all my preconcieved notions involving granola.

This granola is what granola should be: not too sweet and easily softened in milk. The flavor is awesome. I have since tried most of the other Nature's Path granola flavors and they are all pretty good as well, but I think I still like this one the best. Also, this one has omega-3 in it, which is good for you.

Anyway, this is definitely my favorite cereal, and it must be if I'm going to the length of ordering it on the internet! I just ordered my second 6-pack and I don't think I'm getting tired of it anytime soon

If you have ever had trouble with leg cramps, be sure to drink Zico. It will relieve your cramps almost instantly probably because it is so high in potassium. I have recommended it to others and it always works. Pat Rampolla

I personally like the taste of this product, but I can see that others may not. The taste is unusual, with natural tones.

I definitely like the packaging. Standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time, but a box of Zico survived a 2-week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine.

I found this product in the store and the packaging caught my attention. I love everything it has to offer. I tried one sip and I fell in love. It quenches your thirst much better than water and has a subtle, appealing taste. I can't believe anyone could complain about the taste.

I live with chronic pain and there are days that I can't get out of bed and I drink and eat nothing all day. I now have this product to enjoy along with the benefits it offers. I am addicted and plan to always have this product on hand.

Ignore the review below me as she is incorrect.

Coconut water is simply the liquid taken from the center of young coconuts. Their is no "chemical wizardry" all you need is a knife and a straw.

As coconuts mature this water is absorbed into the flesh. When this coconut flesh is ground and strained, coconut milk is produced, the liquid of pina coladas.

These drinks are quite good if you enjoy coconut water

I've been wanting to try Spirulina, the superfood that everyone in the health world swears by, and figured this would be as good an opportunity as any to do so. The bar is a medium sized green rectangle. It smells interesting and is very moist and chewy. I'm not a big fan of sour foods, so I didn't like that it tasted a bit sour. My [...] brother however LOVED this bar more than all the others we tried. Has a lot of cashew and is very sweet and packed with good fats. VERY FILLING! Overall if you like sour and sweet, this bar is for you

This is a great granola that is both nutritious and delicious. Although it is called "Cranberry Pecan," I find the pecan taste to predominate in the mix, while the cranberries are quite chewy and weaker than in some other cereals.

This is a traditional cereal, and is a great way to start the day. It is relatively high in calories, but appropriate for breakfast in suggested quantities. The texture is very crunchy, and while I prefer the Bear Naked texture which is softer, this is still a wonderful product.

In the six-pack the cereal is very reasonably priced, and given the quality of the product is an excellent value. I recommend this cereal to anyone, and especially to people who love pecans

This granola is very good - it's very chewy.... and takes a long time to chew - the dried cranberries are very chewy. I think it would taste great on a salad or mixed in with other cereal. I wonder if cooking it like hot oatmeal would soften it.

While I'm quite impressed with the health claims for these nibs, frankly they taste like dirt! (Or what I imagine dirt would taste like.)

I don't understand how one reviewer got the nibs to melt. When I tried it, I got hot dirt. I finally settled on grinding them fine, mixing them with peanut butter, sweetener, regular cocoa powder and a little milk.

It's not bad -- but maybe next, I'll just get some really dark chocolate. Life's a little short to be eating dirt.

Ever since having my little girl five years ago, I have been dedicated to serving her wholesome, nutritious and natural foods. This can be a difficult task in today's world, with so many processed, nutritionless foods, filled with harmful perservatives and trans fat. I didn't want to deny my daughter "snacks", but I hated the idea of giving her foods filled with chemicals and hydrogenated oils. So it is no surprise that I was thrilled when I stumbled on Annie's Homegrown products. Here is a brand that I can serve to my child without guilt. All of their products are made with a small handful of natural ingredients that we all can recognize (and pronounce!). No partially hydrogenated oils, no preservatives, no ungodly amounts of sodium. And they are delicious to boot! My daughter goes crazy for these little cheddar bunnies! They are perfectly cheesy and not too salty and their cute shape appeals to little ones. This is a company that cares about what you feed your children and yourself. And that is a company I am happy to support.

"...made without hydrogenated oils - which is a good thing since it's difficult for our bodies to absorb trans-fatty acids that come from hydrogenated oils." ~box

These are definitely natural snack crackers to bounce around about. I mean, it is so rare to find even natural foods without hydrogenated oils. I can't count the times I've read labels only to be disappointed to find that "natural" does not always mean healthy.

Ingredients: Certified organic wheat flour, expeller pressed safflower oil, aged cheddar cheese (contains milk, salt, enzymes, cheese culture), salt, yeast extract, paprika, annatto extract (for color), ground celery seed, onion powder, yeast.

I've made my own cheese crackers and these really do taste homemade. About 24 tiny crackers will satisfy any cheese cracker craving and that is about 70 calories.

These crackers are Bernie the Bunny (Annie's beloved mascot) approved. They are also made with only vegetarian ingredients. I love the cute rabbit shape and you can add these crackers into snack mixes with pumpkin seeds, chocolate chips, dried cranberries, GeniSoy Soy Nuts and anything else you can think of including sunflower seeds.

I personally like the taste of this product, but I can see that others may not. The taste is unusual, with natural tones.

I definitely like the packaging. Standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time, but a box of Zico survived a 2-week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine.

I found this product in the store and the packaging caught my attention. I love everything it has to offer. I tried one sip and I fell in love. It quenches your thirst much better than water and has a subtle, appealing taste. I can't believe anyone could complain about the taste.

I live with chronic pain and there are days that I can't get out of bed and I drink and eat nothing all day. I now have this product to enjoy along with the benefits it offers. I am addicted and plan to always have this product on hand.

I first purchased Bear Naked Low-Sugar granola from a brick/mortar grocery store...for $4.59 for the 12-ounce bag. I loved it, and keep it in my office at work to incorporate into any flavor of yogurt or to satisfy those late afternoon munchies. It's nutritious, delicious, and wholesome. The Amazon price is an absolute steal for this product -- over $1 less per bag than you might pay at a store down the street!

Having tried Bear Naked's other products, I can also assure you that you are not sacrificing flavor or texture by choosing the low-sugar option.

I was in the organic section of a grocery store the other night, looking for low-fat granola. (I'm on a low-fat diet to help combat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. *wince*)

I bought myself a 12 oz. packages of the Banana Nut, as well as the Bear Naked Peak Protein Granola. The latter was so-so, but the Banana Nut? YUM!

It's delicious plain, in my opinion, but you could certainly eat it with milk/soy milk as cereal, or mix in with some yogurt.

There are 11 servings per bag (about 1/4 cup) and here are some nutritional facts per 1/4 Cup:

140 calories (60 from fat)
Total Fat 7 g (10% DV)
NO Trans Fat
NO Cholesterol
5 mg sodium
17 g carbs (3 g dietary fiber, 5 g sugars)
3 g protein

If you love organic, hand-made, nutritional products, Bear Naked Banana Nut is wonderful! It contains almonds, and tastes a bit like dried banana chips + tasty granola.

(P.S. The price here at Amazon is a STEAL! I would have paid over $10 more if I would have bought the same quantities at the grocery store!

I have to say that this 100-count box is a great deal for your money. Although this isn't a "full size" Slim Jim but rather a shorter one, it's the perfect size for a lunch box surprise or a mid-afternoon pick-me-up. Slim Jim has managed, after all these years, to still provide the same taste of slightly spicy/slightly salty goodness, and you won't go wrong with the 100-count box.

There is a reason that Slim Jim doesn't ever quite say what it is. It isn't a beef stick. It isn't jerky. It is what it is. I remember eating them when they first came out and wondering what they were. Now, tasting them again, I remember the question. There is some kind of meat in there, but it is treated in a lot of different ways. A Slim Jim is still as greasy as I remember, as well. The trick is to enjoy them without eating them to excess. For what they are, they are convenient, tasty, and can be fun.

While on the computer, in your car, at work or just want a tasty snack, Slim Jim is the perfect treat! Not big enough to ruin an appetite for meals, it is just the right size to curb hunger...and tastes great! The size of the Slim Jim in the 100 count box fits anywhere - pocket, purse, glove compartment...so you can have a snack anytime. Enjoy

When I was a kid I ate slim jims all the time.

I am glad that they still taste the same.
Unfortunately, nowadays they like to change and mess with too many of the things that we grew up with and loved as children.

Here's what I used to do (and still do): I get the end real wet until the skin gets to the point that you can slough it off without breaking it. I eat the skin and then I slowly chomp the stick until it's all gone. Then I grab another and do it all over again!

And I don't care how many of these you'll try to eat in a week -- a box of 100 is guaranteed to last a long time! This is a good buy!

I recommend the good ol' slim jim!

Excellent. One of the few food items I've found on here that I think I'll buy again. Remember that it's best chilled/ice cold, if you're ever gonna sample it. Not so good when not so cold, great when actually cold. Very refreshing feel either way, though, after you've had a drink

This is unlike any other "bar" I've tried. I like that it's gooey green--I'm tired of the drier oat-like bars. It's satisfying tasty. May not be for everyone, though. I only wish more ingredient percentages would be listed on the Amazon descriptions--most of these things are pretty high fat. Ok for a meal on the run

This is a great granola that is both nutritious and delicious. Although it is called "Cranberry Pecan," I find the pecan taste to predominate in the mix, while the cranberries are quite chewy and weaker than in some other cereals.

This is a traditional cereal, and is a great way to start the day. It is relatively high in calories, but appropriate for breakfast in suggested quantities. The texture is very crunchy, and while I prefer the Bear Naked texture which is softer, this is still a wonderful product.

In the six-pack the cereal is very reasonably priced, and given the quality of the product is an excellent value. I recommend this cereal to anyone, and especially to people who love pecans

Absolutely scrumptious granola that is good for you...low fat, high fiber, a delicious alternative to the bland, tasteless granolas produced by the major American cereal makers. I've tried virtually all of the Back to Nature products and each and every one is sensational. Do yourself a favor and try this product. Highly recommended

This granola is very good - it's very chewy.... and takes a long time to chew - the dried cranberries are very chewy. I think it would taste great on a salad or mixed in with other cereal. I wonder if cooking it like hot oatmeal would soften it.

Back to Nature Apple Strawberry Granola are an excellent product for a healthy breakfast or snack. Each flavor of the Back to Nature Granola is tasty.

I would be careful before ordering this product in bulk. My order of 6 bags came in this week and they are due to expire on September 15th. I did not realize before ordering that this product was getting ready to expire and would not have placed the order had I known this. As this is a food product it is not eligible for return.

So while this is an excellent product, I would not recommend ordering this from Amazon Grocery unless you are prepared to have a bulk order of food that is getting ready to expire

I have been using the Navitas Natural Organic Raw Cacao Nibs for four months now and it gives me a feeling of happiness, well being and energy for the day. We add it to our fruit smoothie in the morning. I don't eat chocolate with dairy and sugar as it gives me pimples. However I can tolerate the nibs.

While I'm quite impressed with the health claims for these nibs, frankly they taste like dirt! (Or what I imagine dirt would taste like.)

I don't understand how one reviewer got the nibs to melt. When I tried it, I got hot dirt. I finally settled on grinding them fine, mixing them with peanut butter, sweetener, regular cocoa powder and a little milk.

It's not bad -- but maybe next, I'll just get some really dark chocolate. Life's a little short to be eating dirt.

These little nibs are very bitter. I wouldn't recomend poppin them straight from the bag. They were fabulous melted in a pan with some sweetner, dip with chunked fruit, lay on tray covered with wax paper, and refridgerate for 20 min. The chocolate hardens. Raspberries are my families' favorite but any fruit works! Also, very good sprinkled in warm milk for a homemade hot chocolate. This is a great product for experimental food people. Straight out of the bag... disappointing

We keep a big basket of these for tossing into the lunchboxes or grabbing on the way out the door. For those of us who are concerned about bovine growth hormones in cheese products, they're a great alternative to some of the other cheese crackers out there

Ever since having my little girl five years ago, I have been dedicated to serving her wholesome, nutritious and natural foods. This can be a difficult task in today's world, with so many processed, nutritionless foods, filled with harmful perservatives and trans fat. I didn't want to deny my daughter "snacks", but I hated the idea of giving her foods filled with chemicals and hydrogenated oils. So it is no surprise that I was thrilled when I stumbled on Annie's Homegrown products. Here is a brand that I can serve to my child without guilt. All of their products are made with a small handful of natural ingredients that we all can recognize (and pronounce!). No partially hydrogenated oils, no preservatives, no ungodly amounts of sodium. And they are delicious to boot! My daughter goes crazy for these little cheddar bunnies! They are perfectly cheesy and not too salty and their cute shape appeals to little ones. This is a company that cares about what you feed your children and yourself. And that is a company I am happy to support.

Natural Cheese Crackers - Great for Snack Mixes

"...made without hydrogenated oils - which is a good thing since it's difficult for our bodies to absorb trans-fatty acids that come from hydrogenated oils." ~box

These are definitely natural snack crackers to bounce around about. I mean, it is so rare to find even natural foods without hydrogenated oils. I can't count the times I've read labels only to be disappointed to find that "natural" does not always mean healthy.

Ingredients: Certified organic wheat flour, expeller pressed safflower oil, aged cheddar cheese (contains milk, salt, enzymes, cheese culture), salt, yeast extract, paprika, annatto extract (for color), ground celery seed, onion powder, yeast.

I've made my own cheese crackers and these really do taste homemade. About 24 tiny crackers will satisfy any cheese cracker craving and that is about 70 calories.

These crackers are Bernie the Bunny (Annie's beloved mascot) approved. They are also made with only vegetarian ingredients. I love the cute rabbit shape and you can add these crackers into snack mixes with pumpkin seeds, chocolate chips, dried cranberries, GeniSoy Soy Nuts and anything else you can think of including sunflower seeds.

I bought the natural flavour. Didn't find it very palatable the first time. But the next time was much better and now I am hooked on to it! An acquired taste, indeed! The 11-ounce is difficult to down in one go, though.

If you dont like mangos, you will not like this drink. It does not taste like an "organic" mango, but rather, it tastes more like the "essence of mango" you would smell from an air freshener. This does mix pretty well with cold rum.

I would suggest you find this brand locally to try it before you buy it. This water does not taste like the water you would get from the Asian countries. I cant really explain why either

Excellent. One of the few food items I've found on here that I think I'll buy again. Remember that it's best chilled/ice cold, if you're ever gonna sample it. Not so good when not so cold, great when actually cold. Very refreshing feel either way, though, after you've had a drink

If you have ever had trouble with leg cramps, be sure to drink Zico. It will relieve your cramps almost instantly probably because it is so high in potassium. I have recommended it to others and it always works. Pat Rampolla

I personally like the taste of this product, but I can see that others may not. The taste is unusual, with natural tones.

I definitely like the packaging. Standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time, but a box of Zico survived a 2-week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine.

Bear Naked is my favorite granola and Fruit and Nut is by far my favorite flavor. I came across Bear Naked because one of my favorite breakfast's is granola mixed with banana and yogurt. When I went off of refined sugar I was having the hardest time finding a granola without sugar added. Bear Naked uses all natural sugars like pear juice and maple syrup. My favorite part of this flavor is the dried cranberries and the coconut, plus the almonds add crunch to an overall chewy texture. I recommend this brand to all lovers of granola and to anyone looking for a healthy treat

Bear Naked Granola is just fabulous. I've tried every granola around, and Bear Naked strikes the right balance between crunchy, sweet, and ostensibly, good for you. And Amazon's price certainly beats what you'd pay at the store.

I first purchased Bear Naked Low-Sugar granola from a brick/mortar grocery store...for $4.59 for the 12-ounce bag. I loved it, and keep it in my office at work to incorporate into any flavor of yogurt or to satisfy those late afternoon munchies. It's nutritious, delicious, and wholesome. The Amazon price is an absolute steal for this product -- over $1 less per bag than you might pay at a store down the street!

Having tried Bear Naked's other products, I can also assure you that you are not sacrificing flavor or texture by choosing the low-sugar option.

Guess what I'm eating right now?

You guessed it...Bear Naked Banana Nut Granola!

I was in the organic section of a grocery store the other night, looking for low-fat granola. (I'm on a low-fat diet to help combat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. *wince*)

I bought myself a 12 oz. packages of the Banana Nut, as well as the Bear Naked Peak Protein Granola. The latter was so-so, but the Banana Nut? YUM!

It's delicious plain, in my opinion, but you could certainly eat it with milk/soy milk as cereal, or mix in with some yogurt.

There are 11 servings per bag (about 1/4 cup) and here are some nutritional facts per 1/4 Cup:

140 calories (60 from fat)
Total Fat 7 g (10% DV)
NO Trans Fat
NO Cholesterol
5 mg sodium
17 g carbs (3 g dietary fiber, 5 g sugars)
3 g protein

If you love organic, hand-made, nutritional products, Bear Naked Banana Nut is wonderful! It contains almonds, and tastes a bit like dried banana chips + tasty granola.

(P.S. The price here at Amazon is a STEAL! I would have paid over $10 more if I would have bought the same quantities at the grocery store!

I hesitate to write a review about a food because, well, one man's meat is another man's poison ... I like the not-too-sweet and minimally processed taste of this brand; the Banana flavour is our favourite. The Fruit and Nut flavour lacks a little oomph and the fruit inside is too tangy for my taste buds (so maybe TOO minimally processed?). Also, remember that 'All Natural' is NOT organic, even if you find this in the health food section of your grocery store. Our local Target also carries this brand of granola and has the best price for it

I love granola and cereal in general, but I have to say that this is the very best granola I have ever had. The people at Bear Naked have a philosophy that I love, and which is on the back of every bag: "we believe food should be hand-made from wholesome and natural ingredients you can actually pronounce." Although I do eat processed food, I appreciate the appeal of the more traditionally prepared foods, and this granola tops the list for nutrition and taste.

Like most granola, it is high in calories and fat, but take note that the fat comes largely from the nuts contained (it also contains expeller pressed canola oil), and it has no trans fat, and only 1.5g of saturated fat per serving. This cereal is softer than most granola, though not soft enough for me to consider it chewy. It does have large chunks of nuts and also contains cranberries and flax seed, for optimal nutritional and digestive health.

The six-pack sold on Amazon makes the price per package reasonable (the ingredients are quite expensive), so as a value proposition, I think this is not only a great product, but a great buy.

Delicious and nutritious: a great combination that I recommend highly

There is a reason that Slim Jim doesn't ever quite say what it is. It isn't a beef stick. It isn't jerky. It is what it is. I remember eating them when they first came out and wondering what they were. Now, tasting them again, I remember the question. There is some kind of meat in there, but it is treated in a lot of different ways. A Slim Jim is still as greasy as I remember, as well. The trick is to enjoy them without eating them to excess. For what they are, they are convenient, tasty, and can be fun.

While on the computer, in your car, at work or just want a tasty snack, Slim Jim is the perfect treat! Not big enough to ruin an appetite for meals, it is just the right size to curb hunger...and tastes great! The size of the Slim Jim in the 100 count box fits anywhere - pocket, purse, glove compartment...so you can have a snack anytime. Enjoy

When I was a kid I ate slim jims all the time.

I am glad that they still taste the same.
Unfortunately, nowadays they like to change and mess with too many of the things that we grew up with and loved as children.

Here's what I used to do (and still do): I get the end real wet until the skin gets to the point that you can slough it off without breaking it. I eat the skin and then I slowly chomp the stick until it's all gone. Then I grab another and do it all over again!

And I don't care how many of these you'll try to eat in a week -- a box of 100 is guaranteed to last a long time! This is a good buy!

I recommend the good ol' slim jim!

I keep these and the cheese filled type on hand. When I need to carry a snack in my handbag to get me thru a long day, I reach for them. I keep a box in my office. This is a snack you can feel good about and enjoy. My kids are grown, but if they weren't, I'd be giving them these instead of the garbage sold widely in stores. The ingredients, quality, and taste make these a great family choice for quick snacks any time

First, I would like to remind people that these are flatbread, so they're harder thicker than crackers. They have a great taste. I even eat them plain sometimes, with chili or soup, etc. One of the things that I like about them is that they don't get soggy when I put something on them. They stay nice firm crunchy. If you're looking for a nice crunchy treat, these are wonderful. If you don't like biting into something that's quite firm, then you'd better try something else

I thought these crackers were delicious. They had a rich flavor, and the pumpkin seeds were a nice touch. My only complaint was that they were very hard and I couldn't bite into them, I had to break them into pieces to eat them. Maybe I just have sensitive teeth? Regardless, I thought they were very satisfying and one cracker was a very nice snack for only 100 calories.

While I agree that this soup is a bit saltier than it could/should be, I truly enjoy it. And for the record, I am horrified that anyone who's bought and doesn't like the taste would throw away perfectly good food that could be donated or given away. What a disgusting waste!
Anyway, this soup has plenty of barley, and while it doesn't have the volume of beef chunks that a Campbell's Chunky soup might have, they aren't as sparse as some of the other comments would have you think.
I found the consistency of the soup just fine when I heated it thorougly, but it can be a little gloopy when it's only warmed instead of well-heated.
I work out of my home and get some hectic days where I can't afford the time to make a lunch or go out and grab fast food. This soup is my mainstay for a quick and nourishing bowl of energy replenishment because the ease of microwaving it in the pouch can't be beat. I have just enough time to gather my bowl, spoon and iced tea and the soup is ready.
All in all, I will be buying this product again

Extremely pleased with the product and with the price point at which Amazon had offered it.

The 3.75 ounce can contains larger sardines, typically 3 or 4. I'm looking forward to trying the 4 and 3/8 ounce cans when next offered as I suspect that it contains smaller sardines.

In any case, Reese and Amazon constitute an incredible value

I've had miso soups at various restaurants and this is actually really good. I love the fact they are environmentally concerned with their products. I'll buy their products just knowing they care so much about how much we have to throw away, so it's biodegradable. Only thing I'm not crazy about is the noodles, I would have preferred a thinner noodle, only because it's so bulky, and not really typical of Asian dish

Finally there is a quick way to make a great Udon Soup at home! For any Udon fan, this is a must try product. The noodles are as good as Udon noodles get, and the soup mix is great base to start your Udon. Here is the way we make Udon using this product as a base:

We take the noodles and soup mix from two packages (bowls), add some additional soy sauce and spices we like, and boil it all in a pan (you don't need to screw around with all the noodle rinsing, just throw them in the pot). When the soup and noodles are warm, we add chopped romaine. This is super good, and costs less than $[...] for two LARGE servings of Udon - a deal by any standard!!

When we really want a full-on Udon, we add some sliced pressed fish like the restaurants use in traditional Udon (the half moon pressed fish, white with the orange/red coating) and shrimp. This is heavenly!!

I started to love Annie Chun's udon soup in March 2007. Although it was on my AMAZON GROCERY LIST for many months cause i read a very bad review from a guy that did not know what is great. I just ordered many A. Chun's soup noodle bowls. And i will order more again in future. Annie Chun is a cute and talented woman and she is the 1st Asian female that i admired and read her story about her soup noodle for second time on Amazon.com

I added a half of dozen or so of frozen pre-cooked shrimp and this was great as an evening meal. The package includes the spices that one would expect to find in a Tom Yum Thai soup. While the quality may not be what one might expect to find in a good Thai restaurant, preparation in five minutes is surely an acceptable compromise

Fogbuster is excellent for a dark roast, and the 5lb.bag is a great value. If you're looking for something mild, I'd suggest Jeremiah's espresso or Kona blend

I bought a case of these for my son - he's a toddler - and my husband and I have wound up snacking on them too. I think it's sort of hard to come up with a large assortment of quick-n-easy, 100% organic, nutritionally alright snacks these days in a super busy household and the Late July products make it simple.

These crackers are the best I've found, and my husband has tried them all. I'm the organic nut and I've slowly been converting him from conventional to organic. I'll compromise, but he won't, so whatever organic products I give him have to be as good as or better than what he's accustomed to, and Late July crackers fit the bill

I have been looking for a long time for a cracker to substitute for the main two brands available nationwide. All the others I had tried were not approved by my family for a variety of reasons, mainly not having any taste. These crackers are light, crispy and great-tasting. These will replace all the other ones we used to buy, even my picky 4-year old likes them.

These delicious mini-crackers are small enough to grab a satisfying handful. Yep, it's got all the organic requisites, organically-fed cows whose lips never taste hormones or antibiotics (well, maybe these are injected, I don't know), and the crackers contain non-hydrogenated, trans-fat free organic palm oil.

The taste is mild but you can taste the cheddar, and the texture is more flakey than hard or brittle. If you grab 30 crackers (one ounce, there are 5ounces, or 150 crackers per box), you'll get 310 mg of sodium, or 13% of the Recommended Daily Value (RDV) for a 2,000 calorie diet. Now that's by any means low-sodium, but you can easily eat half of that and feel you've had a snack. Per 30 crackers, there are 4.5 grams (g) oftotal fat, of which 1.5 are saturated, and none are trans fat. Total carbohydrates are 19g, including less than 1g of sugar, but also less than 1g of dietary fiber. Hey, noone said this is health food, but compare this to what you're snacking on now (and that cheese gives it 3g of protein).

Full ingredients and nutritional information may be found at latejuly.com/products, but other good stuff includes organic wheat flour, organic whey, sea salt, and organic evaporated cane juice. Nothing artificial, no corn syrup, preservatives, hydrogenated oils, and they're both Kosher and Lacto Vegetarian (gotta make sure there's no meat in your crackers...). If that's not enough, "Late July" is independently owned and family operated.

Mainly, though, it's the light taste, the organic ingredients, and that enticing small size you can grab by the fistful. Full information at the above-mentioned website.

My sister-in-law introduce me to this product. We LOVE pizza in our house and we could probably eat it every single day if possible. This crust is so easy. My 5 year old helps us make the pizza all the time. It's perfect for the 9" round pan. You put sauce on and your favorite topping and into the oven it goes. I highly recommend for everyone to try. Especially if you have kids, this can get them involved

This microwave oven popcorn pops light and fluffy. When it's popping, it actually smells like popcorn and not like some kind of artificially-flavored buttery grease. There is a hint of salt and light butter. It's really good stuff unless you're looking to replicate the trans-fat experience of the movie theater concession stand

This is the best,but so hard to find. I like one of the other reviewers had shipping problems. I waited 2 months before I received my shipment. It is worth the wait. I cannot find it where I now live, and it really goes a long way and is very flavorful. I just went and bought a large rubbermaid bottle and mixed half of the Knorr bottle and the rest with water and made a quart of broth to add to my food when cooking,it beats paying $3.00 and change for a store bought box. I do hope they bring more in...PLEAS

This product has been in my kitchen for 15 years - it was then sold and labeled Bovril. Knorr started marketing it about 5-6 years ago. Unfortunately they no longer carry the concentrated beef. It gets used in soups, sauces and gravies and for cooking pasta and vegetables. I have tried all the concentrates in the supermarket and even some commercial brands and this is the best.

Took a chance on this item and am glad I did. You can use as much or as little as you like/need (concentrate mixes with water) and there is no extra to save for the next time or to throw away. It stores well, takes little space, no paper sticks to the cube, and it does not clump together. I add some to rice when I boil it to provide extra flavor. Great for soups, sauces, a hot drink, and more. It's a nifty treat to share a bottle with a friend but be warned, they'll go crazy trying to find it in a store

Being Kraft how could it be bad? Very delicious and easy to prepare . . . just squeeze out the cheese like toothpaste. No need to add butter or milk, so quite convenient and fast. The cheese product itself tastes a lot like Velveeta when eaten straight, so don't let the word 'sharp cheddar' make you think it's anything near bitter. And why would you eat it straight? Because there's always that little bit left you can't quite squeeze out, to lap up like licking the spoon, and yum!

I'm very happy that it is low mercury, but with this quality and taste, I might still eat it if they added mercury. I'm back here ordering my sixth or seventh shipment and this time I just had to leave a review.

I would give this 6 stars if I could. I love tuna and I've tried all the different major brands and many of the smaller. I get excited when I see a type I haven't tried and I snap it up and since trying this, I've always been disappointed. This brand is by far the best I've ever tasted. This particular no salt variety is the best of those, though some of my family and friends disagree on that point.

This is not tuna for making tuna salad or even my favorite dish, the tuna melt, out of. This tuna is so good you eat it straight as it comes from the can. Makes a great tasty snack

I was disappointed this jerky has MSG in it which seems to add a lingering aftertaste to it's mostly salty flavor. the jerky texture is a good balance of chewy and flakey without much gristle at all. the jerky is not oily as many beef flavors get when compared to bison/buffalo, but it does not have any noticeable smoke in it either, which makes me wonder how they actually cure this stuff. I consider this an average 3-star jerky, but it's remarkably low price help give it a bonus star

The price about 30% of what you would pay in the grocery store

Warning: boring review follows! ha ha: I was interested in buying these individual servings of cereal for my family and wondered if the cups, bowls or little boxes were cheapest per ounce. The cups hold more than the bowls and boxes(usually about twice as much based on cereal type). I mean we would have eaten 2 bowls if it was really cheaper that way.

I went to the kelloggs site to compare how much cereal was in the cups versus how much in the individual bowls or the little boxes. The bowls, cups and boxes all seem to end up costing fractions of pennies of one another ounce per ounce. I didn't add up all the kinds per variey pack and see which grand total costed pennies more or less based on ounce (I am not THAT frugal), but picked corn pops and frosted flakes to compare. The prices for all the kinds are very comparable, so if your wondering which type to buy, it doesn't really add up to much difference. I do check these things because sometimes the big "value" sizes are actually more expensive per ounce/gram than the little sizes. Those marketing people are tricky!

Therefore, if you want to have more little bowls or you pick the cups (that have more in each), you can make your choice and know you won't be spending way more either way. I skipped choosing the boxes because I liked the convenience of the bowls, but honestly the carboard boxes are probably better for the planet (but anyway, I will save some energy, water, and soap by not washing bowls!) Now all they need to do is sell a cute little dispenser for my counter and I will never go back to boxes

I purchased these on the special Friday sale where they were $7.99 for 3 cans. At the store where I normally shop here one can is almost $5 so this was a fantastic deal. I liked how they were lightly salted and not as salty as alot of nuts are.

I agree with the other review that they were mostly almonds. Id say 60% almonds, 30% cashews and 10% macadamias but they were still quite good

I bought this product because it was a cheaper alternative to the Senseo coffee pods I've been buying. I don't have much else to compare with, as I've only used the Senseo products in my pod-style coffee maker. The Gala product taste just a good as the Senseo in my opinion, and it certainly is less expensive.

One interesting note - I only received one pacakage of 18 pods, and the rest (11 packages remaining in the order) were not shipped. Upon inquiry, I was told these were no longer available, and I was promptly issued a refund for the whole order

This is now the only brand of mac and cheese I will buy, and I don't mind paying a higher price because it tastes great and is made with some organic ingredients. I find that one 6 ounce box makes 2-4 servings (depending on how hungry you are), and for optimal flavor I use both butter and a splash of milk when I mix the macaroni with the powdered cheese

I have tried 10 different brands of flaxseed meal and can tell you that this is by far the best tasting and has the most consistent quality. There are two types of flaxseeds, brown and golden. Both have the same nutritional value, but golden flaxseed is significantly smoother in taste and not as pungent/bitter aftertaste. I especially like Bob's Red mill for the organic offerings at a minimal price increase. I regularly sprinkle 1-2 tablespoons on my cereal in the morning to give it a nutritional punch of fiber, protein and essential fatty acids. The texture is very fine and almost has no noticeable effect on the cereal, if I went with 1 Tbls, you wouldn't even know it was there. I highly recommend giving Bob's products a try, I am sure you will find it as enjoyable as I have. Always store flaxseed meal refrigerated, opened or not

An excellent product inside, I just wish the packaging were different. Information recommends the flaxseed be stored in its opaque packaging. But it's just a bag. So I cut off the top and hope my clip won't slip off and I'll have flaxseed spilled all over the refrigerator shelf. Better packaging might be a shaker container like what's used for parmesan cheese, but opaque.

The package is big and you have to buy 4 so even using some every day on my cereal, I will have flaxseed for a long time from this order. Store extras in the freezer, put the one you're using in the refrigerator

I had never heard of these, and when I came across the product listing I thought these were going to be more like "around the house snacks" given the description and comments.

These are only really enjoyable to eat in the same way whey protein shakes or powerbars or other "good for you" meal replacement or snack-like food units are enjoyable: they stop the hunger with a minimum of fuss.

The balls are fairly dense.. prepare to "gnaw" on them. Taking a bite is a commitment. The texture with all the exterior seeds is coarse. The peanut butter flavor is, well, faint. Using the words "great tasting" in the marketing is stretching the truth a bit, IMHO. (I would not buy these for taste alone.)

On the plus side, they work. I was running out of the house without having had breakfast, so I threw two balls in my pocket and ate them in the first 10 minutes of driving. My hunger reacted the same way it would to any other 400-calorie breakfast -- it went away, and stayed away until lunch. There was no negative aftertaste or other unpleasantness, and it made me feel like I had eaten food rather than some sort of snacky candy thing.

I don't have a particular allergy related need for this product, although I like the fact that it doesn't use refined sugar. I'm not sure how much of this product I will order in the future, but I can foresee finishing this pack

I'm a big fan of good jerky; made plenty of my own, and this stuff is great. It's a little pricey, but the quality and flavor are worth it. It is on the sweet side, but that's to be expected hence the name "sweet n' spicy". You won't be disappointed. I couldn't keep my hands off the 8 bags and scarfed them down in 4 days--dirty gluttonous pig

I prefer variety so most of the time I drink Starbucks house blend and sometimes masala chai (spiced tea). Then occasionally I treat myself with illy. The illy medium roast is very smooth and mild with no aftertaste or bitterness. It is perhaps the best coffee you can buy. It is about twice the cost of Starbucks, but well worth it

Confession: I have been a true fan of Starbucks. I used to think Starbucks was the best coffee ever and the many bags of Starbucks in my pantry will prove that! However, I recently received a gift of a half pound of Illy Espresso Coffee, Medium Grind and I was for once in my life, truly impressed with the quality, flavor, and aroma of this coffee. I also find this to be heartbreaking as I do not know what to do with all my Starbucks that I have on hand. I just gave 3 pounds of my Starbucks to my mother-in-law since I will not be drinking it anymore. If you are a true coffee conesseiur then you will love Illy coffee. If I ever open a coffee shop, I would be more than happy to invest in this company.

I have not found any sardines that have exceeded the pleasant flavor and texture of the Reese skinless and boneless sardines in olive oil. The cans open easily and consistently, in my opinion these sardines are my absolute choice for value and taste, second to none

No need to pay more when Reese's are the same as pricier brands. Plus I found no tiny grit and no damaged sardines.

You'll avoid busting off the ring when opening the can by bending the ring so it touches the can rim and then pulling up

I recently purchased a full case of the Melitta One Hazelnut flavored pods - to use in my Melitta One coffee maker - and I can honestly say Melitta coffee is the best I've had of all the brands I've tried.

One nice touch: every Melitta coffee pod is individually foil-packed for freshness, which is apparent from the first sip. I've tried other brands that were stale and tasteless.

Also, the Melitta One Skip the Buzz is the very best decaf I've ever tasted in my life.

I give Melitta One my strongest recommendation.

Okay. I don't see how anyone could not like this drink. Granted, it doesn't taste as good as RedBull, but the flavor definitely isn't crappy. Since I tried the sugar free version, it definitely tastes less watered down than the Red Bull sugar free version as well.
The reason I bought this was because I wanted a sugar free energy drink that wouldn't cost be 3 dollars a pop (I have been drinking Red Bull). You should get sugar free because 1)it is a lot healthier 2) when you pull an all nighter, you shouldn't have all that sugar in your teeth anyway. Liquid Lightning is not only sugar free, but it is a lot more healthy compared to Red Bull, since it has only 5 calories, 0 Sodium (Red Bull has a lot), 100% vitamin C...
It tastes good too, and for ~1 a can, you can't go wrong! Highly recommended.

I work in a business that sells gourmet coffee beans so I like to check out the competition. We sell lots of organic coffee. These espresso roast beans were perfectly roasted. The coffee is smooth and deceptively subtle for such a dark roast. I was jealous. The blend was just right. Clean on the palate with an immaculately gentle mouth feel. Well done

My family has been eating Fig Newmans for years. Figs are great for you, but how do you get kids to eat them? The answer is Fig Newmans. Since they're organic, you can feel good that your little ones aren't ingesting pesticides along with the cookies. Two Fig Newmans will fill you up and keep you going. They're a great snack

I have been eating Seven in the Morning, now called Seven Whole Grain
Nuggets, for a few years now and started having trouble finding it in
my local grocery store. Thank goodness for Amazon! This cereal is
tasty and satisfying. Crunchy texture if you eat it right away, gets
softer if you let it sit in the milk a few minutes. Love it with fruit

We love Hodgson Mills products! Their Gingerbread is great and they have whole wheat bread machine mixes which I have trouble finding here in the frozen north! It's nice to get these products via Amazon. The price is better per case from Hodgson Mills directly but with 2 day free shipping I get with Amazon it evens out and ordering is so easy with Amazon. Nice addition!

I bought this one and the dark variety. They are both very good; kind of a gentle sweetening agent, not in your face sweet like white sugar.
I preferred the dark type as it seemed to have more flavor, but this one's taste is probably better for most baking recipes, as it would impart a less assertive note.
No trouble using agave in all my recipes both sweet and savory, like that little bit of sweeteness one wants in a Thai dish, for example

If you like Beef Jerky try World Kitchens Peppered Beef Jerky. They have outstanding favor and are really moist. They are the real thing. I loved peppered beef. I can usually eat the whole bag but I pay for it later.

I eat this meal about twice weekly and find it is extraordinary. Until Ensavor came along, I had not tasted an instant meal so tasty with just the right spice and zest that was actually created with good ingredients. Why is that so difficult? This stew tastes just great over a bed of short brown rice and has just enough liquid and protein to complement the vegetables that are cooked just right

i love this stuff. all you do is cook it up like the directions say then add what you want (i love sliced kielbasa)and dinner is ready. i don't have the patience for cooking and i'm not very good at it but my family likes this dish. it has a little heat but my 3 year old eats and likes it. i cook up 2 boxes for my family of 6.

I don't know how is it that someone took rice and made it taste so good, but I have been eating these for several months now. They are extremely addictive. Sometimes I find myself getting up in the middle of the night just to eat them. Not too sweet, and no stomach reaction from someone like me, who can't tolerate gluten. I have tried all of the flavors, and they are equally satisfying. Of course, this is a processed food and has no live nutrients as they say, but its the only snack I eat really when I buy processed foods

I hate flavored coffees, but this one was the exception. The K-Cup process seems to add a hint of a a frothy flavor, but not so much as to hide the flavor of the bean.

I drink a lot of coffee, so buying K-Cups at the department store is prohibitively expense. This coffee was excellent and the price was extremely reasonable. Throw in free delivery and this is the only way to buy K-Cups (even cheaper than eBay and so much less hassle

Green is good, of course. But what's much better than green are these truly awesome cookies. PN Os beat the bootie out of any Oreo variation -- crunchier, more filling(without being smarmy), much better taste. (And this goes for the mint, the vanilla, and the chocolate.)

Fast Eddie Felson -- I love you.

These high-sodium ginger cookies are too tasty to have around - you'll easily surpass your RDA of sodium in one sitting.

The nutrition facts that Amazon neglected to post are: Serving size is 2 cookies (28 g). Each serving has 160 mg of sodium, 4.5 mg of fat (2 g saturated, 0 g transfat), 19 g of total carbs (10 g sugars), and 0 g of cholesterol.

The ingredients in these "Made in U.S.A." cookies are organic unbleached wheat flour, powdered sugar, organic palm fruit oil, organic molasses, organic sugar, sodium bicarbonate (leavening), ground ginger, soy lecithin (an emulsifier), salt, monocalcium phosphate (leavening), and nutmeg. There are no hydrogentated oils or trans fats.

On the back of the package is an Ode to Ginger-O's, which reads: "You might, m'lady tweak my nose. You could, m'lord step on my toes. But Heaven help those poor bozos, who try to filch my Ginger-O's ".

Again, these high-sodium cookies taste too good in order to effectively exercise self-discipline to limit the quantity eaten.

Panko breadcrumbs, for anyone that has not used them, are the best things for fried chicken, fried fish, crumb toppings and anything else you can think of for breadcrumbs. They don't get soggy, or fall off the meat/fish. Some products are not what they are trumped up to be. Panko breadcrumbs are the exception. I gave a box to my girlfriend and we both profess to be good cooks. She has a yen for fried chicken and was just amazed how well the panko breadcrumbs held up. Her husband kept raving about them. I am glad I bought 6 boxes, you will be too

I like this stuff. I initially thought I liked the Sumatra
blend best and ordered a box of that. Sumatra is kind of
"sweet" but not in the sense that it contains sugar. Brazil and Columbia are similar but different and Kenya is, for lack of a better word "dry". If I make a cup of Kenya and don't wash out the machine before the next it will come out tasting like Kenya blend. Kenya is ok but probably not going to be my favorite. I just ordered another variety pack to help me decide while I wake up.

Weight Watchers point that is. The bag is one point. A great, healthy snack to incorporate into your WW diet, or any other healthy lifestyle.

I haven't had a problem with crumbs and powder in the packets I've tried, no more than any other dried fruit I'd buy from Trader Joes or the Gerber ones. It's definitely a small bag for the price, so if you're near a Trader Joes, you should really buy their dried fruits.

Amazon does have a great price for this item though... I paid $1.79 for one packet at a major chain!! That's insanity

Very good product to have on hand if you need a quick on-the-go snack. Good tasting and easy to eat. I keep a couple in my car to snack on if I can't stop for a meal right away.

In principle, this is a great product: It's actual fruit, with nothing added, dried to a crisp and put in a packet that only has 85 calories. If you're looking for light, healthy-ish snack foods that are still tasty, this is a great choice.

But there are a couple of problems:

1. The packets are very narrow and long, which makes it virtually impossible to reach into them to get the fruit out, once you're past the top third or so.

2. There's a decent amount of fruit dust inside -- which, as these are berries and cherries, is red, and just waiting for a bit of added water to stain up any fabric it lands on.

Either of these in isolation is no problem, but put them together, and you've got a product that you MUST pour out, and yet a product that you CAN'T pour out. I guess maybe if you had a bowl or something, it wouldn't be a big deal, but that sort of takes away the portable-snack nature of it, no? As much as I liked the fruit, the inconvenience of the packaging is going to keep me from buying more.

Oh, and one more caveat: Despite the "Cherry Berry" name, this is at least 50% apple. I suspect that apples are to dried fruit mixes what peanuts are to mixed nuts, the inexpensive and unobjectionable filler. The apple tastes fine and all, but I wouldn't mind more cherries and berries, and fewer apples

The fruit is "crunch dried" via a unique process developed by Sensible Foods, making it more than just your run-of-the-mill dried fruit snack. It's naturally sweet, it's crunchy, it's delicious and it's healthy. What more can you ask for? My dog loves the dried apple bits as well. It's his favorite treat. My one qualm with the product is that I'm a guy and for me the serving size is just too small... So, I usually eat 2 packs at a time.

Your kids will love it, your pets will love it, and you will love it

As the mother of three children, two of whom are Celiacs, I can honestly say... I love this stuff! It has a very nice taste, very nice texture, and it's SAFE for my children to eat. We don't have to worry about toxic grains with this one. It's chocolately, without being "too" chocolatey. And, it's small enough that it's not a choking hazzard for little ones.

I like the serving size of 1.5 ounces in these packs - sometimes 1 ounce just isn't enough. They have a nice flavor, rather like dry roasted peanuts, since they have some spice added (paprika, onion and garlic powder, et al) I think the sugar content is a little high. I'd have given them 5 stars otherwise. Nice change from oil roasted almonds, which can seem too oily to me sometimes, or raw almonds.

At less than $2 a pound, it's hard to find better granola for your money.

The taste isn't quite as good as the Bear Naked brand I've also gotten from Amazon, but it's easily half the price.

A little dry, but eaten as a cereal with milk - the taste is perfect. I'll be less likely to just "snack" on this granola because of the texture/dryness, but will gladly use it as a breakfast cereal or on yogurt. Plenty of nuts and cocunut in it, as I had hoped

We eat nachos three or four times a week in our house, so we go through lots of corn tortilla chips. And these are the best tasting we've found. You can really taste the corn in them, not just corn flour. They're flavorful but not overpowering with just the right amount of salt.

I only give them four stars because the box that contained the bags was fairly flimsy and got crushed by UPS so a lot of the bags contained little more than crumbs

This is a nice blend of flavors. The cacao nibs provide a mere hint of choco flavor, so don't expect to brew a "mocha" in one quick session here. I tend to make strong coffee and some can come out a little bitter. This one is quite smooth. I could use a little darker roast than this turned out to be, but to Jeremiah's credit, it is advertised as a "medium/dark" roast. I'd call it medium, but taste IS subjective, is it not? For a baseline, I currently call Starbuck's Caffe Verona my favorite. Overall, for the price (especially with the 10 off of 50 promo, thanks Amazon) this is quite good.

I got hooked by first trying the flatbreads based on so many favorable reviews here. When I discovered the same 3 seed crackers in bite size - that was it!

They taste Great, are good for you, and are very reasonably priced - the ideal combination. And, the containers are re-usable. All told ... very, very cool (that's older person speak for 'way cool')

Make up a batch of tuna salad, dip it out with these crackers, yummy lunch or dinner! These crackers are much heartier than your typical saltine or Triscuit. I find the whole ones a little too big to eat unless I break them up first. This tub variety is just the right size: 1-2 bites worth. Holds up very well to cold cheese spreads too.

After trying many of the richer coffees in the K-Cup field, this coffee was both bold and smooth straight up. As an alternative, add a little warmed milk and it tastes like the coffees served in the coffee houses dripped out of the filter stand in Colombia and Costa Rica. No grinds from the packet; smooth and bold using the 7oz Keurig setting and robust using the 5 oz setting. ENJOY

This is one espresso grind that I actually enjoy over and over again. There is no strange after-taste with some other "premium" brands. This is a coffee lover's coffee. It is rich and deep with a slightly nutty undertone. Try it. You won't regret it.

The canister is nice, too

We love Illy coffee but it is difficult and expensive to find in our area. When I found it on the Amazon web site - WOW! About half the price and delivered right to my door - and quickly! I surprised my husband on Christmas morning when he found the can sitting next to the coffee pot. Excellent

If you like your coffee a little lighter bodied then what the Cafe Kilimanjaro is, then this is your coffee. When I'm making coffee for guests and they don't want a dark roast that I normally drink I throw some Espresso Milano in the machine and make a cup with it and I've never received a complaint about it. Usually I'm asked where the coffee is from and what kind it is. It's a perfect fair-trade, organic medium roast from Pura Vida.

The prunes were wonderful - highly recommended. Unfortunately, over and over Amazon kept sending us just one little bag instead of the case of 12 bags it is supposed to be that we ordered, despite repeatedly contacting them. They finally just refunded the price after about the 3rd time around with the same mistake. I hope they get their system straightened out - or get rid of the constipated employee in shipping pilfering the prunes. ;

This sweet treat is, as they say, a lesser evil. It's not health food, in that it's a sweet combination of vanilla and chocolate, but it is much hearlthier than other carmel and chocolate popcorns out there--just check the ingredients. Other reviewers complaining about the nutritional fact panel or the health benefits of this product don't quite get it.

Some reviewers have noted that this is not kettle corn are correct. Others who say this is half caramel corn miss the "black and white" across the front of the bag--it's not caramel, it's vanilla. The chocolate half is delicious--cocoa-laden and therefore perfect when you want something light; not chocolate dipped, which would be overwhelming, heavy, and creamy. The vanilla half is also not dipped, heavy, or overwhelming. It's a lightly sweet plain corn taste to cleanse your palate for more chocolate.

People who love the New England tradition of black and white cabinets (milkshakes, frappes...can't we all just get along?) will adore this popcorn. People trying to avoid nasty chemical ingredients will appreciate this corn. People who love subtle flavors will love this treat. People who think Oreos are really good won't "get" this snack, nor do people who weigh and measure every kernel because they're watching calories. It's a sugary (albeit natural sugar with no hydrogenated oils) snack. It's the lesser of all the evils out there--and makes being nutritionaly bad feel really good

The quality of this good, but the Kettle Corn flavor did not do much for me. I have had other kettle corn and liked it. This was less sweet and more salt than what I prefer. It's not bad, I still manage to choke down the entire bag, but it's not what I was hoping for. Think I may still try the cinnamon though, I hope I like that one better

The chocolate is mild enough not to overwhelm, but strong enough to sate a chocolate-craving. The "kettle corn" part really is just caramel corn, but it's really good, ESPECIALLY considering there is no corn syrup, preservatives, trans fats, artificial flavors, or gluten. Compared to other "snack" foods, I feel no guilt in eating this

When I was young, a while ago, sardines didn't come three or so to the flat can as they do now; they were small fish, young sprat. The very best were so tiny that they were packed crossways and two layers deep, lightly smoked, in oil. These still are, and at the best price I've seen in years. The taste is utterly different from the cheap supermarket brands. If sardines could be elegant, these would be

I regularly buy this product because I don't think I could live without it!! Like some of the other reviewers I am also Irish, born and bred, and it really helps to have such an easy product to bake which tastes wonderful. I will have to try the suggestion of one of the other reviewers, one egg and substitute the water for milk, sounds like an idea, thanks! I would certainly HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying this product, it's really worth every penny and cheap too

This is really good Irish brown bread! Not only does it taste exactly like the yummy brown bread you get in Ireland, it is also super easy to make. Just add water to the mix and bake for about 40 minutes. I don't want to forget to mention that it is really good for you as the first two ingredients are whole wheat flour and oats. Enjoy

Some products are better by the dozen, but I think that I would have rather opted for a variety pack if I were to buy another 12-pack of Zataran's. If you are reading this review, then you have probably already tried the dirty rice, since you are about do buy a dozen packets of it. So you already know that it is a decent mix (we add our own spices to it to give it even more kick).

I bought a box of this oatmeal at our local grocery store, thinking it would make a nutritious easy to make breakfast for me. I was surprised it tasted so good. It's slightly sweet, just the way I like it.

The real test was when my 16 year old asked me if she could try it. She loved it! Now the only problem is keeping enough of it on hand for the both of us.

I heat the water in the microwave, and add it to the oatmeal in a bowl. It is nice to have a healthy choice for breakfast that is so easy to prepare

I originally bought a bag of this at the local grocery store because of the health claims on the packaging. Since then I've bought a bunch of it from Amazon grocery.

I use it mostly on my breakfast cereal, but have also used it in baking, including the muffin recipe on the package. I can't recommend that recipe because the muffins have too much stuff in them (carrot and apple shavings, nuts, raisins, etc.) and the muffins wouldn't hold together except for the gooey consistency of the baked product. Yuck.

However, in a pizza crust it's great, adding extra flavor and texture that is both unfamiliar and satisfying. I like having taste in the pizza crust as much as in the toppings, and adding some flaxseed meal helps add flavor.

It also goes well in other baked goods, and I've used it in cookie recipes, quick breads, etc

Bob's Red Mill is a high quality food company. The Organic Flaxseed Meal is a versatile, easy to use food for healthy consumption of Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Lignans. I have used several different brands of flaxseeds. Bob's Red Mill Organic is by far the most flavorful and is ground to a consistancy that is perfect as a flour (substitute about 1/4 of the flour in muffin and bread recipes) or add the meal to homemade peanut butter or sprinkle on yogurt or cereal. I keep the flaxseed meal frozen and use as much as needed out of the bag straight from the freezer. My kitchen is never without this naturally wonderful organic food. [..

We love this all natural, organic apricot.
Very sweet and soft. Worth the money. You pay more at a health food store per bag. I,ve been shopping from the health food stores for over 25 years. Let me say that the color is not as bright and cheerful as the non- organic counterpart but keep in mind that this is all natural. It was not treated with chemicals, preservatives or colorings. This is good tasting and good for you. For me, it is good quality and deliscious. I will order this again and other natural fruit products by them. Enjoy

I am a busy woman and yet I have to serve top quality and delicious meals that take little time to prepare. Well, this rice with roasted chicken meal is one of my secrets in the kitchen. It is organic, takes a few minutes to prepare in the microwave and I haven't head anything less than "it's great". The quantity is significant so one purchase lasts for a long time. I am very, very pleased with it and high recommend it

These are my favorite cookies. They are so easy to make but you must use real butter for the best taste. I always keep a package in the cabinet for short notice needs. Just add butter and egg! I love to roll the dough into balls and then roll the balls in sugar and cinnamon to make a special snickerdoodle.

These are soft, not leathery which is perfect for small children. There are no worries about choking and they are very delicious.
I gave these out at Halloween and at parties and the little ones and the parents loved them.
They are also great crumbled up into hot cereal and yogurt instead of sugar

WOW! I am impressed with these snacks. A whole apple in each bar and no added suger of any kind! I love the convenience of these fruit bars. We snack mostly on fruit here in the house, but sometimes it's not convenient to carry fruit with you on outings. So I've been looking for something like this for a long time and it's better than I expected, much better than most fruit leathers you can find in a health store.
These strawberry snacks have also been tested by a three and four year old pallet and they always ask for more.
They're so good I've ordered more of another flavor

I love ESE pods. I know some coffee snobs disagree, but I'll take 90% of the taste for 10% of the work any day. As for pods, I've had Starbucks, Illy, and Espressione Arabica. I like the Espressione the best. I lived in Italy for 3 years and hit the coffee bars daily - I know what I like in espresso. The Starbucks was a bit too rough, too American tasting. Suprisingly, though, the Starbucks pods tasted just like an espresso at one of their stores. Very consistent. The Illy is too smooth. It goes well with food, and after dinner, but I tend to take my espresso at breakfast, and prefer a bold, smooth taste. The Espressione Arabica achieves just that. I'll be buying it again for my every day use

These pods have got to be the best invention yet. They are compact, extremely easy to use is the best solution to making several very quick cups of coffee.

Fresh ground coffee is nice, but there is virtually no mess with these pods. The crema is just as good as ground coffee these can be used in a pod holder as well as a one cup filter basket.
What more could a person want?!

I really got hooked on the great taste and superior creama it produces, but I find it a bit overpriced compared to other pods. I now buy pods from Boyd coffee at a substantial savings. Wish Amazon would put it on sale so I could stock up

I have enjoyed those pods for more than a year with my Frances Frances Espresso machine, but today I am a little bit concerned about the fact that your price went from $37.99 last month to $60.00 today... Why? The advantage of buying 150 pods at once was to cut down on the price, if it is the same price or more expensive than other stores, do we still have a reason to purchase them from Amazon? Please enlighten me! I would be very sorry to have to go elsewhere. Thanks

This is a tasty cereal. It has a good crunchy texture. It is one of a few safe foods my daughter can eat. It has no extra preservatives, colors, gluten etc.. It has been a lifesaver for us to find a food that dose not have a lot of extra preservatives, dyes, etc that could make her ill. It has been a lifesaver as it is one of her main foods in food trialing. She can only eat rice at this point. We buy it by the case. Thank you Erewhon!! for making it and Amazon for supplying

This cereal is like rice crispies and it taste good but better with fruit. There is also a Erewhon Crispy Brown Rice Ceral with mixed berries that is much better for me although I have not been able to get it lately. This is a great gluten free product for those who have to avoid gluten products. Celiac disease suffers are always looking for tasteful foods that are gluten free. I hope more products become available in bulk for us.

Note the order is 2 boxes of 50 each. The package inside the can of 50 contain 2 packages with 25 tea bag each..And one more stuff..the price is great for white te

These are amazingly delicious! In fact, I wish they were half as good, so I would not be tempted to eat so many. I love all the Betty Lou's products I've tried and I'm here at Amazon to buy more because they have the best price

This stuff is great! It's funny that all the previous reviews said use this if your child can't drink cow's milk....NO, use this INSTEAD OF COW'S MILK!!! :D This is so much better for your baby than cow's milk...it's much closer to human milk than cow's milk. Goat's are much closer to us than cow's...cow's chew cud and have 4 stomachs....they eat food, and regurgitate it later and finish chewing it, then it goes through several processing chambers/stomachs. Think about it, a baby cow drinking milk from it's mama is going to process it's food the same way that mama cow is processing her's, WE DON'T HAVE 4 STOMACHS, why would our babies drink that milk???...why should we think that cow's milk is going to be sufficient for our needs? Goat's graze, they eat little bits of food all day, and their food steadily processes through their bodies (hence if you ever have been around goats you'll see they eat and poop, eat and poop...it process very quickly through their bodies. Just like we do, we process our food very quickly and need foods that we can digest/absorb very quickly and easily. That's REALLY why Cow's milk is not the best for us...not just because of lactose and all the hormone/antibiotic stuff (yeah that stuff too but that's not the MAIN reason). However, it's the main source you see because it's CHEAP and EASY to obtain, thin about how many goats it would take to produce the same amt of milk a cow produces...it's all about supply and demand. But heck anyone could own a goat and milk it, easily! I can't wait to have a farm of my own someday so I can have goat's milk for the whole family! :D


But as for Meyenberg powdered milk, this stuff is so easy to mix and so convenient with a toddler!!! Just take it with you and mix it whenever you need it, and don't worry about it spoiling in the fridge or running out and having to go to the store to find that they are out. I REALLY wanted to keep breastfeeding beyond a year but my supply just couldn't keep up with my son's needs at that point. So I weaned him and have given him some cow's milk and mostly Goat's milk and now I have pretty much stayed only with the Goat's milk. and I can tell that he likes the flavor MUCH better, and his BM's are not loose and watery like with cow, and he doesn't have as much gas with this either.

And gosh what an EXCELLENT PRICE!!!! Thanks AMAZON!

This is the best stuff going for a child that is unable to drink formula or soy milk. I used it for my son when he was a baby. I started him on it when he was about 3 months old, because of allergies and his doctor said to leave him on the soy milk even though it was causing him much discomfort. I couldn't just let my son suffer and took it upon myself to put him on goats milk and ended up with a healthy kid and a doctor who was also a convert

My daughter is allergic to soy cow's milk, but tolerated goat milk very well. She has been drinking it since she was 12 months. It's nice having a powder so we can take it with us when we are on the go. There is more information about the milk itself on the meyenberg website. After looking over the website, I felt confident that goat milk would meet my daughter's nutritional needs

My almost-two-year-old is allergic to cow's milk, so we give him a mixture of goat's milk and rice milk. Liquid goat's milk is expensive, at least where I live, so we switched to the powdered form a few months ago. I don't drink milk, but my son seems to like it okay. Goat's milk products have a distinct flavor that you either love or hate; I love it in goat cheese and goat butter, but my wife hates it. Judge for yourself

Maybe this says something about the psychedelic effects of jasmine tea. First, anon_2003 thinks there are snails in the teabag. Then Graham rips anon for saying they were in the bottom of the cup, even though anon wrote that they were in the bag, not the cup. I guess this is the proverbial tempest in a teacup.

In any case, I like this jasmine tea. It's not too perfumed, and does have a smooth taste. No snails. But . . . wait! There are little green men in that teabag!

I have purchased this tea for quite a while and it is the best tea out there for Jasmine Green Tea. The taste is not overwhelming and the finish is smooth and sweet. I have never had any snails or other "non-leaf" items in my tea! Besides, if it comes as a tea bag, how can the snails be in the bottom of your cup?? Shouldn't they be in your bag? I think you should wash your cups more often, or step away from the pipe!

We stumbled upon this brand of pasta on Amazon by searching their gluten-free options. We are long time pasta lovers though recently learned our family cannot eat gluten (in wheat). So the search has been on! This blend of corn and rice it the ticket; very tasty and stands up like wheat pasta. We have cases on hand

I've reordered this Sparkling Blood Orange and Cranberry juice three times now. Clearly, it has been a winner at our house. The flavor is a very definite blood orange flavor with a slight cranberry back-up and a gentle fizz as a bonus. The juice is a beautiful dark red color that looks fantastic when served in a nice crystal glass. The next time you need a special juice to serve at a brunch, try this one. Your guests will love it

This is wonderfully unique flavored soda although a bit pricey. Just the right balance of sweet and tart along with a bit of fizz makes for a great flavor treat. We bought a case and it took us through the holidays, everyone really enjoyed them (children adults included). I would certainly keep some around the house during holidays and special occasions, but it's too expensive to replace our usual beverage of choice

Excellent taste and quality. To me, worth the price as best of show for canned tuna. I will give it six stars if the net weight is truely 7.5 oz. The only comparable quality albacore tuna we have found is also troll caught and solid pack, and sold out of Gig Harbor, WA by the "Tuna Guys".
By the way, I have no doubt that the low mercury claim is legit

Teff replaces oatmeal as a hot breakfast cereal. Teff's pretty unique, its a tiny seed. It doesn't get mushy when cooked, but does stick together. To cook it boil it in water- use about 1/2C Teff to 2 1/2 C water- to serve two or one large guy. Add some salt too, say 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon and just boil until thick. Stir so it doesn't stick to the pan. Flavor is kind of nutty but mild and its really good. Its much higher in protein and complex carbs so you can feel the difference around noon- still with you. Its a definite must have for athletes and if you can afford it everyone else. You may also like grated orange peel, nutmeg, cinnamon or for us we add toasted anise seed as well for peak flavor. We serve it with milk and a pinch of sugar. Its excellent, if you prepare any dish like this you will probably find Teff is better than all of them. Take advantage of the shipping deal when you buy two boxes

I bought this to add variety to my diet, and tried the teff pudding recipe on the back - delicious, I think. My family didn't agree, but they did like the bread I made with teff flour. Hmm...perhaps if I soaked the grain overnight first, that would make for a smoother pudding. Try the pudding, or add the grain to a mix for breakfast or as a side dish - it's healthy and it tastes good.

More difficult than oatmeal or quinoa to cook for breakfast: the small grains must be shaken apart once added to the water, and more frequent stirring required to avoid a sticky gel-like mass on the bottom of the pan. These minor annoyances aside, teff has excellent flavor and nutritional benefits, including 20% of the RDA for Iron. Great with fruits and nuts for breakfast, or as a base for vegetables in a casserole

These are VERY good healthy alternatives to regular graham crackers. The comment above that states she won't try any of the other products is TOTALLY missing out on something very good. I have purchased all of the crackers they make and love every one of them. Anyone I share them with also loves them! If you are looking for healthy crackers (without the trans fat and other nasty chemical ingredients found in almost every other cracker in the supermarket), you should certainly try these. As for the grahams not being crispy, I have to agree, sometimes they aren't as crunchy as I would like, but then again, most graham crackers are not. Try the other dr. krackers if you want a real crunch!! :

Ordered this for my mother and she loves these Graham crackers and I will order some for myself soon. I don't know the expiration date on the package as it is tough for mom to find the date. It is crunchy for her and mom is happy!

I have tried many types of canned herring but Crown Prince Natural Kipper snacks are the BEST.There is barely any liquid in the can,each can is packed full with delicious smoked herring. These kipper snacks are wild caught and low in sodium so they are a very healthy way to get your Omega 3's,high in protein too. If you are like me and don't always have to time to cook fish, this is a perfect way to enjoy the heart healthy benefits of fish

I LOVE this product as it's just the right size for me to eat for lunch or to snack on with crackers.
I had bought this product from my local grocery, but if one buys enough groceries on site the shipping is free there is usually a discount that applies so the cost was just an added benefit.
I also send these to some of our guys in Iraq as they 'keep' forever, don't require any opener, package easily, and the package is compact easy to dispose of with little room needed.
I like this smaller package so I don't have leftovers the next day.
The amount is more than adequate for me to have one sandwich with enough left to snack on later.
I prefer tuna in water instead of oil, and I have always hated having to squeeze the water out of canned tuna so this easy open package with very little liquid has been great.
Love this product and will definitely continue to buy

This is a very good price for Crystal Light Lemonade. The only place that equals it is Costco, and my nearest Costco is far away. I just don't get there often enough. The Costco price is the same as this - but you can buy just one box (instead of three). Even when my local supermarkets have a buy one / get one free deal on the regular-sized canisters; it doesn't come out to be as cheap per ounce as this is.

My husband drinks this stuff almost exclusively. I never cared for any diet drinks myself - until I married him and tasted his lemonade. It's so tart and lemony, that you can rarely taste the artificial sweetener at all! I now drink the Crystal Light Iced Tea - mixed with some brewed mint tea. I never thought I'd be a diet drink drinker - but now I am - thanks to this product

These are all of my favourite breakfast cereals. Good to eat any time, breakfast, snack, lunch, dinner, and after dinner snack.

Buying in bulk makes it possible to not have to shop so often. Each yummy box contains enough for one child or adult. Some of us even like to eat them without milk, or as a "on the go" snack. Perfect.

This huge pack of 40 total boxes will last you a while.

Normally, unsweetened puffed cereal is an eating experience best compared to munching on a styrofoam cup. But not Kashi puffed cereal. The whole grains (wheat, brown rice, spelt, sesame, buckwheat, triticale and others) are Kashi's special blend and they make for a tender-crunchy mix that has flavor. I like it so well, I eat it dry as a snack instead of nuts or chips. The different grains have different textures and density, making it an interesting cereal yet light, low in calories and healthy. It's good this comes in batches of six boxes because I certainly go through it.

This is the only Kashi product I like. It is low calorie (100), fun to eat, doesn't get soggy fast ( I like crunchy cereal, won't eat soggy )and a good out of the box snack if you're desperate. Tastes good if you like puffed cereal. Works well with my eating plan.

I lost 20 lbs. eating this as a part of WeightWatchers plan. A bit of Splenda, fruit, milk, it makes a great filling breakfast. I spend alot of time reading labels and this is one of the only cereals at HEB without a bunch of sugar. I am going to keep it in my cupboard at all times. HEB quit carrying it and instead have the Honey Kashi. So I ordered a case from Amazon! A lot cheaper and less hassle. It arrived quickly

This product is excellent in many ways. It comes with single serving bags, which is very filling without being too much at one time. I have been buying two cases per order from Amazon.com for over a year and there has never been any problem at all. These are actually healthy, great tasting and the "proper portion" bags take the worry out of eating nuts. In addition, the mixture of nuts is delicious without having to buy other kinds. The price and the packaging are excellent too

The Illy is the best commercial Italian coffe that you can find not only in the USA but in Italy too. It is pricy but it is really worth all the money that you spend on it. Illy has a smooth velvet-like taste that roll on your tongue. The smell is sooting and relaxing, but is strong enough to weak you up no matter how sleepy you feel. I highly raccomand it to everyone, because if you like coffe you can't help but love it, and if you don't like coffe, you will love Illy anyway. It's just too god.

Illy Dark Roast Pods provide a great-tasting cup of espresso with crema and without the mess of cleaning up all those grounds. The tin packaging is compact for easy storage, but I recommend keeping the opened pods in a vacuum container to maintain freshness. If you're willing to invest in two 18-pod tins, you can't beat the price on Amazon!

For a slightly different great taste and individual packaging to maintain freshness, try Espressione as an alternative, though the individual packaging requires additional storage space in your cupboard

yes, these pods are slightly larger than the regular ones, but you can make two cups (2x4oz or 1x8oz) out of 1 pod and the price is right. I use the 1-cup insert, squeeze the pod a little so the coffee gets loose inside, when I close the senseo lid, I push at the lever and lid at the same time

So I had this enormous coffeemaker and I like to have a cup of coffee before I buzz off to work. Problem: Mr. Coffee and I don't seem to see eye-to-eye when it comes to getting the grounds/water ratio right for just a cup or two in the morning. I found one of these single cup coffeemaker thingies at Target. Get this! They were offering a 6-pack of 18-count coffee pod packages for $39.99 ... and you got the machine for free! As a result of my rocky relationship with Mr. Coffee, I was easily bellying up to the bar(ista) and spending $39.99 in a month at Starbucks, so I bit. The manufacturer of the JV Pod machine I bought recommends using only JV (short for "Juan Valdez") Pod brand pods, of course. The trouble was, I had trouble finding them after the first batch I got with the machine. I bought several packs of these Melitta guys (different flavors) from Amazon to use in my JV Pod coffeemaker. Since a friend has a Melitta machine, I sprang for enough of these pods to qualify for the free Super Saver shipping and figured I'd give them to her if they didn't work for me. As it turns out, they work just fine in the JV machine and both the regular and flavored coffees, though not necessarily "gourmet" stuff, are really quite tasty. I would have no problem serving this coffee to a guest in my home

This is the Melitta Pod that I make sure is heavily stocked in my kitchen. While the others taste fine, I prefer this for the bold flavor and stronger dose of caffeine. 4 starts because of inconsistent quality - most of my pods have tasted good, but a few seem a bit stale at times

Bob's Red Mill Soy Protein Powder is a low-cost, versatile source of protein. It has negligible fat and no cholesterol, has a neutral taste and odor, and mixes well with the foods with which I have tried it. I have been using it more or less daily for approximately 1 month.

At breakfast I mix 2 tablespoons with 1-1/2 cups of milk, 1 tablespoon of nutritional yeast and 1 tablespoon of blackstrap molasses. The mixture is highly nutritious and tastes surprisingly good.

I also add 2-4 tablespoons of it to approximately 2 quarts of mixed fresh and frozen veggies that I steam for lunch most days. The protein powder takes on the taste of the veggies.

Down the road I anticipate that I will add it to beans and vegetarian chili to give additional protein to these foods also.

I read where Orville wanted to come out with a different kind of popcorn and when he marketed kettle korn, he knew what he was doing. A blend of sweet and sour coats every kernel.

This salmon jerky is definitely tasty. It has a slightly strong peppery taste to it, which I really like.
The previous reviewer was correct in thinking the jerky was a bit too dry and hard to chew. It'll take you a while to bite a piece off and chew it. My jaws were too tired to even eat a whole serving.
Nonetheless, the jerky is quite tasty so I'm not dissapointed.
These come in eight resealable pounches, each with 2 ounces of salmon jerky. I'm sure these will last a while since it'll take a while to chew them all up

This California style salmon jerky tastes great, but a little overly dry and hard to chew, in my opinion. Still it is nice to have, and it is very funny to see looks on people faces when you offer them salmon, somewhere on a trip in the middle of nowhere.

This coffee tastes great when brewed in my pod coffee maker. I especially like the packaging. Since each pod is individually wrapped, the coffee is always fresh no matter how long after I open the box. For me, the benefit of a pod coffee maker is that I can make a single cup on a weekend and then not make coffee again for another week. I was unpleasantly surprised to find that some pod coffee is not separately wrapped, which means it becomes stale rather quickly after the packages is opened. Thanks to this coffee's packaging, I can enjoy fresh coffee with every pod - not just the first one or two pods in the package

We originally purchased this to take on camping trips to replace "yucky" instant coffee. These little packets are a great substitute for that, and we now use them at home for those times we want to only make "one cup at a time" instead of making a full pot

My experience with gluten-free breads goes back over 22 years. This is the best gluten free bread I've found for toasting. It actually turns a nice shade of brown in the toaster without burning. Good flavor and consistency. I add butter, cinnamon and sugar or peanut butter to mine.. keeps very well in the fridge

I buy a case of these or the cocoa variety whenever Amazon features them on the Friday Sale -- generally about six dollars less than the listed $22.00. The 5 ounce packages are paper reinforced cylinders, easy to pack and easy to open, great for a take-along treat. (The packs don't re-close, however, so you pretty much have to devour all contents once opened.) For Christmas I made up small gift baskets using these, a coffee mug or two, and some instant cappucino.

I got in on the cookies a few weeks ago from Bahlsen that had the chocolate filling. They are wonderful cookies and at less than $1 a pack you cannot go wrong. These things were made for a quick coffee or milk dunk. Don't let them soak as the light cookie will fall apart, but a quick dip sets them up just fine! They come well packed and wrapped. Recommended highly

I RESERVE 5 STARS FOR FRESH-BAKED COOKIES. THIS 4 STAR COOKIE CONSISTS OF TWO LIGHT CRISPY WAFERS WITH A CHOCOLATEY TASTE REMINISCENT OF BROWNIES...NOT DARK CHOCOLATE... AND IN BETWEEN, A LIGHT CREAMY FILLING...NOT AT ALL LIKE THE DENSE OREO FILLING. THEY WOULD COMPLEMENT ICE CREAM NICELY. NOT TOO MANY NOW

If you've ever had as Bahlsen Hit cookies (normally a plain cookie with chocolate filling) you'll know these have to be good. A creamy center that can easily be eaten separatly by nibbling off the cookie top and bottom. A dry cookie that isn't too sweet but full of flavor.

Great for a mid-day snack. I always have a roll in my desk draw at work.

Very Very Tasty

I've been drinking Pura Vida coffee ever since I heard a recent Harvard MBA tell us of his efforts to cut out the large middleman profits in the coffee business so that the coffee growere could realise a better life. The bonus is that it is really good coffee! I look for the gourmet coffees and Pura vida is one of them. Thanks for such a good product, easily shopped for and for the chance to help "the little guy".

I first purchased this coffee because I recently decided to go a little more organic. Let me tell you, this stuff is amazing! The taste is much cleaner and fresher than Starbucks, which is what we used to use. Actually, we ran out at one point and bought a bag of Starbucks, and neither me nor my husband liked the Starbucks as we did before!

And, proceeds go to coffee-producing countries. So, you getting great coffee at a better price than Starbucks, and you are contributing back to less fortunate people in coffee-producing countries. What could be better

I had been looking for a new source of whole bean coffees with a rich taste. In this sampler I found a new favorite, the Ethiopia Sidamo. It was a nice medium-dark roast with a rich, winey flavor that I loved. The Columbian was also a nice coffee. On the other hand, the Sumatra had an almost burned taste that was very acidic. The beans were fresher than many that I buy off-the-shelf and they are definitely a better value than the Gevalia that I have been receiving. These are a full 12-ounce

Pura Vida Kilamanjaro has absolutely spoiled my wife and I to coffee. Starbuck's doesn't even match it's taste and knowing that Pura Vida does such great humanitarian work in the coffee growing countries only adds to its value. If you like bold coffee I highly recommend Pura Vida Kilamanjaro! It's now the only bean in our house

If you are looking for a premium dark roast coffee this is it. Not only are you getting a dark, full bodied coffee but it's fair-trade and organic as well. Think about it, you get an amazing cup of coffee every morning and the coffee farmer in Indonesia and Ethiopia (the sources of Cake K) are receiving a fair, living wage for their labors. One of the best if not the best coffees that I have ever drank, I recommend everyone try it once because thats all it will take for you to become hooked on it.

I just got my box of 250 from Amazon this week and already love it. It is much more like sugar than even Splenda and I have loved Splenda for years. It is not as sweet as Splenda. It lets you taste the coffee or tea flavor and not just taste sweetness. I had not realized what I have been missing. I also noticed that after my morning coffee I feel much more satisfied for a longer time. I feel good that it is all natural...I get enough chemicals and over processed foods..who needs more? Try it you will not be disappointed. It will open a whole new world of flavor to you

I just received my box of Sun Crystals and I can not rave enough about this product. I have never tasted a low calorie sweetener that is as close to the flavor of sugar in my life. I am a big time Splenda fan, but this has a smoother taste to it...although not quite as powerful as Splenda. I use 2 packets in a coffee normally and it is the perfect amount of sweetness without being overpowering. Using one packet in tea is just enough sweetness to take the bite off the stronger teas, but not ruin the flavor of high end teas.

Being all natural, I feel like it must be healthier for me and my family than other low calories sweeteners. This is the only one I actually feel ok giving to my children. I recommend this product highly to anyone who uses low calories sweetener.

Don't forget to type in the $5 discount code

I received a sample of Sun Crystals, tried it and loved it. I have ordered a container of 250 packets from Amazon. I hope that it becomes available in our local grocery stores soon. I just wanted everyone to know that the taste is so much like full-calorie sugar that it is amazing even though there are only 4 calories per packet! The consistency is also just like full-calorie sugar. There is no artificial aftertaste like some of the other low-calorie sweeteners as it is all natural. I highly recommend this new product.

I purchased this item from Amazon and expected 6 boxes of 20 bags. I got one box of 20 bags. I complained. When the man I spoke to said they would just send it again, I was thinking that they would send me 5 boxes, but they sent me 1 box in the second order. I guess this is just one box of 20 tea bags for the price. I do really like the tea though. It makes excellent iced tea and hot tea. So if you want 1 box for the price, puchase this item.

This is the best tasting shortbread cookie in my book.
Since I am unable to eat wheat it is a rare find to discover an excellent cookie...or any other wheat-free product. After I purchased my first box at a local health food store, I went online to see where I could buy more. I now purchase these cookies in bulk...at 3-4 cases at once...and they stay fresh until the next order.

Thank you Pamela...wherever you are!

These will satisfy the craving for gingerbread. When you bite into them, you'll immediately know you're in for a treat. The eating experience alone hits the reward center of the brain. Soft, dense and chewy describe the cookie's character. The rich flavor of molasses provides depth to the tasting experience. Shredded Ginger gives the cookie a distinct texture and kick to the palate. One cookie can satisfy the worst craving for carbs. All the Pamela cookies are delicious, but this one could be a dessert all on its own

If you do not eat gluten, and you love peanut butter cookies, you HAVE to try these cookies! They are so superly delicious! They are somewhat crumbly in the box, and at least one cookie in every box will be broken into pieces. But they are so good you will not even care! Definitely try them, you'll love them

Guys, you really should get these little green spirulina-ginseng balls! My two college kids practically beg to get them! :-) My husband and I also love to have a few with us on trips. Great snacks. Great taste compared to a lot of healthfood snacks. Clean and green and healthy for you!

We actually put BETTY LOU'S SPIRULINA-GINSENG BALLS in our Christmas Stockings this year and everyone cheered!

Do yourself a favor. Buy the big canister. They are tons cheaper this way and you won't run out as fast

I just bought a box since its so much cheaper than getting single ones, usually 1$ + each. 1. they are healthy and vegan, 2. i leave a box of em at work for breakfast, quick and easy. 3. the taste is on the good level compared to healthy snack bars, taste like nuts and rasins, n a bit of the green stuff, but its fine if u usually eat things like this. It is moist n chewy. Overall, I like the taste and will buy more

Finding a quick, nutritious, satisfying vegan treat is no small feat! This is it...I always have an emergency ginseng ball in my purse, just in case I get the munchies when I'm out and about in the big, bad junk food world we live in. And THIS is the way to buy them! Less than HALF of what Whole Foods charges...
I shouldn't be telling you all this...I never want amazon to be "sold out" when I come looking for my ginseng ball fix. Never mind. They're awful. Don't buy them

I bought these because I have a corn allergy and wanted to substitute them for the LA Weightloss bars that list corn syrup as the first ingredient. I was pleasantly surprised that they were pretty tasty! My favorites are actually the Fudgie Filberts that taste similar to a Little Debbie brownie if Little Debbie's were diet. Following that I would say Almond and Coconut are tied for second. Third is the Peanut Butter which is the highest in protein but not as good as the others. My husband didn't like any of them but could tolerate the one I liked least, Peanut Butter. Over all I think these are great as a healthy snack for people with food allergies or other dietary restrictions. I think I would have picked a different name than Betty Lou's Nut Butter Balls. Nut Butter Balls doesn't sound as appetizing as what they actually are!! Nut Butter Balls.....Mmmmmm

I've loved gummi bears since I was a kid, and back then I didn't care so much if they were hard to chew, like Haribo's brand. These are great gummi bears, as they are easy to chew and taste sweet but not over whelmingly. I eat them all the time at work, if they are available. I love them and haven't been able to find them in the stores around here, so I'm glad that Amazon has made them available.

I love these Krackers and they were great but I have to say that the date on the tag was from Oct. I bought them in December. I still ate them and they tasted just the same.

I've only tried the sunflower cheese crackers - I stumbled upon them in an organic food store - and I'm addicted. As a vegetarian, sometimes I struggle to find healthy snacks, but these are great. One cracker is about the size of a slice of bread, but much more dense (and filling). They're very crunchy and flavorful.Since they're also USDA Organic, you can eat them with a good conscience, knowing that your support of organic products means they're healthier for you, healthier for the environment and healthier for the farmers.
Though a bit pricy, I highly recommend them

I have tried this flavor along with the Klassic 3-seed, and the Seeded Spelt and I have loved everyone of them. I find that they are a healthy snack to pair with yogart (for dipping) or with brie cheese and some fruit. I cannot wait to try the Seedlander, Muesli, and the Graham although I have not been able to find those in any local stores

These cookies are nothing like the ones I ate when I was 11, at the lunch table while sitting next to Nancy. These Double Chocolate Chunk cookies are exquisitely kind to the senses, but bring no memory of my fifth grade dream girl. Her pleasant eyes would assuage a long morning's pain in Miss Charminker's class, but it was the meting of her chocolate chip cookies that met my heart.

Betty Crocker's cookies are worth sharing too, all of these years later. Made in the oven, they are almost like homemade, almost like the ones Nancy's mom made. Twelve come in the bag if you bake them right. The subtle, bright sweet aroma tinctured with the bold, yet faint milk chocolate scent, captured in a classic cookie enraptured my senses, as they will yours. But, still, the crusty stale, brown-white cookies Nancy shared with me in my youth caused me to smile far more, with a deeper gladdening. She'd lift them gingerly from her brown bag, place one precisely in front of me, on the table, and one in from of her, on the table. She would then proceed to excavate the treasures within, and side-by-side we would eat our lunches until the bell rang.

If you don't know Nancy or her equal, then I suggest you buy the Betty Crocker cookies. They'll taste better than most of the cookies you'll've eaten, and maybe you'll sit next to someone nice at lunch to share them with. Be sure to share. If you do, she might sit next to you tomorrow

Flavor wise it is definetly a 5 star. I do not think you can give a product bad reviews just because someone made a mistake in the shipping department. You have to rate the coffee, not the shipping of the coffee, and it gets a top rate in my book

Unlike the other reviewer, I received all 12 of the 18 count packs.
The pods do fit in my Senseo machine and are as good-tasting -- which is not saying much, they're all quite weak -- as the Senseo pods

No kidding! This cereal is fabulous and I NEVER buy anything that says "organic" on it. I initially picked this cereal up because I lost about 20 pounds on Weight Watchers last year and I am very careful about total calories versus grams of fiber. I decided to try a box and loved it immediately. My husband even likes it! He swears that it tastes just like Wheaties but I think it is much better :) I save over a dollar a box buy getting it on Amazon and I highly recommend it to everybody

We eat a lot of Orville Redenbacher Natural Light Popcorn--it is lightly salted, not full of butter, etc., taste great, and has to be better for us than most other popcorns on the market. Much easier to fix than popping the old time way. The only local store that carried it switched to some off brand popcorn. We were so pleased when we found it at Amazon.com--got it at a good price--and had free shipping. Thank you Amazon!

Better than Wolff's Kasha. I grew up eating Kasha and it is an easy to prepare healthy meal. Bob's Red Mill has a great selection of all things GRAIN. If you are ever in the Portland area you should check out the store/restaurant. Great vegetarian selections as well as meat eater stuff.

Some of the other Yogi green teas, like the one with echinacea, taste kind of bad to me, but I really like the antioxidant one. Not sure if it's actually anti-aging...that's a pretty bold claim...but it's nice! Mildly caffeinated so it gives me some energy without making me wired. And it's good plain or with milk or even milk and sugar, if you want to make it more like a dessert

Subtle, sweet taste of lemongrass. It's alot cheaper to buy it here than at the grocery store where it costs $5+. I drink about 5 cups a day..

This penne pasta is great. Tastes as good, or better, than most wheat pastas. Other non-celiac people can't tell it's gluten-free.

I will most likely buy from this brand again; they are good and pretty cheap here on Amazon

This is a great product at a great price. The light, amber colored nectar reminds me of butterscotch and the darker variety is more like maple syrup. Both blend easily in liquids and taste great on cream of rice cereal. It's low on the glycemic index and doesn't require much

Never heard of it. Did some research and decided to try it. Extremely satisfied with my choice! I went for the "Light" version since my research mentioned that it was the one with no strong after-taste. Much better, natural choice than artificial sweeteners. Does have calories, but the glycemic index response is very good; translation: it doesn't give you that "sugar rush". I like things fairly sweet, so I use 2-3 teaspoons per cup of coffee. You may need less. DEFINITELY get the 12 pack!!! Best value and you'll be amazed at how much you start using it!

I could not believe how good this nectar tastes. I was expecting it to have an aftertaste or be bitter, like most artificial sweeteners. I was pleasantly surprised at first taste. I then had my husband taste it because he doesn't like artificial sweeteners, and he loved it, too! It will come in handy on the Perricone Weight Loss diet, because of it's low glycemic index. The price for the case here on Amazon is really good, too, so I'm stocking up.

If you are a diabetic, this is the best tasting sweetener with the lowest glycemic index out there right now

My search for a non-bitter (stevia), non-artificial, non-refined sugar sweetner is over at last! I hesitated to buy this because of the requirement to buy 12. Boy, am I glad I did buy the whole box! We use this in everything, including baking, and find that it has a really good taste. Most sweetners ruin the taste of our fine coffees, but the agave simply supplies sweetness. We'll be trying the amber agave next in hopes of a heartier sweetness for winter baked goods

Have you ever described a food as tasting "healthy" when you mean it tastes so bad it must be good for you? Fear not! It is pleasantly adaptable to use with any fruit on hand. I honestly will say, though, that it does have an earthy quality. It may take the uninitiated some getting acquainted with--just a little! If trying for the first time, I heartily recommend trying the Hemp Goddess Supreme recipe on the jar's label. Surprisingly palatable! You'll be proud to have done something nourishing and healthy for yourself. Easy to digest. The powder is indeed rather coarse. When you find it'll tide you over very well until your next meal, you won't mind. Including this in one's eating habits can only be an addition for the positive

I was having blood sugar spikes and after adding Nutiva's hemp protein to my smoothies, I can cruise for a good 3 hours without hunger or spiking. This has been a godsend. I chose Nutiva because a few die-hard friends will use nothing else. Plus I am a Californian, and like that it's made here. I tried a few other products over the months and keep coming back to Nutiva. I just like it best, and Organic is really important to me.

This is my favorite gluten free cereal hands down. Let's face it- it isn't nutritious. This is not a health cereal. But thank goodness! It also won't send you in absolute sugar shock, either- and I love the peanut butter flavor. It's a good light snack for breakfast- and I bet it would be good in recipes too.

I love this cereal! I'm a 30 year old cereal lover and this stuff is great. I can't take the real sweet stuff like I used to, and with only 6 grams of sugar per serving (plus some fiber!), I often eat two bowls at a time as a "treat"! Don't let the nutrition label fool you - it's great tasting stuff. Goes awesome with sliced banana and holds up very well in milk

I have been an avid senseo fan for about a year. However, I was getting a bit bored drinking the same Dark Roast every morning (I found the other flavors too mild). So I was very happy when I saw the new flavors (Sumatra, Colombia, Kenya and Brazil). After trying all of them, this is my close second favorite

We were glad to see that Amazon started carrying this Colombia Blend. After discovering it in Europe and bringing several pacakges over, we later had some shipped to us from family in Belgium.
This has a good strong taste and I particularly like it in the morning.
Recommended for any Senseo lover tired of the regular blends found in the retails stores

At last, a product where I have complete control over what ingredients I can use and have versatility of what shakes/drinks I make. No need to worry about artificial ingredients and sweetners. You can make just about any concoction with this protein powder, and make it 100% natural!

Bottom line, if you want to control what you put in your body, you must get this!

I love licorice but cant eat wheat, which is in most licorice candies, so I was soooooo happy to find this! I would buy again. I bought a "case" and it won't be going to waste! Besides, licorice is good for circulation and better than other candies...
P.S. Not too sweet either! Not bland, definitely, but I liked its reasonable sweetness

I don't like water. I know I'm supposed to drink it, but I just don't like it. I have tried most of the powdered drink mixes and this is the only one that I really like. I actually crave it. I drink more water now than at any time in my life because it tastes good. I honestly can't believe that this is a diet drink. Zero carbs, 5 calories, and great taste, what more could you want?

I am a huge fan of Ruth's Hemp Protein Powders, in this blend with Flax and Maca you get a ton of great nutrients and the boost of Maca (which is a good energy source). I use this with 10oz of almond milk, 5-6 frozen strawberries and a 1/2 frozen banana (Blended up in my Vitamix). The only thing about this powder is that it does have a distinct taste, I like it but some may not. If you do find you like the taste, you'll be hard pressed to find a better protein powder on the market!

At first I was leery about buying food, because there was no nututritional info in the description. These have 11 carbs and 1 gram of prorein, just like the brand in my supermarket. They are made with organic rice and taste great.

I saved a whole $1 per bag on these and with Amazon Prime, shiping was free! Needless to say, I reordered when the first case was gone

I am low carb for life due to health issues. The one thing that I miss most in my low carb life style is crispy,crunch. These crackers are amazing. They are so crunchy and taste fantastic and while they would not work on a very low carb diet, they work just fine as an occasional "treat" in a low carb life style. They have a very nutty flavor and you can actually see the various seeds they contain, in other words, they are real, whole grain crackers. I am hooked

The Dr. Kracker Flatbread, Seed Spelt are not only healthy, but taste great and are very crunchy. I gave some to my daughter and she liked them enough to buy herself a case. Also, these crackers are very filling relative to the amount of carbohydrates they contain. Amazon sells these for much less than the health food stores so the price is amazing

When I lived on the border of England and Wales, I had a roommate from Copenhagen Denmark, and he got some of this in his Christmas goodie basket from his Mom. At first it is a shock to the system, and I was the only American in the house that didn't spit it out. Soon I was bugging him to get his Mom to send more. It is a testament to the impression that it made that 25 years later I checked Amazon to see if I could get it here.

Before I got home my wife and kids had gotten into the box and tried it. They didn't try a second piece. I however after the initial shock of the first piece, remembered why I liked it. And although this case will probably last me a long time, I do rather enjoy the flavor. But be warned the flavor is HEAVY on the salt and very light on the sweet. Not for the low sodium diet alt all. But it is a treat that you can enjoy without emptying the whole container in a sitting and wonder where it went. So... if you are adventurous, or if you remember the taste from your European adventures, try this exotic treat.

Only reason this item gets a 4 is because of the price. I can get this for $1.69 in my local store - and even cheaper when I have coupons (can't do that with amazon!). Otherwise, my family loves this version of organic mac 'n cheese (wish they made the larger size!). My 7 yr old doesn't mind the little green flecks - he knows they are the "special" tasty ingredient and now isn't as squeemish to see green bits in other items

This is a tasty product, unlike some of the gluten-free foods that I have tried. It is very crunchy with lots of fruit and nuts. It has plenty of calories, but I use it as a topping for other, less-tasty cereals, e.g. bran flakes or some of the high-fiber cereals that remind me of twigs and leaves. I will definitely be ordering more in the future

After having Illy at the espresso bars in Italy, well, no other espresso tasted good to me! Illy tastes great made in a good pump espresso machine. It also tastes great made in a steam espresso machine (e.g., a low end Krups) and a Moka (an Italian poor-man's espresso maker). The rich flavor isn't burnt tasting like many espresso roasts. Everyone I've made an Illy espresso for raves over the flavor compard to espresso from chain coffee stores.

A tip when brewing espresso using a steam espresso machine: Shut off the valve before any steaem comes through the coffee. The high temperature steam will leach unwanted flavors into the coffee.

I used to buy Illy at the local stores, but the prices were over $11 per can, sometimes $12. I was happy to see Amazon start carrying it at an even lower price.

If you can't find Illy a good runner-up is Lavazza, however, its flavor isn't as intense as Illy

I was already a fan of Numi's Morning Rise and Monkey King Jasmine teas, but their Gunpowder Green tea is an absolute standout. Sure, it's in a teabag, but you can see that there is 'real' tea in there, not just tea dust. You will not be disappointed with this tea

I became a fan of green tea when my Navy duties took me to Japan and Korea. In Japan, particularly, I learned a little about the differences in green teas (shade-grown, finely ground, and so on). Since returning to my land-locked home in the Rockies, the only good green tea I've been able to get my hands on has been through mail order. (If you're drinking Lipton brand green tea and have judged green tea accordingly, you really are missing out...)

This is the first green tea in a bag (as opposed to loose leaf) that really reminds me of the good teas I had in Japan. At work, I don't make time to pre-heat my tea pot and my tea cups and brew it "properly," so I really appreciate a delicious tea in the convenience of a bag, and if you like green tea, I'm certain you'll like this one!

*****
Temple of Heaven Gunpowder Green Tea is a premium Numi tea. It is a low-caffeine green tea, is certified organic, and is kosher.

On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "Our whole leaf Temple of Heaven - Gunpowder Green Tea is gently steamed within hours of being plucked, then skillfully hand rolled into small tight pearls. This process preserves its delicate flavor and aroma far longer than other green teas. Steeped in hot water, the leaves unfurl, releasing a well-rounded, full-bodied flavor. Rich in fluoride, calcium, and anti-oxidants - and with very little caffeine - this is a perfect choice to greet the evening."

The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love green tea, or want a green tea that you can drink in the evening, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.

When I got two 25 packs for $4 with free shipping, I couldn't say no. I'd be losing money if I didn't buy them. Anyways, they are pretty good, slight hazelnut filling. Not overly sweet like Oroes

Please realize that these are not cookies as much as crackers. They have a sweet taste, but don't expect an oreo as the taste of hazelnut is much more subtle than other tastes.

Overall, excellent - I very much enjoyed them

These cookies normally cost $1.50 to $2.00 per package in food specialty stores. I love them but I resisted when I was shopping for Christmas. BUT, when I saw them for 25 packages for $12.00 with free shipping - I caved. OK- they are not low fat but one splurge a year won't kill us.

I have been using Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil since December. I used to buy it at the heatlh food store by my home, however after receiving the great deal on Amazon I will continue to buy it here. Since I have been using Nutiva Coconut Oil my skin is glowing and I feel better all over. I use it as a daily moisturizer on my skin after my showers and I drink 2 tablespoons daily. I have a very hardy, healthy appetite and eat alot. For the amount of food I eat I should weigh more than I do. I believe that the Coconut Oil helps you maintain a healthy weight. I am so glad I found out about Coconut Oil and I will continue to use it forever. Thank you

I have been studying the benefits of coconut oil for some time. I tried several different brands but when I opened a jar of the Nutiva I knew that I had found what I was looking for. Absolutely the freshest most wonderful organic virgin coconut oil on the planet.

I substituted the butter and/or vegetable oil in several recipes with the Nutiva coconut oil and achieved incredible results. I even fried eggs in it last night and they were GREAT! I will never fry with any other oil again. I also use it as a spread on toast, bagels, and muffins.

AAAAA+++++ Try it, you'll love it!

Amazon delivered exactly what I ordered and on time. For me, Nutiva VCO is a great alternative to unhealthy cooking oils. If we compare short-chain fatty acids (such as the lauric chains in coconut oil) which are metabolized within the mitochondria of cells, versus longer chain-bearing oils which require conjugation and transport to the liver, I think VCO must be healthier for me overall. Nutiva also tastes good and frankly people, it's a great lotion. Yes, it takes a few minutes to sink in, but once it does, you have soft skin.

Virgin coconut oil is great for your health and taste buds.
I tried several different brands. I like this one a lot.
I am not a big fan of coconut flavor, but this one smells different. It's preasant.

Just 54-ounce jar was too big. I didn't have a sense of US unit. I recommend smaller jars if you don't bake often.

You'll enjoy this oil as a substitution of butter and also you can use as your natural skin cream

Another reviewer called this a "genetically engineered horror" (and the same review gave high ratings to Poptarts!- not that they taste bad, but they are pretty high in sugar and artificial stuff). I believe the name of the company is "Just Tomatoes" with the name of the product being "Just Rasberries". Freeze dried fruit is hardly a genetically engineered horror. It is JUST RASBERRIES-nothing else added and very good in taste and very healthy. I like the rasberries and the strawberries best. I have used them in my cereal, as a snack out of the box, in yougurt and in smoothies. If you like to have certain fruits when they are not in season and don't care for frozen, these will fit the bill

The product didn't taste like your typical brownie, but it was very chocolatey and very tastey. The consistency was rather dense and chewy, as opposed to cake-like. Wholesome ingredients and being a healthy alternative to typical junk food are what make Pure Chocolate Brownie Bars a four star product. This is more like a health food brownie. If I can eat healthy brownies, all the better! I plan to purchase more

This bar is the closest thing I've ever experienced to eating a brownie fresh from the oven in a packaged food. I have no idea how the folks at Pure Bar managed to make a chocolate bar that tastes so much like baked goods, using only raw and living ingredients, but it's wonderful that they have, and I mean to buy several more cases. Any of the store bought brownies you've had won't satisfy you like this will - Entemanns and Hostess are not nearly as delicious and warm-tasting, and the health food and energy bars I've had that are chocolate flavored always end up tasting like wheat germ or oats. It's easy to carry, one bar fills me up, and as a chocolate fan, I am happy to see that Pure Bar uses raw cacao powder - the real deal, and not carob chocolate substitutes. You can definitely taste the difference. This particular Pure Bar product makes for the best tasting snackfood or dessert I've ever eaten out of a wrapper, and unless you're on a completely raw vegan diet, it's going to be better for you than whatever meal you ate just beforehand! If you like chocolate like I do, you're going to love this. It's a soft, gooey brownie, pure and simple, walnuts and all

I love ESE pods. I know some coffee snobs disagree, but I'll take 90% of the taste for 10% of the work any day. As for pods, I've had Starbucks, Illy, and Espressione Arabica. I like the Espressione the best. I lived in Italy for 3 years and hit the coffee bars daily - I know what I like in espresso. The Starbucks was a bit too rough, too American tasting. Suprisingly, though, the Starbucks pods tasted just like an espresso at one of their stores. Very consistent. The Illy is too smooth. It goes well with food, and after dinner, but I tend to take my espresso at breakfast, and prefer a bold, smooth taste. The Espressione Arabica achieves just that. I'll be buying it again for my every day use

These pods have got to be the best invention yet. They are compact, extremely easy to use is the best solution to making several very quick cups of coffee.

Fresh ground coffee is nice, but there is virtually no mess with these pods. The crema is just as good as ground coffee these can be used in a pod holder as well as a one cup filter basket.
What more could a person want?!

I have enjoyed those pods for more than a year with my Frances Frances Espresso machine, but today I am a little bit concerned about the fact that your price went from $37.99 last month to $60.00 today... Why? The advantage of buying 150 pods at once was to cut down on the price, if it is the same price or more expensive than other stores, do we still have a reason to purchase them from Amazon? Please enlighten me! I would be very sorry to have to go elsewhere. Thanks

I use the regular Sleepytime frequently in the evenings, but on those nights when you need a little something extra, this stuff is amazing. Its very nice when travelling and you are having a hard time sleeping in a strange bed. I don't like taking medications (no Lunestra for me) but with this, don't need to.

I've had difficulty falling asleep since my college days. Once I entered my mid-30's the insomnia became more frequent. Melatonin and valerian pills did not work unless taken at levels that left me with a morning hangover effect. L-Tryptophan, 5-HTP, and GABA were ineffective. I have also tried numerous prescription (sleep is necessary to get through nursing school) and OTC medications that are used to treat insomnia. Most left me with a headache or excessive daytime sleepiness (zombie mode). I first tried Sleepytime Extra (Sleepytime and other chamomile teas do not work for me)about 6 weeks ago, and each time I drink it I become sleepy within 15 minutes. Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime Extra works like a charm! The 25mg of Valerian root works synergistically with the chamomile and tilia estrella. I'm stocking up before the FDA comes down on valerian like it did kava kava. I also recommend 30-60 minutes of sunlight in a.m. hours, because many people are unaware that they have DSPS (Delayed Sleep Phase Insomnia)

I use to take valarian root pill before I went to bed, but always felt it was a little too sedating. With this tea, it's a lot milder (the differance is like a Lullaby vs. a sledge hammer). It also has a nice aroma, bouquet, and flavor. I like to mix this with blueberry, or (when I'm under the weather) Echenacia tea (Celestials wellness tea)

If you love lemons and even if you don't think you do- you will love this drink! It is so crisp and refreshing chilled. Yes, it has sugar, but what fruit juice or fruit for that matter doesn't? If you don't drink soda like me and are kinda burnt on water- try essn's juices. Lemon and a little vodka make a great cocktail, too. They're a little pricey, but quality products usually are. It's also great to get it delivered to my door and save the trip to the store

These are great snacks for traveling, such as, by airplane or car. The cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker. The cracker is less messy than a cookie which can break apart and crumble; and for this reason a preferred treat.

The texture is comparable to a medium crunchy chip and very light to eat. The first response by most people when eating the cracker for the first time is, "Humm these are good!" This is a pleasant response and these crackers will probably be a big success over time

My husband never cared much for my homemade biscuits. I didn't make them often enough to really get it right like my mother and grandmother used to do. Then I tried the Betty Crocker Bisquick Mix and WOW what a difference it made. We like the rolled method better than the drop, but either way these are easy, quick and consistently great biscuits. As good a true southern biscuit as even my grandmother used to make! My husband is now a very happy man when I make his favorite sausage gravy biscuits breakfast

This is worth trying. I enjoy this when I need chocolate or a desert and haven't had time to bake. It's yummy alone or dunked in coffee. It is more dense than traditional wheat Biscotti so it did take eating two or three before I fully enjoyed having this as a desert or treat option. I give this ready made sweet treat a thumbs up for the gluten intolerant

I have been a big fan of Celestial Seasonings since the 1980s, when a friend drank the different blends and I tried one. My husband drinks this faithfully every night, and I sometimes drink some of his. I do have one complaint, though small: when I drink a full cup, it sends me to the bathroom a couple of times in the night.

I also notice that it does not interfere with my or my husband's medications; that is a big concern among alot of people and medical community. Everyone reacts differently, I know; if you want to buy one box and try a few drinks of it each night or every other night, if you are on prescriptions like we are(we are only baby boomers,not old people), I would do it that way.

In a previous review from someone who sweetens it, I think that would ruin the whole taste and aroma of the SleepyTime. Give it time and it will grow on you

Ah, it's a definite American story - in 1969 friends Mo Siegel and Wyck Hay of Colorado began selling the herbal teas that they had previously only made for themselves. From such small beginnings came that famous tea company - Celestial Seasonings.

Among Celestial Seasonings' many products is Sleepytime, an herbal infusion that has such a wonderfully different taste that I have been able to win my wife over to it, and she does not consider herself to be a tea drinker. Many are the evenings when I will brew up some Sleepytime to go along with my famous spiced bread!

Anyway, Sleepytime is largely a mixture of chamomile and spearmint, which produces a healthy drink that has a wonderful aroma and taste. I'm sure that I cannot adequately describe the taste - it doesn't taste like anything you've ever tried before, but its seductive flavors will win you over.

If I could make one suggestion to Celestial Seasonings, it would be to change the name to something else. I've had friends refuse to try it, afraid that the tea will make them feel drowsy. You can buy Sleepytime with Valerian root, which definitely promotes sleepiness, but the regular product is just a pleasant herbal drink. I suppose it's called Sleepytime because its fresh spearmint tastes very good late in the evening, and its natural lack of caffeine means that it won't keep you awake. But, this is a wonderful product that tastes great at any time of the day!

By the way, it also makes a unique, zingy iced tea

Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach. Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.

Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds. The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect. Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds. Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache. Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.

Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.

Quote from the box:

"Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation." Oscar Wilde

We were glad to see that Amazon started carrying this Kenya Blend. After discovering it in Europe and bringing several pacakges over, we later had some shipped to us from family in Belgium.
This has a nice subtle yet defined taste and I particularly like it in the afternoon with a cookie (covered in Belgian chocolate!) or biscotti.
Recommended for any Senseo lover tired of the regular blends found in the retails stores

This blend lives up to its description of dark, robust and strong.
It has a slight bitter aftertaste that makes me want to go one or two blends "lighter", but will appeal to those seeking their classic morning beverage " strong and jolting"

I actually drink this cold. I brew an entire pitcher of it (hot) and then put it in the fridge to enjoy as a cold beverage. This tea has a nice mango (not overpowering) flavor and is both refreshing and crisp. I have yet to try a Bentley's tea that I haven't enjoyed, so I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this flavor, or Bentley's in general! Good Stuff

If you like a thin crust pizza, these will work for you! They hold the toppings well, and taste great. I tried (and failed) many times to make my own pizza crust. This is worth the price, if you must have pizza. I froze the other pizza shells, and they always turn out great. (Just sit out thaw for about 30 mins before adding toppsing cooking.

These are high-quality pilchard sardines wild-caught from Morocco and contain 2g of heart-healthy Omega-3 fatty acids per can. They are boneless and skinless and ready-to-eat. My favorite way of eating sardines is crushed with some extra virgin olive oil and hot sauce (Jamaican pickapeppa sauce is ideal), on top of crackers. Buying a whole case of 25 cans is much more economical than buying individual cans of comparable quality at our local supermarket. We're very happy that Amazon sells these sardines

Be aware, the list of ingredients contains nether pomegranate or blackberry. I am also not sure putting amino acids in a drink is such a grand idea. We get all amino acids we need from proteins, anyway.

In my opinion, this soda does not taste very natural. However, it does appear to be a healthier alternative to regular sugar-loaded carbonated drinks.

IN A NUTSHELL:

Everything that one could want in a boxed 'Macaroni Cheese' meal is in this excellent product from 'Annie's Homegrown'. Its ingredients are 'Certified Organic', with real cheese and whole wheat pasta. The rusult is a very healthy fast-food that tastes significantly better, creamier, richer and more satisfying than its processed counterpart and WITHOUT COSTING THAT MUCH MORE

best of the organic mac ' n cheese products. Even my teenage son loves it and asks for me to buy this brand. We usually get the one with Wisconsin yellow cheddar, but this one is very good also

This is fast food that tastes great. It really is pretty close to the real thing and tastes like "comfort food". The noodles aren't mushy. The cheese sauce is creamy flavorful. I like to add some extra cheese. I also add veggies or a can of tuna now then. Makes for a very quick meal. The organic and non-organic varieties taste exactly the same.

Great tasting organic product! I have been on a somewhat organic diet since I was a child. My parents always had an organic garden and now I have one. My son also loves organic food and this was a great alterative to regular store brands.

Adding organic sour cream or extra cheese to it just enhances the taste. Amazon is a great way to purchase this product if you do not have a Fresh Market or a health food store in your area.

Whether you call it sauce or gravy or something else, the liquid background for the steak and vegetables is exceptional. A cut above some homecooked stews, this steak stew is in a class by itself compared to other prepared stews. I will be ordering this again

We've been looking for a good French Roast that is also Fair Trade and preferably Organic. But the others we have tried have either not tasted as we expect (one was even chocolaty--not what we want in a French Roast) or just way too expensive. This one tastes like a good French Roast coffee should, and it is even less expensive that the Starbucks I had been buying at Costco. All that, and organic too! We finally found the coffee we've been looking for

I had been getting the Starbucks French Roast coffee and enjoying it quite a bit. However, I decided I would switch to organic coffe to avoid the unnatural stuff. I must say I was not disappointed! When I opened the package of coffee I found the beans fresh and oily. Upon grinding and brewing them I found my tongue in a tastey coffe wonderland. I'm hooked

Don't be fooled this is not you average Starbucks French Roast. The roast is darker and the beans are oiler. The roast is a little on the dark side for me but this is still good coffee.

I have used it for drip and stove top espresso and it is fine for both. As someone else mentioned the oily nature of the beans prevents them from free flowing through a burr grinder.

One strange thing is that there is no date on the bags. No expiration date. No roast date. In fact there is no printed code or lot. Who knows how old it is? It is good that these purged bags do a good job of keeping coffee fresh while sealed.

No can here just the usual coffee bag

I love the flavor of this French Roast, which isn't always what I go for, but the beans are so oily, they don't grind well in my burr grinder. I've found that with other French Roast beans too, but none as difficult as these. Maybe that's why they taste better than other French Roasts. Overall, great, high quality coffee

I bought this initially based only on its price since it worked out to a little over 5 dollars a pound. Since I bought it the first time it has risen in price twice and is now about seven dollars a pound. Still a good deal with free shipping but I can buy bulk boutique coffee for about 8 dollars a pound locally. As a result Amazon may lose a customer if they keep raising the price.
However it is an exceptional french roast much better than Starbucks product. Delivery has been fast and painless.

Besides espresso roast beans, french roast beans are my favorite. Rocamojo does not disappoint. I love opening a new bag of this coffee and smelling those beans and the way my whole house smells when I brew with them. These are dark, oily beans. These beans mean business. The coffee tastes as good as it smells and makes a great dark rich strong tasting coffee with that beautiful french roast after taste that lasts on your palette the whole day.

You have to like dark roast coffees though to like these beans. Just like you wouldn't order an IPA if you like Miller Lite. These are the IPA of coffee beans. Yum!

When people tell me "it tastes like the coffee shop"...I guess that's the ultimate critique. Funny thing is I agree with them. Great coffee ROCK A MOJO!! Looks like they varnish the beans they are so dark and shiny.

I originally bought these for my kids but they didn't seem to like it so I started eating them. They are delicious and only 70 calories a bag. They make a perfect snack and it keeps me away from cookies, candies and other desserts. Yes, they are salted but are nowhere near as salty as potato chips or cheetoes.

I'd been ordering these for my family but decided to put a case out at my son's 6th birthday party. The kids gobbled them up and the moms came running to me in droves to ask where I got them. No one had a problem with the salt and the mom's liked the flavor as much as their kids. Buy these for your next party and you will be everyone's hero

This is some amazing sweet corn. It's dried but also very light and airy, and it really does taste like sweet corn and is a great snack. Why only 4 stars? One is that they put salt on it for some reason, which really detracts from the overall taste - if they'd leave out the salt and maybe tell to that you can add some to taste (and neither of us would add any, it doesn't need it), they'd have a real winner. The second is that you have to buy a case quantity, and while it's a very tasty snack, it's going to take a long time, and waste a lot of cabinet space, to get through 24 packs of it - especialy with the salt content.

It is a shame someone ruined the star rating on this product with a shipping complaint. We have bought the Supper Nutty and Crisp n' Crunchy Golden temple granola flavors also. All are great, but this one is by far the best. My husband absolutely loves it, he can't get enough. It is like a traditional granola, with a good crunch, but it isn't too sweet, which is nice. It is also one of the few brands without processed sugars. I will be ordering this one again.

Note, the ingredients listed on Amazon are incorrect. The first ingredient is organic rolled oats, not organic rolled wheat. At least when we purchased a month ago, this is a wheat-free, soy-free, vegan cereal (aside from potential cross-contamination). Unless it changed within the month since our purchase for some strange reason

For anyone who needs a shelf-stable, quick lunch option, this is the one! The soup is delicious and the prep couldn't be easier, plus I love that you can prepare and eat it right in the bowl. I always make sure I have a few of these in my desk drawer at work, so I never have an "I forgot my lunch" issue, and the portion is big enough to actually constitute a full meal (for lunch anyway). I love the Udon flavor, and my husband swears by the Miso

I've had miso soups at various restaurants and this is actually really good. I love the fact they are environmentally concerned with their products. I'll buy their products just knowing they care so much about how much we have to throw away, so it's biodegradable. Only thing I'm not crazy about is the noodles, I would have preferred a thinner noodle, only because it's so bulky, and not really typical of Asian dish

Authenic but a little bland for me. I add Ponzu sauce to taste and make sure it gets really HOT in the micriwave. If steaming when you take it out, it tastes better. Pre Rinsing the noodles (as directed) is nonsense. Just cover them with good clean water (I never use TAP) stir in the sauce and toppings and nuke it about 90 seconds, uncovered. Stir and serve. It had everyone in MY OFFICE drooling with questions! Best price is on Amazon, just order 2 so you don't pay shipping.

I've tried several of the Annie Chun flavors, and I liked most of them, but the Kimchi soup is just unbelievably delicious! This is the BEST packaged soup product of any kind that I have ever tried, and I usually dislike canned or packaged soup products. This is even better than my favorite canned Brunswick Stew that I have loved for so long!

It is moderately spicy, but if you don't mind a bit if spice, this one is just too good to pass up. I could practically live off of this stuff!

Thank you, Annie Chun, for making a packaged meal worth eating

Finally there is a quick way to make a great Udon Soup at home! For any Udon fan, this is a must try product. The noodles are as good as Udon noodles get, and the soup mix is great base to start your Udon. Here is the way we make Udon using this product as a base:

We take the noodles and soup mix from two packages (bowls), add some additional soy sauce and spices we like, and boil it all in a pan (you don't need to screw around with all the noodle rinsing, just throw them in the pot). When the soup and noodles are warm, we add chopped romaine. This is super good, and costs less than $[...] for two LARGE servings of Udon - a deal by any standard!!

When we really want a full-on Udon, we add some sliced pressed fish like the restaurants use in traditional Udon (the half moon pressed fish, white with the orange/red coating) and shrimp. This is heavenly!!

I added a half of dozen or so of frozen pre-cooked shrimp and this was great as an evening meal. The package includes the spices that one would expect to find in a Tom Yum Thai soup. While the quality may not be what one might expect to find in a good Thai restaurant, preparation in five minutes is surely an acceptable compromise

When I first opened my 6-pack of crackers, the organic nature really seemed to hit me hard at first. But a few crackers later, and they were hard to put down. It is one of the healthiest crackers I've had, not salty, but the currants provide that tinge of sweetness that really makes it an interesting cracker to eat...and continue eating. Highly recommended...especially if you sit at a desk all day at work like me and want a healthy snack food

The Dr. Kracker Snacker, Spelt Muesli Stick provide the same great taste and crunch as their other products, but with a hint of sweetness due to the bits of dried fruit in the cracker. Their smaller sizes makes them suitable for a quick snack and they are very filling. The amount of carbohydrates in each is very small in comparison to other snack crackers

I disagree with the person who gave this product only one star. I did find that I had to beat the cake longer than the box indicated and needed to bake it longer. I mixed my first one using my portable hand mixer which was really too small for this product. Second time I used my new stand mixer with the whip attachment. It more than doubled in volume after beating it about 10 minutes longer than the package suggested and I beat it on high. The cake filled my tube pan to the top and I baked it about 5 minutes longer than package suggested as my first one was a bit underbaked. My husband, who is NOT celiac, loves this cake also. We can't tell the difference between this one and a regular angel food cake mix. I also used 1 teaspoon of GF vanilla and 1 teaspoon of GF almond extract instead of using 2 of vanilla. I like the almond flavoring in angel food cake better, but that is personal preference.

I wouldn't consider myself a jerky expert. But I do like jerky, and I have tried more than a handful of brands.

This is definitely better than most. You can taste the brown sugar, and the spicy. Actually you can see the spicy all over the insides of the bag. Don't rub your eye after eating this stuff.

Most of the strips were soft and chewy. And not overly salty like others I've tasted. And I feel the spicy on my tongue as well as the back of my throat, which is always a good sign.

I will be putting in another order in a few weeks, so I can have some at a camping trip.

I'll preface this by stating that I love hot foods and I am not affected by them, so I can understand other reviews saying that the World Kitches Hot and Spicy was too spicy. This was not the case for me though. I found it to be a perfect blend of spicy and sweet. I really enjoyed it and ordered more. I got on a kick where I thought I would try all of the spicy jerkys on Amazon. I found this to be the one I liked the most, because of bothe the flavor and the fact that there were a lot of thin cuts of meat, which made it easier to eat. This does have a kick, so if that is a potential problem you may want to go with something milder. I will say I have had even hotter, but if you enjoy some flavor with your spice, you may want to give this a try

Yes, this beef jerky is hot. That's why it's "hot spicy." If you always order your Mexican or Chinese food mild, I'd say to get a different flavor. The spice blend (which is mostly hot pepper) is pretty good. The quality of the beef is as good or better than any of the mass-market beef jerky you can pick up at your local store. The big difference? This stuff is about 1/4 the price. If you like beef jerky, buy this brand. There is no better value out there unless you're making it yourself. I'll probably order some every time I order books

It is "special" to be offered your choice of tea and company always enjoys picking their own flavor. It is especially nice when it is presented in a lovely wooden box ( sort of like opening a gift).You soon learn your friends favorites. It also makes a lovely gift.

I saw this and thought it would be worth trying, primarily to have a nice box to keep tea in. The box is great, but I was astonished at how much I like the teas. Whatever their source for tea (100% Ceylon) has a very smooth and distinctive flavor. Their English Breakfast is easily the best black tea I've tried (and I love tea), at least when taken without milk. It's fine with milk, but isn't as good as some UK teas. The flavored teas are all very well balanced as well. I'd strongly recommend this (or a related smaller size) if you're looking for some very great tea as well as a good place to keep it

I have regular and quite extravagant High Teas. This set was given to me as a gift. I tried it the first time on a table full of guests...and die-hard tea party ladies.

None of us knew what to expect - it was wonderful - to say the least - lots of oohs and ahhs! The tea (can't remember which was used first) was delicate and tasty. It was enjoyed by everyone.

Unfortunately, the second time I made tea - it was fairly bitter - but the presentation was still spectacular....and being a good hostess - I had the "back-up" teapot of regular tea on the table. Nobody complained as everyone enjoyed the show. I will purchase more tea.

The clear glass teapot is adorable. The bamboo box is of average construction, and it might not take too hard a beating if you decide to put it to some other use, but it looks attractive on the counter. The flowering teas won't change your life, but they taste nice and are interesting to watch. My husband and I had great fun watching them unfurl and taking pictures

The packaging was great, came sealed inside a cardboard box which can easily be gift-wrapped. Although I was planning to give this one as a gift, I felt the need to open it and take a look. Shouldn't have done that because I soon knew it had to be mine. With my first dinner guests after delivery, I boiled water, opened the bamboo box, removed the glass pot, selected the flowering tea from the top of the pile, and brought it to the table after pouring the water onto the tea. Oh my Godness, what a sight! I didn't say a word and it was hysterical to see the look of the first person who noticed the flower bloom! We agreed that it looked like a monster at first, and after laughing amongst ourselves, I poured the first pot of tea into three small teacups. Yummy. Poured a second pot, then a third. Each was great and each time the visual was so lovely. We came to the computer and ordered three more sets. I know I'll be ordering more, too, with extra boxes of the flowering teas. Every part of this set was wonderful, from the packaging and delivery, bamboo boxes, little glass teapot, and tasty teas. It's a real nice value and very presentable gift. Amazon's prices can't be beat on these

Twinings is apparently the original Earl Grey tea, and it shows why it became so popular. Even with so many imitators, none can compare to the perfect cup created from Twinings loose leaf. Even the bagged variety is better than most other offerings.

Do yourself a favor and skip out on fancy boutique varieties that never rise above sub-par, and stock up on the best. And forget about other mass-market brands such as Taylors or Bigelow, they aren't even in the same ballpark

Earl Grey is my favorite blend of tea by far - no competition there. The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe's original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea's natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can't go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend.

(From the Twinings website: "When the mandarin's tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him. Twinings unique blend was the Grey family's long-standing favourite. When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey's tea by name.")

Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend's particular flavor. (But that's just me, of course.) Whichever way you have it, though, if scented teas are your kind of thing, Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley

I love Orville Redenbacher popcorn and decided to try out this new corn on the cobb flavor. Its flavor is good but very light and doesn't taste like corn on the cobb to me. I usually buy the Ultimate Butter flavor which is much more flavorful and buttery than this one.

I will probably not buy this flavor again, and will stick to the Ultimate Butter flavor.

I bought these Because Dr. Manny (FOX NEWS FAN!!) said they were better for you than the other leading bars on the market. Boy was he RIGHT these are Good!! the "filling" reminds me of a nut filled danish just not as sweet but just as satisfying... My husband looked at me funny but he tasted them and takes them to his training as a prework out boost as well as an after dinner snack as I don't but treats but these work for us !!

I was pleasantly surprised that they were pretty tasty! My favorites are actually the Fudgie Filberts that taste similar to a Little Debbie brownie if Little Debbie's were diet. Following that I would say Almond and Coconut are tied for second. Third is the Peanut Butter which is the highest in protein but not as good as the others. My husband didn't like any of them but could tolerate the one I liked least, Peanut Butter. Over all I think these are great as a healthy snack for people with food allergies or other dietary restrictions. I think I would have picked a different name than Betty Lou's Nut Butter Balls. Nut Butter Balls doesn't sound as appetizing as what they actually are!! Nut Butter Balls.....Mmmmmm

This is without a doubt my favorite flavor of all of these. I'm a bit of a novice in the world of veganism, and these are one of my favorite ways to get some protien in my system. They're soft, yet portable and fill you up for quite awhile even though they look small. I love these things

Get your kids off the sugar fix and introduce them to Nutrisoda

If you try this, which i highly reccomend, you will notice that the soda has a very strong fruity flavor. I really thought it had a great taste, also I think that it really calms you down. I dont know if it is one of the fruit extracts in it or if it is an herb, but it works.

I'd never tried this particular trail mix from planters, so I just ordered it based on how good it looked in the picture. And I must say, this is one of the tastiest snacks ever. Everything in there, the peanuts, almonds, raisins, etc... all taste great. The only problem is that I can't stop eating them. :(

But it least they're quite healthy. So it looks like I'll be ordering some more! Highly recommended!

I love these! They're a great source of fiber without having to drink that powdered goo or eating a bushel of broccoli everyday. And my kids love them too, yes, they are that delicious! I put these in their lunches and they think it's a treat. Amazon is the only way to buy them though, so expensive at the grocery stores. And don't worry about buying too many, they will not go to waste! The brown-sugar ones taste good but are a little firm and crunchy, so I recommend the honey-oat, definitely the best. Enjoy

These are the only cerial bars easily available that actually have a worthwhile fiber content. Each bar has 5g of Fiber, that is 20% of the recomended daily amount. This is great for IBS sufferers, or those who care about their internal health. They taste good, like HobNob biscuits you can get in the UK

Like all of the other All Bran Cereal Bars, these are excellent. My personal favorite over the other 2 flavors, but all three are divine. Again, wish Amazon would stock up on more of these because they always run out! (It might be because of me.) :)

But again, tasty, low calorie, high in fiber, all around good

This jerky is not just an excellent value, it is by far the best jerky we have eaten. I buy it every year as Christmas gifts (and ofcourse, save one pkg for us) and everyone raves about it. My family always looks forward to Christmas because they know jerky will be there for the holidays. Perfect to put in your day pack for a hike, or to take with you on vacations,camping trips, or even to the office for a quick, healthy snack. Delish!
You can't beat the price, and quality of this jerky. You really get a lot. I would highly recommend this product, and have, to several family members as well as friends. A+++ Thanks! Best secret in the jerky market.

I order several bags of this in the hot and spicy. It had a grit texture like it had sand in it. I wrote the company and found out that some bags were manufactured with larger grain sugar than they had intended. This caused the grit texture. They sent me replacement bags, and the replacements were wonderful. Excellent flavor and texture.

Give them a second chance

These cookies were a seasonal offering at a local store. I purchased one box. After trying them at home, I returned to the store and purchased the remaining inventory! A simple scoop of vanilla ice cream is transformed by the inclusion of a butter crisp. I also love them with tea...or straight out of the box. Don't be daunted by purchasing a pack of 12 boxes. The cost is a little over half of what I paid in the store. Lastly, unless you hide them in a dark corner of your pantry, you'll never have to worry about the shelf life, because they will be consumed quickly by family, friends, and yourself!

Basically, hot fries are god. I have to say that the majority of young people love Hot Fries. Those that do not like Hot Fries will find them inedible. Some people love hot fries, I happen to be one of them. It's great having a case of these, always having a bag on hand for that omnipresent hot fry hunger. I guess there might be some crack thrown in at the factory. These are definitely worth a try at this price. If you love hot fries, or even only eat them occasionally, this will save you money, and you'll never have to drive to the 7-11 at 10pm anymore

These are great! I couldn't stop eating, and I didn't care because they're so healthy! I'll try to keep it down to one bag a day.

The BBQ flavor is about as authentic as any potato chips I've ever eaten, and these chips are really crunchy too! Just make sure you have a napkin and perhaps a dustbuster available when you come up for air

I really like these for snacks. Peanut butter is so healthy, but messy to "pack" away for mid-day. The perfect size to be filling, but not too large that you will waste any. Tastes like peanut butter cookie dough (without the work, or the raw eggs!) Enjo

Great base sauce just waiting for your own special spices to be added or use as is for milder flavor. Would work for any Italian or American dish. I will order more

I have tried all the Scarpetta line and this sauce is the cornerstone of their line. Excellent for all factes of cooking and should be a staple in your kitchen pantry. Simply simmer the sauce and allow the aroma to fill the house like you have been working on it all day. No one needs to know the truth

This is hands down the best cereal I have ever tried, and I've tried a lot. I have eaten cereal almost every day of my life. You won't find a cereal with more fiber and protein that tastes better than this one. It has excellent crunch without the Cap'n Crunch effect of shredding your gums. It has a mild sweetness to it without being too sugary. Add a little fruit to it and you have the perfect breakfast. The only problem is that it's hard to find and can cost a little more. Even Amazon has run out. Make more please

When I first tried this cereal, I expected it to be like most "organic" type cereals; dry, ugly texture, awful taste. But I was pleasantly surprised and have been eating it ever since. The taste and texture are great and it would be difficult to find another cereal that delivers all the vitamins, minerals protein, fiber, calcium, low calories, etc. that still manages to taste great. Also, it has the blessing of the American Heart Association. You just can't go wrong with this product and I will continue to enjoy it

A friend told me about Optimum Slim. She ate it for its high protein content. I bought a box and was immediately impressed by the number of nutrients, high protein, AND high fiber -- everything I look for in a breakfast to start my day. And I love the texture and taste. My 17 year-old son (who, like 'Mikey', hates everything)tried it and, guess what? He likes it! (Hey, Mikey. . . . )
We are thankful that our friends at Amazon.com are selling this considerably cheaper then we can get it at our local supermarket, as we go through a box every other day.

The best sandwich cookie you've ever tasted! No trans fat, no refined sugars, no hydrogenated oils, no cholesterol, nothing artificial, and just the right blend of mint and chocolate! It just goes to show you, a company can produce something tasty AND healthy! You won't be disppointed if you try these...

Blue Weber agave is the lowest glycemic index of agave nectar. This is 100% blue weber, a great flavor, and price. I use it in tea, and baking, or just about any where I would use a bit of sugar. The texture and flavor is like honey. Great stuff

This tastes great, I love it in my coffee, and have even used it for pancakes. It really doesn't give me a spike in blood sugar, as promised. The only negative is the packaging they are using. During shipping, some of the seals underneath the lids came off, and the bottles leaked. I probably lost about a tablespoon (each) from 3 of the 6 bottles. The lids don't really fit the bottles, either. They have a pop-top, but if you use it, the syrup sometimes leakes out from under the lid where it attaches to the bottle. If they could fix the bottles, this would definitely be a five-star product.

I was tired of buying so many boxes of cereal a week. My teenage son eats it like its going out of style. And there are bowls and spoons all over the house. I tried this to try and get a variety. They actually lasted about a month and it was nice to not have bowls to wash. Now if only the spoon were included! Also, it would be nice to have even more variety, but all in all, great purchase

I enjoyed eating cerial. Whether if it is for before school, work, or just to snack on. And what I like about this is that they come in varieties (Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops, Cocoa Puffs, etc.), so I won't be eating the same thing every time, which is also good. If you're in a rush in the morning and want something to grab and go within a 15 minute period, I recommend this to you. Also you don't have to waiste your dishes, because they come in their own plastic bowls.

My only problem is that they are so small, and after about 10 spoon fulls, it's all gone. Sometimes I'm still hungry after eating one packet (and I'm skinny too).

True this contains Trans Fats, what breakfast item that kids enjoy eating doesn't contain them? Not very many items. Maybe eggs, and whatnot. Also if your kids are somewhat active in somekind of fitness activities, those "deadly trans fats" should be worked off by the end of the day. And using fat free milk with the cerial would make the situation better also

*****
Numi Tea's Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified organic high mountain Yunnan Black Tea FOP (Flowery Orange Pekoe). There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.

On the box, the manufacturer writes: "This noble tea is grown in the mist covered mountains of Yunnan province. What distinguishes this fine, organic black tea is its perfect sense of balance, exquisite tiger's eye color, and a lean vibrancy which makes it suitable at any time of day. Like a complex wine, it is the perfect tea for food, marrying well with a wide variety of dishes. It has a distant and hard to place floral quality, yet it leaves the mouth tasting as clean as spring water. And it energizes the body and mind more harmoniously than the best of coffees. We are proud to bring you this high grade leaf."

Although this tea says "orange pekoe", it does not taste citrus-y, but has a strong morning black tea taste with flowery overtones. It is like a regular orange pekoe upgraded many, many times, with something delicate, lovely, and flowery added. It's the perfect morning tea, or for anytime you want a high-quality pick-me-up.

The price is super, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love regular black, this will probably be the best you've ever had, and you'll wonder why you ever drank the "old stuff"!

Great tea, good taste and its well beyond soothing for bedtime but please be warned that it does contain st. john's wart which is an herb that can reduce the effectiveness of your hormonal birth control pill. Check the warnings on you pill, mine warns against taking st. johns wart.

I use this espresso as regular coffee for a drip machine. It is loaded with flavor, full rich flavors, and no bitterness. I have purchased it twice, first the five pound bag, then 4 one-pound bags. I think the individual bags are not only a better value but they can stay very fresh until you need them. I had no trouble with the 5 pound though, it was a delicious on the first day as the last. I highly recommend this coffee

Seeing as to how I'm a chocaholic, I thoroughly enjoy getting my morning fix with my cereal. As a kid I'd break Hershey's Chocolate into chunks and drop them in my Frosted Flakes....had I only thought then to patent that idea as Kellogg's has done I'd be rakin' in all the dough.... :D

I thought this was actually pretty good. The chocolate pieces added just enough chocolate taste to enjoy. I did not have any issues with 'waxy' taste. This is not baking choclate that melts in your hand so don't expect it to be. It has to hold up in the milk as well as on the shelf. I will definitely purchase again.

Purchased it (and a Keurig coffee machine) for my husbands Grandmother - she can use the coffee machine without the threat of spilling from a coffee pot. She is sooo happy!!! This is the flavor she liked best from a variety pack, and I was able to buy this from home and ship it to her in Wisconsin. Perfect for an older person who may not be as steady, and I can keep her in coffee for months with Amazon and their 2-pack of K-cups at such a great price and free shipping. Thank you for helping me help Grandma

This is an awfully nice gift pack if you want to take the oils out of the box. The cardboard box with the story of the oils/manufacturer came with a big florescent pink label screaming" NOT INTENDED FOR INDIVIDUAL SALE: Sell only on Amazon" or something of the sort directly over the text explaining the oils. I was disappointed as people like to read about where gourmet gifts come from and I had planned on wrapping them in the box. Other than that, the tins cans are very attractive and unique. My parents were VERY happy with them.

I enjoyed McCann's sugar free instant oatmeal. The texture is much better than some other instant oatmeals that remind me of pulverized cardboard. The maple brown sugar flavor has a deep maple flavor. The sweetness tastes natural, not artificial. I love that each packet only contains 100 calories, yet is very satisfying

Baxters soups are usually very nice, but the lobster bisque is especially good. It tastes authentic, it has a good flavour, is creamy, and has just enough lobster bits to make it interesting. Add some fresh black pepper and a dash of brandy or sherry and it rivals soup served in a very good restaurant.

It's also surprisingly low calorie. Though the nutrition info here says 130 calories for 8oz, the label actually says 120 calories, so even if you ate the whole can for lunch you would consume only about 220 calories

I too purchased these on a Friday sale, six bags for $6.99. Considering the current price, Amazon must have either mispriced them or been out of their minds. If they ever go back on for that price, don't hesitate. They are completely fresh and perfect for cooking or just eating right out of the bag. Oh, I forgot to mention; they are terrific on top of a banana split

These slivered almonds are an excellent addition to salads.

I'm sure they are good for lots of other things (baking, stir fry), but they definitely make plain salads seem a lot more gourmet. And they're the perfect size/shape/cut for this purpose.

The shelf life is also great. Especially if you store them in the freezer or fridge you should be good for more than 6 months. A bit pricey retail, but you can't beat the Amazon 6-pack discounted price. I'm stocking up

I've been using Colman's mustard ever since I spent a month in Ireland and the UK on business. The food was basically inedible, even the steaks, until I started slathering on the Colman's. Makes all the difference - the mustard has a horseradish type kick thats addicting. I've stopped asking for Colman's at US restaurants - they think I'm weird, but I definitely keep a supply at home. Its great on all meats and poultry, even vegetables. There's not many foods I won't put it on. Thank you Britain for this major contribution to the culinary arts

I bought a multipack of all the Nutrisodas from beveragesdirect, and i thought for the longest time that all the nutrisodas had energy stuff in it. in fact, only the "energy" nutrisoda was "energetic".

I can't say much about how good this was for my joints, but this is my favorite flavor out of the bunch (and i've had the chance to sample all the nutrisoda flavors). it's like a sparkling apple drink with a midtone of cherry. and anyone can make good use of the ingredients they added for joints in this stress-filled world

While typical fruit roll ups tend to be hard and chewy, these are soft and break apart easily for my 15 month old to eat. He loves them, and they are much healthier than grocery store brands.

Unlike the other reviewers, I do not like fruit rollups or leathery fruit bars of any kind. These bars are soft and chewy and very satisfying. They are a great snack to keep handy. I would highly recommend, especially if you are a person who doesn't usually like the other types of fruit leathers, sticks, rollups, etc

Wow, we've never had so much Macaroni and Cheese in a long time! And Annie's is really, really good. This doesn't need additional milk or butter, and the sauce is an easy-to-squeeze out paste in a foil package. It tastes great, and makes a great receptacle for some creativity of your own too.

Tips to enjoy it:

- Just boil in plenty of water, the six-cup requirement is a minimum.

- Drain quickly, put the pasta back in the hot pot. The remaining heat is just right to melt the thick cheesy sauce into the macaroni. Don't rinse the pasta in cold water, it will make it hard for the sauce to combine well.

- All the Deluxe versions are animal rennet free. Annie's FAQ is very specific about which ones use vegetable rennet (not all do) but Amazon isn't picking up the information. I tag the really vegetarian ones "animal rennet-free" whenever I can.

- Try blending sundried tomatoes, a fresh tomato, olive oil, garlic, pizza peppers, salt, freshly ground pepper, and a touch of balsamic vinegar into a paste. This really complements the mac and cheese and gives it a new, gourmet taste that still doesn't take away from the "mac and cheesiness" of it.

- Tabasco Chipotle sauce makes a great addition for the adventurous. The smoky taste is tempered by the creaminess

I just got a case of these - my 2 year old and I had just introduced ourselves to 'fruit leathers', which we love. I figured I'd look this up as it's considerably less expensive per bar than buying an 8-pack at the store.

My daughter absolutely loves these and so do I! We're planning on bringing them as treats when we go across the street and play with the kids who stay with one of my neighbors. My daughter even told me that they're now her favorite treat. And I feel fine knowing she's getting something that's really tasty and sweet but that it's not gonna kill her with too much sugar and corn syrup

These are the perfect snack for on the go. Actual REAL fruit--No sugar! No "roll-ups" with 10% fruit! They are not dry or leathery and even little kids can chew them well. Just the right size for toddlers and small kids (and Moms too). Great to stick in the diaper bag or purse for an impromptu healthy snack. Works in any weather (won't melt) and even survives at the bottom of the purse! Comes in lots of flavors, an organic version, and bigger bars too for a bigger snack. Cheaper than lesser products at the grocery store. GREAT!

I LOVE this product. It is reasonably priced when one considers each packet can be reconstituted to equal one cup of broth. The broth is organic with a rich flavor of chicken( I also use the beef broth it is delicious as well) but my favorite feature is one may store the equivalent of 6 cans of broth in less space than one can takes up. A definite 5 stars from me. "Savory Choice" broth concentrates are the best!!!!

Great product when you need just a little extra stock/broth. It won't replace my use of Swanson's because it would be too much to open 8 packages for 2 quarts of stock for soup etc. but it is great for making pilaf etc. or when you're just a little short of the quantity needed

These are very tasty indeed. The flavors taste natural and fresh, better than I expected, and the texture is very good. My young son has a real sweet tooth and these are a great treat for him. In fact my whole family enjoys them. My husband about died when he saw I ordered a case of "Pop Tarts", but he was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the more healthful ingredients. I will definitely keep these on my shopping list, and recommend them to anyone, especially families with children who want a quick and tasty snack that's a little more "fun" than a piece of toast and more wholesome than a donut or (most) cookies.

Yes, these Toaster Pastries from Nature's Path are the only thing my 3-year-old will eat for her breakfast. Thanksfully, they are fairly healthy. Now her 2 older brothers are making it a staple for their breakfast also. They are very tasty and toast well in the toaster. The frosted strawberry and blueberry ones are equally as good - just depends on your taste preference. We have not tried any of the UNfrosted ones though

Bran Buds is definitely one of the better bran cereals around. It actually tastes good. (OK, it isn't a cinnamon roll, but it's still pretty good.) It stays crunchy in milk, but is not so hard that you wonder if your teeth will be damaged. I like combining bran buds and a flake cereal. Bran Buds has been at my breakfast table for years.

Good cereal if you like something other than flakes. It doesn't get mushy like them. However, this product doesn't provide the minimum vitamin content some other breakfast cereals do, an important consideration when one considers how vitamin deprived many of us are (and carbohydrate stuffed).

I like the way this tastes, but it's not fantastic. it fills you up (fiber expands) and keeps you regular. Honestly 2/3 a cup and your set for breakfast. i don't know what's wrong with the last guy who posted. I'm pretty sure he's some dude who thought it would be funny to write a post about some old guy's unfortunate run in with bran. Nothing goes through you that fast. Bran is not a laxative. Its bulk forming fiber. I wouldn't really care except that this is a good product

I took a chance buying 6 boxes of this cereal, and I was rewarded! It is flavorful, crispy, and reasonably proced. The only problem is that one of my six boxes had a hole in the bag. I discovered tis because the cereal leaked our through the cracks in the box. Still a decent value with the lost box

My local Whole Foods sells Nature's Path products for $3.79 a box, so this Amazon.com price is an excellent deal.

The cereal is hearty and crunchy, although it becomes soft in a few short minutes when submerged in milk. I sometimes add a little sweetner, as sugar is not added artificially. My housemate (who grew up in France Italy), loves this cereal, as he says it reminds him of his European 'grainy' musli-style cereals. However, I am not a big fan of what is sold as 'Musli' or 'Muslix' in this country and Heritage Bites are nothing like this.

Think Chex style bites and crunch, without the Chex fake crunch, slimy coating, preservatives and sugars.

Upon arrival, I read the nutrition info myself on the cereal box and was pleasantly surprised to find they were better than Amazon's listing. They have 6 grams of fiber (balanced soluble and insoluble fiber) in a 1 ounce (28 gram=3/4 cup) serving and only 5 grams of sugars, all for only 100 calories. All this isn't worth much though, if they don't taste good, right? Well, they are good, very yummy, even out of the box. They are rather like "Life" cereal, regular flavor, just a bit less stripped of the good stuff in taste. The whole grains really shine through and they tend to stay crispy in milk much longer. I enjoyed a bowl of them topped with just a fine bit of honey so that the flax seeds I topped them with would stick and not sink to the bottom, a bowl plain with milk, and also a bowl made into a "Muddy Buddies" healthy version. I bought these initially to make the recipe "Muddy Buddies/Puppy Chow" recipe healthier (using alternatively sweetened chocolate, freshly ground almond or peanut butters and some date sugar to toss in after coating. These would also be a great alternative choice for other "Chex" cereal recipes. I like them so much, I will give up my usual choices in cereal that provide the same, or less, amount of fiber for TWICE the calories and that also soak up too much milk in the bowl. Give these a try, they won't replace some of the worst offending sugar laden "kid's" cereals with no one noticing, but these are really a good choice and tasty, and are always handy for those "chex mix" recipes with a healthier spin. If a sugar addict really needs more sweetening, just let them top these with a better choice in sweetener of your own choice, not a giant company's choice in what makes them the most profit. Best of all, we can have something affordable we like the taste of without supporting these huge companies that are ruining our health and economy , as well as putting the family farmers out of business. I can't think of any reasons why I wouldn't recommend these.

I love these Crystal Light on The Go packets. I have to travel about 20-40 miles to do my shopping, so I like to have a beverage with me on my trip home. These really come in handy when a store has nothing cold that I like. I hate water. It has no taste. These packets come in when a store has no good soda. The only problem with these packets is that sometimes the powder doesn't dissolve completely in the bottld water you use. A lot of times, a big clump of powder mix forms at the bottom of the bottle and you have to find a way to stir it to make it dissolv

They are crisp, buttery yet light.

Unlike some other cookies, they even taste great when they are broken into smaller pieces (as shipping by Belgium is liable to do sometimes).

The only downside is they are addicting - there are about 24 wafers per box and before you know, it's time to order another 12-pack :-)

Yes, it seems like a lot but if you need to remove temptation - these make great gifts. As you can see, the boxes are classy and in most gourmet stores, EACH box can sell for nearly $6! ... so you will also seem a genuine benefactor :-)

The only thing wrong with these cookies is that Amazon makes it too easy to obtain :-

These are very, very good. I love these for a snack and they take care of a sweet craving too. Not too awful sugary sweet, just sweet and tart enough! I tried a handful in my oatmeal with some vanilla creamer this mornining for a treat and it was so good with those sweet, tart cherries. They are great to snack on and add to muffins and in baking. A great buy in bulk, compared to what I find in our local supermarkets which are very pricey! These are nice sized and fresh too! They would be great in trail mix. My husband likes them as a snack in his lunch too! Thumbs up!!

Wow. Just in time for the holidays! Now I can brine or bbq my turkey, methods that leave me with little or no usable pan juices, and still make a great gravy. And a turkey base instead of chicken for my leftover soup too! What a concept!
This is a super simple product to use. Little storage space and little waste but big on flavor.
I keep some of each flavor in my RV. It would be great for any camping style, especially backpacking

My husband and I both love this. My children (who eat only whole grain type foods normally) don't like it. I am not sure why but they still prefer oatmeal type hot cereals.

It is great with a little splenda or to really bring it up a notch I will lightly thaw 1 C of frozen berries and add that with a little splenda. YUM!!

I agree with everything that the previous reviewer wrote in their review. I gave the cookies a rating of 5 stars though because i havent eaten a cookie in about 4 years without getting sick. This is because I have severe allergies to wheat and soy. Pretty much every cookie you will find in a normal grocery store will have one if not both of these ingrediants. So when I found Nana's cookies I was as happy as can be. Yes the texture is different than a wheat cookie but it's better than going without cookies. It also doesnt hurt that these cookies are delicious. If you are like me and have a very limited diet these cookies are a very welcome addition to that diet.

Frankly, I think the chicken flavor is a bit bland. The noodle texture is good and rather filling. Probably the traditional ramen flavor taste better.

But with the price offered and the free shipping, it is a great buy and fantastic delivery service

This product has the benefits of organic whole grains and environmentally responsible packaging, but it's also my favorite cereal - flavorful and super crunchy even if left in milk for a while

These bars are fairly good to be "healthy," yet they lack the flavor and texture of many other granola or fruit breakfast bars. To me they taste like the equivalent of whole grain rice crispy treats (if there were such things) with added cranberries and some ginger. The combination of the cranberries and ginger do aid in the flavor, but the bars are "stickier" than I had expected. All things considered, though, they seem to be a healthy alternative to more caloric bars

while I have rated the item with 5 stars because of the product itself, not the sale from Amazon.
I was on line trying to find this product in bulk. Amazon sells this product 12 jars for $30.90 which abmounts to $2.575 per jar. It is soooo much cheaper to buy this in a grocery store. Thus, I don't recommend purchasing it thru Amazo

This is the best Peanut Butter product ever produced by major American food service company.

If you're expecting "peanuts and salt" with separated oil and a rock-hard refrigerated consistency after opening, this is not that product. If, however, you dislike most of those products -- which are more annoying to eat than many people find to be worthwhile -- this is what you've been waiting for.

It uses a natural tropical oil, which has a naturally long shelf-life, as opposed to the disastrously unhealthy "alternative" of hydrogenated oils.

Many people panic over seeing "saturated", but that is exactly the sort of grossly uninformative evaluation that led us to using the (far more deadly) hydrogenated oils to begin with -- advice which is frankly unforgivable. Learn about fats for yourself, and make the right decisions. I recommend "Know your fats", available right here on Amazon.

If you want the most healthy peanut butter you can get, grind your own and eat it fresh, and congratulate yourself for fantastic self-discipline and patience. For the rest of us, we need more products like this. Finally, a "grown-up" version of an American food product

We love to have peanut butter on toast for breakfast - but my husband would not eat anything but Skippy, no matter how I pleaded. He does not like natural peanut butter at all. When I found this in the store I was so happy - and he loves it! I do too, it tastes great, like Skippy but without all the crap of the original. Highly recommended

Cranberry center isnt dyed but looks like real berries, which is appreciated. .. these days everything is crayola-colored... I like these even better than the apple ones (which seem to be sweeter). Blueberry and apple are both also good though. Great to tuck into your purse, because they are sturdy enough they wont crumble into nothing when you cart them around

The Glutino brand excells in taste with no strange aftertaste. This bar was very good although I hoped for less filling and more crust as the filling was too sweet for my taste. I was looking for a bar that wasn't too sweet so the cranberry flavor sounded promising. While it is not as sweet as other flavors, it is still rather sweet. Still highly recommend this flavor and this brand

Twinings developed this tea last year (2006) for their 300th anniversary - a counterpart to their famous "Earl Grey" product. "Lady Grey" has the distinctive Earl Grey flavor but with just a hint of floral. It has become my family's favorite tea. We can no longer get it in our stores but is easily available on-line from Twinings. Buy it - maybe we'll get it back in our stores! A wonderful product!

The first thing you notice when you open a tin of Twinings Lady Grey
(beside the redolence of bergamot oil mixed with the aroma of black tea and lemon which is a staple of the *Earl* Grey Teas) is the striking visual pattern of the loose tea:
Dark dry tea leaves sprinkled with bright dots of dry orange peel and stunningly-blue cornflower petals. It is almost as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds. Milder and less caffeinated than the Earl, this mix has become a permanent inhabitant of our pantry and our tea cups for almost 5 years now.

Note that unlike Earl Grey, *Lady Grey* seems to be a Trademark of the Twinings Co. If you are looking for a similar tea that is not manufactured by Twinings, you may have a hard time figuring what is the exact equivalent. For example, some other companies market a blend called "Pouchkine" or "Afternoon Earl Grey" which essentially are milder versions of the traditional Earl Grey and lack some proprietary Twinings-only ingredients (most notably, the cornflowers)

It has a strong flavor and its a little different but if you want something to relax you for the evening and put you over the edge...this is it. I have sent it to friends and family and can tell you most were impressed. I gave some to my 21 year old daughter who.... has issues and she said it lulled her to sleep so much so she recommended it to a friend

I have trouble finding this particular tea in non-health-food stores. This tea is caffeine-free, so it's ideal for unwinding at the end of the day or for a quiet escape during a stressful work day. The tea has a strong aroma and flavor, a little bit spicy so not for everyone, but I find the scent irresistable and calming on its own. The flavor is a touch of sweet, a touch of tingle on the tongue. And as a bonus, each tea bag label has an inspirational saying on it. Even if you find the quotations silly, they're at least good for a giggle

I've been eating this cereal for years. Aside from being nutritious it is also delicious. It's hard to believe that something that tastes so good could actually be good for you. Usually it's the other way around, if it's good for you it tastes like crap. This sure bucks that system :). It's great with milk for breakfast as usual, and instead of eating something unhealthy for a snack, have a bowl of this cereal. If you eat it strait out of the box be careful and pay attention, you could eat the whole box and not realize it until you stick your hand in and it's empty, uh oh! It's really yummy! So go ahead, enjoy it. Oh yea, Amazon has the best price too.

We jokingly call this cereal "bugs, twigs, and leaves" in our house. However, we do so with affection. The only complaint we have is that this cereal is a bit on the sweet side. Okay, it's very sweet! We find that is its only fault, though. Having been born and raised on cold cereal, I can honestly say that this is the best I've ever had. Hubby concurs and eats it for breakfast and dessert. LOL! We used to get it at Sam's Club, but it was discontinued quite a while back. So very happy to find it here at Amazon

First I want to mention that I never write reviews online. I probably should, but I just never have the motivation to do so.

Well, this cereal is so awesome, I just have to review it! I'll shortly explain on a few topics to help you understand its greatness.

Taste: It tastes wonderful! My thoughts during the very first 2 seconds of my very first bite was "Oh man, not another cardboard-tasting cereal." It was just then that the lightly sugary-cinnimony taste hit my tongue. How delightful!

Texture: Its crunchy, just like I like it, but not too crunchy. Its not just flakes like alot of cereals, it contains 4-5 different types of crunchiness!

Effect: This is where the cereal sold me. Taste and texture are wonderful, yes, yet the way it makes me feel is out of this world! I'll pour a bowl of this stuff with my favorite soy silk enhanced milk, scarf it down in hungry and sluggishness... and about 30 min - 1 hour later I'm pumped! Yes, this cereal will literally infuse you with bursting energy. And not just a burst like caffeine... no, this energy lasts for hours! I've had the energy from this last for at least 5 hours each time.

Overall: Even if the price is a tad pricey over the "regular" brands of cereal out there, I love the taste, texture, and effects so much that I dont mind the price! And now that Amazon is selling it cheaper in bulk, the price drops from about 4usd a box to about 3usd a box. 25% off, yes!

Bookmark this page and go try this at your local grocery store first, I'm sure you'll be back to this site to buy in bulk too

I bought the flour to make cookies for my granddaughter for the holidays. It's been a long time since she had homemade cookies, as I had a hard time finding a wheatfree flour that didn't need other ingredients added to it to make it work like all purpose flour. I could not tell the difference between the cookies I made with Organ flour and the ones made with all purpose flour. I look forward to making other recipes for her using this flour.

I bought this product after seeing it on Amazon. I have tried it in two recipes. It substitutes just like flour. I made the best banana nut bread with it! It is awesome to be able to use a regular recipe without any special instructions and come up with something so good to eat but gluten free. No need to feel deprived! I am anxious to try it in some other recipes

*****
This Organic Ginger Tea from Yogi Tea is ideal as a digestive aid, and it also purportedly enhances circulation. It's a lovely, intense, all natural herbal tea made from organic ginger root, organic lemon grass, orgnaic licorice root, organic peppermint leaf, and organic black pepper. The taste is exactly like ginger, spicy and peppery, with sweet overtones. It's very nice anytime, but especially after a meal.

Note that this review is for the six pack of Organic Ginger Teas, an amazing savings on Amazon by buying in bulk!

I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Ginger Organic Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.

Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Our 100% Organic Ginger tea has something to offer to anyone who wants to get or stay healthy. For millennia, herbalists from all over the world have known of the healing, soothing and energizing qualities of this root, considered the "universal medicine." Organic Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been used worldwide as a safe and mild home remedy for a variety of conditions, including motion sickness, occasional upset stomach and intestinal gas, as well as minor menstrual cramps. Ayurvedic practitioners have used Ginger for years as a way of activating the body's fire element (Agni), which burns up Ama (the body's toxins, comprised of both undigested food and naturally occurring toxins). When Ama is decreased, the body gains strength, balance and harmony. As a natural warming energizer, Ginger is also known to support the immune system, promote rapid and complete digestion and increase intestinal tone and peristalsis. Furthermore, it works as an antioxidant and has been shown to safely and effectively relieve nausea associated with motion. Our 100% Organic Ginger tea tastes delicious and provides the highest quality of a timeless remedy."

There is a warning on the box that if you have indigestion or heartburn that persists you should see a doctor. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.

Highly recommended.

When my mother-in-law purchased "light" rice bread, I expected it to be even worse than the regular rice bread we had been tolerating. However, I was in for a pleasent surprise! This bread is much lighter than the very dense rice bread made by EnerG. It still tastes better toasted, but my 4 year old will eat it straight out of the bag too. I am enjoying it as well - and so much easier to use than my previously preferred brand, which had to be pulled apart with a knife after storing in the freezer. I have used to make rice crumbs for meatloaf, as sandwiches, as garlic toast, as regular toast, and am hoping to try french toast soon - the first bread even worth attempting that one with

This was a keeper. The best I have found, so far. Light and airy. Can make peanut butter jelly sandwiches.. doesn't NEED to be toasted like the others... Makes a "mean" french toast... My daughter (who is pretty picky) eats this bread a lot.

I've never reviewed a food item before, but this delectable little bar was so heavenly I had to change my mind. At the time, it was a mere snack in between classes; afterwards, it earned a place in my heart, as well as my eternal devotion.

Toffee AND almonds + chocolate...

*sigh*

What more could one ask for?

I am one hardly to ever leave product reviews, and as much as I buy online, I should work on that. But, after trying the various Kashi products, these bars are by far the best and I feel the need to leave a review! I started off eating the Kashi Honey Almond Flax granola bars, which are very good, but definitley not as sweet as these (not a good OR bad thing, just a comparison). However, you will still get the protein, fiber and omega-3s if that's what you're looking for. If you love chocolate and almonds and are looking for a protein/fiber bar that tastes good and is more on the sweet side, this is definitely one to try!!! Whether you use them as a meal replacement or as a snack, they are absolutley amazing and I will definitely be a repeat customer

I love these cookies! Talk about getting to eat guilt free. I gave these cookies four stars because someone used to sugar and processed foods could not appreciate these cookies as much as someone that loves whole foods and the richness that affords.

I've loved this cereal for many years. They are like Cheerios, but stay crunchie in milk. I used to buy it at Whole Foods, but they quit selling it in these Eco Pacs. I start every morning with a bowl of this cereal and fruit. My two dogs also get some of this cereal every morning. It helps keep us healthy, since it is full of fiber

This cereal is super crunchy but it sure beats soggy soup, which is what most cereals turn into after a couple of minutes in milk. It also makes a great pick-me-up dry snack when you're craving something crunchy, but don't want all the calories and sodium of most chips/crackers/pretzels. The flavor is mild, kind of along the lines of cheerios, but better in my opinion (since I go through a 2lb. bag of Heritage O's a week). Whole grain, organic, low sodium, breaks all stay-crunchy records... what else could you ask for in an O's cereal?
One word of caution though. This cereal may cause those close by to complain of the crunching noise you emit while eating it

I LOVE the 100 calorie packs!My favorites are the Sunchips,the Teddy Grahams,and now the LD shortbreads!

In my town,it's hard to get any of the popular 100 calorie packs,like the Cheetos,Sunchips,or Hostess carrot cakes because they always sell out.But the Teddy Grahams and Lorna Doone shortbreads never seem to sell here,so I always have plenty.

I try to limit myself to one pouch a day,but somedays I might have 2 because they are so good

and really enjoying it ! We tryed both the raspberry and blueberry and for me it's no comparison - the blueberry rules... I'm struggling with drinking less soda and increasing the tea. After I "cold" brewed a glass added some sweetener a few cubes, I fell in LOVE. Glad I ordered enough to get a start on spring, summer and grilling ! If you like berry flavored beverages, give the ice Cool Brew Tea, Blueberry a try.

great product; unfortunately shipping took a toll on the biscotti's (majority arrived in crumbs broken pieces). Have since ordered an additional 8 boxes. The lemon ones were shipped in a second Amazon box which seemed to provide some additional protective, as only a few were broken in some of the boxes. Would recommend seller in the future ship all 12 pack boxes in a second box and add extra cushioning protection. It would allow folks to dunk their biscotti's rather than have to eat direct from the wrapper and get crumbs everywhere

I wish I could give 6 out of 5 stars ! With so many choices, I gave two leaves and a bud - a try. Judging by the package outside, it's like a regular brown box, no fancy tin. But, the tea is individually wrapped in some soft satin materials and you can see the little tea leaves. Then, each is wrapped in a plastic to maintain freshness !! I was blown away by the packaging already at this point. Then the tasting began, it's such a smooth, delicate tea - I can't describe how nice it is but I quit the cheap lipton or any other brand. This is the tea for me

This fruit is great for a quickie cobbler. Just pour a can in a 9"by9" pan. Add cobbler topping (mix together, cup sugar, cup flour, 2tps baking powder, and 1 egg.) Sprinkle over fruit. Pour melted butter over top, sprinkle a little cinnamon over top and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Try it, I've gotten lots of compliments on this and it's simple and fast

My husband and I like the Newman O's better than Oreo's, and our 3 year old son loves them! As we did as a child, he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling, just like an oreo. Also, the Newman O's do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have

Everyone in my family (from 3 to 64 years old) loves these organic cookies. I purchased these cookies at several local stores before I discovered that Amazon had them. I sent a package to my grandson who is in the Army in Iraq and he raved about them. Newman's has another big winner!

I do not like store-bought cookies, especially Oreos (too dry and greasy for me). But upon the recommendation of several people, I tried the Ginger O's and was pleasantly surprised. They have excellent flavor and the cream does not have that greasiness to it. If you like ginger cookies, don't hesitate to try these

I love the Original Vanilla Creme Newman's O's, so when I saw the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free on sale one day I picked one up. I figured it would basically be the same as the Original. The chocolate and vanilla tastes are great, but I found the cookies themselves to be rock hard. So unless you have an issue with wheat or dairy products, I would recommend the Original Vanilla Creme, and not the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free variety

I really like the taste of these. I could eat them like candy bars they are so good in my opinion. Mabe not the healthiest granola bar around. But they are definitedly one of the tastiest the Yogurt just melts right into the granola on these just great. I even like the vanilla but really like the Blueberry and Strawberry. I wish they were a little bigger sometimes I eat 2 instead of 1 but I do recommend if you are worried about flavor these are top notch

Here in the shanty, where every grocery dollar has to be spent to maximize the calorie-per-buck quotient, we still find ourselves splurging on the best meal money can buy.

Hamburger Helper's Cheeseburger Macaroni(CM) concoction sates me in a manner no other food can accomplish.

Sure, the kids have to eat their peanut butter sandwhiches for supper so as to allow me to eat an entire pan of CM but I am the one needing the nourishment to arise every morning and descend into the mine for 14 hours to eke out the meager living here in America's proverbial Heartland.

I could eat CM for breakfast lunch and dinner and never tire of it sliding down into my bulbous belly.

Mighty fine stuff, girls and boys

My neighbor talked me into getting these because we are both trying to eat healthier and like to try new things. Well, these are DELICIOUS! They are my new favorite breakfast, even my children (2 4 yrs. old) like them. They do share a cookie because they are quite large, but the size is perfect for me. We had no problem with the two batches we ordered, both were very fresh and very chewy. I stored them right in the freezer and would just pull one out as needed. I'm reordering now. Loved these

I had some reservations about trying new (relatively) "healthy" food products, but this double choc chunk breakfast cookie is a winner. I love to bake and have tried many cookies (both home-made and store-bought) and Baker's chocolate chunk breakfast cookie is in my top 3 favorite chocolate cookies. Not only is it pretty healthy (low fat, high fiber and protein), it tastes very good! My only concern for this product is its short shelf life, so you have to eat it pretty quickly. However, that only means that the product is made without excessive preservatives, unlike many other similar products on the market. I just love that I can pronounce everything on the ingredient list

Ahmad English Afternoon Tea is the best. I love to sample delicious teas from all over the world. I orginally bought a tin of Ahmad tea as a gift, for a discount at Marshall's around Christmas time in 2001. I had so many selections for the gift basket I was making that I ended up keeping the Ahmad for myself. Boy, was I ever glad I did. I haven't found Ahmad teas in any store since then. I've been ordering it online ever since, and re-filling the authentic tin it originally came in. During my breast cancer treatment (chemo, radiation all that good stuff) in early 2005, I was able to enjoy Ahmad English Afternoon Tea, even when I couldn't keep anything else down.

This is the only green tea with echinacea that doesn't have any peppermint, and that was the reason I ordered it. The taste is nice and after I've been drinking this tea for approximately a month, when nasty winter cold virus attacked everyone in the family one by one, I recovered faster than anyone else. Therefore, it is one more proof for me that Echinacea does help to strengthen you immune system. I would recommend this tea to anyone

This is my favorite k-cup for morning drinking. I prefer smooth, medium blends (like this one) and some bold blends. If you like light blends, this might not be for you

These are the greatest. Light, not too sweet, delicious. AND high in fiber. Who could ask for anything more? Problem is, Amazon seems to always have a limited stock so they go fast. They should even out the supply:demand ratio and also offer the other 2 flavors on a more regular basis

These are great breakfast bars - low in calorie but high in fiber. They are the only bar I've tried that keep me satisfied until lunch. HOWEVER - they are very crumbly and don't stay together very well so can be mess if you're on the go in the morning.

This is really the best decaf I have tried... It is hard to find any better than the italian decafs like this one or Illy. Unless of course you are the average local coffee drinker used to embarassments like Folgers or accustomized to all the overburned and stinking like charcoal brands named for an unknown reason French Roast, Italian Roast etc... (believe me, they have nothing to do with French or Italian coffee). Not to mention the local decafs which taste more like tea made out of burned wood shavings...

My husband and I loved our hazelnut flavored creamer, but gave it, and its added calories, up as part of our New Years Resolutions. This is a nice substitute, without the calories. While it does not taste as good, it is a nice treat when you want a bit more flavor in your coffee. We did not like the vanilla, and plan to try the mocha next

I read about these little jewels in a magazine recently and decided to try them. I bought the Hazelnut flavor and love it! Not only are the packs perfect for your purse or desk, but the flavor is true to Hazelnut and blends perfectly with the taste of Splenda. I usually have a large cup of coffee for which I have to use two packets. They aren't cheap so my recommendation would be one pack of regular splenda and one pack of flavored. You won't be disappointed! Try them!!!!!

This oatmeal is some of the best stuff I've ever had. I couldn't believe it tasted so good without any sugar or other additives. The packages are a lot larger than the average instant oatmeal package as well. This is cheaper than buying the instant oatmeals from safeway or albertsons.

Healthy, tasty, cheap.. what more could you want

I have never liked oatmeal. When I saw this at my local Costco, I decided to give it a try. Boy was I surprised! I absolutely loved it. It is the only brand of oatmeal I can eat. Not only is it organic and made from steel cut oats, the flavor variety keeps the breakfast exciting for my family.

Sadly to say, Costco stopped carrying it and I was forced to go online to find it. It is a little pricey here but, you get what you pay for

I've tried most of the instant oatmeals, and this brand has the best taste, while using organic ingredients. The variety pack is good so you don't get bored with one flavor. The price here seems very good, as I pay $3.89 for one box at the local health food store

If you like beef jerky, you will like this product. I ordered it for my 25-yr. old son who expects a big bag of jerky every Xmas no one was disappointed. My only disappointment was realizing that I could purchase this flavor at Walmart for a substantially lower cost-per-ounce.

This hot cereal is great. I've been eating it for years. Bob's Red Mill is the only vendor that I know of. They are local, but I'm glad they have it on Amazon now so I don't have to make the 1 1/2 hour round trip. It has an almost nutty taste. It is high in protein and fiber, and is fantastic with dates and milk

I first tasted this tea way back in the late 70's, when I worked at a specialty restaurant. Now I use it in my secret recipe iced tea, it adds a flavor that no one can identify, but one that they can't seem to get enough of! It's also good hot, with cream and sugar. The taste is like lemon and nutmeg. I've tried other brands, but Twinings is the richest in flavor.

The shipment of 4 jars arrived with 2 of them broken, poorly packaged. Customer Service will replace them, though. And then I tried the sauce, just as is, over pasta with Parmesan cheese on top. DELICIOUS!!! Just hot enough to get your attention but not so hot that it would burn your mouth. Wonderful, I can't wait for the replacement! If it weren't for the poor packaging job, I would give it 5 stars

I've tried all the Scarpetta sauces, and this is might be my favorite. It as a nice early and late kick. Not too strong or overpowering yet memorable on the palate

Annie's Creamy Deluxe Shells Real Aged Wisconsin Cheddar is made with all vegetarian ingredients and even organic pasta. The sauce is made from cheddar cheese, cream, whey, dry milk, natural flavors and annatto for color.

The 12-ounce box is enough for two to six people depending on how hungry you are at the time. We serve this as a side dish with many meals and normally can get about four to six servings from one box.

When making the pasta, use a large stockpot filled halfway with water because if you even use a medium to large saucepan, it might boil over. The instructions say to use a medium saucepan, but I can't recommend that personally as it always boils over. Once you have the pasta cooked, all you do is add the packet of creamy delish cheese sauce.

This is probably the only box of macaroni and cheese with information on where to get a "Be Green" bumper sticker. I also like the cute "Rabbit of Approval" sticker on the Annie's Homegrown products. They are all delicious (not overly salted) and you feel good eating such a healthy product.

This macaroni and cheese is the only kind that both the adults and the kids in our family enjoy. It has a slightly sharp cheddar flavor that makes it taste so much better than the "processed cheese food" types. Our whole family swears by Annie's Homegrown Deluxe Shells Real Aged Wisconsin Cheddar and it is much cheaper buying them here than one at a time at the grocery store

I grew up a Kraft boy, and you wouldn't find me with off-brand boxes of macaroni and cheese. No, sir. Just the authentic and best for me.

When I got older, I realized (thanks to Mark Bittman's superb cookbook, How to Cook Everything -- if you happen to be in the vicinity of a bookstore, pick it up) that boxed stuff is horrid, compared to making actual pasta with actual cheese.

But, well, sometimes I just want something out of a box. (And our seven-year-old ALWAYS does, for he has the insane and tasteless taste buds of a child.) In those cases, I always went back to Kraft, until we started shopping at Whole Foods and bought a pack of Annie's to try out -- very skeptically in my case, as I'd had a lot of off-brand stuff that failed to live up to the Kraft ideal. Even so-called "premium" and "deluxe" stuff like the Velveeta Shells and Cheese was just totally weird and off-putting.

But, heresy of heresies, it turns out that the Annie's stuff is actually BETTER than Kraft. Both the regular box with the powder, and this stuff with the cheese-gel, taste better than Kraft, through some feat of food science alchemy. Try 'em out. Personally, I give the nod to the Deluxe over the regular, just because it's twice as easy to make (no mixing milk, butter, and powder -- just rip the pouch and mix with the noodles), and "easy to make" is pretty much the whole point of boxed food; but it is a lot more expensive, so if you're price-conscious and willing to put forth a bit of effort, get the regular Annie's.

(Or, better yet, get that Bittman book, and learn to make pasta with sage and parmesan for the same price and just about as much work...

Annie's Deluxe macaroni and cheese comes with a pouch of cheese sauce, which tastes better than any dry powder variety and it is quicker to mix. Regardless of how thoroughly I mix the cheese powder, milk and butter, the dry powder varieties do not taste as good as Annie's Deluxe. Our 3 year old really enjoys Annie's Deluxe and I feel better offering her this rather than Kraft macaroni and cheese. Even if the taste wasn't as good as Kraft, I would choose Annie's since the ingredients are natural and some are organic. Kraft uses artificial color in their dry powder macaroni and cheese, though I don't think they do in their deluxe version. Kids (and adults) don't need artificial colors!

I would give Annie's Deluxe a 5 if they would reduce the sodium content and make a Deluxe version that included whole wheat pasta and was ALL organic (currently only some of the dry powder versions are all organic). And while I am creating my dream version, I would give Annie's a 10 if they would enrich it with some calcium and other vitamins and make a whole wheat bunny shape version! :) My big hangup is that the sodium is too high (like all the other brands). It would still taste great with a lot less salt (if kids are not given high sodium in the first place, their taste buds don't crave it). Unless pasta is whole wheat (or other whole grain), there isn't much nutrition in it, so whole wheat pasta that is enriched is the way to go! Annie's offers many varieties that include some of the improvements I am looking for, but it would be great if they would include them all in one version.

Boxed macaroni and cheese is truly junk food no matter who the manufacturer, but Annie's is doing great things to make it better. Knowing that macaroni and cheese is often "kid food" is reason enough to improve it nutritionally.

The price is reasonable on Amazon and at WalMart, however most of the grocery chains and Wholefoods charge too much! The best price I found was at Annie's home website when they offered 25% off and free shipping

Ah, it's a definitly American story - in 1969 friends Mo Siegel and Wyck Hay of Colorado began selling the herbal teas that they had previously only made for themselves. From such small beginnings came that famous tea company - Celestial Seasonings.

Among Celestial Seasonings' many products is Peppermint, an herbal infusion that is based on peppermint leaves, pure and simple. Now, I must admit that I put off trying this tea for years; after all, I am not a big peppermint fan. But, I must say that this tea tastes great! I love this tea with a spot of honey, or with milk and sugar - it makes a great late night drink. But, it also makes a very interesting iced tea!

So, if you want to try a fascinatingly different herbal tea, then get Celestial Seasoning's peppermint tea

These are a little more crumbly than some of Nana's other cookies that I tried before I found out I should be on a gluten free diet. But, they are a whole lot better than any I've been able to bake on my own. They are good and spicy...just the way I like my gingerbread. :-

I used this product as a supplement for my dog and her puppies for almost 4 months. Its high fat and protein content is needed for her ability to produce milk and keep healthy, and their energy and growth. I preferred the evaporated in cans rather than reconstituting the powdered version.

I've been using the Stevia packets for over a year now and recommend it to everyone I know. Some of the packets do contain hardened powder, but this has no effect on the sweetness. As mentioned before, just put the Stevia in first, then add hot beverage. There is no need for the powder to dissolve, the sweetness is dispersed in the beverage and the remains (I suppose) are the inulin dietary fiber. They have been using it in Japan for 30 years with no apparent ill effects. From what I've read, the artifical sweetener industry put pressure on the FDA to have it banned in the 90's and that is why it has to be marketed in the USA as a dietary fiber and not a sweetener

I am thrilled with this product...the taste is great the price was excellent! Being a diabetic for 44 years having used many artificial sweetner products during this time, I am so excited there is now an easily accessible product, which is natural not filled with chemicals! I'm hoping that the word will get out to diabetics everywhere, just how great SweetLeaf's SteviaPlus actually is. Thanks so much!

Always liked the taste of darjeeling tea. True to the form, the really good stuff is quite expensive, but then there is Twinnings - to me it's the best of affordable teas.
Bonus for sloppy people: it's hard to oversteep. With many other teas if you steep it longer than indicated the tea taste becomes bitter and harsz. Not so with this one

Unquestionably the most refined of teas, Darjeeling comes from a region in the Indian (West Bengalese) Himalayas close to the Nepalese border, 7000 ft above sea level. Originating with the small-time, private, mid-19th century plantations of a British civil surgeon named Dr. Campbell, tea has long since transformed the region into a major economic center, with over 80 running gardens producing over 10 million kgs (over 22 million lbs) of tea on a total area of almost 20,000 hectares (approximately 75 square miles), and employing over 50,000 people on a permanent basis, with a further 15,000 being hired during the plucking season (March - November). The area's natural climate with its mixture of rainfall, sunshine and rich soil makes for a very distinctive flavor, and to be called "Darjeeling," tea *must* have been grown *and* processed in that particular region.

Darjeeling tea comes in several harvest varieties or "flushes": the lighter Easter harvest or first flush, and the stronger Spring harvest or second flush, which has an unmistakeably fruity, Muscatel-like note. (There is also a Summer harvest or third flush, which is even stronger than the tea from the second harvest, but it is somewhat less refined and therefore less popular than the first two varieties.) Twinings' variety is a second flush tea with a subtle, quintessentially Darjeeling perfume; a great introduction to this region's exquisite teas that will hopefully make you curious for more

This peanut brittle has great taste and just the right amount of peanuts. The pieces are a medium thickness and not too thin. The only negative comment I have is the can arrived with brittle in lots of small pieces, I don't know if this is due to shipping or not.

I was looking for a pancake/waffle mix with natural ingredients and no hydrogenated vegetable oil (trans fats) and tried Canterbury Naturals Old Fashioned Pancake Waffle Mix. I followed the mixing directions, added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and these pancakes tasted very close to my Mom's homemade recipe but without the fuss. The pancakes have a tender texture and great taste. My family loves these pancakes and so do I.

OK, I'm eating this stuff, and I don't eat cereal.

What's that tell you? It tells you it's pretty good.

And it's organic, so I tell myself I am helping out my body by eating it (which is probably not true.)

At $3 per box delivered, I don't think I'd buy this, but with an Amazon deal I got them for $2 each, and now I am considering loading in a bazillion of 'em.

This is a Prime member's find.

Maybe I'll mix in the rest of the flavors, 6 boxes at a time.

Comes to $.40 per bowl, not counting the milk and half banana

I am very pleased with the Timothy's Breakfast Blend. This particular batch was from the "old" fill where the pods are rounded on both the top and bottom. Remarkably though, they have not locked up my Senseo. I'm pleased with the quality of coffee - especially for the price I paid.

I agree with another reviewer who said that these aren't as good as the strawberries. However, they are still quite tasty in cereal and I have also used them in baked goods like scones, where they add a nice flavor without turning the batter all purple like fresh berries do. Another advantage over fresh blueberries is that you never get any moldy ones

Nonni's Biscotti is a good quality and tasty Biscotti. It is also available in most stores and supermarkets. Occasionally supermarkets have sales on Nonni's Biscotti, and when they do, It is much more cost effective then buying their product online which is higher priced. Overall, It is a good buy when Amazon can compete with those sales prices

Many of Bahlsen's cookies are too sweet and floury for my taste, but these light flaky cookies don't taste stale and are not too rich but are nice and do not taste like sugared cardboard. I don't crave these but when you eat them, you realize that these are better than the average boxed cookies and unexpectedly delicate and fresh tasting given the supermarket price.

Ah, it's a definite American story - in 1969 friends Mo Siegel and Wyck Hay of Colorado began selling the herbal teas that they had previously only made for themselves. From such small beginnings came that famous tea company - Celestial Seasonings.

Among Celestial Seasonings' many products is Lemon Zinger, an herbal infusion that is based on lemons, hibiscus, rosehips and lemon grass. As you can tell from those ingredients, this tea lives up to its name, having a real lemony zing to it!

It wasn't too long ago that I broke out of my black tea-only phase, and began drinking herbal infusions; well this tea came as a real revelation to me. It's good hot, and I really enjoy it when I have a cold or similar illness. But, it also makes a great iced tea, with its lemoniness providing some great relief on a hot summer day. Overall, I love this tea, and give it my highest recommendations

This tea smells like lemon sours! What a great fragrance. This auburn shaded brew tastes lemony with a slight hint of lemon peel bitterness. I imagine it would taste good with some sweetener. Pretty good but not my favorite.

Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.

Quote from the box:

"The greatest thing in the world is to know how to belong to ourselves." Montaigne

They were great, my groom is a huge cashew fan as is my mom and both were more than pleased. They are not heavily salted at all, we were pleasantly surprised, the salt is more of a fine powder than what you would expect from a salted product. They always live upto having the best peanuts in VA, we send them to people all over the country and they are all hooked

I drink hot and cold tea now instead of diet soda. After trying many different brands and types, I've centered in on Yogi teas. They have great flavors. I drink Green tea in the AM and switch to herbals once I get to the office. Of the several Green tea flavors Yogi makes, I prefer the Kombucha. Give it a try

I've had the other Nana's No Gluten Cookie Bars in Berry Vanilla, and they aren't that good. But, the Chocolate Munch flavor is good. They are more moist, have a good flavor and a little crunch. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that the texture is a little bit crumbly. I will be buying these again

This topping was more delicious than I imagined it would be on cheese tortellini. The ingredents are flavorful and fresh. The sauce is chunky and loaded with spices-- not a mild sauce, good for those who like food with a kick. I'm glad it came in a four-pack, because I want to share it with my friends

A crowd pleaser! Bruschetta is simply and delicious. Chunky tomatoes, fresh artichokes and black olive on crusty ciabatta bread is farm fresh and addicting! Also fantastic over grilled fish, served with pasta or a pizza topping. We love it as a dip with flat crackers! Indulge and enjoy....Buon appetito!

Thinking beyond the ingredients is essential for our environment. Our fresh sauces are made with convenience in mind (microwave, freezer and dishwasher safe - great to reuse for leftovers, storage, seedling gardens, art projects...your creativity is the limit.) without sacrificing flavor

The sticky rice is perfect, just microwave it in the container it comes in for 2 min. The paper thin wraps are very small and it is a bit difficult to roll. The result is a bit of a mess but tastes great. I put a small amount of crab meat next to the rice. Each pack comes with 10 wraps, a container of rice, and one soy sauce pack. The calorie count is 340. But with 1/2 it is a reasonable 170 and is enough for a lunch. I bought it when it was a gold box item for $10. It is worth that, but I will not purchase again for a higher price. Overall it is easy to make, tastes great and is a great option to have around since it does not require any refrigeration

I ordered this when it was the gold box deal and I would order again even at the higher price. Reading the reviews just reaffirms the old adage that you can't please everyone. I'm happy that there is no added flavor in the rice. The rice is quite tasty as it is. Have we gone to a culture that has to modify everything? In today's world we don't taste what we prepared to eat. We only taste the condiments we pour onto or into it. I thought the wraps where big enough. How hard can it be to roll sushi for goodness sakes. I thought the salt taste in the wraps added a little rush to the flavor when I bit into the sushi. All in all I think this is a great option to lunch and a good value. Having to roll your own helps you to slow down your eating and allows to feel full just about the time you munch on the last bite. Tomorrow, I think I'll add some tuna! Yummy

I really like the Nature Valley Cinnamon Granola Bars and have for some time. However, I can no longer find them in the grocery stores in my locale. The boxes of Cinnamon bars stopped being available some years ago, and recently they were no longer available in the variety pack either. It was a pleasure being able to purchase them again

Garlic Chicken is my favorite Ensavor flavor - not too sweet, not too sharp, not too "garlicy".

As a diabetic, I need to eat six times a day, even when I'm on the road. When I have a microwave available, I use it. But when I don't, I park my car facing south, leave the pouch on the dashboard, and heat it up that way.

Each Ensavor meal is ready to eat, nutritionally balanced, and portion controlled. Getting hungry while away from home used to cause me great anxiety, as my tradeoff was a diabetically unsound meal vs. delaying my eating, and enduring headaches and light-headedness. Ensavor really satisfies. Bravo

As a southern-born boy my husband is pretty picky about his peanuts. When he discovered this brand he couldn't stop talking about the great taste. He was delighted to get these as a gift and can't wait to share them with everyone...he says they're the next best thing to fresh

I am on a diet so these make the perfect mid day snack. 24 mini wheats per serving and I love that they are made with whole grain wheat which makes them filling. I haven't tried them with milk yet, but the strawberry frosting helps with my need for sweet. I am definitely going to buy more

As a fan of frosted Mini-Wheats I love trying all the new flavors and the strawberry delight flavor was on my mind. I expected them to be a little sweeter, but they have a delicate strawberry flavor that tastes very natural. The pink milk looks pretty with these little bites of tasty crunchy wheat floating around. Sort of a pleasing aesthetic experience that makes these perfect for an afternoon snack.

NOT instant, as the package says. To be fair, the package does also have, in somewhat smaller and less prominent print, a detailed statement telling the buyer that microwaving/cooking will be necessary. BUT if you just look at the package front, you'll get the impression you can make this like you make instant oatmeal. Not so.

I hate using microwaves, so that was a big turn-off for me.

All that said, the stuff is delicious and definitely warms me up and fills my tummy, keeping me from getting hungry better than most oatmeals do.

The texture is thicker and heartier than regular instant oatmeals, kind of a cross between a light muesli and oatmeal. I make mine, add about 2 ounces of organic skim milk, and I'm good to go. The sweetness is light and wonderful, no overly-sugary yuckiness.

Both my mom sister are gluten intolerant, so I have used many gluten free products to make cakes or other recipes for family get togethers. This is the best cake mix by far....This cake mix is just as good as wheat-based mixes. I modify it to make various kinds of cakes: coconut cake, red velvet cake, etc. It always gets rave reviews, even from those used to eating wheat-based cakes. (My mom sister can tolerate vanilla pudding, so I add one third to half a box of instant vanilla pudding - regular, not sugar free - per bag of cake mix to make it extra moist.) I also use The Gluten Free Pantry's chocolate truffle brownie mix; it is better to me than any wheat based brownie mix

Savory Choice is the best stock I've found and I love everything about it. First off, it's flavor is incomparable to any other pre-made stock product and it really tastes like what chicken stock is supposed to taste like. I shared it with my grandmother and it won even *her* stamp of approval. Secondly, I love that it is concentrated so that you make up just the amount you need, which is especially handy when you are deglazing a pan to make a sauce, for example; you don't end up with a whole quart container going bad in your fridge. Finally, if there's anything I learned from NY apt. living, I love how small the footprint is of the box, itself. It's also great to pack for backpacking trips, to keep in your desk at work, etc.
They make chicken, beef, and turkey and around the Bay Area, it's available at Whole Foods, Berkeley Bowl, Andronico's, etc.

I've used this Savory Choice product for over a year and can recommend it highly. It is delicious and easy. Inside each individual packet is a thick liquid: just add it to a cup of water to make the broth. This is not like the low-salt, low-fat powders or the canned products but more like broth you've cooked from scratch. Comes in beef, chicken, and turkey flavors. I keep it handy on my RV as well as in my kitchen

These three sauces are delicious. I think that probably the most difficult part of Indian cooking is getting the right combination of spices and flavors for the sauces. These sauces from Taaza do the hard work for you. In practically no time you can create delicious meals by adding your own fresh ingredients. You can add whatever vegetables, meat, or seafood you may have on hand to make complete meals. For example, I may add shrimp, bell peppers,and onions to one of the sauces. For another sauce I may add potatoes, cauliflower and chickpeas. You can come up with your own combinations (even though the combinations may not be authentically Indian, the sauces make it seem like they are!). Also, by reading the nutritional charts on the bottles, I know that they are healthy (unlike the food in some Indian restaurants that are loaded with calories). I know that I can feed my family rather inexpensively with these sauces and they taste like they came from a restaurant. And...my kids love these sauces too

This alternative trail mix is a uniquely delicious treat. I bought it because I love cashews and thought it would make a great snack. It did indeed! I ate the entire bag in one sitting and had to run out for more. It's a healthy snack and a great alternative to trail mix. While I haven't tried the other flavors yet I'm sure they are just as tasty! You won't be let down with this wonderful snack. Enjoy

I first tried this nut and spice delight at Costco........I had some of the samples that were offered that day and I choose to purchase the Sing Buri. My goodness this is good!! The flavors are just right. You know how a really good (Asian or French) sauce holds together and has a progression of flavors? I found that this happens with the nuts and chili and lemongrass.
Really, this is a gorgeous snack and healthy too!
Now that Amazon is offering this company's products, I ordered 2. And with the nice 10 bucks off, this is a very nice bargain!
Depending on your palate (some folks are happy with Planters nuts you know), I think you will be delighted with this choice!
Scrumptious

I don't usually buy this cereal in the supermarket because it can run almost $5.00 a box in manhattan but when I saw it here I couldn't resist at a little over $3 dollars a box. All the nutrients and fiber that you can cram into a 24.5 box and a great taste too. Jam-packed with raisins,almost a guilty pleasure.....and the flakes hold up longer than most other cereals of this type

I've always wanted to try gourmet salts, but didn't want to risk spending the money in case I didn't like them (or they ended up all tasting just like regular salt). Dave's Gourmet offers a great way to try six varieties, all in one convenient shaker. Amazon offers these salts as a three-pack, making them a good value.

Each salt really does have its own distinct "flavor". Warning: the Eurasian Black Salt has a VERY strong sulfur odor and taste (I used it successfully in a tuna salad recipe in place of hard-cooked eggs). The Smoked Salt is just as the name implies: salt crystals with a natural smoke flavor, excellent for giving indoor-cooked meats a just-grilled taste. The other four salt varieties are milder tasting and offer a nice change to standard table salt (Hawaiian Red Salt can really liven up the look of bland-colored dishes, such as pork or potatoes). Keep in mind that gourmet salts work best when sprinkled on foods after cooking (heat can alter the taste a little).

I highly recommend this product

If you have kids sensitive to food colorings or are just trying to avoid artificial ingredients, these are great treats to have. My children have only recently made the adjustment from commercial, artificially flavored and colored candies. So, they are picky about organic treats. These lollipops have passed the test with my eight children. Their quality control seems to be pretty good (something I don't always see with organic foods), and the flavors and colors are really nice (not boring or tasteless). I keep these on hand to trade for candies others give them that they are not able to eat (due to sensitivities with food coloring)

I LOVE the white sesame crunch. It has just enough flavor to keep you munching. It's better than a candy bar or bag of chips. Hard to find in the area and no problem ordering it. Same good quality - same great taste.
I'd recommend it - but don't expect tons of flavor and spice - that it doesn't have.

This is a good snack to carry in a purse for when I need a quick snack. It is high protein and low sugar which is good for my diabetes requirements. Also it is easy to eat because of its small size. I like the zip lock bag so that I can eat two or three and close up the bag. I am always looking for quick and easy snacks for my diet requirements. This hits the target and also hits the taste spot, too!

If you expect it to taste like fried chicken, you will be disappointed as the other reviewer was. BUT..........if you just enjoy it for how it tastes it is great! Quick meals galore, add to rice, stuffing, or pasta. You can even clean off the gravy and BBQ it! I think it is one of the better tasting "fake" meats around

These are my favorite of the 100 calorie packs (so far) Fun mix of different flavors and textures in the crackers, plus they have a nice spice mix that really gives them a nice zesty flavor

After having this rice at a neighbors dinner party I ordered some for my family. I was eager to eat it again and tried making the Rice Creole for lunch last weekend. 20 minutes later I mixed in some cheese and rolled it in a few tortillas. Easy to make and goes great with any meal or as a meal itself..

These crunchy snacks are healthy, addictive, and tasty. I love the crisp texture, the flavors, and the perfect size for a snack. Much better than the Apple Chips that have all that added junk and sugar. These Sensible Foods Snacks are just dried fruit! Love the apple harvest flavor best, then tropical blend. A favorite snack item

I love these as a filling snack. They are also satisfying if you are craving something crunchy. I keep a few bags in my car for the trip home from work or if I am running late in the morning and can't get breakfast. They also have a nice flavor, really natural not artificial tasting

This is the best breakfast cereal I have ever found. The low sugar content, whole wheat, and yummy blueberries and strawberries made it my favorite healthy breakfast and snack food. Now it has disappeared from store shelves and it isn't available online either. Kellogg's website does not list this product under the list of discontinued products. So why is it not available? My family used to purchase about 2-3 dozen of these per month and I know many other people bought this product. I find kids and adults searching for this product at grocery stores and looking dejected as they helplessly purchase some other product instead. I hope Kellogg notices that there's a market for this product

Kellogg's Fruit Harvest Strawberry Blueberry packs a huge punch with a great taste and it contains no fat, no trans fats and no cholesterol. It is relatively low in sugar and carbohydrates, too.

Despite the fact that this is one of the best tasting breakfast cereals out there I am disappointed in its vitamin content. The artwork on the box leads you to believe that this cereal just has to be very healthy for you. Yes, it has 25 % of your recommended daily intake of iron, niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, riboflavin, thiamin and folic acid; but I expected this product to be healthier still. I will take off one star for that to make this a four star review.

It is low in sugar just as they say it is. However, if you aren't getting the proper amount of exercise you need, then the extra sugar in the strawberries, blueberries and corn syrup could turn into sugar inside your body. As always, when planning a diet, it helps to consult your physician before starting a new diet.

Nevertheless, the strawberries and blueberries taste delicious--even when you eat this dry and drink milk along with it. Kellogg's Fruit Harvest Cereal offers whole grain which is an important part of any healthy diet.

Overall, Kellogg's Fruit Harvest Strawberry Blueberry breakfast cereal is a great choice to start your day. Sure, it may not be the absolute healthiest cereal on your grocer's shelf but this cereal beats junk food by a mile. Buy some and enjoy today!

Love these because you can store the box in a cupboard -- no wasted refrigerator space -- and still have a good / quick meal ingredient.

My husband loves these as a light lunch or evening side dish served with butter and grated cheese. I love them in soup, especially a simple chicken broth soup -- to which I add a bit of black pepper, dill, and lemon juice.

The DaVinci tortellini are aso great

If you enjoy lemon poppyseed muffins (loaf), this is the mix for you. Plus, it is the easiest mix ever; takes just a minute to mix. Personally, I add about a tablespoon of pure lemon extract to the mix, just to kick-up the lemony flavor. My family and friends love when I make these muffins

I've only made it with added nuts, but it always comes out moist on the inside, somewhat crunchy on the outside. It has a nice strong chocolate taste and the ingredients are mostly or all organic. It didn't come out as high as the picture on the box, but that's okay for a brownie

This is a delicious choice for breakfast. I thought it wouldn't hold me from hunger for long because it was flakes, but it really does a good job! It stays crunchy considerably well, and has just the right sweetness. Tastes healthy, but not in a gross way :0) You feel like you are making a good decision to eat it. Definitely worth it, because of the volume of cereal you get

The price of this product (and many others) via Amazon is excellent compared to the "Whole Paycheck" types of "healthy" supermarkets. I'm totally pleased with this cereal. It tastes great, but surely the sugar content boosts its taste appeal. Organic or not, sugar is sugar, and many have been advised to keep their distance from it. Nature's Path should consider using alternate sweeteners, such as, organic of course, brown rice syrup or raw blue agave syrup. The macrobiologists would be jazzed

I really LIKE this cereal, as opposed to..... well, this is something I can eat safely (without gluten). I put all those extra bags in the freezer but will definitely eat them up. Another popular GF cereal is so HARD and extra-crunchy that is beats up my tongue. This is quite tasty and just the right normal "flake" texture

Sometimes there is an unusual aftertaste in wheat free foods from the grains that are used as wheat substitutes, but I don't find that to be the case with this cereal. It gets a little soggy if you don't eat it quickly enough, and I add dried cranberries to give it a little more interest, but overall it is good! I do not find it to be too sweet-I'd say it's slightly sweeter than plain corn flakes

First, remember that you'll be getting a lot of cereal when you order this value pack - months worth if it's just for one or two people. Fortunately, it doesn't have too strong or strange of a flavor so you shouldn't get tired of it. I suggest adding a sliced banana or apple, or even a shake of a honey-sweetened cereal as it's not the most interesting cereal to eat on its own. My biggest recommendation - do NOT eat it plain with soy milk, as the grain flavors reinforce each other to the point of being a bit nauseating

This is by far the best bagged popcorn I've ever eaten. The smoked gouda flavor isn't really subtle, but who wants subtle in a snack like this? It comes out and whacks you on the head--HEY, I'M POWDERED GOUDA--and has a great, full-bodied flavor.

I recently tried Oogie's Smoked Gouda, White Cheddar, and Sundried Tomato popcorn...WOW. I've never tasted anything like it! Very tasty with just the right amount of salt. And to think these snacks are heart healthy. My kids loved Oogie's! It's great to have such a healthy, delicious snack to feed them after school. I will definitely buy Oogie's again and serve at parties, too! If you love popcorn, do yourself a favor and buy this stuff.

This bruschetta topping is the perfect appetizer to throw together when guests drop by! This balsamic vinegar tomato based recipe is perfectly prepared with chunky fresh (never from a can!!) tomatoes and plenty of imported greek capers.

We prepare our bruschetta toppings in a traditional way by hand prepping, chopping, picking and visually inspecting every ingredient so that they taste like they were just made fresh; we then prepare them in small batches so you taste every delicious ingredient. WARNING: May have urge to consume the entire jar upon opening! Buon appetito!

Well, it's not a BARGAIN, but on the other hand, it's not unreasonable, if I take pains never to specify free shipping, and it gets brought to my door.

I purchased the loose tea leaves from Amazon at a fair price quick shipping. English friends suggested PJ Tips Tea, which we ordered from another online site. Twinning's blows it away. The Earl Grey Irish Blend are great both on the pallet to the nose

Grape Nuts Trail Mix Crunch are great. I remember the regular grape nuts that my mom had, yuck...she added almost as much sugar as there was cereal to make them taste good. But Trail Mix Crunch is a different story - they are great, nothing more needed. They added a little honey, almonds and raisins for more flavor and there are 5g of fiber per serving to boot! These are also easier on the jaw than plain grape nuts, they are not as difficult to chew, but still crunchy almost like a granola. Definitely a family favorite!

I would have to say that the only downfall is the price...they could be a bit less expensive, which is true of most granola-like cereals.

I order this product all the time from Amazon. It's an excellent cereal...delicious...great for your diet and digestive system. I'm actually writing this review to commend Amazon on their customer service. I have ordered this many times and each order has come quickly and with no problems. My last order however did present a minor problem. I contacted Amazon and IMMEDIATELY received the BEST customer service I have ever received from any company...both on line and off. I would never hesitate to order anything from Amazon. You can count of them to handle each and every order with the upmost consideration and superior service. Sometimes there might be a slight delay if a product is backlogged but aside from that you can trust Amazon to give you the BEST SERVICE POSSIBLE!!! Thank you Amazon

I normally love nice fruit combo's but have found that most mixes (especially powder mixes) don't cut it. This one honestly was not bad. Now, mind you, it still has that Crystal Light Taste, but if you are a fan of their other mixes, then you should be ok with the taste :).

I would say that it is worth the Money

I have been a long time lover of black licorice and dark chocolate. But since recently discovering RJs, I would have to say, if given a choice between a piece of the best dark chocolate and a piece of this licorice, hands down I'd be going for the latter. I was astonishly surprised with my first bite - wonderfully soft and intensely flavorful. I enjoyed the fact that it didn't stick to me teeth or make me feel that I was having to give my mouth a workout to enjoy it. Amazon offers this at a great price too. I've paid considerably more

I just love this black licorice. It's soft, it's chewy and oh soooo
good. I've loved black licorice since I was a child. This is the closest
licorice to what I had when I was little. When I was a kid, there was a little store around the corner of my grandmother's house and they used to sell little boxes of soft licorice. I haven't been able to find that licorice since the store closed. I keep stocked up with this licorice, too. It's the only candy I eat

I purchased this candy for my father and my father-in-law. They both thought it was some of the best licorice they had ever tasted. They liked the fact that it was soft and easy to chew but the outstanding characteristic was the flavor. Both of them could not stop talking about the natural, "old time" flavor of the candy. I think they will be disappointed if I don't buy it again

You can get real licorice in New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, The Netherlands, Sweden, England, Finland and even Denmark. But not in the US. We use anise oil. Real licorice is found in RJ's and it makes a huge difference. The flavor is akin to dark chocolate and very nice if you are a licorice fan.

I have an old, rather beat-up percolator that I bought for $1 from the neighbor lady during a garage sale. It is terrific. Easy to make the coffee, the coffee tastes great and it takes up little counter space. But I would get these grounds in my coffee cup, and I didn't like it.

Enter the percolator filter! These are great, because the grounds really have no where to go. My grocery store used to carry (but have stopped, which isn't good) the disc filters, which just sit under the grounds, but don't wrap around them in any way. So the grounds can still sneak into my cup (though it is better than nothing).

Also these make disposal easy. Just tip your percolator basket thingie (I have a percolator but am clearly not an expert on them) upside down, the filter falls out and you are ready for another pot of joe.

Thank you, Melitta

Here is proof that a cereal can be good for you. Nature's Path HempPlus Granola Cereal is Low in Fat(5 grams per), low in carbs (about 25 grams per vs 45+ for a regular cereal), moderate in fiber and very low in sodium. PLUS is has healthy omega 3 fats from the Hemp seeds.

Nature's Path HempPlus Granola Cereal has a mild sweetness that is very pleasant and is not over powering. It is easy to chew and not hard like a lot of other granola based cereals. In milk is is very tasty and doesn't get soggy for quite some time. It is ever delicious right our of the box.

Bottom line: this is one great tasting and healthy cereal

Agreed, there's no reason for these people to put in so much salt. On the other hand, there's no way I'd confuse this stuff with Campbell's. Like most cream soups, it benefits from a bit of added milk, but we like it a LOT

I buy Baxter Soups by the case because I am disabled and can't get to the grocery store. These soups are restaurant quality and with a dollop of sour cream, you have a real treat. Smooth as velvet, they will have you either gulping them down and wanting more or savoring every spoonful

My kids love their Macaroni Cheese but one day all we had was a generic brand. They didn't eat it all that well (Kraft really is the best) so I decided to try to make it a little better for them. Follow the recipe on the box with a couple exceptions. Put one slice of velveeta chees in while melting the butter (I melt the butter while the noodles are draining so as to melt the butter and velveeta faster) and add 1/3 cup milk. What you'll have is a less expensive version of the really creamy macaroni and cheese that Kraft sells for a lot more money. By adding extra milk and cheese they're even getting more calcium. My kids love it when I throw in hot dogs and even peas so feel free to throw in other things since it's so cheesy (the extra cheesy sauce will take things like peas that kids don't normally eat and make them taste good). Give it a try and see what you and/or your kids think

My wife first was buying another Orville Redenbacher brand locally called "Honey Butter"...it was nationally discontinued....so when this came out she was happy again.

Now it's no longer carried locally. This merchant has a good price and it shipped fast.

Similar, (VERY), to Oatbran Flakes. I prefer the latter, but this is more..."nutty". I think they're both 10s on the "FILLING" scale. And both (since they are from Nature's Path) are fantastically wholesome, deliSH

These are tasty on their own but i especially like them crushed, tossed into some yogurt with some blueberries or bananas. The only problem with this is that even in bulk Amazon is expensive. When they are on sale it's usually 2 dollars per box so the equivalent quantity to what they offer here is 12 boxes which would be 24 dollars. Amazon is selling it for 33 dollars

I use Bob's Red Mill wheat gluten flour for making seitan, a wheat-gluten "meat" familiar to vegans and vegetarians. It is very easy to use, is obviously high-quality, and keeps well. I've found Bob's works the best out of all the brands for this use. I just wish that it was organic and that they made bigger bags (the case comes with a lot of packaging, which seems like a waste)

I just got a case of these last week and I am back ordering today. I purchased these because I am a diabetic. I look for lower carb, high protein, high fiber products. These are the best snacker that I have found yet. I have tried genisoy, kay's and others, but none compare to the fabulous texture, crunch and perfect seasoning. I was so impressed, I shared with my 23 year old son for his opinion. He asked to have a bag to himself because they were so good. He compared to a ranch-style corn type pringle chip without all the greasiness. I am also ordering the bar-b-que style because the ranch was so good

Though I'm not into so called "guilt-free" foods and eat mainly fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans and low-fat dairy, I have days when I need to make sure I get enough protein in a pinch. These soy chips often fill the gap, as with a new baby in the house (who is cared for full time by his mom in lieu of various mechanical and other devices such as swings, bouncers, teddy-bears with womb sounds, etc) I'm not cooking quite so much. Plus, I don't have much taste for meat, though I'm not a vegetarian.

I don't eat many processed foods, and these soy chips are on the lower end of the processed side of things, in my opinion, as they don't have a bunch of dyes, perservatives, etc, just the soy flour, rice, oil, salt, spices...one could do much worse.

In particular, I have found them helpful for road trips when you don't know when you'll encounter something decent to eat (and don't have room for a cooler) and for plane trips. Along with a few pieces of fruit, I've been carried through many a dicey food situation with these non-perishable soy chips. A 2 hour ride to the airport, 2+ hour flight and average 2 hour luggage retrieval and dash to hotel or other lodgings is a long time to go without something to eat in these days of superb airline service. Besides, who ever really liked, or much less could argue the sound nutrition of airplane food anyway?

The chips pack a lot of heart healthy soy protein (about 24 grams per 385 calorie bag), are low in fat and in sugar. Also, the bag can be compressed in to a much smaller size for carry-on economy if you don't mind some crushed chips. They may not be a salad and healthy entree cover page meal, but they are a giant leap up from the vast majority of vending machine, convenience store, and grocery snack aisle trash. The downside to them is that they do have relatively high sodium, but if the rest of your diet is pretty low in salt and you aren't having trouble with blood pressure, you're probably ok there.

I really love the new amazon.com grocery venture because for one, I can get these soy chips in 12 packs. The price works out to be just over 50% of the cost per bag that I'd pay in any grocery store where I live. When I two cases at a time to get over the $25 barrier, I get free shipping which really seals the deal. My dad kids me that I'm an amazon.com junkie and whenever he sees a package from amazon.com in his box, he knows who's sent it. This is not a prompted plug for amazon, I just really like their service, grocery especially

I originally discovered this pasta at my local QFC supermarket at $4.49 per 12OZ unit. The price point being a little rich for my blood, I only bought it on certain occasions. Buying it from Amazon in 6 packs at $2.33 per 12OZ unit and the free shipping option, along with the $5.00 off promo code that cuts back the per unit price about 25 cents, makes it a much better buy and now a regular addition to the dinner table.

Thanks Amazon for the fair deal and stocking Al Dente Pastas.

I was recently diagnosed with celiac disease, so I turned to Kellogg's corn flakes for my breakfasts, because I figured corn was safe. Little did I know that malt flavoring contains gluten!

These were a serendipitous substitute - SO natural and tasty! It's refreshing these days to find a food with only three straightforward ingredients (corn, grape juice, salt). I ought to buy them in bulk!

My title pretty much sums it up. The are light, crunchy little nuts with just enough salt to add a little punch. My husband and I love these. A great way to add healthy soy protein to your diet. Great for on-the-go and at-your-desk snacks. Won't fill you up, but will satisfy when you just "want a little something"

I think that some people have complained that this popcorn is bland, but that's what it's supposed to be.... It's a product that is as healthy as you want it to be- you decide. :) Although I do like to add salt, I have found that I don't really care to add a lot of other flavors to it. This is probably because my mom used to air-pop popcorn when we were kids (and add her own flavors) and it kind of reminds me of that. I guess she didn't add very much. :) It seems to "pop" better than other varieties I've tried and it doesn't leave you with greasy fingers. Good job, Newman

We love the taste of Illy coffees when brewed in our espresso machine-- smooth, never bitter. You cannot distinguish the flavor of the decaf from the flavor of the regular espresso.

AIlly's vacuum-packed canister has a unique, design and is reusable.

*****
I enjoy Numi's Moonlight Spice Orange Spice White Tea. It has a distinctive orangey taste and a light spicy taste (from the cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and ginger), sort of like a light, subtle, orangey chai tea. It is different and unique and all of the flavors are much more subtle than a chai-type tea, quite adventurous. It brews for a lengthier time (7-8 minutes) and is worth the wait.

Moonlight Spice is kosher, certified organic and contains amazing ingredients: organic cinnamon, organic orange peel, organic cloves, fair trade certified organic Pai Mu Tan white tea, organic hibiscus, organic allspice, organic ginger, organic schizandra berries, organic lemongrass and dried lime. The schizandra berry is a major tonic herb in Chinese medicine used to assist the body in dealing with stress, to improve memory function, and to assist with many various physical issues.

There are no oils or natural flavorings used, unlike many teas; it is also sustainable in that all packaging materials are biodegradable and recyclable, the carton is made of 100% post-consumer waste, and cello wrap is not used. Numi says that all their tea bags "are made of natural fiber paper, not the trendy, "silky" see-though nylon tea bags".

On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Numi's Orange Spice White Tea is like no other. We use an abundance of all natural, organic ingredients for an authentic cup, without using oils or flavorings. This sublime tea ingeniously blends premium Organic White Pai Mu Tan tea with orange, citrus, and spice. Pai Mu Tan is exclusively the top two leaves and a bud of the tea plant and can only be picked the day before the buds unfurl. White tea is the least oxidized and processed of all teas, making it supremely healthy. Smooth and delicate, Moonlight Spice balances citrus notes of orange, schizandra, Numi's own Dry Desert Lime, and luxurious spice for the most divine experience. Transcend into a peaceful moment through its luminous hue and enchanting fragrance."

The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but enjoy white tea, this will probably be one of the best you've ever had.

My husband and I were fans of GeniSoy soy crisps but I ordered these because they were less expensive. We are never going back! Robert's cheddar soy crisps are delicious! The cheese flavor and crisp texture are the best we've had in a soy crisp. A wonderful snack - I can't wait to try the other flavors

a local gourmet shop sells these for $3.50 each and just can't keep them on the shelves so I have to visit that store every week in hopes I catch the day he gets fresh stock. since these sell on the web for over $5 each, I was thrilled when Amazon had them for almost $2 each when you buy a 12-pack carton. I have only tried a half a dozen nutty flavors thus far, with my favorite being the Pumpkin. However I stocked up on the Almond because they are very dense in healthy high fiber toasty almonds, just a hint of sweet and coconut, and you need only a few of these 1-2cm almond cubes as a snack to tide you over between meals

Twinings was founded in London, England in 1706, and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. English Breakfast tea is a mixture of black teas from Sri Lanka, which are blended to produce a smooth yet flavorful tea. Though often served during breakfast, this tea tastes excellent all day long.

OK, let's get down to brass tacks - this is another great tea. Harder to over-steep than some of the teas I have known, it consistently produces a smooth and highly drinkable cup. Highly conventional in its taste, English Breakfast tea has a robust flavor that stands up well to lemon and milk, which makes it a favorite among those who like to accessorize their tea. Plus, I must say that this tea is wonderful iced - add some lemon and sugar, and you've got the right tea for a hot afternoon!

And that's my review. If you want an excellent all-round tea, hot or iced, one that goes well with any food, then English Breakfast tea is for you. If you want tea from a great tea producer, them Twinings is for you. I highly recommend Twinings' English Breakfast tea to all, even those not normally into tea drinking. (Or, perhaps especially to those not normally into tea drinking!

Loose tea is so much better than tea bags. I have two cups every morning, and sometimes want more. Even the second cup doesn't get bitter or harsh. Of course you have to drink it with no sugar or cream.

I've shifted to drinking Pura Vida coffee after searching for some time for a rich blend that is not too bitter or burnt. This batch worked great for espresso and gets strong recommendation for that use. I often drink coffee made with espresso roast to get a very dark cup of coffee and it was not terrific for that. My preference is the Pura Vida French Roast for drinking coffee and this one for espresso

This fruit is great for a quickie cobbler. Just pour a can in a 9"by9" pan. Add cobbler topping (mix together, cup sugar, cup flour, 2tps baking powder, and 1 egg.) Sprinkle over fruit. Pour melted butter over top, sprinkle a little cinnamon over top and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Try it, I've gotten lots of compliments on this and it's simple and fast. If you really want to have more fruit, try adding a can of rasberries to the mix!

I love these crackers for several reasons. They are absoutely delicious, to begin with. And they do not use ingredients like "partially hydrogenated soybean oil." They are hard to find in stores. It's a hit or miss thing, here in the Northeast. So I ordered from Amazon. Propmpt delivery, and ease of purchasing will keep me coming back

My son eats an organic diet, and I thought this would be a perfect snack. Oops, I received the non-organic variety. Contacted Amazon, no problem, keep those and we'll send you organic. The label said "organic" on shipment 2, but upon opening the box, they weren't organic. Amazon decided to refund my money. I really wanted to try the produce, and found another vendor, no problems and my son enjoyed these snacks. If Amazon could get their act together, I would order these again

I bought these for a snack for my five year old son to bring to kindergarten (per his request for fruit loops at snack time). I needed to find a single serving size for each child in the class. Of course the children eat them dry... With this it allowed for him to bring them to school 4 times and serve everyone in his class. His teacher tells me they are one of the class favorites at snack time, easy to serve, easy clean up, economical........everyones happy!!

The muffins are plain without add-ins, but the box is a plain muffin mix, so you know that before you bake it. I've added apples and apple sauce and cinnamon and they turned out great. I've also tried blueberries and those turned out good as well.

The muffins have a nice nutty flavor and don't need any butter to taste good (I'm a butter fanatic, by the way).

If you like nuts and you're looking for a healthy, great tasting snack, you can't go wrong with Almond Crunch! My husband and I recently eliminated high fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated soybean oil from our diet and we feel so much better. Trying to find tasty snacks that don't contain these products is not easy so we were thrilled to find Mrs. Mays Naturals. We love the Cashew Crunch as well

When I stumbled upon Sahale Valdosta Blend, I was in heaven. It's healthy with a wonderful combination of flavors. It's high in antioxidants and low in sodium and I can actually eat it (with all of my
sensitive GI issues). I actually eat it for a meal when I'm on the road.
You've got to try it

These are soft, not leathery which is perfect for small children. There are no worries about choking and they are very delicious.
I gave these out at Halloween and at parties and the little ones and the parents loved them.
They are also great crumbled up into hot cereal and yogurt instead of sugar

I discovered these nut blends when Costco carried the large bag of Valdosta Blend. Being a nut lover, the combination of pecan/pepper/cranberry sounded like a different twist, probably good on a salad. Boy howdy! They are great on salad, but are perfect straight out of the bag as well! Yummy! Yes, they are spicy. Yes, they are different. Don't be afraid of the spices...they add a whole new twist on a boring chicken dish or plain salad. Enjoy

They're delicious, nutrious, and far more flavorful than most healthy snacks on the market. For those who like spice and exotic flavors these are sure to quickly become a favorite. I also really love the 2oz size, as it is just enough to really feel satisfied and not so much that you eat more than you should. I am hooked!

These are a great snack! The pumpkin seeds are fresh and lightly marinated in Tamari. They satisfy a salt craving without being too salty or damaging to the diet. They're also a great source of fiber for those who are improving their diets. We love them, and have even introduced them to other family members who were surprised by how good they were.

I was also pleased by how quickly they were shipped to us. We had them within 4 days even though we used standard shipping

These cookies are great - a perfect breakfast when you're on the go. My only concern about ordering them from Amazon again is experation dates. I ordered a 24 pack of Oatmeal Raisin and a 24 pack of Fruit Nut. The Fruit Nut's expired 3 weeks after shipment, and the Oatmeal Raisin expired 5-6 weeks from shipment. I don't plan on eating them quite that fast, so I'll have a bunch of expired cookies on my hands. I've got them in the freezer, so hopefully that'll do the trick, but beware nonetheless.

They're much cheaper here than at the Baker's website, (12 for $15 vs. 24 for $18), so if you don't plan on eating 2 a day, order them one pack at a time. Baker's site does have a vastly wider selection, so maybe try them all first, then order from Amazon

I'm usually wary of food billed as "all-natural," as that often means "tastes kind of gross and has a weird consistency and mouth feel," but I decided that if I didn't like these, I could leave them at the office, so I ordered them anyway. Fortunately, they're very good, chewy and sweet without being overbearing. It's a good alternative to those super-tiny breakfast bars - it's not filling, but it's not insubstantial, either. One or two of these, a yogurt, and a cup of coffee or tea could be enough, especially if you're not into eating much for breakfast. Otherwise, it makes a very nice snack.

The only downside is that I got these on 11/21/06, and the expiration date stamped on the first one I tried is 12/10/06. I plan on eating two a day, so I should run through 24 quickly enough, and if you're feeding a family, it won't be a problem, but if you're just getting them for yourself and plan on only eating them every now and then, you may end up with a few that will go stale or expire. It's just something to bear in mind when ordering them, so that you don't order too many at once and then have them go bad on you

I first ordered the chocolate and oatmeal raisin cookies but we really like the fruit and nut. Altogether a great product to keep in the freezer for a quick breakfast. I have eaten them in place of my normal breakfast bar. 5 points on weight watchers, my kids enjoy them as a healthy snack.

After visiting a local store, happen to buy a box and try it out... It was absolutely delicious. Proceeded to hop online to see what prices were available and Amazon had the lowest (free shipping too) and bought 16 boxes. Use it for everything from the topping on pies, oatmeal, cookies to just bake it in the oven and stick it in a bowl for substitute popcorn

I'm not ashamed to admit it...I like my rice pudding creamy and decadent. My first batch of this had the right texture, but I found the taste somewhat lacking. It had a "sugar water" quality to it, not very creamy at all, despite the fact that the mix contains milk ingredients. So with the next batch, I substituted 1% milk for water, and the result was much more satisfying---thicker, richer, and more pudding-like.

I also made mine in a double boiler, which I would recommende. Takes slightly longer to cook, but you're much less likely to scorch the product. I think it makes for a thicker pudding also

Our son is an extremely picky eater and almost never wants to buy the school lunch. These make a really convenient substitue for sandwiches every day. We pack a cereal, a fruit and extra milk money. He can pour the milk right into the cereal container and throw the whole thing away when he's done eating. Takes 10 second to pack his lunch which is great for the morning rush!!

Best licorice on the market. I don't normally like licorice but I was looking for organic products that I could eat and this stuff is good. Normally when I think of licorice I think of real sticky or overly chewy. This is really tasty and has just the right tecture. If I had to nit pick I would say that the pakaging could be of the new aluminum bags that a German company develops that is non-plastic because plastic may not be safe for packaging food products but as far as what's available I recomend it with the highest rating. No cancer causing anti-caking agents that they use in salt at least that's what der label says. Again it has the highest standard of Organic which is USDA certified. Placing 2nd order

This is real licorice, not the licorice flavored candy you get in US supermarkets. The flavor is very strong compared to what you find in the supermarket and it is more dense and chewy.

If you love licorice you will love this.

This Finnish licorice is NOT salty

The product may look like some kind of sweet treat, but it is not. Taste is somewhat bitter from cocoa, and somewhat sour from fruit, there is a very little of sweetnes. I think it is not tasting like you would expect from the looks, and that is why all the disappointment comes from. It is just different. We call it "fake candy" and enjoy with tea. very nice healthy un-desert

Healthy, filling, this satisfies the craving for a truly rich dessert. Craving chocolate? Something chewy? Sweet? It absolutely hits the mark. The nuts do not overwhelm the taste of it, they are chopped small and just enough to complement. I am so glad I ordered this box, I am sending one home to Mom too.

These dry roasted almonds are absolutely delicious and make a nice addition to any gift basket, christmas stocking or everyday lunch bag. However, this product will not meet the needs of someone looking for an "All Natural" product. The Amazon ad should be updated to exclude that sentence. If you're looking for a delicious, savory snack that's high in protien, but is a little different than run-of-the-mill almonds, you'll enjoy these

Amazing for a pre-packaged K-cup coffee. Forms a light, frothy head when brewed and has a deep, strong flavor devoid of any bitterness or burnt taste. Strongly reminiscient of coffee you might order in a Parisian cafe

We're always looking for healthier alternatives to carbo and sugar loaded snacks for ourselves and our kids. Jerkey is one they seem to really like as do we. I have been a long time consumer of SnackMaster's Turkey and Beef Jerky. Unfortunately, my grocery store stopped carrying it so I decided to order it online. If you check the ingredients of SnackMaster's Jerky there are fewer chemicals and preservatives then other leading brands of Jerky. That's why we continue to be satisfied customers

R.C. Bigelow, Inc. was begun in 1945 by Ruth Campbell Bigelow, a tea connoisseur who wanted to offer even more taste opportunities to American tea drinkers. Among the teas that Bigelow presents is their wonderful Green Tea. Green tea is now very popular, due to its antioxidants and other health benefits.

Overall, I found this to be an excellent hot tea, with a wonderful smell and taste. But, that's not all: Bilgelow's Green Tea also makes a great iced tea! So, if you are looking for a delicious and healthy green tea, one that tastes great hot and cold, then get this one! I highly recommend it. (By the way, check out the interesting recipes on Bigelow's website!

This pudding is very easy to make - done in about 5 minutes. The texture is not as good as a cooked pudding, but it's acceptable. The chocolate flavor is very good, better than the regular chocolate flavor. The combination of low calories and simple preparation makes it a winner in my book

These Pretzels are great!! I needed an alternative to wheat and found these spelt pretzels. I had them prior to ordering them on Amazon so I knew to expect they'd be awesome. Several family and friends have tasted them and can't tell any difference to pretzels made with wheat. However, I like these spelt pretzels better than your average wheat pretzel!
I don't like too much salt and I found these pretzels average on the salt factor. Like every other bag of pretzels, the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me.
The only thing I don't like is that in the ingredients list they say made with Organic Spelt and also Spelt. While they meet the standard to label their product organic, they should use ALL Organic Spelt

I e-mailed customer service and told them my problem and they wrote back telling me they could not ship just one can and they would ship me three more and I could return the two I had gotten.

They then said to go to a site and print a return label which the site would not let me do as none of the items I bought on that order were returnable.

They then asked me to tell them whether or not their answer solved my problem, I checked "no" and have never heard from them again on the subject

I recieved the variety pack today and tried this flavor first. I buy natural snacks for my kids (freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar), but I find them bland. So I ordered these and I love them. In fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it - it wasn't too spicy for her. You can tell they used "hot" spices, but they are very well done so as to not be too much. The nuts are big and crunchy and the fruit is small and chewy. There is about equal of both nuts and fruit. They do use evaporated cane juice and organic tapioca syrup, but these are healthier than alternatives and there are still only 5 grams of sugar per 1/4 cup serving

We were first introduced to Twinings when we lived in Australia for a year and one-half. As uncultivated Americans, for us tea was tea. We learned otherwise in the company of those who knew. Now Twinings English Breakfast Tea is all we will buy. It does not have the bitter taste common in most teas. As the Aussies say, "It is smooth.

When I was younger, the only tea readily available in my area was Lipton orange pekoe. It was okay, but not great, and very easy to over-steep causing a bitter cup of tea. One day while traveling in Canada, I tried Twinings English Breakfast Tea. It was so good that I purchased a large amount of it to take home. Now it is readily available and the English Breakfast Tea is still my favorite. Every other Twinings tea has been very good, but I always return to my favorite.

You can read in the other reviews about the flavor. It is a robust, full-flavored tea that only turns bitter after grossly over-steeping. There are some very bad brands of tea out there, and a lot of good brands, but as far as I am concerned Twinings is by far the best

As its decaf twin, great coffee for expresso machine or works great with normal coffee pot too. Give Starbucks a good bye for a good buy

I first tried Lavazza Oro in Italy, and I really loved it. I bought this because I didn't have a coffee grinder at the time, and this was the only one that was preground and shipped through Amazon. It tastes very good, much better than Charbucks and much cheaper, too, and imported straight from Italy.

I think this brand of espresso T-Discs trumps all the others through taste, body, and color. I usually have a double to get me going in the morning and this system is much faster (and way cheaper!) than going to the corner starbuck's. I recommend buying the Tassimo T-Disc Coffee Machine System first and stock up on these bad boys for this great price. Plus, these are not widely available yet in my area and I've got to go to a specialty shop to find any

I have 3 kids and was looking for crackers for my kids and my snacker husband that have no additives, no sugar, whole wheat and are suitable for snacking. I love these crackers and can safely leave them out on the counter for snacking. No sugar means they don't get devoured. They are very crunchy, which can be kind of weird at first(it also keeps you from eating 50), but there is nothing like a plate of these with a tiny slice of swiss cheese. All my kids eat them, but my mom doesn't really like them. Everyone else seems to like them - I should warn you that my kids are good eaters. A super fussy eater probably won't eat them.

I used this gluten substitute to make the best sugar cookies my kids have had since they were diagnosed. You only use 1 part of the gluten substitute to 5 parts of gluten free flour. My first batch I used the same amount as for xantham gum and they did not come out right, then I did the math - 20 grams substitute: 100 grams flour and realized - DUH!!! 1 part to 5 parts and tried again. OUTSTANDING RESULTS.

Naysayers - read the directions, do the math - and try again - you won't be disappointed

For me, Shock Coffee has a fine, roasty flavor. It certainly DOES give you a boost and a large one. I am an Arabica bean gal but I really don't taste the common Robusta bitterness. Not at all. What I do get is a full bodied start with a smooth finish. I really like it. The Shock-a-lots are awesome too!

This product is very good, but my wife and I agreed that it was impossible to tell you were eating sweet potatoes, rather than regular potatoes. I expected the flavor to be distinguishable. Oh well. The only other caution is to not overcook this product. It will start to get mushy. That may be characteristic of any gnochhi, but I thought I would include this point as well

We have really enjoyed these unusual snacks! We first got the variety mix and they were all pretty good but this mix is off the chart! No need to put these in a resealable bag they just don't get that far! I keep thinking how good they would be added to a meal as garnish or a salad. We truly love them! Thanks Guys

I bought the variety pack and tried this flavor third (see my reviews for Socorro and Soledad). I buy natural snacks for my kids (freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar), but I find them bland. So I ordered these and I love this flavor. In fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it - it wasn't too spicy for her. They use black pepper which is flavorful, but I wouldn't call it spicy. The nuts are big and crunchy and the fruit is small and chewy. There is about equal of both nuts and fruit. Valdosta has 7 grams of sugar in a 1/4 cup serving

Numi has created a breakfast blend with four of the most popular black teas--Keemun, Assam, Ceylon and Darjeeling. The aroma is a fine grassy floral tea blend. The leading flavor is Keemun, a malty, slightly smoky flavor. This is a smooth subtle cup of tea, without some of the more characteristic robustness of most Breakfast blends. However, it is still a very stimulating blend--fairly high in caffeine I would guess from its effect! Unfortunately, Numi does not list caffeine count on the box.

Numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging. The boxes containing their tea is made from 100% recycled paperboard from 100% post-consumer waste--they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2,040 trees, reduce landfill by 131,200, and prevent 184,000 greenhouse emissions. Numi uses only 100% natural ingredients without added oils or "natural flavorings"

Numi Tea's Morning Rise Breakfast Blend Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The ingredients are fair trade certified organic Keemun black tea, fair trade certified organic Darjeeling black tea, fair trade certified organic Ceylon black tea, anfair trade certified organic Assam black tea. A powerful black tea blend indeed! There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.

On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Numi perfects the classic breakfast tea with this organic black tea blend, Morning Rise. Four of the most extraordinary black teas compose this hearty, complex, and exciting morning cup. Ceylon, gardened in the small and exotic country of Sri Lanka, bestows its strong yet smooth profile, while Indian grown Assam imparts a malty and robust depth. Keemun, from China, offers deep burgundy notes that complement the natural floral finish and fruity Muscatel of Darjeeling, cultivated on the mountain peaks of India. This rich, bold black tea blend has an unrivaled smoothness and a magnificent aroma resembling dawn's early warmth. Let the morning greet you through the radiant daybreak of Numi's superior Breakfast Blend."

It tastes strong and and is perfect for people who want a black tea that is not flowery or herbal-y but tasty, complex, and superb high-quality in the morning.

The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love black tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.

Many blueberries -- fresh, frozen, or dried -- are pretty tasteless. So I always buy a bunch when I find some that taste good. And these are consistently great! Lots of sweet blueberry taste! Not as organic as I claim to like, in that they've added blueberry juice and sweetner -- but the effect is wonderful

Honestly, I was a bit skeptical on ordering nuts online. Mainly for fear they would not be as fresh AND they would be broken via the shipping process. I am a baker year round and quality is of highest inportance to me. I am THRILLED to tell anyone else with these concerns, these nuts not only arrived quite fresh with a long expire date but so well packaged, breakage was of normal expectation, quite minimal, no more than if you picked them from a shelf at a grocery. Even though I chose free shipping, which can take a bit longer, they arrived in no time at all. I will not hesitate to continue ordering my baking needs from Amazon.com

These are really delish. It's like eating one of those peanut candy rolls with the nouget. If you love peanuts you will enjoy these! I didn't buy them for sports, but just because I felt they were healthier than cookies as a snack. I would still be eating them if I hadn't discovered they have wheat in them! (I'm allergic to wheat

I'm a granola bar fan, and I tried these recently and really like them. Had one for breakfast about five minutes ago, as a matter of fact. I can imagine a better granola bar, but it's pretty dang good. If you're like me, you like to pack a variety of bars for camping/hiking/road trips so as to not fall victim to monotonous granola. These are definitely a good addition to your bar repertoire.

I love this item. The strawberries and bananas are nice and crunchy and sweet, with the tang of the strawberries complementing the sweetness of the bananas. Eating this is addictive - but at least you can rest assured you're addicted to something healty, low calorie and delicious.

I wasn't sure about this tea at first because I had tried several other teas that contained licorice that were just too sweet for me. However, I'm pleasantly surprized by the light, tangy flavor of this tea. The sweetness is there, but it's not overwhelming. I'm not certain that it's done much for me in relation to "detox," but I certainly like the taste, especially after lunch. It seems to settle my stomach and help me digest

"...made without hydrogenated oils - which is a good thing since it's difficult for our bodies to absorb trans-fatty acids that come from hydrogenated oils." ~box

These are definitely natural snack crackers to bounce around about. I mean, it is so rare to find even natural foods without hydrogenated oils. I can't count the times I've read labels only to be disappointed to find that "natural" does not always mean healthy.

Ingredients: Certified organic wheat flour, expeller pressed safflower oil, aged cheddar cheese (contains milk, salt, enzymes, cheese culture), salt, yeast extract, paprika, annatto extract (for color), ground celery seed, onion powder, yeast.

I've made my own cheese crackers and these really do taste homemade. About 24 tiny crackers will satisfy any cheese cracker craving and that is about 70 calories.

These crackers are Bernie the Bunny (Annie's beloved mascot) approved. They are also made with only vegetarian ingredients. Each cracker is the cutest bunny shape.

Although I didn't LOVE this product (I don't like cereal bars anyway), it was a good substitute for those on a GF diet. My son, 15 mos old, loves these bars and eats them almost every day! Very good, healthy, and you cannot tell it's gluten free.

My boyfriend has Celiac's and hasn't had french toast in years. I made the bread, in the bread maker, the day before and it was absolutely perfect! I don't have any problems with gluten, but I still think I would prefer this bread for french toast any day. It cuts better than fresh baked regular bread as well, meaning it won't collapse in on itself. I am looking forward to making more of it and experimenting with other receipes

This bread deserves rave reveiws.
Reliable results, even texture.
Makes a beautiful classic grilled cheese
on white. Success with bread machine.
Watch out for the metric to standard
conversion on the liquid amount. We almost put
in half the liquid on the first loaf, we adjusted
it roughly and the loaf still came out.
I think in some areas, desert, high altitude, the
liquid my need to be fudged up a little.
Experiment, have fun!

These crackers are the best-tasting saltines we've ever had. We LOVE them! They are light, not too salty, with a delicate smattering of olive oil. The ingredient list is short --only four items! I buy them by the case for our family of four and they don't stick around long enough to get stale. They are GREAT to take along to a party if you're serving crackers and cheese. I strongly recommend them.

I ordered these crackers about two weeks ago, not knowing how they would be. Turns out they are delicious! A little plain tasting, which was expected, with just the right amount of salt for my tastes and a subtle but pleasant hint of olive oil. They seem to go very well with several cheeses, soup and on their own, too. I recommend them to anyone who likes Saltines or other plain, salted crackers - however I find these to be significantly less salty than Saltines. Enjoy

I am a dark chocolate lover, and have long wished that there were an instant cocoa mix flavored with dark chocolate. I was very happily surprised to find "Dark Chocolate Sensation" at my grocer's last week, but after actually having a cup, I began to get very worried. So many times in the past, I have been disappointed by the unexplained disappearance of a product which I loved, and purchased faithfully. I do not want this to happen again, but just in case it does, I am stocking up all the Dark Chocolate Sensation I can find. Whenever I go shopping, I go to every store in the area, just to get all their DCS cocoa mix. PLEASE KEEP PROVIDING IT FOR ALL DARK CHOCOLATE LOVERS! WE ARE LEGION!

I bought these without trying this particular flavor. Aren't I brave? You get a pack of 60 no less! This is a thick and somewhat tasty blueberry flavored fruit bar. Much thicker than a fruit rollup but not as thick as a granola bar; the texture is quite pleasing and very chewy.

Flavor is decent and complex: not just blueberry. With the product tag line of "an apple in each bar" it's no wonder I taste apple along with some other flavors I can't put my finger on.

This would be good for a snack or when craving something sweet. But I don't expect it to tide me over until a meal.

I hope it replaces my need for chocolate to satiate my sweet tooth. It better, I have 60, no wait, 59

I have always liked Special K. Nowadays, it is all about brand extension. So, they add some things to the basic cereal so you don't have to add your own banana or berries. While I enjoyed the taste of the sample I was given, my advice is to go with the basic cereal and add your own fresh fruit. The fruit here, and the box shows pictures of berries, is really made of apple pieces that are colored and artificially flavored to taste like some kind of vague berry taste.

If you find adding your own fruit too troublesome, well, this is a good and tasty choice

My girlfriend has been eating Special K and I decided to start the Special K diet too. We recently both tried the Fruit Yogurt variation and it's definately my favorite of the variations. On a side note - I seem to be pooping less and feeling less full. Which is great. I spend way too much time in there reading books anyways. Im happy, my girlfriend is happy and everything is fine and dandy. Life is great but Special K is better

*****
If you love bergamot (as I do) then this is your tea. Numi Tea is all high quality, and this aged Earl Grey is no exception. It is a strong, fine tea, and the bergamot is the star.

This tea is certified organic and contains just Organic Assam Black Tea TGFOP Grade 1 (Oxidized Camellia Sinensis) scented with organic Italian Bergamot Fruit (Citrus Bergamia). It is also kosher.

On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "Numi's special Earl Grey is oil-free, using a unique method of aging premium Italian bergamot fruit with malty Assam black tea. When brewed, it imparts an exquisite red-orange hue that calls to mind dawn's finest moments. Balanced and stunning, we've recreated this timeless classic."

The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Earl Grey tea, get it---you won't be sorry.

The dieter who couldn't eat a whole package in a day must have been eating these tasty little gems one by one, with a break inbetween each bite. Not my family. We would each take a handful for a snack, and before we knew it, the bag was empty.

But enough about the bag. These things are tasty and provide a concentrated strawberry punch of flavor which makes "strawberry flavored" items taste lame. With these, you get the whole range of flavors in a strawberry, sweet without being too sweet, and none of the acidic taste that you sometimes get in an underripe berry. The dried fruit is very crunchy, without any of the gumminess that shows the manufacturer removed them from the dehydrator too early.

My only beef is the price, although I understand why they are so expensive. When I dried fruit, it took many pints of cleaned, stemmed and sliced berries to come up with a respectable amount of food. My family was always finished with one batch long before the next before the next was ready. When I consider the effort involved, these snacks are probably underpriced. But it still hurts to see an expensive packet gone before the commercials are over

Both my 2 yr old and my husband like this cereal a lot. And I didn't even mind it when I had to eat GF for a short time. I love to use it as a bread crumb for chicken nuggets or fried chicken. I just pop it in the blender and get it really fine. It has a nice sweet taste to it which makes it perfect for breading.
I only wish that it had some more nutrients in it.

As a fussy vegetarian, I have tried many vegetarian seasonings to use with my homemade soups, and this is the BEST!

Update: One star. I had based my previous 5-star review on the taste and the natural ingredients. Well, after receiving my shipment and reading the label, I was disappointed to find Nutritional Yeast Extract as the number one ingredient. From my research, Nutritional Yeast is good for you, but Nutritional Yeast Extract is not good for you - in fact, Nutritional Yeast Extract has the same negative effect on your body as MSG. So even though the taste is great, I won't be recommending this product any more

I've been using this for a couple of months. I usually have a small mug of broth in the evening with slightly less than a teaspoon of mix in 8-10 ounces of boiling water. Very refreshing and only about five calories a serving. I haven't counted how many servings per cannister I get, but I would guess that it is at least the 40 indicated on the label, so this works out to be a very inexpensive as well as refreshing drink. I've also used it a couple of times in rice-cooking water and it is very tasty, if not quite up to my home-made vegetable broth for this purpose. It's a lot easier, of course

In the last year I've developed a real yen for these sour chewy candies. I've sampled about a half-dozen varieties of sour worms, including the bulk tubs sold at the grocery store, Blockbuster, CVS, etc. Some taste quite synthetic, but these Harmony worms immediately impressed me with their pleasing, almost fragrant fruit flavors. However, they barely qualify as sour---quite mild on that scale, so I nicked them one star on their rating.

Be careful to never leave these in a car on a warm day---even slightly warm day. They melt into a solid mass very easily

One can sells for 3.39 at my local grocery store, so with this special, it's about 2.16/can for 2 8 packs. What a bargain w/ FS. The fruit is soooooo tasty. I usually buy frozen, but this canned is better, so I've converted. I confess I eventually ate a whole can during one evening as a healthy plain fruit dessert since I kept going back for "seconds" a few times. Truly the next best thing to fresh

I bought these based on the great reviews and I can say I am not disappointed! When I brewed my first cup, there was an overwhelming scent of coconut so I was a little worried it would be too "coconutty". I'm happy to say that it's the perfect blend of chocolate and coconut--neither taste outdoes the other. I will definitely buy this flavor again

YES! I didn't know if I'd like it, but the coconut makes this coffee just a little sweeter than the average brew. It's very subtle. Great mid-day snack without the guilt

Wow, this stuff is good! If you like caramel corn, you will love the Caramel Booty. It's got a good amount of sugar in it, so this is definitely not a low cal treat. But compared to the heavy-duty sugar on regular caramel corn, this is much better, not to mention easier on the teeth. The caramel coating is much lighter so doesn't get all stuck to my teeth. No added vitamins either like some of the other booty products have.

I have to admit I love these cookies too. It's a crunchy lemon cookie, in the shape of a polar bear, covered in a white icing. They are sweet and very yummy. We took them on a picnic once and the icing got pretty soft but that still didn't keep the kids out of them

My 4 yr old was recently diagnosed as a Type 1 diabetic. As with most 4 yr olds, she likes very few foods and wasn't getting an adequate supply of protein. With the diabetes diagnosis, it was evident to us that we had to find something fairly nutritious, low in sugar, and high in protein that she would eat or she would become hypoglycemic. SHE LOVES THESE! This is one of her daily snacks and she's now beginning to thrive!

I wanted to give these soy crisps more justice than just the 5 stars (and ordering them all the time). I bought a bag of these Sea Salt flavor crisps and a bag of BBQ crisps about a month ago, in a bid to eat more healthy food. I've always loved BBQ chips, especially Ruffles and Lays K.C. Masterpiece chips, but they've got to be killing me slowly, right? So I busted open the BBQ soy crisps and gagged. How could this be BBQ? They tasted like cardboard, and I gave them to my friends who will eat anything. I begrudgingly opened the Sea Salt bag, and though more palatable, I was still disappointed. (I know..."I thought you said 5 stars." It gets better.)

Anyway, I had sworn off chips and midday snacking, so for two weeks I saw nothing on the counter but Genisoy Soy Crisps. I'd eat two or three here and there, and when I ran out, I bought 2 bags of the Sea Salt flavor again. What happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive--my body forgot what those strong BBQ flavored chips were like, and I started craving Soy Crisps. I began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor, like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars, which I had completely missed before, apparently because it wasn't a sweet, red-crusted, overbearing BBQ powder. I polished the next bags off in three days.

Now, I'm ordering 12 here on Amazon ($1 cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food). My advice is this--give these soy crisps a chance, but don't mix them in with your regular Doritos and BBQ Ruffles or you'll think they're awful. Stop eating, for a month, the oily BBQ chips that have deadened your taste buds for years and reboot your taste buds with these markedly healthier chips. You'll feel better about snacking

The every day Amazon case price is about the same as the sale price. I've been eating these for years and they are a very good source of protein. Soy protein is about the best you can get. LOw fat and carbs.

In 17 crisps you get 120 calories (25 from fat), 17g total carbs, 2g dietary fiber and 7g of protein. ZERO Trans fat, 0 Saturated fat and 270mg of sodium.

Much better than steak in my opinin. After all, you'll never hear of "Mad Soy Bean" desease

I tried this tea in the flowering combo that came with the teapot box. Now I'm here to buy it on its own. It's the best in the assortment in my opinion.

Just as you take a sip, the sweet scent of jasmine combines with the lush flavor, and WOW! A real delight. The tea is very light and subtile yet strongly jasmine. Then there's the flowering effect. This is my favorite bloom of them all. All these tiny little tea balls slowly unwind, dancing under water, swimming and growing until the pot is full of delightful little flowers. Absolute perfection.\

And it's good for your body and the planet. :o

If you judge this snack by the packaging, you might never try them. Baked pea pods don't exactly sound like the most appetizing (or satisfying) snack, but these guys really deliver. As one of the other reviewers said, they are crunchy and light, with a texture similar to Cheetos, possibly a little more dense. They have the taste of lightly salted snow peas, only light and airy. While they might not be as healthy as a raw or steamed vegetable, they're a good alternative if you don't want all of the chemicals and sugars in most packaged snacks. These guys have no sugar at all and the ingredient list is wholly recognizable. I usually buy two bags at a time because they tend to go so fast. Both flavors are delicious, though I prefer the original.

Since it appears that Amazon is no longer carrying them, you might try Wild Oats, Trader Joes or Whole Foods, if any of those are nearby

My first experience with this cereal was with a CASE of it from amazon, so thank goodness it was good! You'd think it be hard to mess up gluten-free rice cereal, but believe me, there are some awful ones out there. This, with the welcome addition of fruit, is wonderful. I've never had freeze-dried berries before, either, and they were tasty (please make one with more blueberries!). I also bought the Erewhon brown rice cream; if you're missing oatmeal for breakfast because you're sensitive to gluten, try the brown rice cream... with brown sugar and raisins, it's actually pretty good. I highly recommend this cereal

I was a little wary about ordering jerky off the internet since I have never tried this brand before. Not to worry, this buffalo jerky is good quality and tastes great. I will be ordering this again

I have tried so many artificial sweeteners, I think they are all horrible. Someone finally convinced me to try Splenda last year and it has made a huge difference in my life. I just use Splenda in my coffee, instead of sugar now, and I have lost 20 lbs. in the past 4 months. At first I admit that my coffee didn't taste "exactly" the same as with sugar, but it wasn't bad and it didn't taste like an artificial sweetener at all. After I continued using nothing but Splenda in my coffee for a few weeks, I couldn't imagine putting sugar in my coffee again. I have now used it for about 4 or 5 months and I even carry a few packets around in my purse in case I need them when I'm out. I would highly recommend Splenda to anyone that uses sugar on a regular basis. Just stick with it for a couple of weeks and you'll wonder how you did without it

At one time in my life I used the sweetener in the little blue packet, then switched to the pink packet, but NOW "they" tell me the yellow packet containing SPLENDA is the healthiest.

Since diabetes runs in my family, I don't want to risk getting that disease or gaining too much weight, so I hope "they" are right in promoting this product.

I've been using it for about a year ... mostly on certain brands of cereal and my hot oatmeal. It actually enhances the flavor of things I sprinkle it on and actually tastes like it's suppose to: LIKE SUGAR. And it leaves no artificial aftertaste, which is a big plus with me. I don't drink coffee and use no sweetener with my hot tea, but it certainly helps to sweeten a big, tall glass of iced-tea on a hot summer day in California.

I recommend this above all sweeteners ... until someone else comes along, proving "they" are wrong. (This seems to happen every other week in the food industry so how are we consumers supposed to know "for sure" the safest things to consume?

Being an avid tea drinker, I have found Numi Monkey King to be the best green tea. It's smooth with a hint of sweetness, comforting for the body and mind.

The price is probably the best I have found compared to everywhere else. Definitely a tea worth stocking up

*****
Numi Tea's Monkey King Jasmine Green Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified special grade green tea that is scented with real summer jasmine flowers from China. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.

On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Jasmine tea is the oldest known scented tea, and ours begins its life in the gardens of Hunan Province. The rich soil and fluctuations in daily temperature yield a fragrant leaf which is further scented with delicate white Jasmine blossoms. During summer, these are gathered daily by the banks of the Min River and repeatedly mated each night with the prepared tea, naturally embracing all of the flowers' scent. When brewed, this smooth, organic green tea has layers of subtle fragrance and hints of moonlight. It is a most romantic tea, and, like a bowl of fresh picked flowers, will bring the joy of summer to your every sip." It sounds quite romantic, and it tastes wonderful. It is a true jasmine tea, and the taste of jasmine predominates, in a both strong and lovely way.

The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love jasmine green tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.

This is very good. The secret to cooking it is lots of water-double what
you would use with wheat macaroni. Bring to boil, then on low aprox 10-15 min.-taste it. It also freezes well.

I have a three year old and a seven year old and they ask for one of these every day at snack time, and love them.
I like them very much as well. The peanut butter ones are a bit better than these... but my son likes the pumpking better. I'm very excited to have found something healthy that the kids love to eat for a snack.

This is the last of the three (elbows with four cheese, shells with aged wisconsin cheddar) that I tried, and I think it's better than the other two. In all, each variation is excellent, but this white cheddar sauce is excellent and has a very distinct flavor.

My favorite addition to this is mushroom slices (or whole small mushrooms) seared in butter and garlic. After letting them pick up a golden brown in the frying pan, I douse them with vegetable broth, just to get the flavor stuck to the pan off it, and mix all that into the rotini and cheese sauce. Mmmmm

After tasting a bowl of this Mac and Cheese i will never buy Kraft (or any other big corporate) mac and cheese again!
This is delicous and wholesome. The white cheese is creamy and the organic grown noodles taste very fresh. Me and my kids love it and will definitly be ordering more.

I absolutely love this mac and cheese it is different from any other 'squeeze cheese' style of mac and cheese i've had as the cheese is white. The cheese is soooo good. I highly recomend this pasta. And i really know my macaroni and cheese i consider myself something of a macaroni and cheese conesiur ( i've tried nearly every kind of macaroni and cheese there is and this is by far my favorite. This is excellent and i've turned my friends onto this macaroni. Now when they go to the store they are also buying it. Just give it a try you won't regret it

A Ming Dynasty (AD 1368 - 1644) creation believed to lower cholesterol and promote longevity, jasmine tea consists of Chinese green tea leaves - usually green teas from Fujian province, which is also home to the semi-fermented Oolong and smoky Lapsang Souchong - scented with jasmine flowers. Traditionally, the flowers are harvested during the day and stored in a cool place until nightfall, when they develop their full fragrance. They are then layered over the tea leaves, which have previously been steamed or heated to prevent their oxidation. The tea's quality is determined both by the quality of the green tea used as its base and by the effectiveness of the scenting process. Brewed, it has a delicate, silvery color and a rich fragrance reminiscent of a flower garden in bloom.

This is a great snack that my husband and I both love.

I try to keep a variety of snacks at my desk so I always have something healthy on hand, rather than going after the pizza, donuts, etc., that seem to lurk in our office. For someone eating on the go, these dried fruits are great because they aren't perishable, sticky or messy, come in a super handy little pouch and the crunchy texture is a really nice change compared to most preserved fruits which typically are chewy or gummy

These fruit snacks are the best low calorie, extremely flavorful snacks in the world. I eat the Orchard and Cherry Berry for breakfast at my desk every day. The fruit is dried to a crunch not a gummy chew and the flavor has no aftertaste or funky smell.

Overall, I love these snacks more than any other pre-packaged food. I carry them with me on trips and eat them at my desk or in my comfy chair at home. Try them!

How can these taste so wonderful? The ingredients are all fruit--No sugar! They are crunchy and so sweet. My husband, 16 year old son, 2 year old daughter and myself all love them. I was skeptical so I only ordered 1 case but now I will be ordering case after case

I am especially pleased with this Rice. I can't imagine how any food item could be more convenient to store or prepare. And, most importantly, it taste quit good. But taste is always very subjective. Another recent reviewer didn't like the taste, and I personally think that it's great.
It's also worth mentioning that it was delivered in only 3 days. I placed my order Online on Monday night, and UPS actually delivered it into my hands on Thursday morning. - Highly recommended

The flavor, texture and ease of cooking (60 seconds - WOW!) make this a product that my family uses a lot. Rice, to me, needs to have the right texture and Viva La Rice has it. It can also be brought to work as it doesn't have to be refrigerated and heated in a microwave

These cookies are superb all by themselves. Far superior to "that other sandwich cookie" in every way. But if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence, melt some Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Chips in your double boiler, and dip these cookies, then remove to a rack to dry. Your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store, and beg you for more. Keep out of reach of children

Everyone in my family (from 3 to 64 years old) loves these organic cookies. I purchased these cookies at several local stores before I discovered that Amazon had them. I sent a package to my grandson who is in the Army in Iraq and he raved about them. Newman's has another big winner!

These high-sodium ginger cookies are too tasty to have around - you'll easily surpass your RDA of sodium in one sitting.

The nutrition facts that Amazon neglected to post are: Serving size is 2 cookies (28 g). Each serving has 160 mg of sodium, 4.5 mg of fat (2 g saturated, 0 g transfat), 19 g of total carbs (10 g sugars), and 0 g of cholesterol.

The ingredients in these "Made in U.S.A." cookies are organic unbleached wheat flour, powdered sugar, organic palm fruit oil, organic molasses, organic sugar, sodium bicarbonate (leavening), ground ginger, soy lecithin (an emulsifier), salt, monocalcium phosphate (leavening), and nutmeg. There are no hydrogentated oils or trans fats.

On the back of the package is an Ode to Ginger-O's, which reads: "You might, m'lady tweak my nose. You could, m'lord step on my toes. But Heaven help those poor bozos, who try to filch my Ginger-O's ".

Again, these high-sodium cookies taste too good in order to effectively exercise self-discipline to limit the quantity eaten.

I do not like store-bought cookies, especially Oreos (too dry and greasy for me). But upon the recommendation of several people, I tried the Ginger O's and was pleasantly surprised. They have excellent flavor and the cream does not have that greasiness to it. If you like ginger cookies, don't hesitate to try these

I love the Original Vanilla Creme Newman's O's, so when I saw the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free on sale one day I picked one up. I figured it would basically be the same as the Original. The chocolate and vanilla tastes are great, but I found the cookies themselves to be rock hard. So unless you have an issue with wheat or dairy products, I would recommend the Original Vanilla Creme, and not the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free variety

Basically, these are good granola bars, and the cholesterol-reducing ingredients are a side benefit for some. They're chewy, and the taste is comparable to other Nature Valley bars - good, but nothing amazing. Since the price of these is also comparable to similar Nature Valley bars (package contains 5 bars rather than 6, but they're each slightly bigger) it's a pretty painless way to take a small step against high cholesterol.

The oats, barley and raisins are all good healthy foods, especially for those with high cholesterol. This alone doesn't make them far healthier than many other typical bars. They're special in the addition of plant sterols - from my self-education, I understand them to be plant derivitives that have been shown to lower cholesterol if you eat enough. I don't think they're particularly advised if you don't have unhealthy cholesterol levels, though.

These aren't incredible, but I'm giving them 5 stars since it's hard to find something so convenient with health benefits, still enjoyable and not much more expensive

Try them added to salads or in a baked chicken dish with a little soy sauce and toasted sesame oil. Dried fruit is very different from fresh so don't expect it to taste the same, these are kind of like a natural gummi. Healthy snack. Thanks

i LOVE Hamburger Helper Creamy Stroganoff. it is the most delicious, most satisfying, heavenly treat i've ever tasted. it calls for a pound of ground beef, you can put more or less to taste though. of course it comes out best when you use 7% or better ground beef, two pounds, cause you are gonna have to make two packages! yumm! in my house we eat this three times a week when it's on sale. sometimes i'll be so hungry i'll eat a whole package to myself. i swear it's that good. the only thing is, if you follow the directions is doesn't come out looking like the picture. to make it look like the picture you need to BOIL THE NOODLES FIRST. then mix them with the flavor packets, milk, and cooked burger. by the way, leave at least a cup or more of the water, don't completely strain the noodles. this will only make it too dry.

I am not an expert on tea, but I have quite a collection, always looking for something good. Having said that, this tea is very good. The flavor is sweet, reminds me of dates, honey and has a very slight malt flavor. I'm drinking some right now actually :) This tea is not bitter at all. There is nothing exotic oe odd tasting about it, a nice everyday tea, like Earl Grey, but it doesn't taste the same.
My father is a doctor and just came back from a medical conference about dieting. He said that Oolong tea is very good to lower your blood sugar and help you lose weight, when you drink it regularly. So, it's more than just a great tasting drink, it's an aid to help you stay healthy

Looking for a late-night snack that's not disgusting for your waistline? Then be SURE to grab this! This stuff is fabulous to just munch on in the evenings while watching TV, on the computer, whatever, and it's inexpensive, great for you, and even reduces your cholesterol! I like mine washed down with a diet Lime Coke, but you might want to try some milk too. Just give them to the kids sraight out of the box - they just love to eat them too. Beats potato chips and all the other fattening foods out there plus it's full of vitamins. And, at 110 calories a serving, that's incredibly hard to beat. Mix a few nuts and raisins in there too and well, it's just great. Highly, highly recommend

This sweet treat is, as they say, a lesser evil. It's not health food, in that it's a sweet combination of vanilla and chocolate, but it is much hearlthier than other carmel and chocolate popcorns out there--just check the ingredients. Other reviewers complaining about the nutritional fact panel or the health benefits of this product don't quite get it.

Some reviewers have noted that this is not kettle corn are correct. Others who say this is half caramel corn miss the "black and white" across the front of the bag--it's not caramel, it's vanilla. The chocolate half is delicious--cocoa-laden and therefore perfect when you want something light; not chocolate dipped, which would be overwhelming, heavy, and creamy. The vanilla half is also not dipped, heavy, or overwhelming. It's a lightly sweet plain corn taste to cleanse your palate for more chocolate.

People who love the New England tradition of black and white cabinets (milkshakes, frappes...can't we all just get along?) will adore this popcorn. People trying to avoid nasty chemical ingredients will appreciate this corn. People who love subtle flavors will love this treat. People who think Oreos are really good won't "get" this snack, nor do people who weigh and measure every kernel because they're watching calories. It's a sugary (albeit natural sugar with no hydrogenated oils) snack. It's the lesser of all the evils out there--and makes being nutritionaly bad feel really good

The quality of this good, but the Kettle Corn flavor did not do much for me. I have had other kettle corn and liked it. This was less sweet and more salt than what I prefer. It's not bad, I still manage to choke down the entire bag, but it's not what I was hoping for. Think I may still try the cinnamon though, I hope I like that one better

The chocolate is mild enough not to overwhelm, but strong enough to sate a chocolate-craving. The "kettle corn" part really is just caramel corn, but it's really good, ESPECIALLY considering there is no corn syrup, preservatives, trans fats, artificial flavors, or gluten. Compared to other "snack" foods, I feel no guilt in eating this

I don't usually buy these kinds of things, but couldn't pass it up when it was on sale a while back. These tasty, healthy treats are perfect for on the go! I snack on them while I am at school. Some fruits have more flavor than others. Raspberries are probably my favorite. Mmmmm my mouth is watering just thinking about them. My only complaint is the price is a little pricey. My girlfriend however doesn't like the tastey treat. May not be for everyone. Taste testing them somewhere could be advised, although I am not sure where you could test them out

I tried these at the local corner store and they taste great!

Since its a whole cashew and chocolate, no artificial anything, it is a nice snack treat.

Looking at Amazons price , its cheaper per bag than if I bought them in the store, and no tax, a good deal

First time trying this and it's delicious! It's super soft and chewy and tastes great. It's almost as good as a rice crispy treat, but it's better for you healthwise. And to top it off, it's organic!

One reviewer asked, why add coconut? It's hard to imagine apricot and nut and coconut, but I love it. It's not a strong artificial coconut flavor. It's real, organic coconut. It's subtle and adds a nice smell and taste.

I will add a closeup of the nutrition facts in the "customer images" link above, right underneath the main image. Make your own educated purchase.

I haven't tried the other flavors, but this one's so good, I'll have to try a different flavor next. These are great as breakfast bars

I am deployed to Iraq, so I needed some healthy snacks I could take with me, that were semi-perishable. I ordered these bars and couldn't be happier! They are soft, chewy and taste great! The fact that they are organic and made from whole grains and other wholesome ingredients is a big plus. These are a good substitute for a dessert, especially when you are craving something sweet and chewy. The only negitive for me was that Amazon will not ship to APO addresses, so I had to ship these to my parents first, for them to ship them to me.

These are fantastic. Not dry or bland like some granola bars. They're very chewy (kind of like Rice Krispy Treats!!) with lots of flavor. I have these for a mid-day snack. My 3 and 4 yr old love them too. I also have tried the peanut butter version and found them to be equally as good. I had been buying these bars at our local health food store. Not only was I paying more money than Amazon sells them for, but they were not as fresh as the bars I got from Amazon

I really like this green tea. I find it to be much better than the other brand. I add a little lemon and splenda to mine and enjoy it hot or cold.

What I wonder is if it is 6/40 count boxes like the title reads or 6/20 count boxes which is in the description??? Hmmm.....If it is 40 counters then this is a great deal.

If you love ginger or any of the other Destrooper cookies, you will like these. They are light and crispy, not at all like a chewy ginger snap. Not too strongly spiced and with small bits of delicious candied ginger. Very good.

As a "Cubicle Commando" Pringles often find their way into my bottom left drawer. They are a staple food in this environment. I suspect Dibert would derive almost 30% of his nutrients from these!

I love pringles!

However, I've come to the conclusion that I need to buy them in the traditional tube because whenever I buy them in the "convenient" snak pack, I'm lucky to get half of them that aren't broken or crumbled. What's the point of Pringles if you can't eat then whole?

Packaging makes a difference. Maybe you'll have better luck than me, but that is my take on it

This is the most wonderful tea for fighting off and shortening the duration of colds and coughs. I usually prepare it with lemon and honey, and it's a very soothing blend with hints of mint and eucalyptas. The echinacea and zinc combined help me fight off the nasty little bugs that seem to float around the office. As soon as I get a sore throat, I head straight for this wonderful tea

My children love Pop Tarts but I just can't bring myself to let them start their day drowning in sugar and sometimes sprinkles and icing. I bought these pastries and handed them out, half expecting groans of displeasure from all three children as I had when trying to sneak in turkey bacon and sugar free syrup. But my children love these. I tasted one and they are quite sweet and the blueberry filling actually tastes like blueberries! I cannot stand the taste of a Pop Tart but these actually have a pleasant flavor from pastry and filling

I just love this stuff. The texture and flavor are just right and best of all its organic! Even though six boxes seems like a lot, you will go through these within a few months (and the experation date on my boxes was about 9 months away when I received them)

This is one of the better cereals....How do I know.....Well I practically look forward to eating it every day...What I do is mix all-bran into the box (because that could be kinda - well I don't have to tell you) but unfortunately also very healthy....I also mix pumpkin seeds and WOW what a great combination.....A little strawberries, blueberries, or something of the sort and it is a great way to start off your day......ENJOY!!!!

This is probably one of the best granolas I've tasted. What I like most about it is the texture. Too many granolas just about break your teeth when you eat them - but this one has a firm (ie. not mushy) but pliable texture. The next thing I enjoyed about this cereal is the taste - not too sweet nor too bland - just a perfect balance. Too often sweetened cereals are much too sweet - or, on the flip side, the "healthy" cereals are too bland. Finally - this cereal is just plain healthy!! What a great combo - Flax and Pumkin seeds!! We ate up this cereal in record time and are ordering more today!

Having read there was no need to buffer the chocolate with oil, I was sold almost instantly. After reading the reviews, I had to have it. My husband and I used this in our Rival chocolate fountain for our wedding and the results were divine. Guests couldn't get enough of it, and I was having so much fun, I didn't even mind when I accidentally wiped melted chocolate on my gown! (I simply turned to my photographer and asked, "You can edit that out of the photos. Right?")
We used the dark chocolate and we have no complaints whatsoever. We actually purchased quite a lot of it prior to the wedding as we weren't sure how much we would need. We had enough left over for our Christmas party here at the house and we were thrilled with the results!
Another note: I have a dear friend who is highly allergic to tree nuts and was afraid to use this chocolate at a post-wedding party she and her husband hosted for my husband and me. I called SF Chocolate before our Christmas party and actually spoke with a very kind lady who immediately went to check on this for me. When she got back to the phone, she said, "I just spoke with the lady who processes the chocolate and she said she doesn't process it on any shared equipment." She checked with the lady who processes the chocolate? WAHOO! How often does THAT happen? Come to think of it, how often does a gal get to talk with a living, breathing person when she calls the manufacturer of ANYTHING?
Oh! How does it taste? We got the Dark Chocolate and loved it! The flavor is wonderful and the consistency is smooth as silk. The chocolate fountain is a bit of a pain to set up and tear down, but it's worth it for the reaction of the guests and the exquisite flavor of the chocolate itself.
Just say no to regular chocolate chips and oil

This is the best high-fiber cereal I've tasted. It was refreshing to eat a breakfast cereal that doesn't taste like cardboard. Smells delicious too. It doesn't need milk on it, so if you don't like milk, you don't need to add it. For those following Weight Watcher's--it's 1 pt per packet

Nonni's uses real butter in this product as well as most if not all of their products.
Premium ingredients for the flavorful Biscotti you want to enjoy and share with your friends.
rich chocolate, to be savor with coffee or milk, for the entire family.
Nonni's is top of the line in premium Biscotti.
Enjoy, you'll be glad you did

I usually buy Nonni's at the supermarket when it is on sale and I have a coupon because they are an expensive luxury. This is a great price, especially if you can take advantage of the $10 off $49 in the grocery department offer. They are great with coffee or hot cocoa

Learning to bake without gluten is a new process for me. I thought that working with the dough seemed more like making a cookie dough than rolling out a pie crust. Without gluten it lacks the elasticity that I am used to. Once I got the knack of working with the dough and doing some patching I was very pleased with the results. The flavor and appearance of the pie were not distinguishable from a crust made with wheat flour. In fact, the crust was flaky and even better than many pie crusts that I have eaten.

I have tried every GoldenValleyNatural.com Jerky product. By far the best are all the Sweet N'Spicy and Peppered Flavors. Beef tends to be smoky and fatty, while Turkey is dry and flaky, making their Buffalo meat varieties the best of them all.
Avoid their Low Carb Jerky unless you are willing to bite off tic-tac size bites and chew for a minute each time. All the Teriyaki Jerkys have the texture and taste like sweet Corned Beef, so I'd skip them as well.
If you want to try different flavors, instead of 8 of the same from Amazon, just go directly to their web sight and buy them for only 15% more than Amazon's sale price
