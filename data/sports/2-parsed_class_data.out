1 0 Barely worked at TWICE the dose I ordered two of these to save on shipping and figured the extra tube would be good for relube in another year or two After applying one vial it seemed even worse than before Tread catches as I walk So I applied the second vial just to make it usuable Still not great This stuff is overpriced and either they don t give you enough or it s poor quality 
2 0 Bad Smell This stuff has a very strong smell like WD 40 or something If you can stand the smell you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store at least then you d probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt I bought this stuff because I thought it would be odorless like all other treadmill lubricant I ve bought But it isn t odorless It really stinks I don t like that permeating smell in my house especially in my workout room I recommend the LifeSpan 100 silicone lubricant It s a little pricier for the quantity you receive but it s the good odorless stuff 
2 0 When It Comes To Mats Thin is Not In I purchased this matt to protect my laminate flooring from the weight of my heavy elliptical exercise machine Unfortunetly the matt is not thick and compresses to paper thin under the weight of the elliptical I would not recommend this to anyone with anything more than very light exercise equipment 
2 0 Suction cup holders wouldn t keep their grip for more than a couple of minutes no matter what I did and the toilet monster kept falling into the drink Overall it was quite underwhelming as a practical joke I ve gotten much better results for the same money with other products 
2 0 toilet monster The suction cups do not work on many toilet seats Though the idea is great save your money unless you have some to burn 
1 0 I would give it 0 stars if they d let me This is the biggest joke on the planet No doubt it is scary but c mon people I guess it s to scare the sh t out of you My comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item Think about it the toilet One of the best places for germs And you want to attach some rubber device to it I ll do you one better and you ll get just as good a laugh from it Also it ll be a lot cheaper Go buy a roll of Saran Wrap Cling it tightly to the top of the toilet bowl Wait and watch as your guest visit the bathroom to use it I don t think no one will die from this type of trick 
2 0 NOT REAL I thought this would be an actual toilet monster and was happy to see such a low price It is however made out of rubber and can not actually eat people 
2 0 small dog backpack review I consider my dogs to be small they are all around 25 pounds I have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and I still feel like they are a little bit too big I think that for a small backpack that they are just too large Thank you 
2 0 Didn t fit well I returned this item as it didn t fit my 19 pound Boston Terrier well at all It was way too large for his body Small obviously means small for a larger dog instead Just be aware 
1 0 No Absolutely no use to me whatsoever Next 
1 0 Too Bulky Heavy I purchased the ab lounge 2 online but returned it the same day It s too bulky heavy I wanted it for my bedroom to use in the mornings while watching the news but it s too heavy to move around and it DOES NOT FOLD I put it together in my living room and then tried to get it into my bedroom BUT IT WOULDN T FIT THROUGH THE DOOR I had to un screw the bars fold pull it through the door If I had put the AB Lounge 2 downstairs then I would never use it Unless you want the AB LOUNGE 2 to be a PERMANENT fixture in your bedroom or living room then I would order something else I need this thing to be where I can easily use it then put it away The Ab Lounge 2 is way too big bulky for that Unless you have a room where it will remain a permanent fixture then don t buy it I m buying the Ultra Ab Lounge because it folds for easy storage It s more expensive but to me it s worth the convenience of having the EASY storage capability I don t my exercise equipment to be sitting in my bedroom or living room when it s not in use 
2 0 caused intense side pain I tried this last year and by the second day I woke up in great pain I tried it again a few weeks later hoping it wasn t the juice that caused the pain the first time and the same thing happened I give it 2 stars because I actually did lose a few pounds on this stuff 
1 0 Questionable company I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase Mine in three months The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself In one occasion they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it s good These back and forth guessing games normally drag on for months and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you even though it s still within one year I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying this is our policy 
2 0 It s a real workout This product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit What it doesn t say is that you really get a workout No matter what incline it is in it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil If you want a strenuous workout then this unit is for you If you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface then this is NOT the unit for you 
1 0 Cheesy I guess you get what you pay for This pedometer was difficult to calibrate and continued to miscount steps and therefore distance covered It is made of plastic and came unclipped easily I am a big person and have started walking to improve my health This product does not work for me although it might be a different story for a slim person It has been relegated to the junk drawer and probably will eventually be thrown away I ll have to find another that works better and purchase it 
1 0 Sucks Initially the 340 was way too sensitive to be even remotely accurate It did however give my wife a good laugh she was sure that at least 5000 of my 10000 steps were registered while sitting perfectly still and clicking the TV remote But after one week of use the darn thing became so in sensitive that it would only register when I jumped up and down like a pogo stick Pass on this one 
1 0 Trashed it after a week No wonder it s discontinued Not worth the shipping cost Completely flawed I ordered the Oregon Scientific which is perfect Should be Zero Stars Dr Parha 
1 0 It can work but I gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf This pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it It has problems that need modification The top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb That means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely Remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it Add some adhesive Velchro to the back of the case Make a fabric band for your ankle Attach the ends to each other with Velchro Put a strip of Velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band I get accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle I got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline The hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted I opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring The strut is made of thin brass Aluminum from a soda can would work too I made a V in one end of the strut to hold the spring I pushed lightly against the spring from the left side drilled a hole in the brass and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board The strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it I now have quite a few miles on the pedometer I have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely Several times the pedometer reset itself to 0 for no apparent reason I know nothing pushed on the reset button One incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security Once it reset while I was walking Twice it reset while I was napping on the sofa I am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit but I do not know Static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers too This pedometer uses a counter circuit If someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts Connect a button switch to the two wires Freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue 
2 0 Nice Machine but HORRIBLE Customer Service We bought our machine 2 weeks ago It looks wonderful nice sturdy with alot of different features but we haven t been able to use it It didn t work from the day we brought it home and have been fighting with Ironman s Customer Service Department ever since They keep giving us the runaround saying different technicians are coming but nobody ever shows up Evertime we call their 1800 number we re on hold for at least 30 minutes before we even get to talk to a person and then they just lie and say they will either call us back or have someone out that day Well after 2 weeks we ve had it We re taking it back and never buying another Ironman product again They re nice machines with good warrentys but what good is it if they won t get anyone out there to fix it Nothing against the store they ve been great Just 2 big thumbs down for the manufacturer 
1 0 Buy some that are made out of metal The first time I used these push up bars the flimsy plastic they re made out of cracked in three different places Perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely but I m not going to risk an injury finding out In the trash they go I suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing 
2 0 Do not buy This does not fit on Super 9 rifles as far as I know Besides it first off has a too high zoom and also is tiny Most scopes are whatever zoom X30 For example I own a 3 9X44 scope This means it is adjustable from 3 to 9 times zoom The second number refers to the size of the scope lens I d seriously reccomend a 3X30 if you can get one Also make sure it s dovetail if its for the super9 otherwise make sure it is a weaver rail If you are getting it for the Super 9 do not forget to unscrew the rear sight peephole 
2 0 Save your money I purchased this bike rack because I was moving out of state and didn t have enough room in the back of my car for the bike I also needed a rack to transport my bike to local trails parks etc So I went with Schwinn given the brand name and that it was relatively inexpensive I drove from NC to Fla approx 700 miles bad idea with this rack I didn t have any trouble assembling the rack only took about 5 minutes and was ready to go However during my trip I had to pull over on the side of the interstate no less than 5 times to tighten the straps back The buckles do NOT hold the straps in place This is a real problem if you are travelling on a highway or any busy road and you have to worry about your bike flying off the back into oncoming traffic Also even if the buckles hold The wind drag from the bike starts to pull the brackets right off of the rack frame I had to purchase 4 bungee cords and rope in order to secure my bike from flying off the back and yes the rack was assembled correctly Bottom line this rack is probably a great value if don t plan on driving more than a a few miles or over 40 50mph otherwise it is a a complete waste 
1 0 Do NOT purchase a ProForm Treadmill I bought this model a year ago and replaced the deck after approximately 8 months Just recently the deck cracked again Of course the warrantly no longer applies Save yourself the headache of dealing with this company and spend a little extra to upgrade to a better brand

2 0 Very Short I am 6 1 and this jump rope was too short for me it says that its adujustable but it can only be made shorter and not longer For a kid this is a good jump rope but its definitely not for a tall person 
1 0 Warning Order from Amazon Don t order from the official website Billy is great full of energy and enthusiam I get great results from his workout much better than any other instructor My family get great results from his workout His customer service rep were helpful HOWEVER I strongly strongly recommend ordering your Taebo products through Amazon I ve been doing business with Amazon many years and have placed over 150 orders I never never once had any problems with my orders at Amazon When I had questions it s amazing at not only how quick Amazon will reply but will give a long thorough and kind explanation Because they reply within a day and take so much time with the response it shows they truly care for you and want to give you the best service possible I ve never found customer service of this very high and rare quality In November of 2005 after ordering the Billy Bands from the official Billy Bank s website I was sent a package without my permission from the company that contained Billy s energy formula supplements It was a 14 day delayed bill for 31 85 I was upset this was sent without me knowing but here s the worse part I contacted customer service a gentleman told me don t worry you haven t been billed just send us back the package and we ll credit you 5 into your account for the shipping packaging and mailing cost you pay out of your own pocket to have the items sent back Within a few days I send the product I never requested back Twice by phone and once by email from 3 different cust rep I was told I would receive a 5 credit to my bank account within 7 to 10 days I was already upset about this matter but it wasn t that big of a concern However about 2 weeks well over 10 days I never received the 5 credit to my account But there was a charge taken from their company without my permisson or authorization from my own personal bank account for 8 97 A few days later the 8 97 was put back into my account When I contacted the company this is their reply Thank you for your recent e mail We apologize for the inconvenience Our records show that your vitamin shipment was on a 14 day delay billing cycle I sent the item I never wanted back in 7 days not over the 14 day limit This means that when the charges actually went through you were only charged for a small portion of the amount that showed on the invoice I kept the copy and nowhere on the invoice is this stated You received a credit for the shipping and handling plus 5 00 dollars to ship it back too This means when the charge for the vitamins actually went through you were only charged for 8 97 This is also the refund that you have received the amount paid again since the item was sent back within 14 days I shouldn t have been charged and nowhere on the invoice is this stated that I would only be charged a small portion So basically they sent me a product I never requested Told me they would give me some money to have the product sent back Took money from my bank account without me knowing and paid me back with my own money they stolen To sum it up do business with Amazon 
2 0 Should have read the reviews I bought the set in a rush without reading the reviews big mistake The Cardio Boot Camp is missing which makes the prescribed program not work as the workout that you need for week 2 and 3 is missing The beginner boot camp is boring though the advanced is challenging fun If I knew what wasn t included I wouldn t have bought it They should list what s not included in the description It seems somewhat deceptive 
2 0 You get what you pay for I bought this hoping it would be a cheap and easy way to do crunches in the living room while watching TV I wondered how the thing worked since the pictures and blurb are less than descriptive What it boils down to is that this is a foot hook tied to a bar with a nylon strap The nylon strap is cheap and appears that it will wear quickly The idea is you hook the bar under a closed door then do sit ups crunches the problem is that the nylon strap doesn t actually hold your feet down I wanted a product that would hold my feet down and allow me to use it in the middle of the room Negative on both accounts You need a good sturdy door to implement this product and then it still doesn t truly hold your feet down Looks like I ll break down and buy one of the bars that actually clamps to the bottom of a door to hold your feet down

1 0 Great idea bad flashlight Rechargeable flashlights are a sensational idea an essential part of any family s emergency kit and ecologically smart to boot While this product is satisfactory for say a science demonsration on the Faraday Principle its usefulness as a flashlight is considerably more limited To its credit This flashlight was meant to last and will stand extremes of water and temperature When dropped into water it will float beam side up for easy retrieval It s so sturdy tha it will likely last for the lifetime of the user and you can t say that about too many products Shake this light for a while and a disk of rare earth conducts enough current to sustain a light for a small amount of time While you may read claims of up to one or two hours a faint but workable current only lasts for about ten minutes and then you shake again And again As long as you don t mind the repetition the wan stream of bluish light will serve your purposes in a blackout or some other emergency But don t entertain thoughts that you ll be able to read find small objects or perform any kind of detail work If you don t have a chance to compare this to its better competition you might not know that say the Sherpa Xray offers a well focused beam you can read by While no rechargeable can give you the kind of illumination you ll find in a traditional flashlight your options are brighter if you stay away from the Diamond Gen Invest in something more powerful and you ll find that a flashlight s usefulness becomes considerably greater This flashlight was disappointing and useless in any practical context 
1 0 EVERLIFE IS LITTLELITE 9 of 9 people found the following review helpful EVERLIFE IS LITTLELIGHT November 22 2005 Reviewer AGNAZZO Tampa Florida United States See all my reviews LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIFE FLASHLIGHTS THE PARTY THAT SAID THAT THESE FLASHLIGHTS ARE CHARGED UP DURING SHIPPING IS SUFFERING FROM SHAKING OF THE HEAD IT TAKES AT LEAST A MINUTE OF SHAKING AFTER DELIVERY BEFORE THE FLASHLIGHT IS GIVING OUT ITS MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF LIGHT WHICH IS VERY LOW AFTER THAT TO KEEP IT OPERATING MORE SHAKING IS IN ORDER THE ILLUMINATION WHICH IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO OTHER BATTERY FLASHIGHTS DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY AND NEED ADDITIONAL SHAKING TO KEEP IT GOING THIS FLASHLIHGT TO BE FAIR MAY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE LED FLASHLIGHTS THAT USE BATTERIES ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THESE SHAKING FLASHLIGHTS THE BATTERIES LAST A VERY LONG TIME DUE TO THE LOW POWER THAT LEDS OPERATE AT 
1 0 shipping not as promised I was promised 1 2 day shipping and didn t get it I was promised reciept by Dec 6th and haven t gotten it 
1 0 ok to begin with but now doesn t hold even 5 minutes In the beginning the led seemed to stay bright for a considerable amount of time but now after almost no use except fooling with it it doesn t remain lit for even 5 minutes Very very poor buy 
2 0 Bad Smell This stuff has a very strong smell like WD 40 or something If you can stand the smell you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store at least then you d probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt I bought this stuff because I thought it would be odorless like all other treadmill lubricant I ve bought But it isn t odorless It really stinks I don t like that permeating smell in my house especially in my workout room I recommend the LifeSpan 100 silicone lubricant It s a little pricier for the quantity you receive but it s the good odorless stuff

1 0 Not so good Got the mat for free for ordering the Series 7 treadmill and while putting the mat under my treadmill it ripped It is made by this rubbery plastic and it s just okay I wouldn t pay 100 for it it s true but I was very disappointed that it ripped so easily Not very durable but I got mine for free so I guess I wasn t too surprised it was given away

1 0 EVERLIFE IS LITTLELITE 9 of 9 people found the following review helpful EVERLIFE IS LITTLELIGHT November 22 2005 Reviewer AGNAZZO Tampa Florida United States See all my reviews LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIFE FLASHLIGHTS THE PARTY THAT SAID THAT THESE FLASHLIGHTS ARE CHARGED UP DURING SHIPPING IS SUFFERING FROM SHAKING OF THE HEAD IT TAKES AT LEAST A MINUTE OF SHAKING AFTER DELIVERY BEFORE THE FLASHLIGHT IS GIVING OUT ITS MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF LIGHT WHICH IS VERY LOW AFTER THAT TO KEEP IT OPERATING MORE SHAKING IS IN ORDER THE ILLUMINATION WHICH IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO OTHER BATTERY FLASHIGHTS DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY AND NEED ADDITIONAL SHAKING TO KEEP IT GOING THIS FLASHLIHGT TO BE FAIR MAY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE LED FLASHLIGHTS THAT USE BATTERIES ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THESE SHAKING FLASHLIGHTS THE BATTERIES LAST A VERY LONG TIME DUE TO THE LOW POWER THAT LEDS OPERATE AT 
1 0 shipping not as promised I was promised 1 2 day shipping and didn t get it I was promised reciept by Dec 6th and haven t gotten it 
1 0 ok to begin with but now doesn t hold even 5 minutes In the beginning the led seemed to stay bright for a considerable amount of time but now after almost no use except fooling with it it doesn t remain lit for even 5 minutes Very very poor buy 
2 0 Poor Pre Manufacturing The wood is very nice but the design manufacturing is very poor My experience trying to assemble this rack was frustrating The holes aren t properly pre drilled The hole at the top didn t match up with the cap plate hole which A made it very difficult to screw together the first screw stripped and B resulted in a gap and wobbly finally assembly I experienced the same issue with shallow pre drilled holes in the bottom and the bolts not going in all the way I never got to the point of figuring out the cryptic finally assembly instructions Based on the wobbly central column I decided to disassemble mine and send it back 
2 0 Good potential Bad Execution When I was assembling this product I discovered that not only were the instructions vague and that the product pictured did not appropriately match the product given but that the product itself was sloppily manufactured The predrilled holes were only half the depths that the instructions required them to be in order to properly assemble and adjust the final height My thought is How hard is it to drill a hole to a proper depth Luckily I own the tools necessary to fix their mistakes but how much money are they really saving by inconveniencing their customers I wish I could give this product a higher rating but hopefully there are better alternatives 
1 0 too small pillow This pillow is too small and it is not comfortable at all 
2 0 Not worth the low price I bought these skates last year with the plans of putting outdoor wheels on them When I tried to take the wheels off they wouldn t budge Spend the extra 50 on a pair of quality skates that you can keep for years When the indoor wheels on these die the skates die too These most definitely are not roller derby skates since those girls change their wheels all the time 
1 0 DO NOT BUY I bought these skates for my daughter from Sport Authority Since we both wear the same size I decided I would try and skate in them after my daughter She complained the wheels would not roll and when I tried to loosen them with a skate tool they wouldn t loosen at all I tried to skate in them as well and I almost fell on my face I wasn t expecting the same quality as my professional skates but at least hoped for skates that rolled safely 
1 0 Too small for my tastes I am a HUGE ski person and I got the jump it is so small for me because I am do like 50 feet drops all the time ___________________MY SUGGESTION___________________ This is good for you starting your kid out on there first scooter they got for the holidays or skate board what ever you get him and its good for those things Not Ideal what so ever for skiing I got it to practice low ground tricks like a 180 at least so go for it if you are doing it for your son or daughter with there first scooter or bike or skateboard NOT skiing 
1 0 Too too small This may be an acceptable ramp for a child 6 8 but an older child would laugh at this one I was embarrassed to even give it to my son 
1 0 worst ramp ever it wasnt very good and it didnt tell how bad it wqa 
1 0 Misleading advertisement There was no indication prior to purchase that the ramp would need to be secured to another surface thru nails or bolts My son saved up to buy this thinking he could use it on a sidewalk or road He could not It is too light to maintain any stability without being fastened to another surface 
2 0 not a very good product this ramp is terribly designed for a skateboard First of all i thought this would be a bit larger When i tried to go off of the ramp my nose hit the front of it Not only is it not fun but you need to weigh it down if you dont want to slide around If you are considering purchasing this item for use with a skateboard i recommend something else 
1 0 razor ramp it should be stateed this item is for 7 years and younger very small for older kid 
1 0 Surprising and not in a good way Not very bright for an LED AND guess what This is about 2 1 2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy toes Given the picture shows a spike on it one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something well the spike is more like a thumbtack I realize the images are provided by the manufacturer so I don t blame Amazon but there is NO excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this 
1 0 They are supposed to light I got four boxes of these matches so I was motivated to learn how to use them I had read the directions about poking them into the lid I tried stroking and poking at various angles and finally got one to light after about 10 minutes It burned down to the wood portion and went out Incidentally these matches are very short Perhaps one is supposed to light them with a lighter 
1 0 Airsplat service stinks==avoid them I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son s airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat a shortened M 4 airsoft rifle s weaver rail Yes I could go out and find screws the proper length but I though I d make Airsplat do their job So after several e mails with the service department they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size Wrong The diameter of the new screws is so big they won t fit through the mounting bracket on the sight Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws Why by a gun from these guys If it arrives broken you pay to ship it back Want a refund You pay a 15 restocking fee Take a pass on Airsplat 
2 0 Bag itself is decent but 3 of the 4 metal clasps broke withing 6 months The title pretty much says it all The bag is solid and didn t get too soft even after a good amount of use The big downside is that the metal clasps that are used to hang up the bag are of extremely poor quality and can t support the weight of the bag One of the clasps actually broke in two and two of the others became bent beyond usability All within about six months of use Unless you re prepared to spot weld the clasps to reinforce them I d look elsewhere for a heavy bag 
2 0 no traction for my feet in down dog I was so frustrated with those so called sticky mats my hands would slide forward in simple poses like downward facing dog So I decided to give the 50 skidless yoga towel a try This worked pretty well for my slipping hands but i had a new problem I was unable to get traction for my feet and felt as though they would slip up when in many of the commonly practiced poses in yoga downward facing dog even poses like triangle and extended side angle I really tried giving this towel a chance but ended up purchasing a harmony yoga mat those rubber mats which greatly reduced my slippery yoga experiences I would not recommend the skidless towel for your entire mat maybe you may have better luck with just the hand towel I realized with yoga mats that every person is different so what doesn t work for me may work for you I just thought I would give my 2 cents 
1 0 So noisy I can t use it I bought the CycleOps Wind Indoor Trainer to train at home when I can t hit the road because of work or weather complications If you are like me that means weekdays late at night or very early in the morning I m terribly frustrated because I can t use it due to the unbearable noise the fan flywheel makes My neighbors can t stand it Hey I can t stand it The noise level is comparable to an industrial vacuum cleaner To give you an idea I don t even hear the music from my iPod while riding this thing Don t buy it Go for the magnetic resistance models 
1 0 everlast mantis punching mitts Mitts no good tore up in two weeks inside came out very displease 
2 0 spin spin spin seems I may have already broke this bar twisted it to stop it from spinning while I was doing exercise and heard a POP now it spins all the time I use it Not happy I did not force it a suprised such a sturdy looking piece would break already 
1 0 bad radio worse pedometer For 20 this looked like it could be a nice light radio for walking jogging with a bonus pedometer The radio has no channel display and the only setting is a reset button to go the bottom of the dial then a scan button When walking it loses the station occasionally luckily my prefered station is at the bottom of the dial but if yours isn t this could be terribly annoying As for the pedometer it jumps by 10 steps just from clipping it on my waistband and several times went zooming thru 20 or 30 steps when I was holding it perfectly still thus worthless I m sending it back 
2 0 A good idea with a FATAL FLAW I m a big fan of Topeak s gear I own two of their racks couple of pumps bags etc I use the MTX trunk bag panniers to commute and I live in Florida so I needed rain cover I purchased this and to my surprise Topeak failed to include a strap for a rear blinkie Yes the cover is yellow Yes there s a reflective triangle But that s not the same as a blinkie Gee Topeak do you think people might want to run a blinkie in the rain Stupid lack of planning 
1 0 Clubs broke After only one or two uses the heads of the clubs began breaking off from the shafts rending themselves completely useless I m very disappointed as I have another set of Cougar clubs that has performed well for the past 2 years I would not recommend buying this set of clubs 
1 0 Dont buy I bought this set after reading the positive reviews but I must say that I am terribly disappointed Two of iron broke yes broke while I was practicing in the range Its completely worthless and I strongly suggest to stay away from this set 
1 0 completely useless software completely incompatible This software is completely useless with an explorist gps unit I am sending the gps i just purchased along with this software back to amazon The software will not communicate with the gps and the company will not respond to any of my support requests the web page has none of the patches that are supposed to be available and the live technical support is a complete joke After 20 minutes of being on hold I spoke with a gentleman that barely spoke english and offered me no help I knew more about the software than him and i ve only owned it 3 days I ll never purchase from Magellan again 
2 0 Not a good Fit Did not fit into the handle bar on my recently purchased bike It should have listed the minimum inside diameter of the handle bars it would accommodate 
2 0 You get what you pay for Overall poor quality in craftsmanship One can clearly see the glue that holds the gold trim in place and on mine the trim on the handles was loose and could be easily removed The wood is of subpar quality as well The price is low however I would not recommend these swords 
1 0 DON T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT OR COMPANY Please don t waste your hard earned money on this awful toy It is tiny The hinges and lock had worn marks on the plastic even before opening the product so you know they will break off soon The jewels never sink either Interestingly PoolToy doesn t list the size of this product In fact they don t give much information at all which is very misleading and disappointing What a rip off I hope Amazon discontinues its association with this company Look at the feedback record for them It s as terrible as this toy is 
2 0 BE WARNED If you order this sword you may not get what you see Yes you will get the same style of sword but as for the look forget it the steel is pure black Now if that s what you want great I personally wanted the silver steel look but got the jet black steel Don t worry it was the same sword just a different color 
1 0 regretting it Hi I am highly regretting buying this mat It is too bulky to carry And it came on sale in Big 5 for half the price of Amazon 
1 0 DO NOT USE THIS VENDOR AMAZON COMPLETELY UNACCOUNTABLE Expedited shipping was erroneously entered for this order Tried to change and then cancel it minutes after entry and repeatedly until it came to no avail Refused package a month ago Exorbitant charge made to my credit card and I will have to seek resolution with them since Amazon takes no responsibility Vendor has not responded to over 20 calls and emails to cancel refund order AMAZON PLACES ORDERS WITH SKETCHY VENDORS LIKE THIS AND THEN YOU RE STUCK WITH ERRONEOUS CHARGES BEWARE 
1 0 Very poor quality Amazon has the brand mislabeled as Apex but it is Ipex Cardboard box arrived spilt open and plastic carrying case was cracked obviously it was never intended to hold so much weight The rubber handles are very hard and already coming apart The chrome paint is already peeling before even one use Also buyers should be aware that you can only increase the weight in 5lb increments and if you plan on using both dumbbells at the same time the maximum weight on each is 15lbs If i would have thought about it when I purchased it I would have realized both of these Overall very poor quality I will try to return 
1 0 not sturdy at all We bought this for my 7yr old son and in 2 days he had totally destroyed it Thank goodness we had it on a tile floor He kicked the bottom and it broke letting out all the water What a mess Not worth the money 
1 0 Piece of Crap The idea is great for my son who studies karate but the quality of the product is below sub par The pump broke two pumps into blowing the thing up I spent the better part of the night hallucinating while blowing up this thing Everyday it had to be blown up again WITHOUT THE PUMP I told my son it was garbage and said he could practice on his big sister DON T cheap out with this 
1 0 DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE OVER THE AGE OF 7 Although they claim that this item can be used by adults it is the furthest thing from the truth You can only fill the black bottom HALF up with water which you wouldn t know until you buy it Due to this you can t do any combonations with this bag as you knock on its side with even the most mild of punches Also after a few hits it rips open like your fists were made of nails even with gloves on The only reason why this purchase was made was due to the fact that I have no where to hang my actual heavybag in my apartment This is not even remotely a replacment for a real bag Save your twenty five dollars for something else 
2 0 popped i cant fit a normal mattress in my new apt so i need this till i move i had it a month and the one of the seams tore and kept getting bigger i couldnt patch it because the hole was on the velour side so i had to buy a new one im not buyin a swiss air mattress agai 
2 0 Problems with the Valve I bought this for our camping trip to the Bonnaroo music festival in Tennessee The valve on this matress has a little flap on the inside that is supposed to stop air from coming out while you re securing the screw on valve Unfortunatly the design of the pump is such that you have a plastic nozzle that pushes the flap back to far to shut properly What this means is that you pump it up nice and firm but the flap does not properly prevent air from escaping while you secure the valve cover So you end up with not nearly as firm a matress as you would otherwise have I will say that the mattress did stay at the the less than firm inflation point while we slept on it overnight and the pump was robust and quick However the valve flap problem is serious enough that I am returning the product 
2 0 Broke after 3 days ^ Works as advertised except One of the attachment straps broke the 3rd day No particular stress applied or anything I m going to Allen to see if I can get a replacement That was my only complaint Otherwise it s fine Then again breaking on the 3rd use is a big complaint 
2 0 Nice frame but The frame seems to be the only thing of any quality on this bike I have owned this for three months so far and have had to replace the shifter derailer brakes and other small items This bike is NOT Schwinn s usual quality Very disapointin 
2 0 Nice looking bike but If you just like the cruiser look and will use the bike only occasionally for very short rides less than 10 miles then this is probably not a bad bike BUT if you want a much more comfortable and efficient bike and one that will fit your body properly go to your local bike shop and ask to see their hybrid bikes This type of bike gets its name from being a cross between a road bike and a mountain bike or all terrain bike They are available in several frame sizes so you re not stuck with one size fits all which is NOT good if you are shorter than about 5 7 or taller than about 5 10 Hybrids are available in a wide range of prices and equipment selections The price will range from just over 200 to as high as you want to go over 1500 anyway As the price goes up the weight generally goes down and the quality of the frame and all components goes way up But even at the low end of the scale a hybrid will be a much more efficient bike to ride more miles covered per energy expended and it will be more comfortable on longer rides over 10 miles If you are truly interested in covering some longer distances up to maybe 30 40 miles focus on the models that feature 700C wheels as opposed to 26 inch your bike shop person can explain and keep the tire width down to 35mm or under 28mm is a good size for most people if they ride only on pavement The narrower tires offer less rolling resistance making the bike easier to pedal and the larger wheel sizes improves efficiency a little also Happy peddaling A VERY experienced cyclis 
2 0 in stock but out of stock i ordered the item saying it was in stock but days passed i still havent received the item until i followed it up i was told the item was in a back order i think they shouldnt write in stock if the item is really a back order meaning they dont have it it delayed the item for 2 3weeks and it was suppose to be a gift though i can say the item was nice when i got it 
2 0 Better available This compass handles very poorly compared to other manufacturers The pin for the lid is cheap and the hing will likely break The card actual compass part that spins wobbles a lot so it s difficult to get an exact bearing It is like the oil in the compass is very thin Also the direction line lid spins easily making it possible to take a bad reading Ironically this is the Silva weakness as well If you need an inexpensive engineer style compass consider the Silva For a two more dollars you get an aluminum case a hinge that won t break and a card that doesn t wobble with the slightest hand movement 
1 0 You get what you pay for I was tired of the rental skates and wanted to be able to zip around the floor with my kids at the skating rink So I bought these skates At the time it felt a little impulsive to spend so much on skates Well now I know I should have spent more and at least be happy with what I purchased I had such a hard time skating with these skates and when I talked to the guy at the pro shop and 2 people online there are a lot of resources online do a search for quad skates I realized these skates were made for beginning kids never a 36 year old mom They are not made to do the kind of things on the floor you think you might be able to do In fact I couldn t even turn I kept having to push off because they would slow down I kept adjusting them and had a professional at the rink adjust them for me and forget it I m selling them at the resale shop and spending more money to at least get something decent 
1 0 A Piece of Junk This cargo carrier is so flimsy that I thought it would fall apart before I got to my destination The hinges are a joke and barely work It is also a nightmare to assemble 
2 0 A little stiff I think they are too stiff for comfort I do like the short finger but the material over the back of the hand is too stiff I thought it would stretch out and soften a bit But it hasn t Protects the hands well through off road trails though 
1 0 The Worest Deal EVER DO NOT BUY WHAT EVER YOU DO OK so i got this gun for christmas and i open it and i m so excited Then i play with it its working then i go to charge it boom 8 hours later its dead the gun will not work I checked the battery it has full juice I had my dad and uncles look and try to fix this for about 2 hours they could not figure it out Currently my uncle is going to take the gun apart and try to fix it DO NOT BUY THIS GUN OR ANY OTHER TOYS OR AIRSOFT GUNS FROM THIS COMPANY PLEASE DON T BUY THIS IT IS A RIP OF AND THE COMPANY HAS TERRIBLE CUSTOMER REVIEWS That is my review and i am a kid and im doing this on my moms nam 
2 0 Beginners Gun This gun was okay when I first started using it It s really a backyard gun and should only be used for beginners I had it on my bed which is about two feet high and it fell when my dog jumped on the barrel broke The spring in the magazine also broke There are better guns out there but if you just want to have some good clean fun in your backyard this is the gun for you The sight is a pretty nice feature 
1 0 Worst Purchase I was very disappointed with this purchase since I have always been an Under Armour supporter These gloves felt like I was wearing a material that sped up the onset of frost bite to my hands Definitely not for cold weather don t waste your money 
1 0 Some free advice stay away from mini steppers Let me first say that I did not purchase this mini stepper through Amazon but rather directly from the Discovery Channel Store Two weeks after I submitted my review of their product on their web site however they still have not seen fit to post it I used the Discovery Electronic Mini Stepper daily for 29 days 30 minutes per day before the cable around the pulley wheel broke This seems to be a consistent problem with this piece of equipment judging by previous reviews on the DCS Discover Channel Store web site Being inside the 30 day return window I sent my stepper back for a refund Customer service I must say was excellent only the product itself was cheap and substandard On a related note this is the third mini stepper various brands not all DCS I have owned in the past year They have all broken down in one way or another Feel free to look at some of my previous reviews here to get the details but the bottom line is that this will be my last mini stepper Take some advice from me when I say that these machines are built for people who are beginners in the world of fitness That is to say if you intend to use a mini stepper two or three days per week for 15 20 minutes then you may be satisfied with one However if you are at an advanced or even intermediate stage in your workout routine then don t even consider one of these machines you will destroy it trust me There s just too much that can go wrong pulleys cracking pulley cables breaking shocks leaking and I actually broke the frame of one stepper Through all of this I have learned one important lesson about exercise keep it simple I am now having great success with some simple resistance bands many varieties are available here at Amazon and cardiovascular exercises e g regular old jumping jacks I get a better workout than any I ever got from a mini stepper and I m feeling great and even lost a little weight in the right places Honestly if you want to save yourself some grief please learn from my experiences and avoid the horrible cycle of mini stepper destruction Just buy yourself some resistance bands maybe a jump rope an exercise mat an instructional video book and then get to work Exercising to tone your body and lose weight isn t easy and if it is then you re probably not doing it right but you can make it easier by not wasting your time and money on junk like this 
1 0 A funny thing about this machine and others like it For all of the supposed resistance built into this machine it enables you to do many more repetitions than you d be able to do of simple bodyweight core exercises crunches leg lifts situps and a multitude of others Why is that and what is the effect 1 Why The resistance is less than the resistance supplied by the weight of your own body being moved around without any equipment The so called resistance actually assists you on the return motion the exact opposite of exercise 2 The Effect You must do an incredibly high number of repetitions do get any effect at all and it won t be much even then High rep work should be full body cardio not isolated ab work Ab work should be the same as any other muscle building work After you can do 15 reps the resistance should be raised Exercising the abs obliques other core muscles to strengthen and build them If an exercise doesn t get difficult enough to make you stop after a minute or so it simply isn t difficult enough to do you any good There is no such thing as spot reducing exercise Modern ads know better than to claim the lie of spot reduction but they still strongly imply it Why do they get away with it Because people never stop looking for an easy way out The re sale value of these gizmos goes down to around 5 bucks as soon as you own it Why Because the market is flooded with as seen on tv home exercise junk that s collecting dust 
1 0 Very Poor I bought this based on the other review It takes forever to inflate and when it does the seal where it does must be very poor All through the night it leaks air and becomes quite soft I am waking up during the night reinflating this thing and after an hour it is back to being deflated Don t waste your money like I did 
2 0 OK for simple work The Brunton Nexus Star is a low cost fairly rugged basic compass Like any low cost compass if you know how to use it you can get where you want to go but it lacks features you may later wish you had On the plus side it is lightweight inexpensive and fairly thin so it doesn t take up a lot of room in your pocket On the minus side the baseplate is very short so it is harder to use with a map and a little less accurate when reading a bearing The biggest disadvantage in my opinion is that it doesn t have a true declination adjustment it is advertised as having a declination scale which is not the same On a baseplate compass you take a bearing by lining up the compass needle inside the North Reference Indicator sometimes called the Doghouse etched on the bottom of the vial Compasses with true declination adjustment allow you to rotate this Doghouse to align it with the desired declination That way you always read a bearing by aligning the needle inside the Doghouse On the Nexus Star however you can t do this Instead you have to remember to line up the compass needle with the point on the scale that corresponds to the local declination In this case the needle is not boxed inside the doghouse and I find it can lead to errors especially when you are tired and not thinking clearly after a long hike If you always navigate using magnetic bearings rather than true bearings this isn t a problem I can recommend this compass for use with a GPS receiver that is set to read magnetic bearings and it is suitable as a back up compass I also regularly use it as an inexpensive tool to teach students in my GPS classes how to use a compass but I wouldn t recommend it for serious work 
1 0 China s Finest Garbage I threw this away yesterday 3 30 7 First of all it s too cheaply designed and manufactured to stop anything as heavy as a door The tin plate on it fell off last week and no one even broke into my home I went to my local hardware store and purchased a solid steel Collins Axe 4 wood Splitting Wedge to replace it I bought a tube of Hard As Nail Heavy Duty contruction Adhesive and affixed some rubber to one side of the wedge to prevent slippage Now that s the way a door wedge should be Don t waste your money on this cheap Chinese garbage called the Super Door Stop Alarm Make your own right here in the USA 
1 0 these things are horrible they dont even go where u want them to they suc and i dont recomend buying the 
2 0 Gag ball This ball is radio controlled with a remote that is about the size of a small cell phone The ball has two small holes smaller than the size of a dimple on opposite sides that connect to a battery operated charger 2 AA The remote uses a 9V battery The ball has a small internal battery that apparently can be replaced if needed once it can longer hold a charge The ball can be operated for a couple of minutes after a charge The ball is not meant to be hit but probably can withstand a putter hit from a short distance Because of a rolling weight and circuitry within the otherwise hollow ball the ball does not roll straight on its own The ball looks somewhat like a real ball but has a slightly off white color and has an obvious seam When using the remote to control the ball the ball revs up for 2 3 seconds by making a rattling sound then it takes off still rattling away An arrow on the ball is present to let you know the initial direction the ball will roll You can reverse the ball s direction but you can t make it go left or right The two biggest drawbacks of this gag ball are 1 You can only direct the ball in two directions front back with the remote 2 A fairly loud rattling noise is made by the ball that probably can be heard from about 20 yards away As a gag ball it seems like it is of only limited use But for about 10 what more can I expect 
2 0 Body Ball Blue 65cm The blue body ball that was sent to me was not blue It s white with some blue print The pump didn t work right so I used a rocket type pump that came with a ball I had purchased from another company Plugs and pumps seem to be interchangeable The quality of the blue ball is good When I opened the box it looked like the ball was the wrong size but it expands to the 65cm My first thought was wrong color wrong size No inflation directions enclosed in box only an excercise chart Ball is OK pump is not I was not happy but didn t want the return hassle If you aren t fussy about color and have a back up pump go for it 
2 0 Disappointing My Daughter is 38 and about 30lbs It s the perfect size for her We mainly use it as something to lay on while watching TV or reading books on the floor PROS When in the chair position it s tall enough to accommodate taller children Cover is removeable and washable Comes with handy pink storage bag although it s kinda hard to fit the pump in the bag along with the bed Pretty easy to convert into chair there are 2 straps on each side of the bed that need to be connected in order to change it into chair they are color coded Might be hard for young children to figure out how to do it Inside of sleep bag is made of soft material although it appears as though it may snag easily Large zipper located on one side of the sleep bag Easy for small hands to use Weight limit 100 lbs CONS The Pump is VERY cheaply made and it takes a long time to inflate the bed it operates by use of foot motion or you can use your hands The air slowly leaks out of the bed We actually thought ours had a hole in it when purchased so we exchanged for another one But this one too deflates pretty quickly Example if we completely inflate at 7pm by 8am the next morning it needs to be inflated again because it loses about 40 of it s air Adult help is needed to change into chair Adult help is needed to inflate OVERALL It s a bit pricey for the quality I was expecting It would be nice if adult assistance wasn t needed to change from bed to chair and back Defitely would work as an extra sleeping spot for the night but it takes along time to inflate and requires an adult to do so 
1 0 Might not last long Bought it 2 months ago for in door usage thought it d last until the end of the semester After less than a couple of weeks of normal everyday usage punctures started to appear and the patches that came along with the package didn t help much Even though the design and the built in manual pump is a big plus the quality is very disappointing 
1 0 Blind Squirrel Just like once in a while even a blind squirrel finds a chestnut once in a while Amazon gets it right Had a very bad experience before Christmas when ordering a gift for my daughter After being scared into spending extra on next day shipping 2 weeks prior to Christmas on an IN STOCK item 5 days prior to Christmas I was notified that item was OUT OF STOCK and I wouldn t receive it PANIC MODE I sent an unsolicited E Mail complaint to Amazon My response was pretty much sorry but Amazon has no control over items that they essentially broker and don t actually inventory WHAT I noticed that they didn t ask for a review of my experience on that one But my son did get his B Ball this time and if it wasn t for him I would have never done business with Amazon again This review probably doesn t meet the guidelines and undoubtedly won t be posted 
1 0 NBA going to return to new ball I just read an article at the Fox sports website saying it is almost certain that NBA will go back to using leather ball There will not even be a bragging right once this officially happens so in my opinion don t buy it 
2 0 99 for bragging rights Ok i REALLY thought this ball would be GREAT considering the overinflated price and since it is endorsed by the NBA NOT SO This ball feels very similar to the cheap 20 balls you can get at your local department stores Feels similar to the Wilson NCAA solution game ball but slightly less tacky but since it has to be pumped up so much inorder for it to actually bounce it feels almost like rubber I personally do not like that This ball is supposed to be able to be played out of the box without a break in period Well i hope it gets to feeling better over time but since it supposedly has not break in period i am very skeptical I honestly do not feel the crosstraxxion design does anything to improve the the feel or grip of the ball If you like the feel of leather this is NOT for you I am NOT impressed Search for reviews for this ball before purchasing The only thing you can do with this ball that you can t do with others is say Well at least this is the Official Game Ball the pros use 
1 0 I expected coleman quality was dissapointed This tablecloth bleeds As soon as it got wet we all ended up with red checked arms I ordered a dozen from oriental trader for the same price and they are perfect Go figure Avoid these 
2 0 Cable was cut and bike was stolen less than one month after delivery I have HALF the cable now Good price and attractive product for a LOW security environment 
1 0 whatsit all about This bokken is only for looks and not hitting ant thing I used it for less than five mintues and broke It has a nice look and feels good but does have blemishesand Also say if you accidentally hit something even a little hard it breaks The company does a lousey job of wrapping the sword too The barcode sticker failed to come off in one piece and I ended ripping off some of the finish of the burgundy version of this bokken I spar with my friends all the time and would have to recommend the bokkens from karate depot instead of this inadequate piece of whatsit Anyone honestly that tells you differently is wrong 
1 0 Ball but NO DVD I am in the same boat stupid I should have read the comments before bidding on ebay and getting ripped off first on price I paid about 45 on ebay and then it came stright from Amazon and NO DVD I called cust service and all they could tell me is to send it back and get a refund what a pain I told them to use photo shop and crop out the picture of the dvd false advertising oh well live and learn ball does seem pretty small once I aired it up I think I will look else where for a differnt name brand ball And yes it takes like 30 min of pumping to get it blowed up and its a huge work out arms hurt etc 
2 0 Amazon gave me a refund I was also disappointed that the product came without a DVD though the initial description said so But Amazon has given me the refund of the whole purchase price Appreciate their gesture Agree with previous reviewer that the pump is really hard to work with It took a lot of time to get the ball inflated and the pump got hot meanwhile Yeah not very happy with this product p s Contrastingly had a bad experience with Dell on a similar situation when I bought a Nikon camera Dell blamed the wrong description on Nikon and expectedly Nikon blamed Dell Neither owned up the error But Amazon was pretty good I really appreciate it 
1 0 Wrong description or intentional rip off There is no 50 minute work out DVD included The pump included does not work after pumping air for 20 minutes straight doesn t even put a dent on the deflated ball and becomes very hot after a while I kept thinking the plastic pump is going to melt before the ball enflates if ever The 65cm ball turns out to be only 55cm I don t know seems like a rip off to me but amazon is not at fault since the Nautlius web site has the exact same description for the item Quality wise the TKO Cory Everson Fitness Ball 55cm I got a while back was so much better The plastic isn t so sticky and it felt a lot more durable than the Nautlius one too 
2 0 Too hard to compress spring My son has had this pogo stick for about a year and has not been able to play on it because the spring is too stiff and does not compress easily Even my daughter who weighs 70 lbs cannot get it to work Our 11 year old neighbour who has her own pogo stick had no problems but it is not for the beginner 
2 0 Cute but my 14 month won t touch it I just received this toy today in the mail and it was a total bust I gave it to my 14 month old daughter and she handed it back to me They legs that are supposed to make the music are hard to push and she can not do it herself I only paid 5 29 for it with free shipping so I can t complain At least My 3 month old likes to look at it I would not recommend buying this toy 
1 0 Don t waste your money Terrible as a musical toy My daughter liked the colors but that was pretty much it It is difficult to squeeze the feet too Cute as a stuffed animal 
1 0 Atrocious Very disappointed It didnt play any music its own quiet difficult to squeeze 
2 0 Warning If you expect this to play music by itself you will be dissapointed Basically each foot is a sqeeze horn It s not bad a plush but as a musical toy it s horrible 
1 0 CHEAP PLASTIC QUALITY DON T EVEN BOTHER This poker set is the cheapest quality there is For the price I kind of expected a lesser quality product but not this bad The chips are plastic with a metal insert The chip edge is sharp and there are a lot of imperfections on the chip like dirt was mixed in it Furthermore the thickness of the chips are UNEVEN Therefore when you stack the chips depending on the color 5 white chips may be shorter than 5 black chips The poker case handle broke the first time I lifted it The chip dividers are loose and the felt material is not glued in properly This is really a bad product which should be banned from Amazon Save yourself some grief Spend a little more money and buy a reputable poker set What a waste of time and money 
1 0 Jeep should take its name off this horrible bike I bought this bike thinking since Jeep put its name on it then it should be a great tough rock solid ride Boy was I wrong Not only the bike feels cheap and extremely heavy its mechanics are worst part After taking it to a bike shop to get it tuned professionally 10 of its gears still don t work Now you may say well the mechanic did a quick crappy job let me tell ya I stood by the guy as he worked on it for 2 hours yet the gears still didn t work Overall I d have to give this bike two thumbs down You re better off buying a bike from walmart 
1 0 Too short Indeed these are way too short for protecting your knuckles My boxing coach laughed when he saw them Ringside make really good long wraps which are better J 
1 0 Useless These are indeed the short static hand wraps You don t want static wraps period They re also too short 
1 0 No resistance This is my first review I just felt the need to tell people about this product These things do NOT have any resistance I think my 11 year old niece and do about 100 reps I ll give it one star for comfort but that s about it I m not even going to return them since shipping will eat half my cost away Buy something else 
1 0 Do not waste your money I thought this would be the ultimate gym bag The main compartment is too narrow Your shoes will not fit side by side you have to stack them The pockets do not expand wide enough and are not deep enough The zippers are cheap and stick It is very pretty but not very functional My 16 00 bag works much better 
1 0 What a joke This key hider wouldn t fool my 18 month old With a VERY visible seam on the bottom it s obvious this thing opens You can practically see the spare key through the cheap plastic Awful awful awful 
1 0 Field in a bag should stay in the bag Field in a bag claims to be the perfect way to get a baseball game going While this may be true the number of games you can actually play with this set will be ONE if the set even makes it through the game First off with these bases you must set up the field using the wooden mallet the pound a flimsy plastic stake into the ground With one of my sets I bought 3 unfortunatly at the same time not knowing their reputation the wooden mallet wasn t even glued together it had fallen apart so I had to just use the head Then when I put the stakes into the ground out of the 3 sets I had at least 1 in each set broke while I was placing them To actually place the bases the set gives you a string device that helps you measure out the field This was handy except for the fact that it took me 10 min to untangle the mess and then when I went to second base realized the string was not long enough Granted one could place 1st and 3rd and then figure out where 2nd went but the picture in the set up shows that the string will measure the base however it definintely is not the right length After placing the bases the team is now ready to play However don t wear cleats with these bases The bottom of the base says not recommended for use with cleats and boy were they right With our game we had tball children using the bases and even their little cleats and not all the kids had cleats tore them to shreds Our bases lasted about one hour before they were torn and the inside cotton coming out It was very unfortunate seeing as though we purchased three sets and all were done by the end of an hour This non profit won t see that money again So unless you plan on using these bases on the grass for easy set up do not plan on wearing cleats and not playing a true game of baseball softball you would probably be better off buying the 8 flat bases for temporary use and they can be left outside afterward too Just not impressed sorr 
2 0 An okay flashlight About average for the price nothing particularly illuminating about this flashlight The wide beam is fairly faint with a strong central spot This one will go out into the garage and likely stay there 
1 0 Disapointed I live in Argentina I bought it and someone brought it to me from the usa The watch doesn t work and I can t change it or sent it back to usa 
1 0 Very disappointed First of all the colors of the product at amazon pictures and the real product doesen t match What seens to be a silver watch it is realy a white one At the beggining everything was ok at the end of first week the light button locked after a few hours i get it unlocked in the second week the the battery has ended I m very disappointed 
2 0 too small to use I got this for my boy scout s birthday He really liked it and it is cute but it was a lot smaller than I thought it was I m not sure if it is usable My son hasn t tried using this yet 
1 0 goal frame and net goal frame is okay but net is a pile of pants and does not last five mins cant seem to buy replacement 
1 0 Get the Yakima I bought this over the Yakima equivalent for the locking accessory What a mistake i made The racketing system that locks the arm down over the bike is made of plastic and doesnt work I called Thule to complain and was told i have a faulty unit and i need to RMA it I sent it back yesterday and hopefully that is the case But i would steer clear if i was you 
1 0 Bad Thule Bad Poor vehicle attachment design Even though this is a receiver hitch mount item it does not use a standard hitch pin It is a permanent attachment to the vehicle hitch must be bolted into the hitch to remove must be unbolted This totally defeats the purpose of a receiver hitch versatility the ability to easily without tools change whatever is mounted in the hitch Bad Thule Bad 
2 0 Waste of money I bought this mat with the expectation that it would keep me from slipping since I tend to sweat alot on my hands and feet I was in for a big disappointment For the price that I paid compare to the other yoga mats I was very disappointed Lesson learned find a yoga store and shop in person rather than on line For those of you who sweats alot DON T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS MAT 
1 0 Slippery stinky heavy If you are sensitive to smells do not buy this mat Seemed to fill the room with it s funk Does not grip well I bought it for grip Yes it s stable Worth it Not to me Try the hugger mugger earth elements mat 5mm model It s got great grip and seems like a feather weight compared to this mat Not as stable in place but seems a better value reasonable price And it s biodegradable 
2 0 fogo rocket pole I couldnt find this item ANY where but Amazon Its all my Grandson wanted I asked him after he had been fishing how he liked it He said I dont like it I asked why they arent cheep He said It doesnt soot far enough OH Dylan is 7 yrs old Hope this helps 
2 0 Not so great Well they looked so cool on TV that I ordered 2 of them and I regret it It s awkward to get the hook back into the rocket once the bait is on I took my son fishing with them and what we ended up doing is not launching them out of the gun rod We left the pod open with the bait on the hook and dropped it into the water and let it drift with the current I ve come to find that buying cheesey little rods and reels are simply a waste of money If you re going to take a little one out fishing just use your own and let them reel yours in until their big enough to handle a decent set up The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it was a neat IDEA 
1 0 DO NOT BUY I road this bike for the first time today I got to walk it home The gear shifter boke off into my spokes and bent the rim This bike is a unreliable piece of junk 
1 0 don t buy this My first pedometer from Sportline worked only a few days digital display completely disappeared so I returned it to them and after over two months and several emails from me to them they replaced it with this Sportline 350 The first two days it worked fine although it seemed to count many more steps than it should have The third day in the middle of the day it said approx 3400 steps later that afternoon it said 1300 steps and by nighttime the display totally disappeared and never came back I just sent the second one back and am expecting that again it will take several weeks and multiple emails to get the situation resolved with their slow customer service Their products seem to be very poorly made and I don t expect to purchase any more after reading the reviews I have just purchased an Omron and am hoping it will be much more reliable 
1 0 Pedometer Review The pedometer worked great for the first two weeks Than my 1 1 2 year old snatched it off my jeans it fell on the tile floor and broke the casing of it It still worked but I had to be careful when I opened it because the back was broken and no longer attached Last w e it stopped working completely Everthing is set to 0 and won t move My husbands odometer seems to be working fine However I m dissapointed for the short life span M L McDermot 
1 0 Not so happy with my pedometer I purchased two of the same pedometer for my boyfriend and I and they both stopped working on the same day We only had them 10 days and when they went kaput 
1 0 Worthless I thought this was great at first until I realized that it works sporadically I can get up in the morning and walk all over the house look down and check my Sportline to find it is still registered at 0 steps Other times I can walk a mile or more and find it recorded maybe 20 steps One of the problems with it is its shape Unlike some pedometers like Omron that are a vertical oval shape the Sportline is a horizontal rectangle which makes it easily roll with the waistline of your pants or skirt It s important for a pedometer to be perpendicular to the ground for it to record accurately After much frustration I finally bought an Omron pedometer which I love Unfortunately this Sportline model is so inconsistent and inaccurate as to be useless 
1 0 inaccurate counter I ordered 2 of these pedometers and neither of them count steps accurately One only counts about half the steps I take and the other is usually 2500 steps behind that I wore them both for a week and got the same results everyday I could understand if one didn t work properly but I got 2 at the same time with the same problem I would not recommend this product 
2 0 Difficult to use This light worked for me when I used two D batteries but that was a lucky guess as the light did not come with instructions I was also unaware that the light was fender mount and wasn t happy about the idea of drilling a hole in my fender just for the light I found that replacing the front reflector with the light worked OK for me and this replacement was easy on the cruiser I have My main complaint for this product is the lack of description on the internet and the missing installation instructions 
1 0 Lousy design shoddy quality I ordered two of these with high hopes to be utterly disappointed First the design of the battery holders is bad They are supposed to hold two C cell batteries When I tried to get one in I initially concluded that a different size must be requried as it seemed the C size wouldn t fit After much futzing around I managed to get two C cells in without hopelessly bending the flimsy contact springs This one now works but I doubt that I could successfully remove and replace the batteries again The battery holder is too flimsy On the second unit the contact wire which connects the two far ends of the batteries had fallen out of its plastic holder After 15 minutes of trying to put it back I gave up This unit is totally unusable Nothing on the Pyramid package label indicates that two batteries C cell size are needed but not included Second this is a fender mount light meaning if you want to mount it to your handlebar there s no way to do that with the hardware included While the Pyramid box does say Fender Mount that description was not included in the online product description And this light with batteries installed is fairly heavy The lightweight plastic fender on my front bike tire would not come close to supporting this light and I doubt that many bike fenders these days would Why would anyone sell this as a bike headlight without including a handlebar mount I m totally disgusted with this flimsy product and with the vendor who sold it to me 
2 0 Not exactly what i thought When i bought the resistance bands i thought they were going to be much bigger than i thought i havent used them since i bought them i sent in a questionairre sort of deal back to the company i bought them from requesting an exchange but i havent heard a thing from them i m not very pleased 
1 0 STAY AWAY The scooter came with broken brakes After numerous phone calls to Razor they sent the wrong part They dont answer their phones during their open hours and the customer service is a slap in the face Buy another brand 
1 0 Piece O Crappo This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really really hate This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler 1 Pet Dog s Chew Toy 2 Door Stop 3 Play Street Hockey 4 Stress Release Stomping Toy 5 Mother in law Birthday Gift 6 Modern Art for Coffee Table 7 Nerf Ball Target Practice 8 Condom Dispenser Kind of think about it this is a great toy Have fun PS If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler you might like it 
2 0 Way too big I bought this watch because I wanted an altimeter but needed to return it because of its size It is HUGE looked like I had a clock on my wrist Take into consideration 
2 0 Bad experience with purchasing X Lander on Amazon Two Amazon s statements about this product were absolutely misleading 1 Usually ships in 24 hours It actually took 1 week to ship it 2 When I finally received the package it turned out that the watch didn t have leather band The band was made of artificial materials nylon and rubber or something like that I will have to return it 
2 0 Pump issues i don t really write reviews but i felt like i needed to say something about this one maybe its me but i couldn t get the pump to work So i bought a new basketball I bought a regular one and bought a pump I wish that infusion thing worked out because it would have been great to deflate it put it in my bag and then pump it up again at the court But my friend warned me they don t work so good I m just stubborn i guess That s my 2 cents Take it for what its worth 
1 0 Stay away from infusions We ve gone through about 2 or 3 generations of infusion basketballs from spalding The gimmick isn t worth it and there are better balls like the original zi o and the excel for outdoor and the TF1000 for indoor 
1 0 Airpsplat s Service Stinks avoid them I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son s airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat a shortened M 4 airsoft rifle s weaver rail Yes I could go out and find screws the proper length but I though I d make Airsplat do their job So after several e mails with the service department they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size Wrong The diameter of the new screws is so big they won t fit through the mounting bracket on the sight Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws Take a pass on Airsplat The sight seems ok for the price 
2 0 Its Really Picnic Set I was shopping for a new lunchbox for my son and thought this might be good When it arrived it turned out to be much too large for a boy s lunchbox and more for a picnic box for 2 4 people I kept it anyway for picnic use and bought a smaller one for his lunch The Pranzo is great for a picnic but it is mislabled as a lunchbox 
1 0 ABSOLUTE GARBAGE This nightmare was so disappointing It was hard to assemble and the instructions were minimal and illegible It is an overpriced piece of junk In addition the net for the hoop was not in the box and the hoop was put on backwards My son was so upset I would think this company would be able to produce a product that would be functional with proper communication and some info how to contact them if there was a problem because there will definitely be a problem 
2 0 good bag bad resevoir just got it today and i am kinda mad there is a small leak near the top so i have to keep it upright or the bag gets soaked the pack itself though is very nice many pocekts for keys cell phone ipod ect 
2 0 ok but not great Small very small kit not as advertised Every item needs expensive batteries 
2 0 Cheaply made Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that the other cars joystick control broke So now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work but are wondering when that one will break too I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior The controls are cheap and will break eventually The cars are very loud but on the positive side the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them I would definitely NOT recommend this product 
1 0 I do not recommend this The plug that keeps the air in kept popping out We took it back and bought another one Same problem So we took it back again I think we spent more on gas going back and forth than we did on the float Buy one of better quality 
1 0 Buyer BEWARE We recieved two of these for my daughter s first birthday She LOVES being in the pool but this float ALMOST changed EVERYTHING The inner tube sinks underneath the top tube no matter how you try and fix it or blow it up My daughter FREAKED OUT She had never been afraid of the water until we put her in this DO NOT waste your money 
2 0 misleading When I purchased this item I got the impression that the kit looking at the picture included everything but the gazebo which is the frame You should be more specific and mention that the kit is just the screen around the frame and the top cover was not part of the kit I need the top part of the gazebo more than the screen around it The title of this item should say gazebo screen and not gazebo screen KIT Unhappy custome 
1 0 Turn back now Don t buy from Joe Brands We bought this tractor from Joe Brands It was a big disappointment It was very poor quality and did not function at all as was described on the Joe Brands site When I contacted Joe Brands and explained all the problems with this tractor they would not refund my money 100 They refused to pay the return shipping to send their dysfunctional item back to them They told me I had to pay the shipping and send it back to the manufacturer in Wisconsin instead of back to Joe Brands in Colorado I am in Las Vegas and it cost me a lot for shipping to Wisconsin instead of Colorado When I bought this item they sent it to me with free shipping After I shipped it back to them and they received it they disallowed my initial free shipping and deducted the original shipping cost from my refund I am out over 100 because of Joe Brands IF YOU BUY FROM JOE BRANDS YOU MAY BE SORRY 
2 0 Works great for the first day or two I bought the armor abs because my gym membership just ended at my college So I wanted to get a few small workout machines for home The day i got it one of the rubber bands popped of its holder already The machine is designed very poorly although what can you expect for the price I ve had to reattach the bands at least 15 times over the past week and today one of the rubber band holders snapped in half leaveing that resistance level useless Overall though i have to say i really love this thing If it wasnt for the d mn bands flyin off all the time it would be a great peice of equipment If you use it carefully and correctly you may be able to avoid these problems though I give it a two because i love the machine but i hate its bad habits 
1 0 Waste of money the very day i received the armor abs 2 i used it and all the bands came loose that same day i see why it is so much cheaper than the 6 second ab 
1 0 rip off this is the worst piece of junk i have ever purchased i cant believe it please dont waste your time or money on this it b roke the second day rubber bands poped man what a piece of junk i rate it a fat zero but i only had an option to give it a one 
1 0 waste of money Not well made at all and only works half the time and the programming changes on its own I recommend spending a little more for a better piece Don t waste money on this one 
1 0 Um no Not like the picture at all and very cheap looking and didnt form to the head correctly Must have been stuck in the box too long husband said send it back Needless to say we got a refund 
1 0 DOES NOT WORK Does not work like advertised Ball falls way to low and right next to the pole way before you can hit it again It may also damage a wood or aluminum bat Last time I buy anything before reading the reviews on amazon 
1 0 Don t waste your money on this product I bought this for my 10 year old son s birthday He was very excited about it and having Derek Jeter endorse it was an added treat for him We spent half an hour setting it up and trying to figure out how to use it We eventually concluded that it was a BIG disappointment The ball comes around real slow and drops to the bottom of the pole I was worried he was going to hit the pole instead of the ball I can imagine how this might work for a power hitter like Jeter but imagine a 10 year old Save your money time and child s feelings 
1 0 Cord Way too rigid DO NOT BUY This is the first product I ve bought through Amazon that I wish I could give a negative star rating After involving three adults and spending about 3 hours troubleshooting I ve concluded this product DOES NOT work Customer service cites this is a product upgrade A video shows cable wrapping around pole and unleashing with sufficient velocity to hit What we received was a cable of similar rigidity to what you would lock your bike up with or tow a small vehicle It would barely even unwrap Imagine Derek Jeter in the photo trying to hit the ball three inches from the pole at 1 5 miles per hour and you can begin to understand this product upgrade 
1 0 Don t waste your birthday money This looks better on TV than it actually works The cable that the ball is connected to is very rigid and you have to really hit the ball hard to get it to wrap around When it unwinds it does so VERY slow and loses it s momentum and sinks to the pole before you even get a chance to hit it Plus they advise you not to use an aluminum or wood bat to hit it with What are you supposed to hit it with then These things you don t find out until you get it out of the box and set it up Don t waste money on this item 
1 0 Worst Bike Ever This bike should not have the name Mountain in it you can not take this bike off ride It might be good for paved roads but you will hurt yourself if you try to use this bike even on the most basic of trails Do not buy this bike 
1 0 AIR SPLAT IS A TERRIBLE COMPANY TO DEAL WITH DONT BUY FROM THEM I had purchased a rifle from Airslat and it broke after 3 minutes of use The quality was not good but the customer service of this company is the worst i have ever dealt with It has been 2 weeks and no replacement has been shipped i have had every excuse imaginable first they wanted me to pay for shipping then they wanted me to pay full price for another gun then they said they did not have that model any longer and I would have to pay for the higher priced model i still have not been refunded or had the item replaced i have spent hours trying to get this taken care of with no progress the worst customer service of all time 
2 0 golf bag organizer i would not reccommend this product i would rather do chinese arithmetic than put this together again it took a long time and i am good at this type of thing the unit is ok but not as good as it looks hope this was helpfu 
1 0 Water Actracting Holder I used this product for surface level snorkeling and was extremely disappointed 1 it filled up with water after only 15 minutes in the water and 2 the plastic holder came off of the clasp during snorkeling luckly I noticed it floating near me when I stoped to clear my mask Referring to this product as waterproof is criminal as everything I placed in the holder was saturated with water even after dumping it out and resealing throughout the day it continued to fill up with water In addition this product is overpriced as a snorkeling mate found a truly waterproof holder at a dollar store that kept his contents perfectly dry throughout the day 
2 0 Clunker Purchased the 418 Elliptical 5 months ago now Reviews after a week or two may not tell the whole story After 3 weeks the clicks squeaks and clunks wouldn t go away by just tighting bolts so I called for service It took 4 weeks to get a tech to look at it he had to order parts which took another 4 weeks Replaced one of the main flywheels inside and the track rollers under the pedals It s not as noisy now but still makes a clicking noise on every rotation and intermittent squeaks and clunks Thought by spending a little more on this machine than the cheaper competition these problems would have been avoided not so The heat rate monitor is not accurate but the rest of the electronic features have been working fine unlike many other reviewer s comments 
2 0 Ehh its okay This tent is alright Its not very sturdy and they sent me the wrong parts I bought it in the spring and this fall with a little bit of wind its in pieces and in the garbage I don t really think its worth the money It is very spacious just wish it was better made 
1 0 surprised I was surprised when I received what appeared to be a sales brochure I searched carefully through the shipping materials to see if I had missed the book entirely but in fact the small clumsily put together manual was in fact the 3 75 book that I bought online It has some new exercises in it but most of what we needed to know came with the therabands in the little manual that ships with them 
2 0 its good for beginners i dont have this ramp but my neighbor does i have a homemade quaterpipe that is 4 feet in height and is about the same price in materials the lauch ramp is really small and after awhile it gets pretty boring im a skateboarder and usually go 2 da sk8prk which i find more fun then playing on a small lauch ramp i dont think this ramp is worth the price at all u can get ramp plans on websites for free and u can build a much better ramp for a cheeper price 
2 0 Great lightweight plastic ramps This ramp set is really fun to skate on but keep in mind that it takes a lot of damage First it will begin to slide when you skate on it due to lost rubber bottoms Screwing screws into the edges of the ramp can somewhat solve this problem The worst thing that happens is when the front of the ramp begins to curl upward making it so you have to constantly pull it back down I forgot to do this one time and my skateboard wheels locked up and I went flying But don t let this turn you away It is a good fly box nonetheless but just keep in mind that a homemade wooden one would last you a lifetime not a year 
1 0 Don t buy it Have received and reviewed this item I cranked it for 2 minutes The radio played no longer than 2 3 minutes then died I tried to crank it longer same results It is useless It s large and bulky though very sleek and nice The cranking handle looks fragile and I suspect with all the cranking this toy needs it will break sooner than later Bottom line Don t buy it I own another similar product which has a simple look however the radio plays for at least one hour on a 1 2 minutes crank 
1 0 Well made This radio has a very good rich sound for such a small speaker The 1 bulb LED flashlight is brighter than I thought it would be The rubberized case is solid and durable Two minutes of cranking has consistently provided 45 minutes of play time at average volume There are 3 big drawbacks 1 The tuning knob is very small and next to impossible to read 2 The crank handle is the smallest I ve seen and feels like it will break easily 3 The worst feature is the on off switch for the flashlight It is a push round button mounted on the side that keeps turning itself on when you hold the radio or pick it up They should have used a slide switch and put it in a different area 
1 0 don t waste your money We registered for two of these mobiles for our twins We recieved both of them Upon putting them together we realized that the mobile can t operate without the pieces hitting the bar that holds it to the crib How annoying We returned them both 
2 0 3 flat tires I received this trike with 3 flat tires The 12 inch tire tube needed to be replaced The valve in the other two tires were defective and had to be replaced 
1 0 not pleased The quality of the construction was poor I would not recomend this to anyone 
2 0 Some real drawbacks but some good points too I just bought this product and it is sturdy and cheap But there is not instruction manual on how to use the buttons or explain that stupid twist plate What is it for I can twist without it Anyway 10 mins after using the machine I got a severe knee injury I didnt have an injury before using it but I got one now I am going to have to get rid of it 
2 0 pitching the tent extremely serious challenge cage net to put together it was the best price around and when it finally showed up at my door i couldn t wait to put it together until it was harder than it looked you should use more than one person to put it together maybe it was my fault but the net was not fast nor easy to set up just like the box says it was a challenge Extremely I would not recommend this product for someone who has no time nor patience for an hour long set up process I do recommend anything that folds up quick and pops up into position But the extreme deal would be an actual 10x10x10 cage you could get online for less than 500 You might have to spend the money but to not have to deal with the headaches over and over again putting this together is well worth it find your self an area out side and build your real cage and enjoy it all year long The nets are not worth the time nor the money balls still fly up out of the net you have to be really close and the fabric is just like a tent with as much force as im hitting the balls with it wont be long till the material is damaged Dont waste your money even if you do get it for 60 bucks The wind will always win once it catches sail it tumbles like sage grass Get Bigger Better Deals with the real Cage 
2 0 Disappointed in Wilson Golf Extreme Cage Net I received the net missing a pole which you obviously need to erect the net properly But I was particularly disappointed in the net and its ability to stop a golf ball It no more stopped a driven golf ball than drapped toilet paper Unless you hit the nylon target you have lost a ball I may as well hang the nylon target alone from a tree and the results will be the same if I miss the target 
1 0 Quality is missing I received my Cage Net on August 12 06 I set it up on Aug 16 I hit about 50 golf balls into it and one of the tabs that holds the black tarp tore loose I then noticed that there was a hole in the netting Where is the QUALITY 
1 0 great way to practice but shouldn t it last I got this net and set it up in February and been using it fairly regularly I was hitting some balls tonight and noticed some tears in the netting much to my disappointment Shouldn t a 100 00 golf net last longer than 3 4 months Completely unacceptable 
2 0 Ok but not great While I like the functions this offers the screen is a bit hard to read when riding Also the instructions aren t very easy to follow For example it is displaying in kilometers per hour but the instructions don t say how to convert to miles hour I would probably not buy this again 
2 0 Uh no This seems to be a pretty low quality item I love Zelda for certain But it seems that it is more of a toy sword than a replica of any kind Unless I missed something and Link s sword really did have a plastic handle 
1 0 SOME THINGS ARE JUST PLAIN DUMB ANYWAY YOU LOOK AT THEM THIS IS PROOF I have seen some really dumb things in my 46 years but this flashlight is near the top of the list A flashlight whose power reserve lasts only 30 minutes after 15 hours spent charging Sad thing is after not much more than 3 minutes the flashlight is down to half brightness 8 minutes after turning it on the light it gives out is useless such that you would do better turning this flashlight off allowing your eyes to adjust to the darkness at least you will see more than what you did with this lame light I have heard some wild stories but the reality of this flashlight has me thinking the people who made this monstrosity are quite totally and completely insane living in fantasy land This flashlight is what you buy when you just want a prop to take up space and look good because as a tool for illuminating space it is totally utterly and profoundly useless Your Good Money invested in this flashlight instantly becomes money wasted with no hope of any meaningful return whatsoever Don t say we did not warn you This flashlight should have a sign on it that says I am awesomely pathetic buy at your own risk 
1 0 WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM I BOUGHT THIS ITEM A FEW WEEKS BEFORE HURRICANE WILMA HIT SOUTH FLORIDA I KEPT IT CHARGED FOR 2 WEEKS WITHOUT USING IT AT ALL AFTER THE STORM HIT AND I TRIED TO USE IT THAT NIGHT THE SPOTLIGHT STAYED ON FOR ONLY 20 MINS TOPS BEFORE IT TOTALLY RAN OUT OF POWER LUCKILY THE CAR CHARGER WAS IN THE BOX AND THE LANTERN LIGHT WORKED VERY WELL ON A FULL CHARGE BUT I DO NOT GIVE PRAISE TO THIS ITEM AT ALL AND I GAVE IT THE CREDIT IT DESERVED THE 1 STAR IS FOR THE LANTERN AND NOT THE SPOTLIGHT CRAPPY AT BEST PLEASE DO NOT BU 
1 0 15 hours of charging for 30 minutes of light Small print on box Charging the spotlight takes approximately 15 hours using the AC charger adapter and approximately 12 20 hours using the 12V car adapter The spotlight lantern cannot be used while charging A full charge will provide for approximately 30 minutes of power 30 MINUTES after charging for 15 HOURS What the heck is the point of this flashlight 
1 0 Apparently Fix It indicates that unit will need fixing Despite charging the flashlight for the required 15 hours the light failed to shine for more than 5 minutes Also during those lackluster minutes of operation the emanating light seemed to be nowhere near the advertised 1 million candle power 
2 0 Cheaply made Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that the other cars joystick control broke So now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work but are wondering when that one will break too I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior The controls are cheap and will break eventually The cars are very loud but on the positive side the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them I would definitely NOT recommend this product 
1 0 Worst Customer Service in the world We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy s for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member Both of them were missing the charger for the battery and other hardware so our kids couldn t even play with them They were very disappointed What is worse Razor s customer service is TERRIBLE They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt Of course since they were gifts we didn t have the reciept Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement which won t be for a couple of weeks Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers All this hassle all the hours on the phone when they could have just sent us the missing chargers like any decent company would for such a high price item Our poor kids just looking at their motionless bumper cars Of course we can t actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it Happy Hanukkah to you too Razor 
1 0 Looks Good On Paper Just disappointed is all Wasn t what I expected and it s very cheaply made 
1 0 Extremely Disappointed I ordered this bike for my granddaughters 4th birthday The first shipment arrived on schedule but the box was total destroyed and without opening you could see that the bike was scratched and dented Delivery was refused and another bike was sent The 2nd bike arrived with the box being in less than perfect condition but delivery was accepted When my son started assembling the bike he found that several of the parts had been assembled at the factory incorrectly and he could not assemble the bike The bike was returned for a credit and we went and purchased a similar bike locally We still have not received a credit for the return of the bike I am very disappointed and will not purchase from this vendor again 
2 0 30 sec sweep hard to get used to I bought this watch for work to time a 2 min procedure I found the 30 sec sweep hard to get used to I m used to a 60 sec sweep And the minute hand was difficult to read I really had to check to see if I was at 1 5 min or 2 5 min 
1 0 Not very durable I only had this for about 2 days before the resistance band broke in 2 places I would say that the ball s tension would fall under the easy category I d recommend the Power Web over this product 
2 0 Don t hold up I found the performance of these Michelin tires to be adequate There doesn t seem to be too much in the way of rolling resistance and they grip the road well The road seems to have eaten these tires up I have less than 1 000 miles on it and the tires are full of holes that may say something about the quality of roads out here in Hawaii I m getting a flat every time I ride My next tire will be something a little sturdier 
1 0 Good for delicate people only excuse my english but if youre a delicate person then its good for you but if youre like myself then this product would last arround 4 days like mines all i did was walk to my job for half hour and it began tearing apart it wasnt defective its the material its made out of the product itself is a good idea but the material is delicat 
2 0 TOO DIM I was surprised by what I got This Flashlight is NOT BRIGHT at all Especially when used as a lantern I could hardly see the other side of my living room 
1 0 DO NOT BUY I RECIEVED THE ARACHNID ELECTRONIC DART BOARD AND IT LOOKED VERY CHEAP THE NUMBERS LOOKED LIKE A CHILD PUT STICKERS AROUND THE BOARD THE ENTIRE LEFT HALF OF THE BOARD WOULD NOT REGISTER THAT THOSE NUMBERS WERE HIT BY THE DARTS I BOUGHT A DIFFERENT DART BOARD FROM WALMART THAT WAS CHEAPER AND WAY NICER 
2 0 Lipo 6 skip it I did get a nice little buzz the first two days I took this product and it does give you a boost when you take it right before you work out You can push yourself a bit further at the gym The gassiness and stomach discomfort are what cause me to not recommend this product It wasn t so good or effective that the side effects were worth it I had no lasting weight loss when taking it just lost 3 lbs the first 2 days taking it which climbed back on a day later I d skip it 
1 0 Nasty diet pills Nutrex Lipo diet pills make me sick to my stomach I never lost any weight at all They just made me sick I would not recomend them to anyone ISh 
2 0 No Effect It helps with digestion just like any other multi digestive vitamin It didn t really help me output a lot of energy I didn t get the jitters or anything like that however I would think twice before purchasing 
1 0 Major design flaw There is nothing wrong with the knife itself but there is a major design flaw The ring to attach the knife to say a set of keys is on the wrong side so the open knife is not away from the set of keys This is the first swiss army knife I have ever come across with this flaw So alway make sure the ring is opposite the swiss army logo 
2 0 Falling Apart They look nice but they re badly put together I had to re sew all of the fingers within the first month 
1 0 cheap You get what you pay for These are extremely poorly made They were slapped together with mis shaped finger holes and seams Cheap and fall apart at the slights movement 
1 0 Never Received It This sender is 0 to me I bought this product on January 12th 2007 and today is Febuary 12th 2007 and I Still have Never received it so I Want My Money Back or send me my Product today 
1 0 doesn t work I tried to use this thing but it just goes off no matter what even when nothing has moved Waste of money 
2 0 you can do better I am writing this as a review of Hippo clubs in general I purchased a simmilar set from Amazon a year ago because it was a 300 set or irons reduced to 100 I was interested in the graphite shafts all I have ever used is steel and wanted a cheap set to travel with I have had 2 different sets of clubs lost during travel The first thing that I noticed with these clubs was my miss hits rose dramatically The clubs looked nice enough but their performance was less than par When I talked with my club pro he said that the problem with buying graphite shafted clubs that are inexpensive like these Hippos is that the shafts are cheap not consistant Your average pro plays with graphite shafts that cost up to 80 each He also indicated to me that high handicappers tend to buy cheap clubs which was a humbling fact that I had to swallow and that high handicappers tend to play better with steel shafts All of this being said I chalked up my 100 mistake and began looking locally at all of the golf shops for high quality pre owned clubs After 2 weeks I found a hardly used set of 04 Big Berthas for 359 I talked the salesman down to 299 and walked out with the best set of clubs that I have ever hit I guess my point is that if you are looking at these clubs you are either a new or relatively unskilled player like me If this is the case take some time and search out high quality pre owned or used equipment that will make your learning curve my shorter Let the golfers that get new clubs every two years spend 600 1000 for new sets Take advantage of their trade ins That s my opinion anyway 
2 0 So So mega phone I had to repurchase this product because my first one broke the hinge that they use to attach the battery door to is pathetic seriously a design flaw However with some Epoxy glue and a different type of hinge you can modify the origional product to be something better In this case you really get what you pay for Its dirt cheap plastic and it breaks easily I wouldnt recommend getting this unless you need something dirt cheap and only plan on using it a few times 
1 0 Horrible Product Stay away from this prodcut Manual sucks and the product is horrible there is no way this thing is going to work 
1 0 Let nothing induce you to buy this product The only satisfaction I have gotten out of this product is this opportunity to vent If the price seems too cheap it is Where to begin Instructions pretty bad Hardware missing inconsistent inadequate Design deeply flawed Mounting not on my standard mountain bike Manufacture cheap cheap cheap What result culminated my frustrating evening retrofitting it just to see if it would work I ll spare you the suspense it didn t Not a glimmer 
2 0 Belt Tore The velcro belt tore off after the second use Within a week of Purchase The material for the vest is not durable enough for so much weight 
2 0 Inadequate I bought a pair of these as a workout set for heavy bag use and have been mostly disappointed with them for that purpose Pros Easy on and off even putting them on by yourself Wrist straps are simple and hold well Breathe surprisingly well for the design Cons Even with hand wraps on I found my right glove to fit too poorly to absorb punches well the design makes it hard to form a proper fist without trying to grip the glove into a proper position to do so The left I have no problem with for some reason maybe just have a bad pair The padding makes blows glance off of the bag to a degree that it made me feel like I was risking injury when using them for actual impact punches Grips make my hands feel too open when punching can t grip a tight fist my hands would be bruised or very sore after even a modest workout with them 
2 0 Bag O K SAMFE shipping a ripoff This product falls into the category of not worth the cost of shipping for me The bag is a basic black nylon bag that is adequate for holding a large yoga mat The bag was shipped in an envelope via USPS first class mail for 1 35 SAMFE was the retailer that Amazon used for this transaction so Free Super Saver Shipping was not available SAMFE charged 7 50 for shipping I generally stay away from retailers who charge shipping in order to boost their profits hence the low star rating for an otherwise adequate product 
1 0 don t waste your money we bought 2 of these things they both literally fell apart within 2 weeks of receipt the stitching in various parts of the bag came undone we ended up throwing them away i ve been purchasing things on line since 1995 and this product was by far the WORST thing we ve ever bought run away run away 
2 0 Very Disappointed I bought my free standing heavy bag at a local store and I was very excited to try my new product When I got home I was in for a shock There were at least sixteen screws locks and washers in a little bag In addition to that there was about twelve additional pieces that needed to be put together All in all it took me about two hours to put this puzzle together and eventhough it weighs about 275 pounds once it s filled with water it does not take much to move it around when striking during a workout I need to keep readjusting the base back to its original position every three to four punches I throw on it For the amount of money that I paid this bag should have been put together for me I will keep the bag and put it outside If somebody steals it they will be doing me a favor Next time I will go with what I know and buy a wavemaster from Century now that is an awesome product 
2 0 Needs more stability and less springy I didn t read in the instructions that I was also buying a dancing partner This thing just will not stay still I tried putting it on carpet and on wood floors but the water weight just isn t enough to keep it still Power punching causes the base to tip and then slam back to the floor making a terrible racket If I lived in an apartment my neighbors would hate me The water ends up around 200lbs when full and just doesn t do the trick I have been thinking of using sand which tops out around 320lbs but not sure how easy it will be to get back out since the only opening is a small opening on top meant for water As for springiness you can definitely wail on this thing and it can take it by moving across the floor but in my opinion it s TOO springy There is no comparison to hitting a hanging bag It definitely needs a tension adjustment I d say this bag is probably better for practicing control I wouldn t suggest this for an apartment if you plan on power hitting 
1 0 Can t believe those weak guys I won t mention about the quality of this product But this standbag doesn t have enough weight to stand my punch I filled this with water to the full and when I throw a hook the front part goes up in the air and comes down Am I supposed to fill this up with lead I m not bragging I am below average young males heights and weights I don t work out never had a boxing training just sometimes visit the gym with sandbags and throw punches when I m depressed I can t believe those guys who wrote the reviews are so weak to be satisfied with this stuff I m returning this and get a real heavy bag even if it will cost a lot 
1 0 The parts may as well be made of glass I ve had this product about a month purchased from a sporting goods store at first all was well Unfortunately the bag became shakier and shakier as time progressed I had to reset the screws as other reviews for this product have mentioned but one screw WOULD not come out It was stripped A week later same problem I tend to hit the bag about 2 hours a day 3 times a week and 1 hour a day the rest of the week Apparently hitting it causes the screws to warp the holes of metal centerpiece which connects the stand bag to the base This causes either a screws to strip b the holes to enlarge and warp meaning screws no longer catch Apparently whoever designed this product forgot that a punching bag is made to be struck and hit Today finally the bag got KO ed because now only two holes in the metal centerpiece out of eight will actually securely catch the screws I m a 6 1 220 lb guy and I m only using about half of my full force into my punches again I hit it just about every day so in other words this bag is definitely not intended for heavy duty use I ll call Everlast Monday and keep my fingers crossed that the replacement part is made sturdier than the original 
1 0 Bad Reflections This handlebar mount mirror was most disappointing The adjustable mirror shaft has next to no memory and creeps into a position which is totally unusable Don t risk your safety or your dollars on this product It s simply not worth the inexpensive price 
2 0 Nice but not good for every day use I bought this stroller because it looked nice and sturdy I liked the stroller with air filled wheels and other features such as brake and wheel locks However this stroller is so cumbersome if you have a compact car Even with my Acura I still have to take apart the front wheel to fit the stroller in the trunk Imagine you have your kid and have to assembly your stroller in a before your walk It s inconvenient and takes up lots of space in your car s trunk I was mislead by Amazon description of the stroller that it would fit in trunk of any car Yes it would fit but you have to take apart the front wheel to make it fit in 
2 0 Light weight very light duty chair I bought a mesh chair that looked very similar to this and loved it so I thought I might like the Alps chair too I was wrong It s very light weight but it s a lot longer than my other chairs which made it more difficult to carry and transport The arms are attached to the seat with cheap plastic fittings one of which broke the first time I used the chair The next day three of the support bars broke completely apart at the rivet points throwing me to the ground and rendering the chair completely useless Save your money on this one 
1 0 Waste of money these clubs are a waste of money The graphite shafts from cougar in a senior flex that is way uncontrollable unless u are 75 My 8 iron broke the first time i hit it The bag is falling apart Save ur money and buy a quality set of clubs U can get some clone clubs that will last years and u ll play twice as better for just a tad more 
1 0 this gun is to much moneys holy jesus this gun is to over priced and is to powerful to be a air soft gun i meen dam its just not righ 
2 0 package missing Package missing It s never be received So I cannot rate it 
1 0 Nuts Got my Bowflex weeks ago and having trouble lots of trouble putting it together It s not the product s fault other than the fact that putting together is a real mutha Seems the parts could ve been marked better Identification is pretty much visual Instead you have a picture map to compare what part is needed I was doing fine until I inserted the wrong bolt stripped the bolt trying to get it out got the WD40 on it finally had to use a crescent wrench So my confidence is blown and then I continued on to assemble the seat backwards The assemblage directions could be better believe me I used the 800 once but I finally found that no matter what was suggested the picture was misleading and there s no way that could ve been explained Onward through the fog 
2 0 Don t bother When I purchased a pair of these gloves a couple of years ago I had high hopes My hands become cold easily and I was looking forward to wearing gloves that would actively help in warming them I will admit that these gloves are respectable as normal unheated gloves They are fairly well insulated and provide a moderate degree of dexterity However the heating element is ineffective Inserting batteries into the gloves provided little if any increase in warmth My fingers remained cold In addition I have recently discovered that the thin wire connecting the heating element to the battery in one of the gloves has become disconnected These gloves have not been subjected to any harsh abuse so it is disappointing to find that the wire had been disconnected so easily If you are looking for a pair of heated gloves that will actually make a difference and keep your hands including your fingers warm look elsewhere 
1 0 I was sent wrong merchandise I ordered electric gloves I RECIEVED ELECTIRC SOX I would like the gloves to be sent to me I can use the sox so would pay for them separately The gloves were 29 95 the sox were 19 95 so I should have a 10 credit If you can correct this error it would be appreciated R Heins 
1 0 Not as described The product picture and description do not match actual item sent If you look on ebay it is the same item that malibu wholesale starts bidding at 99 It does not weigh 6 but actual weight of item is around 12 oz It is cheaply made and not designed to last 
2 0 Ms the brace or axle to hold the goal in an upright position was to short and couldn t be used A new one had to be purchased 
1 0 The Mistaken Twinblade well it was shown as a Full tang double bladed katana but after buying the item and checking it out for myself i have found its nothing more than a rat tailed show piece as far as show pieces go it does look nice however its not the Full Tang construction i was expecting to see and feel when i bought it Fast shipping though 
2 0 Disapointing Purchase Experiance I purchased this item based on the picture I didn t want a cheap looking air hockey table because I planned to keep it for a long time The price seemed good for the looks of the table even though the shipping was 150 Arranging delivery with the carrier was a bit awkward but not too bad but the box itself was clearly abused and showed a general lack of care in handling I don t know if the abuse was from the carrier delivering it to me or prior carrier but it did have me worried about the condition of the contents I couldn t see any parts through the holes and tears in the box so I hoped for the best When I opened the box there was no obvious shipping damage however there was one spot on the surface that could have been caused by improper packaging The assembly instructions were a poor quality photocopy that cut the top line off most pages There was a separate sheet of paper instructing me to line up letter tags during assembly however the tags were not properly placed and assembly per the diagram on the sheet would have been impossible Assuming all parts were symmetrical worked just as well I was also disappointed with the quality of the assembly of the main components Alignment was poor making final assembly difficult and there was excessive adhesive all over the place even on the playing surface I was able to remove most of the adhesive from the playing surface except for one spot that may have been damage from shipping The table comes with a 90 warranty on materials and workmanship but doesn t include shipping As the table surface is the largest component I m imagining it would cost most of the 150 shipping fee to have it replaced At this point I m not willing to sink any more money into this table After the table was set up I was hoping it would at least play well I was disappointed there too There are some plastic guards on the goals that make scoring very difficult I ve never seen anything like them on other tables By the time you get the puck moving fast enough to evade your opponents blocking of the small opening your shooting for it fly s off the table In fact you spend more time retrieving the puck than you do playing Maybe this has something to do with the extra adhesive down the sides of the playing surface but it still ruins the game There were a lot of excited kids when the table arrived They all played about one game and now the table sits unused All in all this has been my most disappointing online purchase I guess there are some things you see first hand before you buy 
2 0 Speedo Aqua Racer Optical Corrective Lens Swim Goggle I love the lenses but these goggles are painful to wear I tried various adjustments but they are still too uncomfortable I sent an email to Speedo to let them know 
1 0 Totally misled I ordered and received this item through The Golf Warehouse It arrived and I immediately saw a defect in that the magnetic balls would not release correectly even with major force I contacted the Golf Wrehouse and they told me to return the item to them I requested a refund but they refused this saying the item showed signs of use and returned it to me Since then I have tried to contact David Leadbetter s organization but without any success I am desperately unhappy about this purchase and in particular the after sales service Derek Price Toronto O 
2 0 Great toy while it works I bought this toy for my 9 month old son for Christmas He loved it and it is a wonderful toy However in mid January it started to sound as if the batteries were dying and then it just quit I replaced the batteries but to my disappointment it still wouldn t work I tried different batteries again just to be sure and still nothing I had a very hard time finding out how to contact imaginarium com and finally just emailed amazon They responded quickly and it appears that I will be able to return the toy and my son liked it enough that I may take my chances and buy it again There are mixed reviews some saying that it is durable and works great and a few like mine 
2 0 Great toy but with a defect Our kids loved this so much so that when one dropped it and broke the plastic strip by the on off button making the toy unusable I bought another one Wouldn t you know the same thing happened a few weeks later This toy is supposed to be made for small children who have been known to drop things on occasion the manufacturer needs to correct this problem 
1 0 Popped the first day My husband inflated it and was extra careful not to overinflate it but it still popped before the kids even had a chnace to try it they were so disappointed this has now happened twice fyi the first one we inflated and it deflated within days slow leak what a waste it is so heavy that it would cost 20 to mail it back for a replacement don t bother 
2 0 It s a Stick For the price I shouldn t complain but what the heck What ever happened to quality control It came double shrink wrapped There was a plastic handle guard that didn t fit the sword so I had to just throw it away Very little pride in the product The wood was roughly sanded before it was painted Well it s just a stick afterall I m just glad I did not purchase a more expensive item from this vendor DreamObjects Read their feedback responses sounds a lot like aggressive Ebay sellers who get their jollies replying to negative or lukewarm feedback Sorry waste of my time and a few dollars I gave them a 4 out of 5 feedback simply because you can t tell quality from a single digital photo 
1 0 Nice rack but I purchased this rack a few months ago and it is very neat Problem is that it does tend to move when you put the MTX bag on The movement becomes more of a problem as the weight of the bag increases Another problem was getting enough clearance between the rack and the tire if you are short like me and don t have the seat raised up really far If you play around enough you can get it to work but if you decide to put on the Topek rear fender which I did you may have to adjust your seat a little higher than might be comfortable I just got accustomed to having the seat a little higher Bottom line is that Topek has made a very neat system that just needs a few more refinements and some better instructions to make it perfect 
1 0 Too Big Doesn t fit at Byrd Stadium These seats while they are as nice as they look do not fit into a seat at the stadium rendering them USELESS They take up 1 25 seats per and if you are at a sold out game you will not be able to use them especially if you have 2 They need to make them a few inches smaller 
2 0 It couldn t stand even for one month Due to lack of space and in need of activity I have decided to buy a mini stepped to increase my daily phsycial activity This one I bought from a retail market and the reason for me to choose particularly this one was the price of course the flexbands with counter Very limited documentation it doesn t tell you actually how you can adjust the difficulty levet I figured out a better way after two weeks by experimenting the device And then it sarted to make craking noises So I used some olive oil on the joints that passed Then The suspensions got air inside and at the very begging of the step it started to make a crack noise which I couldn t evade at all While experirmenting the device the electronic part got loose it was attached with a soo thin cable one touch and the cable was torn off OK I said that was my fault I shouldn t have touched it But Today the steel cable that holds the pedals got apart That is so suprizing I am only 80 kg and using it usually every two days for 30 minutes Very bad construction Ok Why I gave 2 stars The flexicables worked really well That deserves a point 
1 0 Looks cool but broke after a few months I bought this basket because it was the lowest price and cool looking But after I say 2 3 months the basket broke in one spot near the handlebars at a critical point I did carry a heavy backpack in the basket But still I think the basket is a piece of junk Plus the basket requires you use the hardware to connect to the fork which limits your height of your handlebars The basket seemed like it was badly put together and just not durable I can t recommend this basket Buy a basket from your local sports authority or something thanks DaRealDeal 
2 0 Go with the Deluxe version don t waste your time on the Elite The snap on the Leapers Elite Drop Leg Holster the term Elite must be used loosely would never stay attached It would always either unsnap or come loose at the back Eventually it fell off in the field and I lost it The straps would never stay securely in the place I positioned them The Leapers Deluxe Drop Leg Holster is much more effective Even w one strap it stays secure becuase of the wide band of material in place The method for latching the gun in the holster is much more effective as well Spend a few more dollars for the Deluxe holster rather than trying to work with the Elite 
2 0 Problems with DVD This was the 2nd DVD with problems that I bought from this vendor The first DVD had 2 sections where the DVD would pause but would continue playing and I was willing to live with it Bootcamp Muscle Endurance on the other hand would not play the Muscle Endurance workout at all I contacted the vendor and they said it was a problem with my DVD player and they would only allow me to exchange with any of their OPEN dvds only to better suite my needs I own 20+ workout DVDs and none of them gave me any problems like this one did The DVD is also fairly pricey and so I m afraid to buy any more of these dvds from them I was able to play the Bootcamp workout until towards the end before the cool down section where it would not continue playing I like Cathe s workout very much The part of Bootcamp that I was able to play was excellent But I am very disappointed with this vendor 
1 0 friedrich gone bad terrible customer service absolutely the worse Do not order from this website I had a bad tape and it would NOT play they refused to credit my account insinuated that I had a duped copy from somewhere else 
1 0 you must be kidding do not waste your money I wish I could give it zero star 
1 0 Not Recommended Well I purchased this bike because I previously had a Schwinn recumbent bike that I was pretty happy with but had to sell it because I moved I m very disappointed with this upright bike though I think the seat is very very uncomfortable so uncomfortable that I don t want to use the product The seat design in itself it horrible The way it bolts on is a little strange and it appears all the Schwinn upright models are like this Even though I have the seat bolted down all the way it still wiggles As others have mentioned my box came trashed all ripped and with holes in it In fact the UPS driver actually told me that I might want to refuse the product but I took it anyways I think I m going to attempt to return this if possible Although the entire process is a huge hassle since I work everyday the box is trashed and how heavy the product is I also had to help the UPS driver carry it up to my 3rd floor apt I don t recommend any Schwinn upright bikes although I likes their recumbent series I hope Amazon will help me come up with a solution to return this 
1 0 Huffy Service Stinks I purchased a new 26 Men s Huffy Cranbrook Cruiser Bike After assembly to my surprise the rear wheel would not inflate because of a bad inner tube So what do you do disassemble and return No call Huffy and they take you through nine hoops Finally they sent me the right part which took ten days and I took the bike to a local fix it shop which charged me 15 labor to fix the rear wheel No savings P S The bike is a piece of junk made in China The instruction manual is nearly useless 
1 0 Damaged in shipment The bike I ordered wouldve been a great Christmas present had it not been dropped a few hundred times before I received it both fenders damaged badly and paint scraped off the frame in 3 spots 
2 0 good bag bad resevoir just got it today and i am kinda mad there is a small leak near the top so i have to keep it upright or the bag gets soaked the pack itself though is very nice many pocekts for keys cell phone ipod ect 
1 0 Not what I expected at all This step sucks If you are used to doing step classes at the gym you will find it difficult to switch to this smaller step I didn t know it was a smaller step or I wouldn t have bought it It is hard to adjust to the shorter step especially when doing a turn step or V step It ends up being VERY close to a basic step I was so nervous about stepping too close to the end and flipping the whole step up that I was cheating myself out of a full workout DO NOT buy this if you re used to the step at the club I feel like it s more dangerous on this and ended up doing a lot of the steps on the floor If you already know that you like to step buck up and buy the club size step even though it is twice the price of this one Otherwise don t buy anything 
2 0 Poorly Constructed The way these bags are constructed or supposed to be is that they are stuffed with fibers and filled with sand for weight AT THE BOTTOM the part you DON T punch I was wondering why it felt like I was punching a brick wall on the left side that s where they stuck the bags of sand Just what a fighter needs before a fight or anyone needs at any time of their life to be punching compacted bags of crushed rock This is a clear defect I am considering returning it Not sure if they re all like this but I assume mine is not unique Can t find where it says it was manufactured but in this day and age and based on the craftsmanship it s reasonable to assume China Hey at least the cardboard box it came in was made in Missouri Mine also suffered a little damage during shipping the box had a small hole in it and the bag got scuffed It usually takes years of pounding before this type of damage occurs on it s own Hey it s hit or miss when you order online particularly with oversized items as far as shipping an handling are concerned The shipping box was damaged and oil stained the product poorly constructed So I d call this a miss 
1 0 Ark is for the birds I bought both the Ark III and the Super Ark The Super Ark is a slight improvement over the Ark III but I would never recommend people buy either one There are far better entry level kits for just a few dollars more available from other sources The Ark III contains 24 oz of water a food bar and a small inexpensive emergency blanket in a Kleenex sized cardboard box I ll use the products in the two kits to supplement the emergency kits I subsequently purchased I m surprised and disappointed Amazon carries these products 
1 0 Tent leaks Tent leaks in multiple places including door seam back panel and through seams on Rainfly This is NOT normal condensation I promise but leaks that resulted in two bath towels and one sleeping bag getting soaked The tent was set up according to instructions with Rainfly secure and failed to keep its occupants 2 adults and a three year old dry during a rain Made for a miserable experience 
2 0 DON T BUY THIS STUPID PIECE OF PLASTIC This gun is a piece of My bro got it some time ago He was so excited It made me glad to see that he was so gung ho about his new airsoft He loaded it aimed at a 1 foot target not more than 20 feet away sprayed as accurately as possible and guess what happened Yup out of the 20 in the clip about 5 or 6 hit Not on the bull s eye I can tell you that The 20 shots went wayyyyyyy too fast for comfort and the accuracy sucked like mad but my brother s hopes were not dashed yet _ He filled up the 110 shot mag winded it up aimed and the same thing resulted only this time the spray lasted longer than 3 5 seconds OUT OF MAYBE 50 SHOTS FIRED ABOUT 12 HIT I checked the gun all around but it was not defective at all except for the part that this gun was made very cheaply My brother tried it on semi auto which is usually more accurate Not for this gun though In fact the semi auto was even less accurate than the automatic feature OUT OF 10 SHOTS ONE OR TWO HIT i COULDN T TELL BECAUSE THIS GUN S 140 FPS MADE BARELY A SOUND WHEN IT HIT THE TARGET We were shooting in the dark Let s not even talk about the red dot scope or the silencer I only gave it a two because 1 That is the next lowest you can give and 2 This gun s looks is okay Please buy a different gun off ebay or something You can get an m16 with a grenade launcher with 300 fps and 300 mag cap for less than 20 bucks if you bid correctly By the time my brother had finished playing his dopamine levels were probably under normal In simple terms he was disappointed 
2 0 You get what you pay for not much I recieved this gun about a week ago and couldn t wait for it to arrive It managed to arrive one day early because I live close to it s store in California When I recieved it I couldn t figure out why I could not mount the scope It was broken Next I tried to read the instructions which are total crap because they are awfully written I started to shoot it and every time I wanted to use the larger clip I had to jam it into the socket every time it stopped shooting which was quite often Next I had my sister shoot me with it from about 10 feet away and didn t even feel it when the BB s hit in a T shirt Plus aftera while of shooting the semi automatic started to fail and it would only shoot automatic Lastly in it s first CQB the strap fell completely off Here are the main good s and bad s of this gun Good relatively cheap lays down a lot of BB s in a short amount of time collapsable stock is nice relativly accuracte at close range Bad Clips either tiny or worthless because it won t stay in the gun extremely weak accesories may come broken insructions awful low battery life fire settings jam don t work P S I m not really Jacqueline K Schmidt 
2 0 Really sharp a bit TOO sharp focus = a great FLASHLIGHT Good points of the EL 300 Powerful sharp beam LONG run per battery change easy on off quick mount clamp for anti theft and it s a superb FLASHLIGHT I like to use it for undersink and underhood repairs so I often borrow it from my bike This light is intense enough to force a person to avert eyes if the beam hits direct from even say 40 away Cateye does caution us not to play the beam on people s eyes In my estimate it is mostly a terrific flashlight and not a great bike mounted headlight at least as a stand alone Trouble is that sharp focused narrow beam makes you choose between two conflicting and shifting essentials lighting your path you actually CAN with this focused power or alerting others to your presence That would mean focusing it more toward oncoming traffic or a tad right or left toward peripheral traffic depending where you are and how the road tracks and where cars are coming from It s a real attention getter to oncoming drivers which is great if conditions are all just right IF you focus the lamp near level and if the drivers are considerate enough to all approach from in front of your beam However traffic off to the side is another deal since the headlight s peripheral light suffers by contrast I nearly took a short trip to a long rest as a result Late on a quiet night one flaky guy entering a major broad secondary road I was traveling was coming fast up to his stop sign on a side street to my right ahead of where I had just rounded a curve He had a view accross broad lawns on up the dark road behind me After slowing just a bit he accelerated and ran his stop sign I was right near his position on his side street committed pedaling about 15 17 MPH about to cross his bow He started his right turn gunning it merging with unseen ME He was totally UNAWARE OF ME and was clearly of this mindset No double CAR headlights no CAR noise so no CAR so nuttin coming so good to go so GUN IT all in the space of a couple seconds Moving fast with the right of way I had the EL 300 blazing away bright Only it was focused straight ahead of me and a tad downward toward the road surface yards in front I was dependent on the EL 300 to send ahead to the likes of him unavoidable announcing LIGHT It s what I paid for about 45 00 delivered I also wore a white helmet had reflective stripes on my panniers and rack trunk and the churning reflectors on wheels and pedals But I know darn well all the reflectors in the world have no merit when not bathed by headlights and if not also bouncing back at a narrow angle to the driver s eyes That s why I own a headlight It s why now enlightened NJ demands a bike headlight Of course neither does a DRIVER have any merit when s he rewrites the stopsign law to read No need to stop as long as I don t SEE ANYONE COMING He nearly killed me coming fast at me broadside He had regained nearly 15 or more mph as he started his right turn still accelerating when he spotted me and panic braked We were at one point about 2 feet apart thanks to his hard braking and my veering left on the luckily deserted dark main road I was for a fraction of a second looking DOWN at his headlights and bumper almost below me Could have reached over and touched his hood ornament Incredible experience It was my closest call ever and scared the hell out of me It must ve scared the hell out of him too He registered his shock and awe with a reproaching after fact horn blast as he scrambled around and passed me racing off before I could read his plate I guess it must ve ticked him off my scaring HIM with that close call One little vehicular manslaughter can change your address awhile Equally maddening for him after he passed the intruding cyclist with the red blinkie taillight and the white helmet and all the reflectors THOSE alerted him once I was his front and center target he would had to then see that blazing headlight s pencil beam in his rear view mirror Damn nuttin he could blame on this creep on the bike The EL 300 simply failed me that time as I see it by focusing most of its light in a narrow long projecting beam It was focused left of where he was looking when I was very close to the side street he was traveling ignoring his stop sign There should from so much light energy be some part diverted wider closer to the bike even if lower intensity In my judgement there are two related design flaws with this lamp 1 The narrow focused beam making you live with the single direction in which you aim the beam Its relatively dim peripheral light gets lost in any ambient light 2 That is in turn aggravated by its wandering from the aiming you settle on both vertically and horizontally The vertical part is the worse the mounting clamp sets too far back from the headlight s balance point so it s a seesaw that s forward heavy Lift your bike front tap it down lightly and you ve likely refocused the lamp lower as you would not if the mounting were at the balance point Aim it temporarily right and tight and you are seemingly good to go but only as far as the first noticeable bump It then drops a few degrees and you keep correcting it vertically to light EITHER your intended path or the oncoming drivers windshields Your need is like being at the Oscars you want to both see and BE SEEN only in this case to save your life I am chasing after another LED lamp now which I understand to have a wider along with brighter beam I have respect for Cateye in general Their current website page of battery op headlamps does not offer the EL 300 
1 0 TERRIBLE PIECE OF JUNK I ordered 2 of these flimsy tables They were not only expensive to ship but one arrived damaged The one that was not damaged in transit would not even open fully meaning that people s drinks would slide off the table These are the most flimsy tables I have ever encountered If it weren t for the replacement tables I found at costco the party I planned would have been a disaster 
1 0 Looks great poor output Like other users I found the light output substandard I bought it specifically as an emergency light source If I really needed this light there really would be an emergency Absolutely pathetic 
1 0 Very Poor Light Output I really wanted to like this lantern It is a nice size and is nicely made at a great price but the light output is pathetic The package gives the impression that there are 4 leds in it but I find that doubtful The light output is no better than the output from a tiny key fob Princeton Tec or Photon In fact I think you could read a map or a book play cards or follow a trail more easily with one of the tiny key fob lights I m returning mine 
2 0 Cat Eye Vectra Metered Mediocrity I purchased this product from Performance bike to replace a much older 10yr CatEye wired computer I have a certain amount of brand loyalty to CatEye because their products are typically of higher quality almost always manufactured in Japan as opposed to China and typically last a long time like the aforementioned 10 year old cycle computer I purchased this product without much hesitation but was disappointed with the unusually stripped feature set The CatEye Vectra is missing two critical functions ride timing and average speed features even my 10 year old Velo2 computer has It offers only current speed max odometer clock and trip distance The overall quality of the unit is good and I m sure it will last for years with the solid Japanese construction but I ll seek another unit because the missing features make it unusable for my purposes Luckily the sender unit magnetic pickup is reverse and cross compatible with CatEye s other wireless computers i e it works with my older CatEye Cordless 2 computer also Bottom Line Pick another CatEye model and watch the feature set carefully 
2 0 looks good only better if it works I bought it given reviews by others but my one must have been faulty coz it worked for about 1 second after installing it and it hasn t worked ever since I d suggest any would be buyer pay a bit more for something that works 
2 0 Bell Bicycle Computer It is reasonably accurate The numbers displayed are formed irregularly You can t zero it out by zeroing one category i e Distance The price is reflective of its quality 
2 0 save your money Made of a soft steel the legs attachment is a bit flimsy so it leans forward too much May not accommodate bikes with disk brakes the upper hook is too low for the wide frame opening I had to drill a hole and move the hook closer to the top of the stand to make it hold my 26 mountain bike 
2 0 Hard and slick may be good for some things but not footballs I m in charge of a weekly touch football game where we use an official NFL football from a previous year and I wanted to get another one for backup I know The Duke is supposed to be the official NFL ball from this year but there seems to be something wrong with the balls Amazon is shipping The first ball I got from Amazon was hard as a rock slick as all get out and had poor stitching in the laces I got a second one and the stitching was a bit better but it was still hard and slippery And when it was exposed to rain the ball stained the hands of everyone who touched it with red coloring I have no clue if that s to be expected or not since it s all leather but it seems odd In any case you can grip the ball with a good pair of sticky football gloves which also help mitigate the pain of catching the ball So it is usable and throws a nice spiral but maybe I play ball with a bunch of wussies cuz no one else wants to get near that thing out of fear of breaking their hands which is kind of annoying given how much i paid for the balls Maybe the footballs just need to be broken in but I m not really sure how to do that aside from playing with them which no one seems to want to do I ve tried to let some air out to make the things more user friendly but it doesn t really help Anyway I find it really hard to believe this is the ball the NFL played with this year Something about them just seems cheaply made In any case I suggest you save some money and go with a decent composite leather ball 
1 0 Not Worth the Money This is very heavy and hard to fit anywhere for storage Very hard to use even when you adjust the tension to a low setting I tried working out on it for about a week and gave up it will most likely be tossed 
2 0 Nice Ti set but with manufacturing defect I have been looking for nice Ti set for camping and finally found it in Amazon at very cheap price The Ti set is really light and good for backpackers Unfortunately I found one my of set I bought 2 sets got manufacturing defects the fork is bent at a smaller angle which looks quite weird when I stack them together Hope Brunton should do better QA on their products Apart from this the Ti set is quite nice But buy with your own risk you never know the angle problem if you buy 1 set only 
2 0 Mediocre at best While this rack looks good and appears well constructed it s mounting system leaves something to be desired While attempting to lock this unit down tight enough to keep it from constantly twisting around I managed to bend the locking lever Now don t get me wrong this is mounted on my wife s bike a cruiser and has had at most 10 lbs of groceries in the handy basket you can purchase that slides right on But having to stop every so often to straighten this thing out is quite annoying I suppose I will end up modifying the locking mechanism to avoid further aggravation By the way I have a Delta rear rack on my ATB that mounts to the seat post using a 4 bolt clamp Much sturdier and it was much less expensive as well 
2 0 not practical i bought this knife for my husband for a christmas gift at first he was thrilled to get a new one upon putting the knife on his key ring and trying to use it he noticed that the blade opens toward the key chain making it almost impossible and very uncomfortable to use He had to buy another knife that opened the opposite way He did however like the other features namely the light and the pen 
1 0 Never buy this bike Terrible assemble I coudln t even assembel front wheel The axle is way short and no axle nut So there s no way to place wheel in fork drop outs 
1 0 Garbage Do not buy this bike I got to ride mine for about 35 minutes before it was broke The crank is cheap aluminum and the peddals are steal well the steal threads chew right through the aluminum in no time flat 
2 0 great design too small the design of this product that it is a backpack is PERFECT for my husband s lunch at work HOWEVER it is too small for the two or three medium sized gatorade bottles and lunch contents 
1 0 Wrong Item This item was sent back the sleeping bag was not sent and was on the invoice I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY REFUND CHECK This is the first time I have had any problems with items sent on Amazon I like Amazon because I can send a personal check and not a credit card Please send me my refund Candice M Tressler January 9 200 
2 0 Okay but break in half and chip These are fast but inaccurate and break easily bet bigger and more accurate bb 
1 0 Beware of rain This tent is not designed for the rain instead of running off it collects on the top If left unattended it pools up until the poles bend and the entire this collapes unrepairable 
1 0 buyer beware I recently purchased this item and with the first nite of rainfall it crashed down The cheap metal sides were bent and it became useless A waste of over three hundred dollars 
2 0 Very disappointed These skates are very comfortable but within ten minutes the stopper had busted No wonder this item is no longer being sold 
1 0 You get what you pay for sigh Very lightweight fragile and poorly finished Not sure what the hardwood actually is It looks oak like but is far too lightweight for it s size It came a bit rough and splintery and only got worse over time The lacquer or whatever it is that they finished it with developed spiderweb cracks almost immediately and then began to flake off I only used it for kata didn t feel safe actually hitting anything with it let alone using it to defend against a weapon for tandem drills After a few months of very little use mostly sitting on the rack it began to develop cracks Perhaps it wasn t dried properly when they applied the finish Regardless the one I received 50 model was cheap junk You get what you pay for Not only not recommended but downright dangerous if you hit anything with it Spend a little more to get better quality 
2 0 Blow Back Problems This Is a cool gun BUT Has NO acuracy and the instruction manual is really hard to read i like it as a side arm but only in tight situations 
1 0 Well well the first day i got it i popped in the battires and really thought it was good i dry shot it a few times and showed off to my dad because he got me a horrible spring pistol for christmas i charged it for a couple of hour and put some bbs in and shot some its the slowest shooting gun ive ever seen it wouldnt hurt even at point blank but i kinda recomend it for 4 year old backyard games 1 5 out of 5 
1 0 Doesn t Last Well i got through about a clip and a half before it started breaking First it went from semi auto to uncontrolled auto then it just stopped working It was pretty cool for a bit and is pretty light and easy to set up but I d suggest looking somewhere else for a pistol 
1 0 Not comfortable This would be a great tube except it forces you to sit up in an uncomfortable position Unless you re worried about your posture when hanging out at the lake find another tube 
2 0 YIKES Wow I thought THULE was THE company for this type of stuff Boy was I mad after a trip from NJ to SC The bag was mounted to my roofrack and was a little noisy top be expected But when I got to SC and opened the bag the horror The inside lining shredded and flaked off on everything There were also 2 holes along the to seam What a mess and I couldn t use the bag on the way home had to ship my stuff home I just wrote THULE we ll see if they come thru for the customer Sept 12 2005 THULE sent me a replacement an Escape 2 Great customer service but does this mean the Escape is better Is the Quest inferior There was no coorespondence with the repalcement I ll try it out this summer 
2 0 Not much more than a waterproof penlight I bought this to replace a C Strobe light I used as a tail light on my bicycle The C Strobe was bright flashed bright enough to make car drivers complain and waterproof just not rugged enough to survive being run over by a truck when it fell off my backpack This one was by the same manufacturer with strobe action and 1 3 the cost It doesn t flash the strobe action is the way it appears to flash as you go in and out of the side ring of light It isn t anywhere near as bright as the C Strobe I m going to get a C Strobe later this month from a local boating dealer 
1 0 Not worth the price I was very disappointed with the Ironman Speed Jump Rope It is made of cheap plastic and even after a month of hanging from my 2nd floor banister with a weight on the end it s still coiled and kinked It s impossible to jump with it as you never know when one of the kinks will bump the bottom of your foot I would not buy it again even for the low price charged by Amazon 
1 0 People notice but not very practical This Bobber Cooler is definitely a conversation piece I have had so many comments about it I used it when floating down a small river near home No Rapids just calm water it doesn t hold its weight literally The first thing is that the opening is in the center of the cooler making it impossible to get drinks out with out pulling the whole cooler out of the water The opening seam rides just barely about the water and since it is round the weight shifts a little and the seam will dip into the water The cooler then fills up with water which almost immediatly melts the ice and as it fills up it will sink to the bottom maybe if there was a rubber gasket to seal it better it might be ok The 2 plastic clasps on each side used to close the cooler are really easy to break off plus they are facing the wrong direction If you bump something like a rock or a log it will push the clasp back and then unlatch the cooler This cooler might be good to use in bodys of water that do not have current like a pool but I don t suggest towing it behind anything I suggest using one of the many inflateble coolers on the market 
1 0 misrepresented These ear plugs I feel were misrepresented in that the picture shows one type the kind I wanted but what was sent to me was not at all what was in the picture I did return them without any difficulty 
1 0 Not as seen on the picture I bought 2 sets of this speedo ear plugs Those 2 sets shipped to me are different as shown online They aren t that comfortable while plug into the ears the rings of the rubber are a little too thick and hard 
1 0 did not come as described did not come with supressor or laser and the sight broke within 3 shots do not bu 
1 0 horrible The only way other people can thnk it is a good gun is because when they first get it they look and say cool well it cant even shoot so its not cool this isnt just mine either its all of them cause it cant shoot because its made by the cheapest plastic and i looked inside its only held together by the outside the laser is off target and sucks and it shots as fast as u can throw it if it shoots I had this for about ten minutes before i thought that i got 13 dollars ript off it fell apart after 1 hour it couldnt shoot after 5 minutes Dont get this gun cause it isnt just mine its the way its made those othe reviews are people who probly dont ever use it and probly never have used it 
1 0 This Gun is extremely cheap It is NOT worth the money It broke the first day I got it and with the silencer and all that crap it doesn t shoot The BBs fall out the front It jammed like 6 times before it broke This gun is somewhat accurate but doesnt hurt at all It sucks a lot Don t buy any products from HotImport Toys they are cheap worthless and extremely breakable 
1 0 Heat sox do not work I never write reviews but I had to make my comments on these socks I bought them to keep my feet warm at me desk at work I put them on and turned the switch to high They DO NOT EVEN GET WARM at all I thought it was broken but realized it was both socks that didn t get warm These are a total rip off and I am going to try and send them back 
2 0 Explosion I used this ball with exercise video 4 times On the 5th day my 16 yr old daughter was sitting on it talking on the phone and it exploded sounded like a tire blowing out and the ball ended up with a two foot piece blown out of it not just a hole 
1 0 Terrible Video for Several Reasons If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me I urge you to buy something else 
2 0 MarinePro 12V Coffee Maker Used once Unit Blew a fuse No manufacturer supplied info on fuse and none on the fuse body No contact information was provided by manufacturer or seller Had to calculate fuse rating Unit is very slow to make coffee Power plug does not fit well in 12V accessory recepticles Does not go deep enough into recepticle to hold itself in place has a tendency to pop out of the recepticle No return information provded Considering all the problems I would not buy another product from this manufacturer nor would I recommend it to anyone else Unit is overpriced 
1 0 Bad Company I m sure the mat would have been fine but they mixed up my order and this company does not refund shipping which was almost the price of the mat lame 
1 0 Great Looks Broken by 2nd Ride When I first got the bike I thought it was great By 2nd ride the chain broke while I was trying to do a simple down shift Unfortunately it also took out the shimano shifter mechanism which equates to big bucks in repair cost Looking at the metal used it is no wonder it didn t last Very poor quality Too bad because it is a great looking bike I guess I ll give Wal Mart a try next 
2 0 Good for a week Bought this for my son He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week Then the wheels broke He wasn t doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable 
2 0 a little disappointed I thought from the reviews this would be fairly sturdy rope it wasn t it was pretty limp For the price I suppose i got what I paid for 
1 0 Garbage complete garbage What this is is a cheap skateboard with a cheap metal bar stuck through it with some Dora stuff pasted on last minute Within the first day of using this the Dora sticky paper they put on the bottom of the skateboard where your child puts their feet was torn Within two days it was nearly completely destroyed I tried to fix this with elmer s glue but to no avail Now I have a plain scooter I ve seen this thing on sale for less than a ten spot it MIGHT be worth that price but not any more 
2 0 Don t buy cheap paddles Nothing against these particular paddles but avoid cheap paddles If you splurge on any item in your kayak budget it should be the paddles If you paddle you will develop a close relationship with your paddles it can either be a good one or a bad one You can markedly improve your paddling experience with a relatively small increase in spending Good paddles will make you want to use your kayak 
1 0 This Mat is Dreadful To say that this mat is very slippery is an understatement It is basically unuseable I wound up throwing it aside the first time I tried it out A complete waste of money 
2 0 Buy ASIN B0002VM8ZM instead cheaper w more features This piece is really quite over priced for what you get though not having the knife allows you to bring this on a plane with you I ve seen this unit marketed elsewhere as a travel friendly Swiss Army tool not knife Nevertheless the unit I have is the 64MB version of ASIN B0002VM8ZM which costs considerably less 30 on Amazon has the same 128MB USB drive and red light as the unit on this page plus you get a small quantity of Swiss Army tools INCLUDING a knife Unless you are concerned about going on a plane I d recommend the ASIN B0002VM8ZM over the unit on this page BTW I got my handy little 64MB unit which I d give four stars for if I had the option for only 9 99 on clearance at Target 
2 0 Was a bit mislead Maybe I should read the description better but I was disapointed to find out when receiving it that this is JUST a USB Key with a pen and anemic led light No swiss army stuff Not even a knife I thought all swiss army knives are supposed to have you know a knife That said the USB key is very tiny almost too small on its own detached from the swiss army non knife housing so it s good it has a home within the casing otherwise it would probably go missing 
1 0 worthless bike cover very heavy easily torn reinforcement non fucnctional doubt i can cover my bike 10 times before it is torn to shreds i would not reccomend it at all wasted my mone 
1 0 Great idea terrible execution I live in northern California so rain is nothing new to me I ve been putting off getting a large umbrella for quite some time now but since I signed up for free Amazon Prime I figure I d buy everything I ve been wanting for 30 straight days This umbrella made my list because I ve read some decent reviews on it plus it s affordable but I guess you get what you pay for The first umbrella came and the tip was split I ask for a replacement from Amazon which arrived next day nice service however I wish this umbrella is as good as Amazon s service because the replacement umbrella also arrived damaged Except this one is far worse the entire tip is missing Since this is the replacement Amazon will only do a refund By the way I m STILL without an umbrella 
1 0 valeo gloves did not do it for me I ve been looking for weight lifting gloves and trying out gloves that seemed to work for me but either bled onto my hands or ripped These gloves however dried out my hands and made me use lots of moisturizers They also tore down the knuckles on my left hand and in between the thumbs Weighlifting gloves are yes supposed to keep your hands dry during work outs and to prevent calases These gloves dried out my hands completely and gave me calases If you want a good pair of gloves do not get these 
1 0 This is NOT a Crock Pot type of product nor is it a Slow Cooker It may say Slow Cooker on the front of the item but I assure you it is anything but slow I was looking for a crock pot for camping using propane and was told this was the item for me So I made my Hungarian Ghoulash in it glad that the night meal would be done in 8 10 hours when we got back from the beach All I can say is thank goodness my husband noticed that it was bubbling inside of the cooker a half hour later or we wouldn t have had anything but charcoal left had we left the campsite that day without checking it It was cooking on low and it was literally done in a half hour s time So keep in mind if you are camping and you haven t tried using this product yet it won t take long before your meal is done Sadly my crock pot recipes were put away for the rest of that trip the campground we were at didn t have electricity hence why I wanted a propane crock pot 
2 0 it works but it puts out heat but not very well maybe if it was put under a blanket in an emergency it would suffice but by no means is it a replacment for your cars heating system 
1 0 Junk This is the second Nike watch I ordered The first one did not work and Isent it back to Amazon Amazon was great and sent me new one This one worked for a few days I then had the battery replaced Two weeks after it stopped working By that time I had thrown out the box etc and now it is sitting in the basket in my kitchen I have hopes to return it but it seems to much of a problem to explain I am am glad I have had this opportunity to vent In short the watch is awful 
1 0 Not a safe bike After ridding a only a couple of times this bike began to fall apart The brakes were faulty to begin with which were repaired soon after purchase While ridding on an easy trail the seat broke off half way through the ride With out a seat I had to walk the bike back to the car I advise extra caution for first time bikers and do a check to make sure all the components are working 
1 0 Very disappointed I have an original thighmaster I purchased years ago thinking this Thighmaster Gold was going to be similar I purchased it to take to work with me It is very flimsy it seems to be made of very light weight material that is not going to hold up My old thighmaster is very sturdy I have been using it for years and it looks fairly new This one will be ready for the trash can in less than a year Save your money 
1 0 If you re thinking about a thighmaster think again First of all I d like to say how much I loved my Thighmaster I got one four months ago from a Sportmart and it has been part of my daily routine ever since I have much better thigh muscles and a lot more confidence in myself because that little invention made of foam and an industrial strength coil With that said I have a slightly amusing and mildly alarming anecdote for you I was just beginning my strength training exercises and I had just done my second rep with the Thighmaster and all of the sudden I heard a loud pop and it fell to the ground IN TWO PIECES Now there are two things that immediately crossed my mind Wow man my thighs must made of STEEL and the other more likely scenario Wow man it fell apart after four months this must be an inferior product Anyway I e mailed SuzanneSommers com in hopes that it was a fluke and that I had gotten the one crumby thighmaster I asked them if it was possible to replace it and sadly although I only owned it four months I was told It may be time for a new thigh master as the product is not designed to last forever Last time I checked four months is NOT anywhere near forever A year six months maybe but when you divide the cost of a thighmaster by the amount of time I owned it the costs outweighs the benefits It is even less comforting that the company wasn t surprised or alarmed by their product s short lifespan It seemed that if four months is akin forever to the people at suzannesomers com then the product s usage expectancy is not much more than that It makes me unhappy to have ruined such a handy little device with normal wear and tear but I can t really afford to buy a new one every four months I just wanted to give everyone a heads up and let you know that although it is theoretically a great product the durability is highly dubious And the suzannesomers com who referred me to the manufacturer s warrantee only think that a thighmaster should work for three months maximum 
1 0 Poor Quality and zero service Does the unit work Well yes to a degree It takes 6 holes to lock on to the satellites and then does a fair job of giving distances The display is poor and though they say up to 40 objects per hole there is normally 2 4 objects per hole All this depends upon the Skycaddie course recorder The user you can not modify the course or add any objects that the course recorder didn t think was important Now the bad part The unit attaches via button and belt clip like a cell phone My button part that attaches to main unit has died twice in the first 30 days When it breaks again which it will often the unit will probally hit the dirt This isn t good But fear not It will be packed away weeks trying to get in touch with Skygolf And another week to get a replacement button which has been modified even weaker than the original one Now my replacement broke on the first time I clipped it to the belt Now back to Skycaddie to get another After being on hold for another hour they need to transfer you to another tech that handles parts This will take another hour You then get a message to leave a message Normally within a week someone will call you back By normally I mean about 35 of the time you leave messages they return them Would I buy another duh NO 
1 0 This Thing ks Do Not Buy I got this POS for Christmas because I was excited by the ad the concept and Natalie Gulbis It a neat idea and I love gadgets Upon removing it from the box it looks and feels cheap like a happy meal toy cell phone Cheap plastic and a poor LCD screen If that were it I could live with it but I can not get this thing to connect to the website to down load the necessary software I have been trying all day from different computers and still nothing I call the support number sit on hold for about fifteen minutes and then it just hangs up on you This is a fairly expensive toy You would think SkyGolf would spens a little less money on advertising and a little more on R D This thing is junk Stick with a Bushnell 1500 PinSeeker instead Traditional rangefinder but it works great Nothing to crash no support needed and IT WORKS I am sending this expensive piece of junk back first t hing tomorrow The sad thing is SkyGolf is destroying its image and reputation If they had put a little more effort into their development and actually had someone there to answer the phones this could have been a really nead golf tool that people wouldn t mind paying for The annual 20 membership fee is no problem if it works Right now I wouldn t pay 20 for the unit its self let alone the membership Don t waste your money on this well I was going to call it an expensive paper weight but it wouldn t even work for that it weighs about as much as a sheet of card stock 
1 0 Do not recommend this cycle The following were the problems 1 Bent fender poor packaging 2 Sratches in paint in several areas 3 Three nuts were missing 4 The front wheel hub had lateral play cannot be fixed Planning to return cycle if amazon accepts it 
2 0 J W The cardboard shipping container for this bike was broken through and open in several places which could have been the result of poor design of the packaging and or inept handling by the shipping company A fender was bent and some of the paint was scratched The front brake was difficult to adjust because there did not seem to be enough wire A required tool a 5mm allen wrench was not provided I have not attempted to adjust the gears because it seems too complicated however the bike seems to perform adequately as is 
1 0 Basically its a limited cheap piece of junk As the previous reviewer said I can see this being passable as a one player score keeper But don t make a mistake it s impossible to correct If it is possible I don t know how as there are no directions Using it for more than one player is tedious and not practical With the buttons the way they are its going to get bumped and errors made And you probably won t even know it Just a horrible design and a waste of money 
2 0 Easy to Use Overall the item works well If keeping track of one player it is just fine When trying to play two players it is hard to get from one player to the second player To play two players it has to go through all four players before getting back to the first player and then to keep strokes as they happen it is difficult to go back from player one and player two 
2 0 ok not great this unit is amazingly heavy given that it is mostly mesh The poles are not super high quality and I would imagine are going to break is used a lot I used this in some high winds and the zippers broke 
2 0 Not as advertised Advertised as having a coaster brake not Advertised as having a 6 speed not has a 5 speed If I would have known this I would have opted for something else 
1 0 Stay away from this I bought this for my mountain bike with large suspension forks I tried the instructions to find the proper placement of the sensor but that was useless as it just has a picture for this part No recommendations for proper location Then I found the only way the system would register a rotation is to have the magnet touch the sensor So now I have an annoying clicking and am wondering when it will actualy break from the constant contact Going to send it bac 
1 0 Cheap being the operative word To describe these as light and cheap is exactly right And neither is a compliment My Thera band handles started crumbling after only a few weeks of regular 3 or 4 times a week use The foam rubber on the handles is obviously cheap quality and started fraying at the edges After picking up several chunks of foam off the floor I learned that tying my own handles at the end of the Thera band stretch bands works better and is free These handles simply are not sturdy or well made enough to hold up for the use they are intended for Save your money 
2 0 Poor quality The foam rubber on my handles is shredding on the edges after only ONE MONTH Not worth the money 
1 0 Poor handle design My Mom wrecked badly on this the first time out due to the difficult to control steering Very awkward handle bars several of us tried to ride it My friend a fitness pro personal trainer put it best by saying That s the most uncomfortable bike I ve ever ridden Mom ended up giving it to a charity bike drive I hope somebody likes it 
2 0 Missing Parts and Customer Service If you decide to purchase this bicycle may I offer some advice If your bicycle arrives missing a part please immediately return it to the store where it was purchased My wife s bicycle arrived minus the front fender with bolt The folks at the Customer Service Department at Pacific Cycle were understanding and said that I would receive the missing parts with 10 business days After two weeks passed I called again this time the parts were on backorder Curious I asked why I wasn t told that two weeks earlier You have to dig down in our system was the answer I asked when I might receive the missing parts Could be two or three more months she replied When I suggested that two months was a long time she said something I didn t expect You know there s no reason that you can t ride the bicycle without the fender 
1 0 HORRIBLE SHIPPING I would like to tell you my opinion of the bike but I never even got to see it The company that amazon uses to ship the bike Eagle freight lost my bike even with a tracking number They refused to admit this after several rounds of calling and waiting on hold Even the supervisor never returned my phone call I explained the situation to amazon and they were very helpul and offered to send out a replacement immediately but unfortunately they would only send it by Eagle so I took the refund If you want to pay a small amount for a bike buy it here If you want to actually own a bike and ride it buy it somewhere else 
2 0 Bad smell I ve been using harbinger since mid 90 s and all of them share the same problem after a few months the begin to smell like wet rag a recurring odor after handwash machinewash sun exposure I am embarassed to use them This particular model is in its second year of use at first they seemed too bulky to completely clench your fist without some feeling of vascular obstruction an effect exacerbated by the rubber pieces that form the non slippery grip sometimes i prefered to use my basic pair without all that fancy stuff Now that some rubber has fallen they feel better As of now they are dismembering at the seams they still smell bad 3 4 working sessions a week lt 2 hours good care I am moving to another brand hopping they will behave better maybe GoFit or Valeo or Nike Try neoprene perhaps 
1 0 stick to it impossible to get off after a good work out just not for me 
1 0 Beware of Master Replicas I have had very bad experiences with this company in the past There is absolutely no support for any repair to their products whatsoever If there s a problem in the first 90 days you re fine After that you re up the creek and this is particularly true of any item with electronics in it As all their components are manufactured in Asia they have no way of repairing or replacing any component of your items should anything go wrong with them in time Be very careful with these people as you re likely to pay a lot of money for a very pretty non functioning bookend 
2 0 Looks Fun Bad Design We bought this boat 4 years ago when my oldest of three was a baby I totally agree with the others who have said that it is tippy and not safe We only used it a couple of times because he would just pitch forward or from side to side We used it when he was between 5 and 9 months old and able to sit up and still had this problem Maybe an older much more stable child could use it but it is advertised for use with infants and it s just not worth the trouble of trying to balance your baby in this thing 
1 0 be prepared to retrieve your baby from the water this boat seemed like a great idea and my 7 month baby does like it it gets him in the water which is fun but i cant even take my eyes off him for one nano second he has fallen over the sides he has fallen forward between the seat and tube the seat is so small and there is so much space between it and the tube my babys legs fit fine in the leg opening this boat is dangerous i am looking for a new one 
1 0 Seems extremely unsafe I bought this boat for my son when he was 8 months old He liked the boat well enough even played with it when it was sitting on dry land However in the water this boat is VERY tippy requiring two adult hands AT ALL TIMES Not good if you have more than one kid and NEED that extra hand I bought a much sturdier boat that still of course needs constant supervision but is great and can be used for more than one summer I wouldn t recommend anyone put their baby in this boat 
1 0 This baby float sucks Small holes unstable no space for the bum My daughter cried everytime we tried it We had a Pool School deluxe baby float before but we left it at the pool and it dissapeared She loved that one I could not find it in the store so I bought the Swim School and am regretting it Buy the Pool School 
2 0 Dangerous The handle bars keep loosening up which in turn makes it very dangerous Also the base metal footboard is cracking I wouldn t spend the money on this scooter It s not worth it Spend your money on a cheaper model Razor 
1 0 YES THIS IS A REALLY BAD REVIEW well first of all I ordered this product on Amazon and they sent me something completely different they sent me roller skates with the wheels side by side instead of the roller blades I ask for like in the picture Then when I sent an e mail trying to exchange the product no one returns my calls or e mails me back after so long of trying it s already past the 30 day exchange policy So yeah if you want a better review contact me so I can exchange the product 
1 0 no foam and bed exploded This bed was a real disappointment from the beginning We actually thought we had received the wrong bed because there certainly is nothing like memory foam on it It s just a fabric cover perhaps with an extra layer of material but it CAN T be foam Maybe only 1 4 thick at most Then after 4 months some of the inner cells must have separated because there was a 4 rise on both the top and bottom of a cell area and it felt like more were starting to detach internally BAD BED 
1 0 junk The product information states that this bed has 1 inch of memory foam they must round that number up to the closest inch because there was maybe 1 2 inch We didn t even bother to blow the thing up utter junk returned for something cheaper and better put together we hope if I could give this a negative star rating I would 
2 0 crap i paid bucks for tyhis gun got it and got it ready and figured out how it works and after using it a few time si relized its flaws first its too damn small its accurcy is not bad but its velocity is utter crap and doenst do squat in heavy battles and the clip is a reduiclus system of shaking the rounds form teh clips into the spring ssystem buy this for collections and maybe for soem fun but not a good gun and it jammed after the first month and i broke it trying to fix it 
1 0 The Thing That Does Not Work This is the most horrible product I have ever bought in my entire life so if you want a nice gun this is not it 
2 0 Not a good gun First of all it took like 2 weeks for then gun to get to me 2 weeks later the piston broke so its not a high quality airsoft gun But it looks cool and its worth the price 
2 0 Thick and cushiony but unsuitable for yoga practioners Both me and the mat slide all over the place It has no traction whatsoever and is absolutely not suitable for anyone who does yoga on a regular basis 
1 0 Defective Product and Poor Service There was a click in the crankshaft that was loud enough to be heard while riding and felt by the foot through the left pedal every 360 degrees of pedal rotation I purhased a crank puller tool for 21 44 incl tax a crank wrench for 18 18 incl tax and grease for 6 38 to repair this brand new bicycle Upon disassembly I found two 2 metal shavings each about 0 25 inches in size that appeared to be from drilling I have saved the two 2 metal shavings I removed the metal shavings cleaned and re greased and the clicking noise and vibration was fixed Since this was a brand new bicycle it would seem reasonable to reimburse me for the tools required to repair it The total cost not including and labor is 46 00 
2 0 Apex Roman Hyper Extension Bench Machine is well constructed but should have been made adjustable also no instructiuons were included and after having contacted the company to request instructions I have never heard from the 
1 0 disappointing The day we received the stroller we were very excited We put the stroller together which was very simple per instruction However when we took the stroller out of the entryway of our house the elbow of the stroller where the stroller folds caught the underarm of the babies skin and pinched it into the elbow Of course it tore the skin and the baby was screaming We have not used the stroller again and we are still trying to resolve this issue with the company I would not reccommend this double jogger to anyone at this time 
2 0 Keep on looking poor workout DVD I saw this ad on TV today and about to purchased from here at Amazon instead of zone pilates web site I kept reading reviews and one reviewer Evelyn from FL mentined that the ring would not stay on the body Actually I was thinking the same I was about to purchase and saw s h fees about 15 Also her Keep on looking and I did I found out Everlast for Her Pilates Fitness Ring with DVD here at amazon for only 14 99 ASIN B00091RYZY and Bally Fitness Ring for Pilates with DVD 17 99 ASIN B000H3YNR6 Both are very identical to this zone pilates and eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping on orders over 25 Sorry my review will not be helpful for the seller of this zone pilates but maybe for actual customers like me PS I have similar pilates rubber resistant ring and it doesn t stay put on the body especially near the hip It is good for toning my legs though I really want the butts from the models of Zone s commercial Maybe I can try with Everlast ring with half price Update 1 11 07 I received my Everlast ring yesterday The physical ring is very identical to this Zone ring but actual workouts are quite different I really like Zone s workouts from commercial you can also watch again from their website especially for buns thights I wish I can purchase just DVD from Zone with low s h Update 1 16 07 I d also purchased this Zone Pilates from Walmart 25+7 s h and received it yesterday It was a huge mistake The ring is very identical to Everlast not any better rather slightly heavier The accompanied DVD has only 2 workouts and they last only about 10 min and the second workout is slightly modified from the first one They were not as effective as Everlast s workout DVD which is more precise and has better menu The instructor from this Zone Pilates Kim Stoneman has flabby belly and sloping buttocks It seems like she is not using her own ring unless it s not effective as advertised and she proved that Very un motivating for me She stands in front of a still camera so we cannot see particular movements from different angle unlike Everlast you can see those Zone Pilates advertised with a different model with pretty body but you cannot see her in the workout DVD Don t waste your money to belive the commercial and purchase this Zone I ll return mine to Walmart ASAP 
1 0 misleading ad and name be forwarned that this is more for isolated toning legs arms shoulders hips rather than pilates workout does not strengthen the core muscles like pilates does and may weaken them The trainer on the dvd has flabby abs and thick torso rather than long lean muscles and core muscle strength that is usually found when doing pilates workouts i found the equipment bulky and awkward to use hard to hold my body in good alignment and almost impossible to do the exercises from my power center very disappointed in dvd training that accompanies the set and serious questions about whether this routine weakens the abs after my experience with it and seeing the condition of the abds of the trainer It is not up to the caliber of what I have come to expect from pilates also feel there is risk of injury related to difficulty of holding body in correct alignment as equipment kept slipping down or up Need to go back to the drawing board on this one there are better less expensive better made options out there with better training Keep on looking 
2 0 Not so happy I just got mine 3 days ago I can see that it might help toning the areas And the video is not annoying What is a problem is the WONDERFUL bruising on my legs where the device sits for the workout I didn t purchase this item for weight loss I thought it would help for toning But the bruises while they may go away with continued use are not worthe the I am sending mine back today Sorry 
1 0 Use for Batting Practice This product is not very good The speed registers at least 6 miles per hour faster than radar gun Getting the grip on the ball correct to make it even register a speed is difficult and frustrating Avoid this ball 
1 0 all talk no walk this is marys suns review it broke in 2 days first the full auto went then the shooting in general dont get i 
1 0 Don t waste your money I purchased this bike from a local dealer 15 months ago and it has broken down 3 times in the last 15 months The resistence motor is defective which is what I have had replaced 3 times now This motor does not allow you to change gears or bike through a program upgrading to shifiting on the fly technology would be a plus The positive aspect of the bike is the comfort and grip heart rate monitor and the ability to swap out saddles also a plus Ovewrall I cannot recommend this product 
1 0 This gun never worked This gun didn t work from the moment my son took it out of the box The return shipment and restocking fee would have cost nearly the purchase price so I didn t bother It went straight to the trash can 
1 0 Terrible Quality This gun broke in the first few used When I called for service they inisted on waiting for the tech and then the return was going to cost almost what the gun cost Overall this was a writeoff 
1 0 Don t bother unless you re looking for a plinker Okay here s the bottom line If you re just getting into airsoft this could be an okay gun for backyard can shooting or whatnot But if you re actually looking to get into the sport competitively look for a Classic Army or Tokyo Marui AUG It will be more expensive but it will be quality The number one rule of the airsoft world is You get what you pay for This is a cheap gun and it s going to perform like a cheap gun If you re looking for a decent cheap gun let me recommend the UTG Warhawk UTG MP5 or some of the CYMA MP5 line 
1 0 HORRIBLE The gun broke about 7 days after my son received it and the people WOULD NOT take it back said he d had it too long I will never buy this product nor work with this seller again HORRIBLE 
1 0 if you care about your bikes don t buy this Graber should be ashamed of themselves for this product This rack will scrape the paint right off your bike the arms of the rack that fold closed pop out of place with a bike on the rack sliding your bike around the rack itself does not stay in place despite trying bungee cords ratchet tie downs etc This was a complete and total waste of money AND damaged my bike On top of all that it is NOT an inexpensive rack Save yourself aggravation and choose a different rack 
1 0 Don t like it at all I got this Heart rate monitor and the strap was way too small so I had to order a replacement strap when I went to change the strap the battery was dead the battery lasted only 1 week so I had to buy 2 new batteries one for the watch and one for the chest strap and now there is a line of pixels out on the screen of the watch I am going to get a forerunner those seem allot better I was very disappointed with this my Suunto dive computer is great this HRM sucks 
2 0 scrrratched had to switch bands standard band had patent leather look to it scratched from day one i can t understand why a 150 sport watch would not come with a mineral crystal face i ve had 50 nike watches that were scratch proof after changing the band the watch is pretty functional and cool looking but still can not replace the convenience or functionality of a mounted computer for biking 
1 0 Its a piece of Face is made of cheap plastic it scratched within an hour of putting it on Watch had about 20 scratches and dimples after 2 weeks I ve been wearing a cheap Casio for the last two years that hardly has a scratch on it Other problems include the buttons press very easily making the watch change functions constantly for example when I put my hand in my pocket or put on a coat also the functionality of the watch is not very intuitive with five buttons it should be much easier to move through the different functions of the watch Finally the watch is very well photographed in the ad and doesn t look any nicer than my cheap casio in reality 
1 0 DON T WASTE YOUR Brutal horrible instructions No pictures No clear concise steps to follow It took 2 people to set up and just as previous reviewers mentioned nothing fits properly It s very flimsy and unsteady I was extremely frustrated and dissapointed in this product so I returned it Don t waste your time and money Spend a little more and get a better product 
2 0 Not extremely portable Positive Size good surface area Chipping net Negatives Poor instructions Very hard to set up by yourself Really takes 2 people because nothing fits tight so as you try to get one side in the other side pops out Nothing locks in Plastic caps to hold rear poles don t fit tightly The male sticks that go into the female section of the rear poles are not tight so a wind from the rear pushes it over I have had to make some modifications to this item to make it usable I taped some eyelets to the bottom of the rear poles and attached to ring with caribiners I ve had to tape the caps onto the top of the rear poles and add some tape to the ends of the front pole to make it snug 
2 0 screen tent I purchased this screen arbor for protective coverage outside but the material portion is hard to fit over the piping to tie it down Next the piping that holds the form is not at all sturdy the first time the wind picked up it blew the whole thing apart So for a one time use it is okay The money spent on this was a waste It also looked in places like it had already been repaired seconds as in 2nd class merchandise 
1 0 Don t waste your money In less than 3 months the seals didn t work because the velcrow came apart Everything inside gets wet Poor product 
1 0 Web description is the wrong size I never got to use the product Upon opening I realized the sizing details on Amazon s website was different than the one on the box I am 5 5 and the 65cm was too big for me although Amazon states it s just my size 
1 0 Not for people with arthritis or joint pain Ouch The reason I gave it one star is because of how it affected my body I am an athletic person and very agile but this is one of the workouts that I will never do again I have arthritis and that causes major joint pain and this workout focused all the pain unto my joints in my knees and I was in tears I had to stop this workout about 5 minutes into it My knees were hurting for almost 3 days after and I could hardly walk I m sure if you are in perfect health this might work for you but if you have any type of arthritis or any joint pain please stay away from the ball workout 
2 0 Not accurate I agree with the previous reviews that say Hydrocoach is not accurate Instructions say to take deliberate sucks Even with that not all ounces register It might only register 12 16 ounces after filling the 22 ounce bottle I like gadgets but this 30 water bottle is not worth it It would have been better if you fill up the bottle and press a button when you drink all the water in it adding 22 ouonces each time 
1 0 Good idea bad execution I agree with the other reviewers that the idea for this product was going in the right direction but took a bad turn somewhere I get lightheaded trying to suck hard enough on the straw for it to register and even when it does it is consistently 8 to 10 ounces off the mark of what I ve actually consumed And if you re really thirsty forget it you ll pass out before ever getting enough fluid to quench your thirst At 30 it s a hefty price to pay when it s much simpler to just refill a 20 ounce plastic bottle 3 times a day Sorry to say I ll be returning my HydraCoach 
1 0 lousy product I was extremely disappointed in this item I think it is a good concept but it doesn t work well at all it says on the back that you have to take big sips for it to register that you are really drinking it I tried to really take big sips and it would barely register that I drank anything it is awkward to drink from too I can not believe this thing was really tested out by people before it went on the market not worth buying just buy a regular water bottle for a fraction of the cost and save yourself the aggravation 
1 0 Wayfinder V2020 We found the system very hard to read At night we couldn t see it at all to read it Our family bought us the better model for Xmas so we are going to put this one on ebay Would not recommend it 
1 0 Ft Myers Fl I bought this compass at a Good price thats about all I can say good for this product The backlight is too dim plus the compass will not hold an accurate reading I have to keep resetting it I cannot reccommend product 
1 0 Wayfinder V2020 Review The first unit was installed as directed and when it was working it was fine The problem was it would just stop working and this was most of the time I exchaned several e mails with customer service rep Pat She was extremely nice and suggested I send it back for a replacement The second unit was installed as directed and worked flawlessly for a couple of months It now works a bit better than the first one Instead of stops working most of the time this one stops working some of the time I have decided to keep this one because of the bother and expense of shipping it back for a replacement And who knows the next unit may not work at all Not a good product for Amazon to be selling R Lockwoo 
2 0 It was a nice idea The attachment isn t textured enough to stay where I put it As I ride the entire assembly slowly spins around the handle under my hand 
2 0 You REALLY get what you pay for with bikes I am not a big spender but unlike a lot of things the more money you spend the better bike you get I really didn t want to spend a lot for a bike for a 5 year old and I wish I would have gone with my first instinct and bought one from a bike shop I m so frugal that I couldn t stand the idea of paying 140 for a bike for a kid so I got this one instead which was actually more expensive when I bought it This is a mediocre bike at best MAYBE one step above a big box store bike just maybe I wanted a simple bike that would last while but I will be surprised if this one makes it one summer Paint chips easily and the white bike seat is clean for only the first few minutes out of the box The components seem cheap and the frame does not seem very solid The difference between this one and a good expensive bike is huge I had a bike shop put it together and I added a basket so the difference between what I paid for this and what I would have paid for a good bike was about 30 I m kicking myself now 
1 0 Business as usual You ve got a lot of ab rollers You need a gimmick The product is no better than the competition You don t have an ad budget What do you do CHARGE FOUR TIMES AS MUCH Then just sit and wait for the clients who are looking for a quality product to assume that the high price actually means something 
1 0 Uncomfortable for child and adult I bought mine at the same Toys R Us Sale and had the exact same issue Both my husband and I own Trek bikes and it wouldn t work his bike at all It fit on mine only to find out that my heels would hit the footrest of the carrier I woulud only recommend buying if you have the patience to install it on your bike only to find out that it won t work comfortably while you re riding Not to mention that my two year old is very tall and he didn t look comfortable in it anyway The free helmet is way too small for his head We ve returned it and have yet to purchase a different one yet I think we re going to a bike shop 
1 0 Biggest piece of crap on the planet I bought this seat for 40 on sale at toys r us since it stated it would fit most bikes I followed the directions that came with the seat and that made it impossible to install on both bikes that I tried it on After several choice words and approximately 2 1 2 hours later per bike 5 hours total I finally had this piece of crap installed only to find out that both my and my wife s heels grinded against the footrests of the seat DO NOT buy this piece of crap it is not worth any amount of money as far as i m concerne 
1 0 Believe the bad reviews I was desperate for a fast way to get my youngest child to the park when my older children ride their bicycles Unfortunately the only thing in stock anywhere was this seat And it took me all morning to get it put together The holes for the straps to go into were so small I had to widen them with a screwdriver and shove them through the holes with the screwdriver as well The screws to attach the seat to the seat post of my bike were too short and the washers needed to be pried together Finally I was nearing the final steps when lo and behold I was missing a piece I call customer support which is at Bell not Fisher Price or Mattel I was on hold for 20 minutes before I was able to speak to anyone Then when I spoke to the representative she put me on hold to speak to her supervisor for another 15 minutes This happened twice Their solution to my missing piece Use a zip tie We don t ship that piece separately Excuse me You make a mistake you fix it Regardless of whether or not the piece is shipped separately Ridiculous And at the end of the conversation there was no apology offered no attempt to make the situation right Ugh So now I have nothing to show for my morning of effort Also I attempted to adjust the strap on the seat to see how it would fit my daughter I sat her in the seat and she BARELY fits She is two years old barely weighs 23 pounds and is tiny I have no idea how a child any bigger than her would even fit in the seat I had hoped to use this seat for family rides for the nextfew years That would NOT happen with this seat So it is going back to the store and I am buying a Kettler Flipper or a Bobike Maxi or a Topeak I will steer clear of Bell products in the future Oh and to top it all off the helmet provided with the seat has the plastic cover peeling off without me even removing it from the packaging Worthless Save your time and your money avoid this seat at all costs 
1 0 3 to 7 your kidding aren t you I found the size range to be completely missleading My child was just shy of 5 and weighs 42lbs She is 42 inches tall and found herself to big for this seat Her legs were right up against my seat and was very uncomfortable The bottom line if she is this uncomfortable at her age what would a 7 year old be 
1 0 Nightmare We bought this for our 2 year old daughter It was a nightmare to put together then it did not fit Becareful when installing in larger mountain bikes We bought a 20inch frame men s mountain mike and it was 3 inches too short of fitting Not worth it 
2 0 Don t be fooled by the low price If you search for the keyword Illuminator LED Flashlight you ll find that this same item is offered from varies sources at wildly different prices So naturally you should just go for the lowest price right Not so fast I already bought one Illuminator flashlight elsewhere see my Customer Images above and was going to order a few more as gifts The lowest price I found here is from IGgFactory Handhelditems at 7 95 But during checkout I found out that their standard shipping and handling fee is 8 21 for just one item The flashlight itself weights only 7 oz but the company charges 4 lb for shipping weight What a rip off With such inflated shipping cost you may be better off buying this item from local drug stores such as Walgreen for 15 At least there you can return the item easily if you re not happy with it Update on Jan 21 2007 Please check out my review for the Garrity Power Lite where I have made a comparison betweeen it and the Illuminator It is my opinion that the Garrity is a better flashlight 
1 0 An absolute dud I wasted my money so save yours In my opinion this thing is flimsy and worthless I set it up in the doorway and it is so poorly designed that it just doesn t hold Once you bring the bar crashing into your forehead on your first or second chin up you realize that you ve already thrown away your money and now it s time to throw away this product I ABSOLUTELY agree with the reviewer who cautions against making this product available to kids without close supervision 
2 0 Questionable mounting configuration Took it out of the box took 5 minutes to set it up and propmtly ripped one of the flimsy mounting brackets off of the wall during its first use I definitely would not let children use this item without supervision The bar itself is of good quality But the brackets have to go 
1 0 Don t lose your receipt I ve had my Suunto Advizor for 16 months I am now in Iraq and the bezel is broken off like the other reviewer I dont have my receipt You can go to the Suunto website but one thing you won t find there is an address with a note that says send your broken expensive plastic watch here and we will fix it My G shock by comparison lasted longer than I wanted it to and cost one quarter of what the Suunto cost So I give the Suunto one star for being adventure cool for a while A lot of other Infantrymen own these so I jumped on the bandwagon I wish I had stuck with a regular watch and a GPS with lensatic compass backup 
2 0 flimsy It hasn t broken yet but it is going to eventually I m 5 10 180lbs and these things barely support me and don t provide a stable grip These would be fine for a smaller woman but thats really it the PVC construction isn t adequate I thoguht they were metal when i bought htem but was obviously mistaken 
1 0 Absolute Garbage This is the first review that i have done on amazon So far i have purchased over a dozen items on Amazon and by and large i have been content happy with all of them except this product This product is made of a cheap hard plastic and the assembly socket for one of the bars actually cracked when it was assembled DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT Shell out about five bucks more for all metal push up bars 
2 0 Not a true work stand I held high hopes for the product being that I live in a little apartment in NYC I was looking forward to saving space The tune up stand is little portable however it was not too sturdy The bike while on the stand will not withstand much torque at all The bike fell over many times before I gave up and purchased another bigger more sturdy stand Forget about turning the crank the slightest movement of the crank creates too much torque for the little stand and the bike falls over This stand would be good for LIGHT work possibly a light tuning of the brakes or a wipe down with a rag Any pressure whatsoever would necessitate a bracing hand on the frame of the bike Overall a 2 5 because it may be okay for a little person s bike or a bmx I used it on a men s road bike size 57 
1 0 Bad design You cannot sit upright in this chair Bad for soccer games why we bought it The chair is designed to lean back THe company is not Amazon and would not take back without more postage charges than the chair is worth Unless you plan to sleep in this chair it stinks 
1 0 No weekend support for this consumer product If this were an office shredder Mon Fri support would be OK but hey I have a day job and so I d like Bowflex to be responsive at my convenience Not so 
1 0 This gun exploded I got one of these because it was only a penny I used it several times with only a slight crack that I later cemented Later I used it again and while cocking it back the whole top piece just splintered into many pieces The gun is fun for about the first few tries then it s prone to jamming up Even though it was only a penny it was 4 99 shipping I m better off getting one for about a dollar at a flea market I m not very satisfied but I m not spending 40 cents to get my 1 penny back 
2 0 Expert review This gun is a VERY BAD GUN If you are from the ages of 6 10 i would get it but if not dont I got 2 of these the first 1 broke rit away and the other only shoots 15 feet trust me this gun is a piece of junk Just poket to shipping and buy something else 
1 0 Scuttle this Trike Anything coming out of a box at Christmastime is exciting to our toddler Most toys though hold an excitement for him This trike lost his interest after one try Scuttle the trike I say or let it become unmoved furniture in your home 
1 0 I wish it were adjustable I just saw this toy in Parents Magazine Sunday night and was so excited to see it on sale at Target this week I ran to get it since my son is too short to use his hand me down red tricycle It looked like lots of fun in the picture however my son is too big for it I don t know why it states that it is suitable for up to 3 years old no way If it were adjustable I m sure he would have loved it but just like another reviewer stated it s just like the other ride on toys we already own Currently the Scuttle Bug is in the trunk ready to be returned to the store How disappointing 
1 0 Airsplat Service Stinks avoid them I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son s airoft rifle as a Christmas gift The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat a shortened M 4 airsoft rifle s weaver rail Yes I could go out and find screws the proper length but I though I d make Airsplat do their job So after several e mails with the service department they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size Wrong The diameter of the new screws is so big they won t fit through the mounting bracket on the sight Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws Why by a gun from these guys If it arrives broken you pay to ship it back Want a refund You pay a 15 restocking fee Take a pass on Airsplat 
1 0 VERY POOR SERVICE I ordered this sleeping bag on 12 07 06 I chose standard shipping which is 3 to 5 days This was more then enough time I needed to have the sleeping bag arrive before Christmas Here it is 01 10 07 and still the sleeping bag has not arrived My account says it was shipped on 12 11 06 When I track the item it says expected delivery date is 01 31 07 Nothing was EVER stated when I placed the order that the delivery date would be 01 31 07 Only 3 5 days This is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard I had other items placed with this order that I have received off and on out of the blue before and after Christmas There are 3 all together that I NEVER received at ALL from TARGET I counted on these items for Christmas and I am very disappointed with AMAZON and TARGET I have done alot of business with Amazon and in the future I will NEVER NEVER give any of my business to AMAZON if the order is connecrted to TARGET in any way TARGET AMAZON deserve 0 stars for terrible service and false advertisement 
2 0 Bolt broke The bottom bolt broke a week after purchase which prevents the unit from functioning as designed it cannot swing out of the way 
1 0 STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS THING Ive never done a review before because I have never been so disgusted with a product Ive had mine a few weeks Used it twice a week which equals roughly 10 uses so far Well just now the little knob that gets screwed in to hoold the arm in place to prevent it from swinging BROKE cracked right in half as I was turning it with my fingers I didnt even put any weight into it Last week the nut that holds the eye hook and entire weight of the heavy bag fell off sending my bag crashing to the ground I dont know why they wouldnt put something more permanent up there instead of a 2 cent nut The design is terrible Rather than have the supports and screw holes run the length of the wall studs they have then run so you mount two in the studs two in the drywall unless of course you do the wood mount like another user suggested which is what I did TKO just lost me I will NEVER buy ANYTHING from them again Seventy dollars for this CHinese made garbage Im sure the welds will be the next thing to go Buyer bewar 
1 0 don t purchase This is a nice bag with a fatal flaw The major zippers break very easily After my first bag broke within a few months Amazon kindly provided a free replacement Deja vu ensued For a few extra dollars Delta could use more robust zippers they really should 
1 0 avoid this product This machine literally broke within the first 15 minutes after it had been assembled I couldn t believe it My advice would be to avoid this product 
2 0 Cover is too small I realize the price being so low that I would not receive a top of the line bike cover which is fine I did expect to receive a cover which would fit my brand new average size mountain bike it does not since it does not fit over both tires the plastic snaps that cinch it tight do not come together to make a complete unit I have to use clothes pins in certain areas to seal the cover in enough area to make the cover at least somewhat useable My tires and rims are left exposed to the elements and thus are getting mud and moisture on them when it rains Even the picture to the right of this review shows the cover with ample room all over the bike very misleading Very disappointed 
1 0 Defective Item and Poor Customer Service This waterproof fanny pack is not waterproof We tried it on two separate occasions both times fully closing each seal but water leaked through anyway soaking the contents When I tried to return the item the seller refused to accept it claiming that its own tests showed it was working properly Despite what the company now says the fact is that the item was defective I see from the other reviews that this is not an isolated problem and the fact that the merchant refuses to honor its return policy means that customers should be very wary of doing business with this company 
1 0 Waterproof We bought two fannypacks one for ourself and one for our friends who were going with us on our trip We were doing some shallow water snorkeling no diving My husband wore our fanny pack which contained his wallet and our passports Our stuff got soaked Why our friends worked we and ours didn t is anybody s guess possibly ours had a defective seal These fanny packs have a seal just like a food storage bag and I know some of them don t seal right 
2 0 Don t bother My daughter got these at 6 years old and she loves them She learned how to move about on them although a year later she s still quite wobbly The shoes still look pretty new after a lot of use My problem is that there really is no way for her to stop No knob brake like normal skates have so most of the time she s pretty out of control or walking like Frankenstein Also the button to pop the wheels in and out is very difficult for her to push on her own so we have to dot it for her It wasn t like that when I first bought it though We bought her normal skates for Christmas to replace these 
1 0 HORRIBLY BAD This gun is horrible I bought this for my friend and let me tell you it was a waste of First off it is a 3 4 scale gun so it is very small and very light if you were to drop it it would deffinitly shatter Also the cocking system is terrible on the top there is a lever you have to pull and if pulled in the wrong spot it will snap off and then it would be useless When we did end up shooting it the bbs wentd straight for about 5 or 10 ft then curve down so unless you are going get within five ft of a person it is useless even if you do get that close he wont even jump the fps is more like 270 not 370 Also the clip is an absolute pain to load first you pour all the bbs into a chamber then you pull down a spring and shake it upsidedown fot the bbs to gome onto the front chambet then you have to release the spring and put the clip in the gun After about 10 15 shots you have to take the clip out and repeat the process Granted it holds 180 or so bbs you can only shoot about 15 at a time Over all this gun STINKS I bought it when it was originaly 100 00 but the list price was 10 00 so I thought it was going to be decent but i was wrong SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE 
2 0 Great use for five minutes Great use for five minutes then one broke Having use Kendo Shinai bamboo swords before I would not suggest these and only bought them as I had a 25 dollar gift certificate to get rid of 
2 0 Great look Nice frame Dissapointing ride I wanted a bike to ride around on unpaved trails on my few acres in the country This retro designed one speed steel framed coaster braked comfort bike seemed to be the ideal choice When it arrived I pulled out the tool box and set to work assembling it The first frustration was that the instructions for assembling this bike are NOT included in the manual which seems to cover every bike but this one How hard could it be to write up instructions with tool specifications for EACH model they manufacture A one page flyer could have done the trick To further complicate matters some of the models in the manual are assembled using metric tools and others call for standard sizes It turned out that I couldn t complete the assembly because I couldn t find a tool to handle the quick release hardware for the seat attachment I had to take the bike to a bike shop to complete the assembly Even the bike shop had problems with this bike because there is so little clearance between the fenders and the tires I watched while they had to bend the sides of the back fender out by hand so that it wouldn t rub the tire When I got the bike home the first thing that I did was to adjust the seat to the correct height and take it out for a ride Within 10 seconds the seat slipped all the way down The quick release handle can t hold the seat in place with the weight of a rider on it I m not that heavy Chrysler should have taken the retro design a step farther on this and drilled holes in the seat stem for a rod insert to adjust the seat height Rather than try to dis assemble this and box it up to return it I will check to see if I can drill the seat stem myself to get the seat secured at a ridable height Its too bad they couldn t come up with a workable design for such an essential part of the bike as the seat height adjustment The points I do give here are for the otherwise sturdy frame and tires that will work well for unpaved trails when I can finally ride this 
1 0 have not tried it READ MY REVIEW I saw another mini microphone it got one star the review was telling me it was horable If i were you I would get the maga phone one the top of the list type in maga phone in the search and you will find the list DO NOT GET THIS 
1 0 Bad product don t even think about buying This thing simply does not work I bought this prodcut for my mountain bike and I cannot even believe someone manufactures a false stuff like this It cannot even hold the weight of my bike and bends out to side and eventually my bike falls I tried to adjust the distance between the two archs to fit the tire width to see if I get better result but no luck 
2 0 not worth the money may be okay if you take it to a climate controlled office but not much good as an outdoors job food jar 
2 0 Its ok to look at I just got the sword and I liked it but I thought that it was a little small Then the sword broke from its hilt on the third day that i had it Now you might think that I was doing careless things to it but i just swung it a few times slowly in the air and i realized that the sword wan t on there very good After that I was just swinging it slowly around the house and it just fell off So don t buy the sword if you going to do ANYTHING but look at it 
2 0 Nice idea poorly made I bought this gloves so I wouldn t have to wrap my hands to protect my wrists everytime I went for a bag workout One reviewer is clearly confused They said that there was a metal bar in the glove to prevent fatigue in your hand Turns out there is no metal bar in it but instead it was plastic or something similar Then when using these gloves on my 100 pound punching bag I wound up with blood blisters all over my knuckles This has never happened to me before and I have been working out with punching bags for over 15 years Yeah sure you might get some skin torn off from your hands rubbing on the inside of the leather everlast gloves the first couple weeks you use them but blood blisters on your knuckles after your knuckles are use to those kinds of blows for years Another thing I noticed about these gloves is they wear out fast if you constantly use them on punching bags They get to the point to where you feel like there is no padding in them Gave these gloves 2 stars since I liked the idea of being able to wrap these gloves on and go to work But they need to be greatly improved upon 
1 0 Worse product I have ever purchased I rarely get taken but I did this time One song played 50 times No instructions Pad not in tune with TV movements This is going to a garage sale or charity 
1 0 Worst DDR Game Ever I used to have DDR for Xbox and when my Xbox broke on me I decided not to spend the money on a new one However I missed my DDR workouts everyday so I bought this as a replacement I should have spent the money on a new Xbox This product is not worthy of having the name DDR on the box Imagine a dance pad game for Atari Then imagine it is the worst possible Atari game you have ever seen and that would be a close description of this game There are 50 computer generated beeping monphonic sounds that irritate more than energize you The rythem and the timing is off on all the songs and the dance pad is very poor quality It wasn t even worth the cost of the shipping to have it delivered to my home I wish I had sent it back without opening it Now I m stuck with a game that even the pawn shop will not take 
1 0 Total Scam This thing is being advertised as Dance Dance Revolution It is NOT DDR It is just a cheap knock off not worth a penny My daughter plays a DDR at afterschool and loves it She received this for Christmas tried it once and gave up within five minutes She said it says fifty songs but it plays just one Well the 50 songs all sound the same They are not radio or stereo quality rather just computer generated noise Totally awful Having tried it myself I am very disappointed and don t blame my daughter for not giving it a second glance Total waste of money and total false advertising This company should be investigated Believe the poor reviews and skip this product 
1 0 NOT Real Dance Dance Revolution Game i bought this for my niece thinking it would be a plug and play version of the video game this has nothing to do with the real Dance Dance Revolution game other than being a cheaply made imitation and using their name which is not on the actual product very disappointed 
2 0 Not the real DDR My husband bought me this for Christmas and we were both disappointed The graphics are awful some give me a headache The songs are awful they all sound alike Its the kind of thing you can do on a cheap keyboard The pad loses any sort of sensitivity very quickly I ve had it two weeks and already I m hitting the arrows but its registering a miss I gave it two stars because my kids ages 6 and 2 love it but then again they don t know any better I am using it to get better at DDR but then I will invest in a better pad and game 
2 0 Dance Dance Revolution Plug N Play Before buying DDR I read everyone s reviews and thought that after all of the bad reviews I might still like it This product really fools you this is why If you ve seen regular DDR you know what the pad looks like well the dance pad and the box looks normal untill you turn it on It says 50 Songs right Well it s not really 50 different songs About 20 25 of these songs are a trick they combine 2 songs and make it into one track The graphics are horrible a screen looks like pieces of moving clip art stationed around the middle of the screen where the arrows are I wouldn t reccommend buying this at all 
1 0 overall design and looks are good but not efficient the pipe is too wide to let the two plactic disks run smoothly I could barely assemble it together because it would not fit maybe they sent me wrong disks I do not know but i am very dissapointed with this purchase it does not work as well as i expected also gofit web page does not have the exact description of the item as it is indicated on the box that they send it packed it waste of money i would better buy it at the store and try it how it works 
2 0 not so great this mat gets very slippery and makes even simple moves frustrating i would recommend a different mat cheer 
1 0 Not Satisfied I just got the mat and went to unroll it but it is stuck together expecially where the paisley patterns are so that when I unrolled it chinks of the mat came off Very poor quality and I m unsaitsfied I would not recommend getting this mat 
1 0 A DISASTER You can t play with this cards all are marked and cuted don t buy this cards 
1 0 Marked decks Only about one third of the decks do not have ink makings on the backs wich makes them completely unusable 
1 0 Finders keepers for now I just found one of these while climbing the stairs down at the track today I brought it home and looked on the net for some info about it and found these reviews When I read that people are losing this thing all the time I could believe it LOL I ll enjoy it until it falls off and somebody else will inherit it 
2 0 Having problems I am not very happy with my new pedometer It falls off all the time the face plate comes off and I have a very hard time making it stay back on The spring has now broke from the clip so the pedometer won t even clip to my pants anymore I have to carry it in my pocket and it is too big for that I am disappointed with this purchase 
1 0 bad product I bought 2 one fell off my belt and i lost it the other does not work at all it works even if if i shake it and the insides hit the cover from inside maybe its broke already i dont recommend anyone to buy it just walk rather than buy such gizmos that is the pilosophy i learnt from this episode 
1 0 Reviews were good until I bought it I bought this pedometer when the ratings for it were 5 stars Now there are all kinds of bad reviews starting in 2007 Too bad I bought it in December This is a piece of junk I thought I was ordering a mid priced pedometer It was 12 at that time I agree about it not staying on and even though I followed the calibration instructions the steps were never accurate I had an additional problem in that parts of the numbers were missing on the LCD most of the time So is a backwards three actually an eight was that a one or a seven is that 5000 or 6000 I never knew The only time all the lines displayed making perfect numbers was when you cleared it to 0000 I ll probably try a cheapy from Walmart It will probably do better than this 
1 0 Doesn t stay on not accurate This pedometer is easy to use and pretty decent looking Those are the only good things I can say about it It simply does not stay on I too have had to use a safety pin to make sure I don t lose it Maybe I have a defective device but this is anything but accurate I consistently walk a measured 5 mile route every day One day the steps will be 5800 the next day 12800 the next day 10300 Which is accurate Are any of them I can t rely on it When testing the device for accuracy in walking 50 steps it never got it right Most of the time it was over the 50 steps 2 times it was way under the 50 steps I would not recommend this one 
1 0 Lasted less than a month This is a piece of junk Spring broke constantly resets itself and after less than a month it completely gave out Don t waste your money 
2 0 thought it would be better than it is I am on something like my 5th pedometer and until recently I didn t want to invest a lot in one I bought this because I thought it looked cool and was a great price It fell off constantly For a few days I would pin it to my pants but that was time comsuming and annoying not to mention painful when the pin stuck me It is fairly accurate but who cares if you are always worried about it popping off and falling to the floor I finally invested in an Omron that not only stays on but has a security latch you can attach to your clothing in case it does come off it will not fall to the ground I also bought it on Amazon but it was around 18 99 It stores a week s worth of steps for you so you can track your progress I am in love with my new pedometer I wish I would have invested in this one first 
1 0 Consider the development stage of the kid I received this toy as a gift for my 1 year old son It was one of the most frustrating toys he s had The handle requires too much strenght to press down so he was not able to operate it alone He could press it down only when standing up using his body weight but the size of the spinner made it very inconvinient to play this way he had to lean and crouch The noise that the balls make is rather loud in my consideration and can irritate the adults after a while too Because my son was already walking this static toy got very little attention The positive features it is made of sturdy plastic and the colors are nice and bright 
2 0 okay The bike came in a timely fashion however it seemed to be damaged during delivery I returned the item for a refund 
2 0 Doesn t offer very much protection These gloves are well made leather gloves with an iron bar for good grip but they re very light and offer no support for the wrist or hand In addition the padding is very thin I wouldn t recomend them for heavy bag or working with a trainer They re probably fine for the speed bag If you re going to use these gloves at the very least also get yourself a pair of hand wraps or like me you ll probably loose some skin from your knuckles For not very much more money you can get gloves that offer significantly more protection 
1 0 Product not as described I was extremely disappointed when I received this product Contrary to the description the handles are hard plastic not comfortable and soft as it states on the product packaging and website Other than that it may be a decent product but after only a few reps your hands will hurt and will have the design from the grips imprinted on your skin I ve already printed the label to return to Amazon Beware the other review of this product the individual posted the same review for all ab wheels sold on Amazon Not only is it not informative there is a good chance they have never tried the product 
1 0 these suck bad these really suck i shot my lil brother in the head point blank it didnt hurt i was holding him as a hostage beacuase we play that way his teamate stuck a m16 macine gun to my head I told him to back off or ill shoot I shot and the damn bb did not come out I got a big welt on my head for 5 days and got in big troble beacuse i was trying to shot the brat 
1 0 Terrible guns These guns r the worst one of them broke when i dropped it and the other just broke and i dont no y they r also very weak and the accuracy is terrible They might be ok if you are new at air soft and dont wanna use em 4 wars of anything thow 
1 0 These are very poor quality I purchased these as a replacement for some Joe Weider shorts I have had for many years that have started to wear out I bought 3 pair of these shorts worn 2 of them 1 time each washed them and they both came apart near the seam The seams themselves did not come apart but the actual fabric itself split in two like a run in panty hose The third pair is still in the box and I have not worn it but I figure that the same thing will happen with it as well Also one of the pair had one leg about an inch longer then the other leg The one leg also fit tighter and you could tell the cut was wrong Like I said very poor craftsmanship and materials 
2 0 Delivery time is horrible The turnaround to receive the product is horrible Product was ordered before Christmas and wasn t received until end of January 
2 0 Misleading item not advertised clearly When I received the shipment I was disappointed as all three kickboards were different sizes when I placed the order no where it tells that different colors kickboards are different sizes Otherwise I would have ordered kickboards in Blue color The yellow and Purple kickboards are too small for me and my wife 
1 0 Not stackable I was going to give this product a 3 because the trays acutally quite nice Just as the previous reviewer I love handing out chips in them However I re read the name of the product and I had to change my vote to a 1 These chip trays are not stackable which is really frustrating not only during game play but afterward when I m trying to store them 
2 0 Not free of latex allergens I bought this band in two strengths It is advertised as 99 998 free of soluble proteins and latex allergens and powder free and it is neither I used them and got a skin reaction to latex which I would not have if it was only 02 latex Customer service was helpful when I called 
1 0 Ninety dollars for this is unreasonable Ninety dollars for this is unbelievable For less than 15 that is less than one sixth the advertised price someone with NO skill could make an equivalent product from pine 4x4s and 1x12s in 30 minutes or less It may not be cool but it ll get the job done Are you more interested in getting fit or having cool trendy and frivolous toys Avoid this plastic albatross It will be destined for a garage sale near you within two years Go to your local hardware store spend half an hour and 20 and maybe learn how to work with your hands a bit and get what you need without supporting this craziness or just go for a walk for free Save your hard earned money 
2 0 Crappy Rail This was a very disappointing product Amazon delivered it in great time but Razor is very misleading about the quality of this product It is too flimsy to remain upright while grinding it It is frustrating to be told by the Razor customer service AFTER the purchase that it should be bolted down to the ground or bolted to a piece of plywood There goes the portability of it VERY DISAPPOINTING 
2 0 not what I expected These are the short benches not the long ones that advertise on Television The cardio video is entirely too fast I teach aerobics twice a day and it s way too fast for a beginner even an advanced learner couldn t keep up Also the music is really boring I use the benches for my own individual exercises not with the dvd 
2 0 The Firm Sculpting System The first time I did this video I was in pain for three days Each time I exercised to this video it got easier but I don t have fun I have nowhere to put the fanny lifter steps that I didn t realize were coming with the dvd and my boyfriend uses them as a table If I could do it over I wouldn t buy this product however you will get an excellent workout If you have more room in your house or apartment for equipment and you like an intense workout then get this video There is a person doing an easier workout throughout the whole video 
1 0 I can t get the battery in This sounds very stupid I m sure but I can t get the battery cover off in order to put in the battery I unscrew it with a coin as I m told but when I can t turn it with the coin anymore I still can t get the darn thing open 
1 0 DOES NOT WORK I got the pedometer and from the start it DOES NOT WORK You have to physically shake it for it to count a step I m returning right away 
2 0 Dora Skates I didn t like these at all The toes are too pointy and wouldn t fit Might be ok for younger children than stated 
2 0 Daughter loves it but the area around the velcro has already started to fray This was a Christmas gift so she has not had them long I think that the quality should be better The knee pads and elbow pads do seem to protect well 
1 0 rolled OUT roller skates The front wheels came off the first day Christmas Day Very frustrating 
1 0 DISSAPOINTMENT I will never purchase an item from BabyRide again This canopy is MISLEADING It said it keeps out the sun and it is made of net The sun came right through and blinded my baby Not only that It is not worth the price You could go to a fabric store and buy the same netting for 5 Also when I went to return the item they charged me a RESTOCKING fee which I had never heard of Bad item I ordered the Rayshade by Kiddopotamus and LOVED IT get this one instead 
1 0 I can do this I can do this without the system it s simple why don t you get a pair of 20 pound dumbells and put them in the ground then do pushups trust me it works i do it all the time and the results are nearly similar without buying ANYTHING 
1 0 Awful I also bought this because it was the Consumer Reports Best Buy and I expected to get a lot of use out of it The frame broke on my first I weigh 175 and run about 30 miles per week after about 1100 miles and its replacement just died after only 350 miles So far I ve paid about a dollar a mile I ll never buy from Schwinn again 
1 0 Schwinn Nautilus ZERO QUALITY CONTROL The railings on the Schwinn 820p did not line up with the screw holes on the frame by several inches It was impossible to assemble With any quality control at all these measurements are checked on every item that leaves the factory Human error is then not a factor This is a defect that should never happen Schwinn Nautilus has zero quality control That is simply a fact of the most basic quality control standards You are therefore definitely taking your chances with this or any other Schwinn or Nautilus product With zero quality control no telling what else can prove to be wrong And though the warranty says 1 year on parts the warranty then goes on to say that there will be a charge for the installation of any defective or replaced parts So what is the 1 year warranty on labor Nothing obviously I wish I never had purchased this product myself 
2 0 Not too impressed This ab wheel is simple to use However I haven t had the same results as the other reviewers The only place I have felt the workout is in my arms For a good ab workout I would recommend buying an Ab Dolly or the video 8 Minute Abs 
1 0 Can t give negative stars Because you can t give negative stars I ll give this product one star I bought this product instead of the AbLounge because it could actually support a plus sized weight I m glad this product was cheap because it was the worst exercise machine I ever bought Everytime I swing on it I feel it creak and wobble I feel like its going to break under me each time I use it It makes a better decoration then it does an exerciser I ve been useing it for a few months and all its done is make me feel akward Don t buy this product if your plus size If your not plus size go get the 210 lbs weight limited Ab Lounger Jack Knife System thing If your are of plus size order THE BEAN full body I just did 
1 0 Not fit for use This product is not fit for use in any circumstance It Definately Looks Great But thats it The product can t call it a gun Broke in the first 5 hours of use NOT COMBAT play use with reasonalby responsible youngsters I am Extremely Dissapointed with the quality of the product I wrote two letters to the seller manufacturer rep and no repsonse yet Not surprised My son decided to spent 20 extra dollars on his replacemnt purchase and it WAS WELL WORTH IT We did not repeat buy and won t Learn from our mistake 
1 0 Airsplat s Service Stinks I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son s airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat a shortened M 4 airsoft rifle s weaver rail Yes I could go out and find screws the proper length but I though I d make Airsplat do their job So after several e mails with the service department they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size Wrong The diameter of the new screws is so big they won t fit through the mounting bracket on the sight Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws Take a pass on Airsplat The sight seems ok for the price 
1 0 Save Your Money I wish I d read the reviews for this piece of junk before buying it I had the same problem many other reviewers here had after using it for about an hour a day for less than two weeks the cable snapped rendering it useless This is just a poor quality machine plain and simple 
1 0 Poorly made breaks easily I bought this stepper to use when I am on the road for work After 3 days 10 min day the PLASTIC wheel bent out of shape and allowed the guide wire to fall off I replaced the wire and began again It was to no avail because the shape of the wheel was now distorted the wire would not stay in place and eventually the metal wire snapped The company Spartan actually replaced the entire stepper but the same thing happened The unit is rated for a max load of 220 lbs I am below that weight but it still broke If Spartan is serious about this product then change the plastic wheel to steel or rework the entire mechanism This design flaw is totally uncalled for and easily corrected The rest of the construction appears to be sturdy except for this crucial part Since this product was manufactured in China it is easy to see that the company placed more emphasis on cost than reliabilty STAY AWAY This product was made for extremely light people not for people who are serious about getting in shape and staying there 
1 0 Stay Away Amazingly I had the exact same problem as the other reviewers I had mine for about 4 weeks used it maybe 4 5 times a week when I started to hear snap snap SNAP The cable on it broke for me as well It s supposed to support up to 220 or 250 lbs or whatever it is I weigh 180 I also called the company and told them what happened and that I wanted a replacement I was told it was on back order and the cable would be sent out as soon as they get them in After calling back numerous times they continued to give me the same story I have since returned this thing to the online store where I bought it since they were NICE ENOUGH to understand the situation and wanted to make ammends I have yet to receive my replacement part Spartan Sporting Goods should be investigated THOROUGHLY 
1 0 This piece of equipment bites I wish the review written in January was posted before I bought this thing I bought this as a present and the exact thing happened The cable snapped after only 2 weeks of use The ad states it holds 250lbs but when you get it the item states 220 which she was still below that but the cable snapped anyway STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM FAR FAR AWAY 
1 0 Don t Buy This BEWARE This was given to me as a gift I used it almost every day for about 1 1 2 months then a cable on it broke It never even worked that well to begin with I e mailed the company for a new cable since it was covered under the warranty They told me they had to order it from China and had no idea when it would come They gave no apologies they could not have cared less EIGHT months later after I had already gotten rid of the piece of junk they sent it to me I used it for 1 month the whole year How lame 
1 0 No refund I recieved umbrella from UncleSams Umbrella shop of N Y then returned it as it was too big I have never recieved a refund of over 25 00 I would like to know what happened and when I will get my money back Umbrella was picked up by UPS on 03 07 05 I can be reached at vlb47 earthlink net I look forward to a resolution to this problem Thank you Vick 
1 0 Poor quality warranty is deceiving I bought a GustBuster umbrella several months ago expecting that it d be the last umbrella I ever needed Wow was that a bad decision This windproof umbrella had two of the spokes break in a light wind the weather report said the winds that day were only about 15 miles per hour So I e mailed the company because I remembered that it had a lifetime guarantee They told me that I d have to ship it back to them which is perfectly fine but I d also have to pay them 10 for their trouble What kind of lifetime guarantee is that For 10 or less I could buy another umbrella locally Their product has proven that it s NOT superior and it DOESN T live up to the claims they make for it Don t spend all this extra money on a GustBuster because you think it ll work better It won t Go out and buy a normal umbrella for 1 3 or 1 4 the price of a GustBuster you ll probably get the same amount of use out of the normal umbrella and you won t be paying an outrageous price for something that doesn t work the way their marketing claims 
2 0 Disappointed in durability I bought these for my 6 yr old son last fall A couple of them have already ripped in half and the others aren t far behind Invest a little more and buy something that will last more than a couple of months the vinyl doesn t 
1 0 Worthless I car camp around 6 weeks a year Every night on a different spot I was looking for a light and sturdy table Easy to setup and easy to pack This table is not the right table for me Yes it s light That s the only good atribute I can find for this table It s cumbersome to setup The plastic tabs that hold it together are very fragile The end caps on the ribs of the top surface started falling off even before the table was assembled It s low to the ground I would not buy this table again nor I would recommend anyone to buy it I give it one star because I can t give it any lower Alvaro Sacramento CA 
2 0 Too Wobbly The set up was easy and the bikes were easy enough to load but when used in a 2 in hitch it wobbles like crazy I was a nervous wreck just driving across town watching our bikes sway 45 degrees on every right turn I had a neighbor who knows alot about bike racks look at it and he said it was assembled right but it s just not that tight in a 2 inch hitch 
1 0 SO DISAPOINTED i did not pay head to the other reveiws and bought this bike anyway the first day i had it the back fender snapped off leaving sharp points exposed sadly we had to tell our 4 year old on his birthday that he could not ride the bike so we returned it and got another one not more than 30 mins after getting on the new one than the exhaust pipes came off leaving a VERY sharp screw exposed then the tire came off and the rim broke becuase it was plastic as well also the vinyl on the seat started to come apart at this point i had to return it and fight to get my money back it was a week after it had been delivered to the house i was to afraid that my kids would get hurt on this peice of junk please do not endanger your children by purchasing this bike 
1 0 Cheap I bought this for my 43 lb 6 year old daughter for Christmas The BACK FENDER MAIN BODY HEADLIGHTS and the RIMS are made of CHEAP PLASTIC This toy was broken on the first day she rode it The back rim and the back fender cracked and broke making the bike useless 
1 0 DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP Our daughter got one of these for Christmas She s taken it out twice on pavement and the rear wheel which is make out of plastic broke I regret paying what I did for this one not because of what the going price is now but because it s a piece of junk DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP 
1 0 didn t work at all I ordered this knowing that it would have its limitations but I expected it to project sound at least a short distance When we tried it out all we got was feedback Words were not audible at all When I contacted the seller I was told it was a novelty item only which I think is a ridiculous answer since even a novelty item should work a little Maybe the one we got was broken I didn t try again since the seller didn t seem to think anything was wrong with it when I called and the shipping which was not refunded when I returned it was just too expensive to have nothing to show for in the end 
1 0 Worthless This item sounded great in the ad but the only thing right in the ad is that it s pocket sized No one can understand what I say through it When the volume is turned up the sound becomes fuzzy and incoherent I thought this would be a great device but no one can understand me 10 feet away much less 200 If you order this device save the box it came in so you can send it back and get a refund WARNING The shipping is non refundable 
1 0 don t purchase This was a bitter disappointment One of the features we expected to get the most use from was the volume control However if we raise the volume much more than a quarter of a setting we get horrific feedback screeching Nothing seems to help and when I sent a note to the manufacturer for advice I never received an answer Unfortunately I d already disposed of the packing info when we discovered the problem so it looks like it ll hit the trash Save your money and don t purchase this item 
1 0 Flimsy construction small bench This bench is a bit of a joke unfortunately Having put the bench together myself I can tell you the most flimsy part of the bench is the part you sit on It s particle board wrapped in thin vinyl sitting on two VERY small pieces of metal balanced over the main structure I feel foolish for buying this bench Between the shoddy construction and the fact that the bench is supposedly rated for a MAXIMUM TOTAL WEIGHT OF 300lbs INCLUDING YOU AND THE WEIGHT YOU RE LIFTING I think it would be a mistake to purchase this The maximum width of this bench is only 3 feet It s narrow And small 
2 0 A Light Weight Bench This bench went together quickly All the parts fit well and the instructions were decent Anyone with a simple set of tools and about a hour can handle it with no problems There are a few steps where a second set of hands help Craftsmenship of the parts themselves seems to be pretty decent However this bench is simply not built for much weight It will wobble and flex It doesn t feel safe at all If you are serious about lifting you will quickly out grow the weight capacity of this bench There are alot better benches out there for just a little more money 
1 0 Terrible Video for Several Reasons If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me I urge you to buy something else 
2 0 Not industrial strength Overall the system is useable but there are multiple areas of potential improvement The most important area for improvement is the height of the weight bench It is too high so there is no way to perform a traditional bench press Second the pegs that hold the weight bar in place are positioned where one would normally place their hands There is no way around this other than narrowing your grip The fly bars are awkward and tend to bang against the bench support The lateral pull bar provides resistance through some palstic housing which I am pretty sure will wear out in a short period of time The weight bench has basically been relegated to my off day strength work outs since it does not provide the stability and support for a vigorous weight session 
2 0 disappointed in product This product is actually quite small Even though is says mini I still expected it to be a little bit bigger Also it will not stand up with a drink bottle in it The seams on the bottom make it too unstable to stand alone 
2 0 It works only when you are doing any work outs This will work only if you are doing work outs while you are not doing work outs if you wear this I don t think it would be of any help 
2 0 not spill proof this item will keep drinks cold but it is fine if you have it in the car in a cup holder for long trips but if you intend it for a child to take to school it spills all over their lunch bo 
1 0 To small for me It does what its supposed to do but its made for someone 5 6 I m 6 and not really enjoying it 
1 0 BIG DISAPPOINTMENT Granted this was on sale for 20 bucks it was originall 75 it s poorly made difficult to assemble and very uncomfortable to use 
2 0 Good if you re tall enough The Ab Roller was a big disappointment for me It was more difficult to assemble because of shoddily constructed parts Then once that project was done I was unable to use it as the design is clearly for someone at least 4 or 5 inches taller than me As a very petite 4 11 woman my hands barely reached the top bar making it impossible for me to get the leverage to use the machine properly So beware shorties out there 
1 0 what a hassle Received the ab roller and the box contained none of the hardware necessary for assembly 5 days after emailing the company they reply that they are unable to send the hardware and I must return it to them before they will send out a new box Very frustrating I must drive 20 miles to the nearest UPS store to return it Wish I had just bought the thing at Walmart 
1 0 Need a workout This pump did not work very well for me Must pump it with much force fast and is more of a hassle then a help I wound up putting it away and walking my bike to a gas station instead 
1 0 5 Stomps and it s broken Didn t pump any air into the tire the first 2 stomps tried it again another day 3rd stomp and the gauge went flying off Put the gauge back on and it still doesn t work Biggest waste of money Never even filled one tir 
1 0 RELLY BED WHEN I FIRST TIME USED IT IT S BORKEN AND I CAN NOT RETURN OR EXCHANGE WITHOUT BO 
1 0 Bad pump I wanted to use this pump to pump my bike but it never worked It leaked It can only used to pump up balls only It is a piece of junk 
1 0 Bad Investment I bought this pump and used it on three bikes a total of 5 tires before the foot pedal bent then broke If you need a pump I suggest going to a bike store and paying for a good one I tried to go the inexpensive route and learned my lesson Bell products are cheaply made and don t last beyond a few uses Don t make my mistake and disappoint your kids on a Sunday when there s nothing you can do about it except to drive to the nearest gas station for air Stay away from this and other pedestrian pumps Makes you wonder what a Bell helmet will look like after a spill 
1 0 Don t waste your money It only runs for about 15 minutes with a child who weighs 50 lbs Doesn t run well over pine needles or leaves Make sure to rake the yard before riding The acceleration in slow the child pushes on the pedal and nothing happens I spent most of the 15 minutes run time push starting the thing It stops when the child tries to make a tight turn All of this was on the grass it was advertised as being rugged off road capable when in fact it only works on the paved driveway Don t hold your breath waiting on hold for live customer service person it s been 3 days and still haven t heard 
1 0 Do not buy this item You can only ride for 45 minutes after charging the battery for 12 hours Forget about buying an extra battery to charge while you ride because of the adapter it only charges while its on the machine There is no seperate battery charger 
1 0 A garbage bag would have been just as good We bought this cargo bag for a 900 mile trip from Pennsylvania to Florida We didn t use it on the way there but on our way home we put two medium sized suitcases in it We barely made it 100 miles before the bag started coming unglued at the seams Fortunately or unfortunately due to the color we had a bright yellow roll of duct tape with us so we were able to repair the bag as we drove After another 100 miles we had to stop again and repair the bag We drove from Florida to Hilton Head having to stop three times to repair the bag with the bright yellow duct tape From Hilton Head to Pennsylvania the bag started to look like a nightmare of black criss crossed with yellow The last leg of our trip was nothing but a hassle having to stop to fix the bag The company has a 30 day return policy but we missed that by a day having ordered it two weeks before our trip and being gone for two weeks and they wouldn t even work with us on it 
1 0 Which designer thought the recline on this stroller was ok I have had this stroller for ONE day and I m going to send it back or sell it I am so disappointed I was so excited for this to arrive We set it up instructions were a little shady here and there and I try and adjust the seat I have the strap pulled ALL THE WAY BACK and my two year old looks like he is almost laying down He HATES it He is a very happy kid and loves to ride in his stroller He was miserable because he couldn t sit up and look around plus the tray was at such a weird angle in relation to the seat angle that he couldn t even see the Cheerios on the tray from his angle His Playtex sippy couldn t fit into the small hole for a drink in the kids tray and my water fell out over and over again from the parents tray The construction is great the fabrics are nice overall I could have given it five stars but the seat positioning is SO extreme that it makes my son start to cry that makes it a really crummy purchase If you are wondering about which one to buy DO not buy this one unless your kid loves looking at the sky all through your walks 
1 0 up to 50 pound stroller The only reason I am rating this stroller a 1 is Amazon has it listed that is usable for a child up to 100 pounds It actually is only 50 pounds It is now being returned 
1 0 Dora the Explorer Bike I was very dissastisfied with the product The 16 inch DORA bike was a christmas gift for my youngest daughter We had to keep it in the box until Christmas Eve so that she wouldn t find it When I started assembling it that night we found no training wheels or SEAT I was very upset for obvious reasons how do you tell a 4 yr old that Santa forgot the SEAT and training wheels for her bike 
1 0 Another piece of junk pair of goggles These goggles suck I swim an hour a day every day and not only do they scratch if a fingernail touches them but they fog up in 5 minutes fit terribly are hard to adjust and cause irritation around my eyes They leak water and the different nose pieces are just a joke They go from tiny a little bigger than tiny huge and then extra huge They don t fit What a waste of 15 I ve had similar success from goggles one can find at the grocery store They are only 5 and they fog up and leak the same as these 
1 0 Hard to use I love the idea of this sleek out of the way for transit but readily available on the road protected when not in use Unfortunately the reality is a hard to use product that does little to improve road safety Because of the narrowness of the mirror it s very difficult to focus on what is actually behind you with a quick glance Sure if you sit there for 10 seconds you can figure it out but I don t have that sort of time when I m dodging through Chicago traffic Save your money and buy the excellent Mirrcycle instead 
1 0 Cool design poor execution Even though they look pretty cool these mirrors are hard to focus and even harder to see anything in 
1 0 Does not work Uncomfortable and heavy for bar ends and useless as mirrors As mentioned the mirrors are of a terrible quality To top that they do not stay in place when adjusted 
1 0 Great concept but tiny distorted mirrors don t work Mirrors are too small and too distorted The picture on the package shows a perfect reflection as if It s about as useful as taping two foil wrapped sticks of chewing gum to your handlebars and expecting to be able to see reflections in them 
2 0 These are only for FLAT Smooth surfaces Be sure you have a very flat smooth surface for these bumper cars There is almost zero clearance between the driving surface and the bumper part of the car Our girls rode them in our driveway sidewalk and constantly got stuck on uneven surfaces or the edge of the driveway We had to make the girls get out and pick up and move the car to a flat surface These are probably much better for a basement or a perfectly flat surface like a tennis or basketball court 
2 0 Not really worth it I hate to complain too much since this is a pretty cheap item but just to warn others I bought this because I wanted an ab bench It really doesn t suit that purpose too well since it was one incline position only for abs the other positions are just back support for working with dumbells The ab position is pretty weak and doesn t really work your abs as well as an abs only bench would have plus it is a bit uncomfortable and as the other reviewer said if you are anywhere near 6 ft tall or over get something else Combined with shipping this is a waste of almost 100 bucks here while usable it really won t make an impact on your workouts I did a few sets of situps and really don t feel the tightness I would have if I used a real bench or even just sat on the floor for that matter If you re on a budget this may work if you put something under the front base to put it on a greater incline and or do situps holding weights and make sure you pad it with a blanket or something the position is just too awkard The fact that it s a multipurpose bench takes away from it as an effective ab bench real ab benches are ONE smooth incline not a perpendicular seat that bends down halfway which really stretches your back a bit too much in a direction it s not supposed to bend LOL 
2 0 Marcy Decline Flat Utility Bench Not what I expected This bench is ok for a petite woman not suitable for a man or anyone over 5 feet tall 
1 0 I Have Found That There are Better Options From the previous reviews it seems that this product doesn t deliver any satisfaction at all Buy instead the wrist roller manufactured by proboxinggear I bought one eight months ago and I loved it I use it at home and even at the gym since it is small and very light so it fits in my backpack taken about the same space than my gloves The one I bought is really an excellent accessory since is not only a Wrist exerciser but a complete Forearm Strengthener Simple to use with no spring or moving or breakable parts it looks like it will resist the hardest workouts and continuous use With simple rolling movements and as you gradually increase resistance by adding weight plates to it you strengthen hands wrist forearms and upper arms I have considerably improved wrist stability and holding power and also feel an Increased range of motion and flexibilit 
1 0 Missing a part Both the original order and the attempted re order were missing the same parts the plate that holds the weights on the end of the rope and the nut that holds the plate on the bolt at the end of the rope when the item arrived I think that this is a design flaw in the packaging 
1 0 WASTE OF MONEY i bought this bike in the mermaid ariel theme for my 2 year old daughter the manufactor s age for this bike is 1 1 2 year and up this bike is awful the seat is set up like it would be on a normal bike BUT the pedals are attached to the FRONT wheel like a tricyle which make it IMPOSSIBLE for a child to reach the pedals while sitting on the seat my 4 year old son can reach the pedals but he even has a hard time riding it its truly a waste of money and if i could find the receipt i would take it back it was a huge disappointment as a Christmas gift Whoever designed this bike did not have a child in mind there is no way a child could ride this bike comfortably even if they could reach the pedals 
1 0 never able to use When I ordered the product I kept putting on my order for a medium size When the final paperwork was sent for delivery it said it was being shipped and it was a small A small was sent instead of a med therefore we could not use the product If you can take care of this matter with a return ticket for the small one we would appreciate it 
2 0 Overpriced Boxing Gloves Though I bought this boxing glove with a 20 discount I still think it was overpriced First I had a hard time getting my hand into the glove and I only have medium sized hands I make do with taped hands but using this glove with the popular Evergel hand wraps is out of the question Tape s better than the Evergels anyway Second on one of the gloves the Everlast label on the elastic wrist wrap started coming off though I d only just started hitting a heavy bag It s made of this cheap plastic like material You d think for 100 you d get a glove with every detail of medium to high quality I cutoff the hanging label entirely Third the product description states five distinct layers of foam are in the glove between your hand and point of contact With the 10 oz glove it doesn t feel like anything special just a thin layer of foam I m not impressed with the padding Overall the glove is of medium to low quality It even looks cheap The leather is less than a millimeter thick and the stitching is ordinary I ll use the glove as I ve already spent the money but my next glove I think is going to be a Title Platinum Unfortunately Everlast seems to have gone the way of cheap mass production and net profit at the sacrifice of it s reputation 
1 0 Terrible I wanted to confirm that I had the same experience as the other dissatisfied reviewers The Everlast Bar comes with nuts that don t fit the screws The nuts are laced with a hard inner plastic lining that requires you to use powertools to force the screw to chisel through I returned it for a new one thinking that surely this was a mistake but the replacement had the same pieces Horrible However I was determined to make my purchase work so I put it together with force Once I had everything assembled I found that the bar does not keep together by design even with the screws pretty secured the outer loops on the bar they are supposed to serve as multi purpose handles can unhinge and detach from the bar because their connection to the bar on one side is not secured by screws That s absolutely ridiculous when this is clearly supposed to be keep you safely suspended in mid air Thoroughly dissatisfied I ve used the Door Gym and it s much more secure than this 
2 0 Victorinox Altimeter First off The knife is great I wouldn t expect anything less from swiss army only bad part about the knife is that the altimeter has an accuracy error margin of about 75 And since this is both the title of the knife and the main feature of it I give the knife a two Only because you can get a knife just like it without the altimeter that works just as well 
2 0 Maybe for a couch potato This machine is too easy Even with the additional resistance bands it s just not enough if you re an active person at all The assisted crunch funtion is a joke and most of the moves are just as effective without the machine I used it every day for a month until I felt I d gotten my money s worth now it collects dust I d sell it for 20 at this point just to get it out of my house I see my Easy Shaper becoming a Goodwill donation in the very near future 
1 0 crappy this gun is not good it is a piece of crud beginners could buy a gun thats about 100 times better from walmart for only 20 bucks get it if your a idiot i wish i could give it 0 star 
1 0 Worst gun ever This gun sucks it has the worst range out of all the ones I own When I lob it I can only shoot twenty feet fps sucks i can shoot my hand two inches from the barrel and it doesn t hurt flimsy no joke I dropped it when I was playing and it shattered accuracy is a joke I have a walled backyard and I was at one end When I lobbed it I hit the the wall once 20 ft away I fired it again twice and I hit 5 and 7 ft away from my mark The one good thing about this gun is the price 3 dollars is not bad for this piece of dog feces 
2 0 Eddie Bauer Performance Boccee Set Crate busted in mail The set is fine however the crate was completely busted up I will think twice before I order an item so heavy for it was not packed well at all I was going to try and get a refund but I am not going to pay to have it returned However if the Powers that be might receive this e mail a new crate or bag would be wonderful An Amazon Patron Iri 
1 0 Junk Plastic junk Tried it once Wont try again Just get a piece of rope and cut it to size This thing is suppose to be adjustable Only with difficulty of yanking it through the handle The plastic rope does not turn properly so therefore it twists and kinks leading you to trip over it Just get a piece of rope 
2 0 Good product but far too small We bought and then returned the Scuttle Bug It was well made and easy to snap together However it was far far too small for our 27 months old daughter who happens to be very petite only 25 percentile for height and weight Her knees dragged the ground I think it is a cool product but maybe for younger smaller children We wound up getting a kiddio trike which is fantastic 
1 0 Horrible Make sure your bike is compatible Make sure that your bike is compatible with this trailer It doesn t work with every bike it didn t with mine I called Allegro Medical several times to try and return it and they gave me a hard time about it saying I cant return it unless it is defective So now I have a bike trailer and a bike that don t work together and I m out 85 00 Horrible 
1 0 Decent design terrible materials This bike trailer seemed like a great deal When I assembled it and tested it out it worked great seemed very safe and comfortable My daughter loved riding in it Initially I was very happy with the product especially for the price paid Unfortunately after several weeks in the sun all of the white nylon straps used for support and restraints began detoriating and breaking I would recommend spending a little more on a bike trailer that uses a better grade of materials 
2 0 no worth rec d this pitchback and assembled the cords that hold net to frame disintegrated and broke free after a short period of time park sun was unwilling to replace or address faults very disappointed 
1 0 disappointed 7 year old Received the order in a timely fashion however the box was badly I mean badly damaged It was a birthday gift for a family member I always order early mistake returns are 30 days We had the party 45 days later when we opened the box rust went on the carpet did you ever try to get rust out of off white carpeting To make things even worse it was missing all the hardware for putting it together Probably fell out of the hole in the box that was there before they shipped it to me HAPPY BIRTHDAY and your welcome for the carpet stain all new things come rusty you didn t know that 
2 0 Poor quality control and rust I was attracted to the Park Sun PB PRO Pitchback Pro because of the large dimensions of the tubing and the hinge assembly that would allow me to easily fold the unit and place it in my garage The first unit I recieved arrived with the box trashed and the netting hing pieces and hardware missing I promptly recieved a replacement box and it contained everything I needed to assemble the unit Unfortunately the tolerance on the nipples and flanges of the tubing pieces varies considerably After juggling pieces around and pushing and tugging I ended up with two pieces that should have fit with other pieces but absolutely did not fit any of the pieces On one vertical piece the nipple was too big and would not fit into any of the flanges on a corner piece the recieving flange was too small to recieve any of the vertical pieces Also the tubing is made of rolled steel tubing and the weld is not ground off of the interior of the tubing so that virtually all of the pieces are difficult to fit together The packaging was insufficient as several pieces came with the paint rubbed off with rust showing through due to shifting of the contents There was rust dust on the plastic sleves covering the tubing particularly at the tube ends Nice idea poor execution 
1 0 Calm 55 1532 Gravity Inversion Therapy Table Review The table is easy to put together but it is uncomfortable on your feet to use 
1 0 Garbage This stand deserves a 0 but that wasnt an option The engineers that designed it were smoking something wicked It is of poor design and quality I wouldnt take if they were givin it away I ve had it set up in my basement for a few days and I couldnt wait to take it down and return Which I did Pronto Do yourself a favor Stay away 
2 0 very bad quality This stand is very bad quality Not worth investing in this stand The speed bag platform isnt even made out of real wood It vibrates too much The Swivel it comes with is made out of plastic It Sucks Invest in a better stand like the ones from www balazsboxing co 
1 0 Fell Apart I was thrilled when I received this knife It was cute small and the utilities were perfect for light duty mom emergency situations However after less than a month in my purse the floral plastic cover which in truth I thought felt pretty flimsy when I got it had broken off one side and was cracked on the other Sigh 
1 0 dont buy this product this item is horrible It is flimsy and didn t even come with any instructions Even though it was so cheap I feel so ripped of 
1 0 Not worth it The stamper broke on the very 1st ball I tried to personalize A little black washer fell out of mechanism and the stamp jammed and would not stamp the golf ball 
1 0 Don t Waste Your Money Shame on me for not reading the reviews on this product It is garbage A waste of time and money 
1 0 Don t Buy This item is a piece of junk All you get is smudges and black marks It does not work Buy your balls already labeled or get a better stamper Just please don t buy this thing 
1 0 doesn t work Don t buy this It doesn t work The ink is not even at all if and when you can get it on the stamp I ve attempted around 50 stamps on some range balls and not one is crisp and clear The stamp is either running too much ink or the middle letter is messed up from too little ink Save your money buy a sharpie pen and mark your balls with that 
2 0 Don t overuse it My son hit 515 as an 8 year old last year This year he moved up a division and has struggled at around 250 even though he has a fairly nice swing Using this device for two weeks he suddenly can t hit anything I pitched him hardballs today and he swung over the top of every one of the first 60 The problem with this device is that the ball doesn t drop like a pitched ball so it actually trains them to swing higher than normal I ll be putting this away for the season and trying to recover my son s swing and confidence Don t get me wrong the kids love it The entire team lines up before every game and begs you to throw fastballs with it It s great for use around the house just tie it to a tree and you can take swings that you couldn t otherwise Beware if you intend to use this for much more than casual practice and don t let it replace live pitching Fun factor is a 5 but as far as a training device I have to question its value 
1 0 Great Tool My daughter loves it You wants to practice more often now Thank

1 0 Durability of the Wenzel Air Bed with Built in AC Pump The design of the bed is awesome Unfortunately it would not hold air There were no visible flaws The instructions state that the bed will need additonal air after the bed is originally used The bed would not hold air at all I only attempted to use it in the house and checked for possible problems there 1st I purchased another bed assuming that the 1st bed had a flaw and the second one did exactly the same thing I love the design but I am disappointed in the quality 
2 0 Deflates every time This mattress has deflated on my guests since the first time I used it Very aggravating because it s a pain in the you know what to send something this large heavy bulky back 
1 0 A Piece of S T This was a big waste of money The first day of use my two guest had to pump it back up about five times throughout the night I thought maybe it was because two people were on it A couple of monthe later I had another guest sleep on it He had to do the same thing IHe ended up sleeping on the couch He thought it was a mre comfortable sleep anyway Again DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY 
2 0 Wenzel Queen Raised Insta Flex Air Bed with Built in AC Pump The pillow top portion of the bed started leaking after few times of use 
1 0 Not worth the Money Bed is not even after few hours of sleep Very difficult if two people are sharing the bed when one rolls in the sleep other person wakes worse still you will get up with back pain shoulder pain even if you manage to sleep 
2 0 Sports net Unfortunately this product did not live up to our expectations It did not last one full season The bottom braces not reinforced very well 
1 0 Piece of junk I didn t think it was difficult to set up but it clearly isn t designed well The target that hangs inside the cage doesn t actually fit And the netting doesn t stop the balls How s that for a good product 1 out of 5 balls rips right through the net Buy anything else 
1 0 Net rips Difficult to set up Difficult to set up Netting rips far too easily Avoid this item Be sure to look for something that has hassle free set up and also water resistent nylon netting thats tough 
1 0 broken junk The thing broke I never thought I d see a chain breaker tool that would break under the stress of taking apart a chain And the worst part is I only used the thing about five times 
1 0 Cheap junk DO NOT BUY Stay away from this chain breaker I hoped for a few uses of this breaker but instead got only half way through my first job before the handle broke and threads started to cross thread My Nashbar one was much better quality and only slightly more expensive 
1 0 A Total Disapointment I expected much better quality from Thule As used according to the manufacturers recomendations this bag did not even last one trip from New York to Chicago without it s interior lining cracking and completely flaking off In addition the back of the bag ripped creating two large holes in the fabric and the zipper attachments became loose and proceeded to pound at the roof of my car The contents shifted continually during travel making for a loud noise that s not unlike a pouring rain hitting the top of the car This becomes a terrible distraction while driving All in all I had a very bad experience with this product and would not reccomend it Opt for one of the solid constuction type carriers they cost much more but are worth every penny In the end I thought I was saving money with this product but wound up having to purchase a Sears X Cargo container to replace it for my return trip back 
1 0 Service was so poor I had to cancel the order Placed the order on 11 20 delivery was supposed to be by 12 9 On about 12 1 I contacted the company that Amazon said was the provider Unbeatable Sale Inc to verify that they did have the order Unbeatable said that it was an Amazon order period and gave me a number at Amazon to contact Amazon said that Unbeatable had the bike on back order because they fill their direct orders first Cancelled the order and found a similar bike for 20 dollars less at Walmart 
1 0 HUGE Watch Before purchasing this watch you should go to a store and take a look This watch is HUGE The temperature feature works fine until you wear the watch then because of your body temp you have no idea what the temp is The barometer feature is displayed in millibars not something I am acquainted with I could not get the compass feature to work correctly It took approx 3 weeks to be delivered free shipping I returned the watch and purchased a TIMEX paid for shipping and it was at my door in 4 days and works perfectly 
1 0 Very angry These stupid gloves ripped the second time i put them on my hands I would only recommend then to someone who feels like wasting 30 bucks 
1 0 A Total Rip off Don t order this item or anything from Mercantilla Inc The product was a different color than advertised it was missing three important parts without which you can t use the bench and many of the other parts were damaged I ve never had this many problems from any of Amazon s sellers This was supposed to be my Holiday present but it turned out to be a real disappointment 
1 0 rip off Since I have received this piece of s t I have had to call twice because parts were either damaged or not working You have to call several times to get through to a customer service rep and they never answer when you leave a message 
1 0 It won t work I used one powerglove for a month and it was sporadic at working and then quit entirely Amazon sent a free replacement It did the same thing I couldn t get it to turn on then after 8 minutes or so if it did turn on I couldn t get it to turn off It needs major redesigning I like the concept and it was comfortable but that s about all Barbara Baxte 
2 0 Not easy to use I had great hope for this item after reading reviews but found that it didn t function as described and that the three buttons that control it are so close together that my fingers were unable to press them individually and I have tiny hands It s a great idea but needs a re design before I could use it 
1 0 Camp grill not worth the When the grill arrived my husband put it together right away I am glad he did It was very unstable I would be afraid of cooking anything on it We packaged it back up and sent it right back 
2 0 Flakey I ve been using this mat for a little over a month for a 5 day a week practice At first I was thrilled but at the end of my 2nd class I noticed it was looking a little rough where I placed my feet It s continued to get worse and worse 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice and scatter on the floor around me Since I practice in a studio it s particularly annoying I practice with the sticky side down and the jute side up The jute side is the side that flakes Practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem but then the mat inchworms across the floor 
2 0 Not as good as it seems Power bad Strings lose grip slippery Basically I ordered my racket on the 11 and got my racquet in 3 weeks That was really long especially because I upgraded my shippping I dont like this because the grip isn t really grippy lol and the strings make your hands hurt because they re kinda loose The only thing I like about this is that it donates to breast cancer but I really don t recommend this raquet I bought an N code right after I tried to use this 3 times Very unsatisfied This wilson doesn t live up to the wilson reputation for m 
2 0 package missing Package missing It s never be received So I cannot rate it 
1 0 Suggested Retail 12 99 I went to Swiss gear website to check out the pole and see if they had any others This is the only pole they have which isn t saying much for the brand but I found that the suggested retail is 4 lower to what Amazon is selling it for Just seems like the seller should always be lower or at least the same price Even though Amazon is jacking up the price its still really cheap Probably too cheap to be any good 
2 0 Most Handles had Too Few Threads Inviting Breakage I tried 50 60 sets from Regent who apparently also does Spalding Franklin and Sportcraft and only got a usable set by combining parts from 2 sets alternately one should check out manufacturer part replacement policies in advance including who pays Shipping costs Regent and Sportcraft had several handles with too few threads inviting breakage Franklin wood and threads were such that 1 mallet s threads stripped when tightening by hand and 1 had poor threads because the wood narrowed and flattened Some Sportcraft end caps rolled under and they claimed their 2 balls were 3 if they were rounding why don t they round their 3 5 16 balls as well Franklin s stakes had different tapers and about 1 16 different diameters On the personal preference front Sportscraft s handles are grooved Franklin s balls are and their wickets are narrow Regent s colors are dull 
1 0 Bad safety key design When one trips the safety key one has to power the treadmill off then on to get the treadmill going again This action looses all the time and distance information The Keys Fitness who manufactures Ironman and a bunch of others help line confirmed that this is normal for their products I see this as a safety problem because many people will bypass the safety key by not clipping it on their body 
1 0 Wrong hardware aweful customer response by company I was so happy to order this It hasn t even been put together yet in box for two weeks They sent the wrong hardware with it I emailed them 2 times and got no response After twenty minutes of trying I finally got a human voice She was nice and shipped the parts They arrived today and guess what The same wrong parts again I can t get a response so I guess I will have to also go and purchase the stuff to put it together At least I have a list from the owner s manual Overall experience was a big fat bust 
1 0 Broke after two months This stepper is terrible The bar between the steps cracked after only two months of regular use In addition it is very squeaky and the monitor doesn t register anything unless you step all the way to the ground Don t waste your money on this piece of junk 
2 0 Difficult to assemble Don t buy this equipment unless you have two very strong people who are expert mechanics Other exercise equipment comes partially assembled this just has alot of odd pieces Complaint 1 No how to assemble video as other brand names include 2 Instruction sketches are small and diagrams are vague 3 It took hours of painstaking trial and error to assemble and we ended up leaving one washer out because once assembled it cannot be diassembled If I had known what a giant project this would be to assemble I would never have purchased it This is Tony Little product is not an assembly friendly exercise machine which Body By Jake products usually are How much more would it have cost them to put in a a how to assembly video I ll never buy a Tony Little product again That said it s very simple to use Since this is the heavy duty model it s heavy to move and it takes up alot of space It s a type of exercise equipment that needs its own large space If you have a small room think twice about this model Millie in Californi 
2 0 Not that special for cars This sounds great in theory being that you don t have to get under the car to drain the oil Fantastic But while this has still seemingly been made out to be a great thing for boats and cars I don t quite agree You still have to get under the car to change the oil filter so I d suggest saving 50 and taking the ten seconds to drain the oil from under the car which is actually faster than using this device 
1 0 Very poor quality Poor workmanship Padded handgrip area varied from 3 25 to 3 5 long Most palms are wider than that The cheap construction looks like it will fail within a short period of use Shipping them back would cost more than they re worth 
1 0 Arrived broken looks clearly like a bad design where the parts go together  
1 0 Coleman Dome Tent We already tossed it One of the worst The braces that secure the material and the tent together broke After taking it down we noticed cracks in the rods When I went to set it up the second time one was split end to end and another snapped It sits on our from curb for garbage as I write this review 
2 0 there is such a thing as too sticky This mat may have a design flow or perhaps it was rolled up before paint on the cute paisley pattern dried up Layers were stuck together and it was hard to unroll In the process the paisly design ripped bits of the bottom side of the mat I suppose it s still functional but my brand new mat looks pretty awful 
2 0 not so great this mat gets very slippery and makes even simple moves frustrating i would recommend a different mat cheer 
1 0 Not Satisfied I just got the mat and went to unroll it but it is stuck together expecially where the paisley patterns are so that when I unrolled it chinks of the mat came off Very poor quality and I m unsaitsfied I would not recommend getting this mat 
1 0 For Display Only Great feedbacks from J Leigh This sword is for display only Try swinging it around and you ll see what happens They should add that to the description 
2 0 Nice for the movie collector This is not a usable sword This is for fans of the movie and to hang on the wall There are very few swords that can be used among these are Paul Chen s Cold Steel s and the Last Legend stuff Only buy this if you intend to put it on your wall because failure is not a possability it is guaranteed if you try to use this blade 
2 0 Cheap but not quality = fair enough First of al it is not stainless steel It has exactly its price do not think it is too cheap Handle is not that reliable it is like it s gonna break easily I mean don t think of any usage It is only for decoration 
1 0 Too heavy and spongy I bought this for one of my children but it is a bit heavy and too spongy severly lacking speed I also bought the Stiga Champion which is lighter and faster I would spend 6 more and get a paddle which helps play instead of hindering it 
1 0 totally not plastic these are not 100 plastic but they are paper please do not buy these if you think you are getting plastic cards 
1 0 low quality marked cards Don t buy these cards They are of very low quality I bought 4 decks several cards in each deck where visibly marked You will be better off paying a few dollars more for high quality cards 
1 0 crappy paint First off the paint balls were two different colors and were both worng second problem was that they blow up in your gun so easily dont buy less you like cleanin your barrel 
1 0 Bad fit very painful at night I woke up repeatedly in the night with more pain that the Plantars Faciitis was giving me for the following reasons The front part of the sock device is extremely narrow I don t have wide feet but the pointy ends crowded by toes and caused cramps that I had to adjust for constantly Could never get used to it The strap around the ankle was too stiff and chaffed Took forever to find the right tightness that didn t cause my feet to swell painfully in the night while not being so loose that it moved and chafed horribly Honestly even wearing a hard plastic brace was easier for me to sleep with A simple strap that supported the arch and wrapped over the instep has been the most effective along with faithfully wearing the arch supports during the day Don t waste your money 
1 0 these gloves are garbage The padding is too bulky toward the knuckels There is no padding on the fingers The gloves are closed palm so your hands get sweatier faster Overall these gloves are a poor excuse for grappling gloves 
1 0 Thule LB58 58 Load Bars 1Pr The Thule load bars that I actually received were only 50 inches long and I needed the 58 inch load bars so I really couldn t do anything with them It specifically said right in the title that they were the 58 inch bars but they were not I even wrote amazon back to try and right the situation but no one contacted me so I had to sell the bars on ebay and buy another pair that were the right length 
1 0 Complete junk I ll be returning right away Suction cup does not hold at all Completely useless 
2 0 too short for most This weight bench is too short and is almost impossible to use in a completely horizontal postion You would have to be a little kid for it to work After working along time to put it together I found neither me nor my 6 2 kid could use it effectively 
2 0 Quality control now that great On my third pair since I purchased these gloves from Amazon a few weeks ago First pair had Velcro on the inside sewn into the seam Very irritating especially when holding heavy weights and having the rough Velcro dig into the palm of your hand Medium size was smaller than advertised shutting off the circulation to my fingers and the non slip pads on fingers were ripping off after 1 week of use Harbinger customer service was very helpful and sent me out a new larger pair for free had to return mine first This pair shows up and the gloves are two different colors Blue and gray on one and blue and black on the other Strike two for quality control Waiting for a 3rd matching pair from Harbinger Again Harbinger customer service is excellent but the quality control of these gloves is less than average 
2 0 Comfortable but falls short This fitness mat is thick and cushy but I find myself having to make a lot of adjustments during my workout because it s about a foot too short My biggest complaint is that the washable cover a major reason I selected this product shrank to a completely unusable size when I washed it in cold water line dried Now I m left with just a piece of foam that is inconvenient to transport and somewhat uncomfortable 
2 0 Too bad I was excited to purchase what I thought was a quality knife for a good price with good ergonomics being a Ken Onion design What I bought was designed to sell and not to last The handle was textured on the sides but the edges of the handle were far too smooth to be held safely especially if they were to ever get a little wet The thumb studs have very sharp edges that will wear out pants quickly The spring assist broke after two months of extremely mild absolutely non abusive use The 12 00 return shipping fee plus the cost to ship it to Emerson makes the true cost of the knife about 84 00 and what if the spring breaks again My advice is buy another brand P S The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is the tanto blade and the fact that it can still be used as a quick opening folder absent the blur 
1 0 beware i was JUST LOOKING at tennis rackets on the amazon site the next thing i get is an email to say i have agreed to purchase one i did NOT press to conferm this order but AMAZON kept my credit card details on record and used them nicola bradle 
2 0 Zoomboard Inexpensive but for a little bit more you can get much better I would not recommend this product unless you absolutely cannot afford to spend any more money For around 60 you could get the World Industries M A D Balance Board and get a much better looking and more durable product Or you could spend around 80 and get a Bongo Board If you really want the best and have the money for it you could spend about 120 and get an Indo Board The Zoomboard that I received was green and blue Unfortunately it looks garish but a child may like the look of this In addition to the garish coloring scheme the board has a rough sandy underside This is good because it allows the board to better grip the rolling tube However after a couple weeks of using it five days each week for 30 minute sessions with my 140 lbs frame the tube develops craters from the sand and wears down Then again if you wait it out the sand eventually will slough off of the board itself and you won t have to worry about wearing down your rolling tube But the gripping surface will be compromised If you try using this on a hard floor and not carpeting the rolling tube starts to move less fluidly than before Make sure there are no grains pebbles or hard materials on the surface you are practicing on because they can easily ruin your rolling tube This may be a failing of boards that use a wood rolling tube Overall this board is fun but not great quality If you absolutely cannot afford 10 more to purchase a much better product then buy this board and use it sparingly on a carpet to get a long life out of it If you can afford more keep looking and check out the products that I mentioned above and get something that ll actually be worth your hard earned money 
1 0 Not worth the price I am surprised this bike has gotten good reviews I am quite diappointed I purchased this bike after looking at many mountain bikes and decided that this seemed to be a good buy However it turned out not to be so First of all the bike is really ugly with its white and brownish colors though I suppose that s a personal issue As for performance this bike is not worth its stated price of over 200 so don t think you are getting some great deal The suspension leaves something to be desired and it seems to be shifting funny I am not an expert on bikes but I m pretty sure shifting is supposed to be a little smoother than this Also after about a week I noticed a strange noise coming from the bike as I peddled It s hard to explain almost like something is out of place So again the bike is not worth this price Perhaps if it were being sold for around 100 it would be a decent deal 
2 0 Can t agree more with Beware of Stamina Products I received my Stamina Products Adjustable Hyperextension Bench on March 13th of 07 and was very disappointed There was hardly any insulation whatsoever in the box and it looked like it was just thrown in the box The product was scratched and parts were broken Fortunately the bench works but it looks like it is already a few years old with all the damage The product seems to be of quality it s just unfortunate that SPS doesn t understand how important that packaging is and if it is insufficient it makes the product look cheap 
1 0 Buy a better backpack I have purchased this backpack in black in August and I haven t actually used it until December of 06 I was carrying around 40+ pounds in this pack hiking along the apalacian trail and on the first day this pack ripped My left shoulder strap ripped off at the bottom and I had to secure it with a square knot The next day the right shoulder strap ripped in a different place and I had to loop the adjustable strap around a seam on the belt Also I have stepped on the waist belt numerous times without thinking about it and the flimsy peice of plastic broke It still held but I had to check it twice every time I tried to pick up the handle above the straps on my fourth day hiking and the left side of it ripped partially Another thing that happened was that I was trying to put the heavy items at the bottom of the bag while hiking and when I came home I noticed that the bottom of the bag had some holes in it from when I leaned against a rock or ground to catch my breath The bottom of this bag is nothing but fabric This pack is nothing but a glorified backpack not meant to hold anything more than 25 30 pounds at the most If you want a backpack that is dependable buy something else If you want something cheap for a day hike or something I suppose this pack is for you but I d still say that this pack is not worth it 
2 0 You get what you pay for Keeps the drinks chilled but not cold What do you expect for 20bucks Would no buy again Would go for the more traditional fridges 
2 0 Not that great It s not that bad of a product considering how cheap it is However I have three definite criticisms One it isn t very stable When your doing dips it s pretty wobbly Two the pull up bar isn t far enough away from the crossbars so if your body swings at all during your pull ups it s really easy to bash your shins on the lower crossbar And three the push up bars are totally usless You can not do push ups on them with out hitting your head on the lower cross bar 
2 0 At First were good but Now not good At first they kept the water out of my eyes and were comfortable But after 3 or 4 times they had some water leakage I use them for recreational swimming at the YMCA But am already looking for another swim goggle I hope you post this even though I gave them a poor rating Thank you Eileen 
2 0 Six Pieces Usually Puzzle Mats come in 6 Pieces You can visit Walmart and they have same type ther 
1 0 Not enough info I wanted to order the puzzle sports mats but they do not tell you how many you get with your order I also tried the company web site and could not fine info there 
1 0 Don t Order it I ordered several of these tables as Christmas presents two of five arrived broken Both of the broken tables had broken slats in the top and one also had a broken bracket on one of the legs The tops are made out of a brittle plastic spend more money and order a table with a metal top 
1 0 You d better shop around These provide good protection in case of falls while inline skating However I ve had them less than a year and the material is starting to tear and fall apart I am not sure how long they will last I purchased these to replace a similar set I had for 9 years which were worn but not falling apart Now I wish I had not thown the old ones away 
1 0 Lost Product I never received the product and had a terrible experience with Amazon trying to get my money back 
1 0 LaFuma Walkid Backpakc Child Carrier The product that was delivered was defective The harness system was manufactured with insufficient webbing I contacted LaFuma and was informed that this was a recurring problem They sent me a mailing label to return the product free of charge and will send me a replacement in mid April when the new model comes out The manufacturer was responsive however I was out of pocket 13 00 for a shipping box that I purchased for the mailing In fairness Amazon should reimburse me for this 13 00 expense I did not expect to receive a defective product 
1 0 Cheap plastic connectors The ski rack is attached to the Thule bars by a plastic connector which must be spread almost to the breaking point to wrap around the bar The old 724 had metal connectors Making them plastic is insane These connectors will break over time Additionally a thief could simple steal your skis by grabbing the rack and twisting it thereby breaking the plastic connectors 
1 0 Don t waste your money It was flat after one night of sleeping We had to blow it up to capacity every night and would be sleeping on the ground by morning Also be aware that you need an AC outlet to pump it up it s NOT for camping 
1 0 worst product I bought one outside Amazon and charged it 15 hours My mini Maglite had more power The battery never worked Don t waste your money Better pay a little more but for something that works 
2 0 Nice features poor battery life Easy to use in the configurations shown However 3 million candlepower doesn t do you much good when the battery needs recharging after no more than 15 20 minutes of use 
2 0 tether broke Is it squeeky Yes But I didn t mind What I DID mind was the fact that the tether which acts as a pully broke about a year into its use I didn t use it vigorously and I m only 160 lbs I d say avoid 
1 0 Shockingly Bad I loved it the first 2 months i had it With out notice the cable shredded I called and emailed and nobody at the company got back with me It seem that the inside of the wheel was rough and began tearing it The customer service is bad and so was the product 
2 0 Great workout poor craftmanship My husband bought this for me for Christmas after we both had looked at reviews and decided it was a great product I used it for 5 months with no problems other than the squeaky sound everyone talks about Then without warning the bolt securing the cable to the right pedal popped off When my husband called the company he was told that the parts including the pedal and cable were only guaranteed for 90 days and the frame for 3 years In other words there was nothing they would do about it When I called they told me that they could replace the entire stepper free of charge but I would have to pay shipping and handling That was today I m still awaiting a call back from the supervisor about the s h reimbursement This gave me a great workout so I was disappointed to find out it was defective enough to break after 5 months of use by a 120 lb woman and I only used it about 3x per week I m hoping that this was a fluke as only one other review in this set currently states the same problem and I m hoping the company has the decency to replace their defective product 
2 0 Steaming pile of plastic I would have given this product one star but I did get several months of use out of it before it literally melted down into a useless steaming pile of plastic After about two weeks of use the Electronic Mini Stepper started creaking and groaning like it could snap at any moment As previous reviewers have noted the thing actually starts smelling of burning oil plastic metal After two months of use the shocks on both pedals started leaking fluid Good thing I had a nice thick plastic mat underneath it I owned and used the Electronic Mini Stepper for all of four months using it five days per week 20 25 minutes per day before the cable secured around the pully wheel snapped loose of its moorings This probably occured because of the extra strain put on the cable due to decreased pressure in the defective leaking shocks I now own a twenty pound forty dollar door stop There s no reason other than ultra cheap construction that a 160 pound man should be able to destroy a piece of exercise equipment like this in four months During this time I used nothing but normal exercise practices smooth even steady steps nothing jarring Buyer beware on this one 
1 0 Did not work for me My first impression is that the unit is very rugged and nice looking Then I tried to use it I mostly bought it for the altimeter and thermometer In the first day of use I just ran out of patience and plan to return it Here s the problems I had with the Altitech2 1 Most of the time the buttons work fine but several times I pressed the mode button and the mode did not change 2 When setting Declination page 25 of the manual states that you can press SET RESET LIGHT to reverse the digits but as soon as you press the SET RESET LIGHT button the unit ends the calibration mode 3 The temperature was stuck at 87 5 degrees for about an hour after purchase Finally after cycling through the mode buttons the temperature instantly dropped to 81 5 degrees I held the unit in front of the AC vent in the car until the car was cooled down to 70 degrees I suspect the air coming out of the vent was actually cooler than 70 degrees The temperature display never budged from 81 5 degrees 4 I constructed a rudimentary chamber and placed the Altitech2 unit and a digital thermometer in the chamber The digital thermometer registered 78 degrees the Altitech2 registered 81 4 degrees I blasted hot air in the chamber with a hair dryer The digital thermometer quickly rose to 116 degrees and I turned the heat off The Altitech2 stayed at exactly 81 4 degrees After removing from the chamber the Altitech2 slowly increased to 94 degrees went down to 92 6 degrees and stayed there for a good 5 minutes Despite the room temperature being about 78 degrees 5 The compass will only stay on for 10 seconds then the display turns off to conserve battery This never seems to be long enough to get a good fix while using in reference to a map When the display shuts down you need to press the start button again to turn on the display Since this button is recessed you have to reposition your hand to press the button with your fingernail I had to This moves the compass in relation to the map again and is very frustrating to have to constantly have to press the start button I ll stick with my 19th century compass for now This unit might be worth keeping for me if the Altimeter is reliable but after all the other trouble I had I did not even mess with setting up the altimeter as I had lost confidence in the device 
1 0 It looked nice but held less than three minutes before coming apart The band that holds the foot came loose with the whole string after two minutes of light use I didn t even had the chance to kick with it I excepted better quality from Everlast too bad In addition the bands that hold the chin are designed such that it is difficult to tighten this thing on your shin 
1 0 Too Expensive for 2 3 4 Balls they call 3 I tried 50 60 sets from Regent who apparently also does Spalding Franklin and Sportcraft and only got a usable set by combining parts from 2 sets alternately one should check out manufacturer part replacement policies in advance including who pays Shipping costs Regent and Sportcraft had several handles with too few threads inviting breakage Franklin wood and threads were such that 1 mallet s threads stripped when tightening by hand and 1 had poor threads because the wood narrowed and flattened Some Sportcraft end caps rolled under and they claimed their 2 balls were 3 if they were rounding why don t they round their 3 5 16 balls as well Franklin s stakes had different tapers and about 1 16 different diameters On the personal preference front Sportscraft s handles are grooved Franklin s balls are and their wickets are narrow Regent s colors are dull Rated 1 Star because sets tend to be priced by the size of the equipment and this is too expensive for mislabeled 2 balls 
1 0 Rip off I bought one of the Brookstone mini exercise bikes when it was still priced at 99 00 on February 1 2007 based on two positive reviews that were posted at that time Initially I was impressed by the prompt delivery of the product but immediately discovered the bike was not factory assembled correctly Instead of a left and right hand crank arm my exercise bike has two right hand crank arms This may seem trivial until you realize that the cranks are suppose to be threaded in opposite directions to prevent the pedals from coming unscrewed during use I contacted Brookstone Customer Service to request a replacement part I needed two right hand pedals the evening I received the shipment I had to place follow up calls each week for six weeks until finally receiving the replacement pedal When at one point I mentioned simply returning the exercise bike the customer service rep indicated that approval would be needed from higher up the food chain because as I waited for the new part I d had the bike in my possession past the 30 day return policy With the new pedal finally in place I immediately tried out the bike and was disappointed though unfortunately not surprised that the overall construction feels very flimsy under foot The mini bike is quite noisy and so far I ve found no floor surface that keeps it reliably stable during use either on a rug or on linoleum As a result I have to back it up against a desk file cabinet or bookcase to use This product has been a huge disappointment and I would strongly encourage people interested in purchasing a small exercise bike to please not waste their money even at the reduced price on this product 
1 0 A Major Dissappointment I was looking forward to the arrival of this bike so much I thought it was going to be a great way to burn calories while doing just about anything But when I tried it I discovered 2 things First off your legs have to be at a 90 degree angle in order to pedal without it moving all over the place which means you have to have an adjustable office chair or put phone books on a normal one And when I finally get settled on it no matter how hard of a setting it s on it only burns about a calorie a minute This bike might be great for arm workouts because it doesn t move as much on the table and it can offer a lot of resistance though I only tried it for a few minutes but definitely not for your legs

1 0 DO NOT ORDER PRODUCT AND SERVICE NIGHTMARES I ordered this product for more than what its new price is on December 21 2006 as a Christmas present for my mother It didn t arrive until January 9th and it arrived damaged We sent it back for a refund On February 2nd this low rate item arrived at our doorstep again AFTER I checked several times by phone to make sure that my order was marked as a RETURN and not an EXCHANGE We decided to set it up and see if this one was better STILL DAMAGED in another area I have called The Sharper Image over ten times now over a span of 2 months I know their customer service number by heart and I even know their direct customer service number without having to go through the machine by heart call 1 888 344 5555 instead of 1 800 Their shipment is slow and their processing is painfully slow They ve given me 3 different order numbers without telling me so I couldn t get accurate information about my order online Beware of dealing with this company If you can go into a Sharper Image store somewhere take the thing out of its box to examine it and only then consider bringing this product into your house One good thing is that they do give you a full refund tax included At least that s what they told me by phone today By the way this should be called a Foldaway Strider not Elliptical It absolutely does not have the elliptical wheel or power that other more functional elliptical machines do 
1 0 Misleading product name not an elliptical I am a personal trainer and I was asked by a friend to check this elliptical strider out for them I was suspicious from the price thinking that it really couldn t be an elliptical machine but checked it out anyway As I suspected this is simply a glider similar to what was on infomercials years ago Except for the Tony Little TV glider most of those 20 or more gliders that were on the market are all gone There is a simple reason that true elliptical machines are so popular in health clubs and that there are NO gliders in health clubs With ellipticals and treadmills users lift their legs with each stride which of course is more like the natural motion of walking and running This of course engages many more muscles than the gliding or swinging machines of the past Also ellipticals have a flywheel to allow the user to add resistance while still keeping a smooth motion I ve read the other reviews of this machine and realize that certainly any movement is better compared to doing nothing But it is a question of time You could swing on one of these machines for hours and while it might be kind of fun for some people it will never come close to a true elliptical I m not promoting any one brand and I have no ax to grind except that it is somewhat annoying when companies like Sharper Image continue to intentionally mislead the public because they know it sells products The reason elliptical machines are called elliptical is that the user s foot goes through an elliptical path Gliders just swing back and forth like a pendulum If you don t believe me ask any trainer or exercise physiologist This is misleading marketing and no doubt they know they are using that name to cash in on the popularity of the real ellipticals My advice to my friend was to save a little more money and get an elliptical 
1 0 not worth the money I read the reviews below and then went into the Sharper Image to test the product myself There is NO resistance what so ever and I simply cannot immage getting a good workout from this product 
2 0 Not what I expected At first I was very happy with this stroller I love the big wheels the front one which swivels The cup holders are convenient for both parent and baby And the adjustable handle is awesome because I m short and I can push the stroller at a comfortable height Also it maneuvers very easily up and down curbs steers easily even with one hand everywhere from the mall museum park or on city streets One of the biggest drawbacks for me has been the reclining seat back There is a drawstring that you must adjust This requires two hands and can be difficult at times if the child is fussy or uncooperative Despite this I still loved the stroller until recently However after only two months of use my stroller will not lock It has actually folded up on my son while pushing it I now cannot even seem to lock it into the open position for use I have not found any levers to snap in place to hold it open And because the stroller folds outward not inwards like an umbrella stroller it actually pulls the childs body backwards when the locks give out This is very dangerous I am contacting the manufacturer about this defect 
1 0 Like putting a thick balloon on your head I have a small head and this was way too tight for me It pulled my hair and left me with a headache Plus it has a strong chemical smell that didn t go away after wearing in the pool I tried it 3 times thinking it might get better but gave up and threw away Spend a little more and get the fabric or silcon style instead 
2 0 missing parts Bad smell The important top hand bar is missing The thing smells like gear grease I can t tell if I like to use is because it s missing parts 
1 0 Poor quality and no service After unpacking and assembling the Ab Chair Deluxe I noticed it was cheaply constructed with poor quality fastners and metal components even at the price point sold The digital read out display lite up all 8 s and blanked regagardless of the written direction input or new batteries Every black end cap except two have fallen off due to poor fit I still use it extensively because the principal of crunching and stretching the abdominals is very effective Get a ab chair just NOT this one 
1 0 Buyer Beware I wish I could write a review of this product unfortunately I cannot because the vendor Verdent is dishonest You see Amazon requires all outside vendors to ship all orders within two business days Verdent Gifts thought they could just sidestep this little detail not ship my order for 9 days and feed me a line of BS on top of that Yes I called the vendor and he told me quote we are having a difficult time getting UPS to pick up our orders what a crock unless you are t paying your UPS shipping bills Anyway to make a long story short Amazon did try to help and is refunding my money after they tried to get Verdent gifts to make the refund Verdent refused so Amazon is picking up the tab and hopefully giving the boot to Verdent Gifts in the process Avoid a headache and hassle steer clear of these bums Verdent Gifts and thier dishonest practices 
2 0 Ab Chair I bought the chair for my mother She really wanted the chair so that she can start working out on it She loved it It looks very nice the size is alot bigger than what I thought it would be which is a good thing The only problem I have is that every time she uses it one of the screws comes out and the arm comes loose She is very disappointed with that because she s afraid to use it now I m not sure what can be done to rectify this problem but it something that needs to be taken care of Aside from that It took a very long time for the item to come in and I m very upset with the fact that we had to wait so long to receive it and now she can t really even use it 
2 0 Well Built Poor Directions Ab Lounge seems to be made of quality materials excluding sauna Belt import junk Direction manual is almost useless does not tell where certain parts go or how they are to be used You will need to look at TV commercials and possibly take a trip to your sports store to get an idea how this thing goes together Their web site is no help 
2 0 no heat in the right place only heats the palm of your hand fingers stay cold No elements in the fingers of the glove only heating element is in the palm of your hand Not worth the money 
1 0 keep you money your money could be well spent on something other than this not any better than a regular pair of gloves you can buy at wal mart 
1 0 Broke 3rd time out I wouldn t recommend this table Some of the plastic slats that unroll to form the table top have already broken and I ve only used this table on three camping trips Too bad because most of my other Coleman gear has held up really well 
1 0 This table is very flimsy and overpriced I don t think I have ever run across a more overpriced flimsy piece of camping gear and for this very poorly engineered and built table to actually come from Coleman was rather a shock The first time I opened the box containing this table was while setting up the camp site Too late the table was so delicate that the main parts that hold it together the leg anchors that support the equally flimsy and fragile aluminum cross pieces had been broken in the simple act of shipping I looked closer and these main supports were made of some incredibly cheap delicate plastic This thing wouldn t have lasted a day on a campsite even if it had survived shipping We placed the table in the campsite s trash dumper the next morning Buy a lower cost table from another company no need to even go to a higher priced unit since anything else would be better designed and constructed than this table 
2 0 Topps Does It One More Time Continuing their recent trend of crisp looking cards with nice borders and wonderful sub and chase sets Topps has done very well with their 2006 line up of cards The basic card design doesn t stray too far from their tried and true formula of having complete MLB stats for each player and a brief insightful look at each player These insights include quotes from players teammates stats from a particular time in the player s career nickname origins etc This is one thing that always set Topps apart from the pack The front design includes action shots of each player trimmed in a border that somewhat coincides with each team s colors The player s and team s name are trimmed in silver The back of the cards have the aforementioned stats and a nifty cartoon in the upper right hand corner with another brief insight into the player featured on the card With the collapse of Fleer MLB has begun working with Topps and Upper Deck in an attempt to draw collectors back to hobby of collecting and trading baseball cards according to Athlon Sports Baseball Preview One aspect of this joint venture is the distinguishing rookie card logo found on all rookie cards this season It will be used to remove any doubt on collectors part as to which card is the authentic rookie card of each player You ll find cards with that logo in this set from Topps Another fine addtion to this set is the Mantle Bonds homerun cards With the scandal surrounding Bonds these days his cards may not be worth hunting but Mantle s cards are a wonderful find when you open a pack Topps has also thrown in a few autographs and relics as usual but the real doozies here will be the autographs of all stars such as John Adams and Benjamin Franklin Topps has inserted cards in their set this season featuring the actual signatures of each of the signers of the Declaration of Independence I haven t been lucky enough to snag one of them yet but the basic Declaration cards are a nice addition to the set With historic sigs and Mantle cards Topps has proven that nothing is more American than baseball Chevrolet and apple pie A nice set to get 
1 0 Love Hate Really Hate I have been using a Polar s610 for some time When everything is working it is a wonderful device However it is difficult to keep it running smoothly For example when I upgrade to a new computer I go through hell getting the software to work again Polar customer service is useless Most recently I have been unable to upload data from the monitor to my PC via USB for months I do not believe I will be able cure the problem without PURCHASING new software + the software dose NOT include the USB connection software That is sold seperately Polar will not provide replacement software unless you purchase it on CD The rest of the world will provide software and upgrades to registered users online Bottom Line the product is pretty good However in terms of user friendly Polar is a total failure Sorry folks why not get a Garmin 305 I a 
1 0 Don t buy You will be disappointed This bagpack is ridiculously small Believe me it cannot even fit 1 college book The description did not say that it is for Elementary School kids Believe me THIS BAG IS FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KIDS YES IT IS THAT SMALL I m gave it as a present to my friends cousin who goes to the elementary school I am not kidding The photo is misleading It is unbelievably small If you buy you ll see 
1 0 Description lacking The dimensions of this bookbag where not stated The bookbag is extremely smaller than the photo depicts I had to pay double shipping sending it back A big disappointment 
2 0 Fragile Three days after I put this on my keyring the two parts of the Highgear Smartlatch broke apart and I couldn t put them back together Then a week later the compass popped out of the case It s now in my tool drawer Perhaps only mine was this fragile 
1 0 Nice Idea Dumb Execution Highhgear is supposed to be in the outdoor and active gear business which one would assume involves some knowledge about how outdoor and active gear works So what do they do with this item They sell it with a ferrous metal split ring on the compass so that the thing will never point to north correctly as long as that ring is attached to the compass This leads to the problem noted by an earlier reviewer I bought this model to replace a previous version no clock the battery had run down and there was no way to replace it Which brings up another point Why an alkaline battery instead of lithium Dumb But even more strange is that the earlier version had non ferrous split rings and the compass worked fine so Highgear is not even maintaining the QC they had a year or two ago Also at least one of the buttons on my sample is pretty dodgy S1 by which you set time date etc does not work well Sometims it ignores input and other times it registers two hits with one press All together this product is the result of very poor design and manufacturing specifications and or very poor quality control Please don t expect to much functionality from this product 
1 0 I got this for the compass only i cant say anything for the other things but the compass does not work at all North is always changing and if you move it to see if north will remain the same north does does not i was looking for a simple compass keychain this is small and a keychain but a compass that works it is not 
1 0 No instructions I enjoy the elliptical i really do especially when I first received the box It had NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL how da heck do you expect someone to put this together 
1 0 Caveat Emptor No where does Amazon say in their description that this comes completely disassembled I have purchased other exercise equipment and you usually have to put on a handle bar or stabilizer So here it sits in it s box like a big paper weight in the middle of my floor Amazon is not paying for return shipping and I can not afford to spend half the amount of the purchase to return it Buy your big purchases from someone who has a unconditional paid return policy This may be a good machine but I will never find out 
1 0 Junk This is completely junk Don t buy it It colapsed in a 5 mph wind with out the sides attached 
2 0 Came broken When the scope arrived it came slightly cracked on the end you look through which wasn t a good start Then when i looked through there was no magnification just small red crosshairs If you are looking for a functioning scope DO NOT BUY THIS SCOPE But if ur looking to decorate your gun then this looks pretty cool on it 
1 0 Airsplat s Service Stinks avoid them I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son s airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat a shortened M 4 airsoft rifle s weaver rail Yes I could go out and find screws the proper length but I though I d make Airsplat do their job So after several e mails with the service department they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size Wrong The diameter of the new screws is so big they won t fit through the mounting bracket on the sight Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws Take a pass on Airsplat The sight seems ok for the price 
1 0 A Warning This product is ineffective The snorkel gets stuck either open so that water pours in while you re trying to breathe or stuck shut so you cannot take a breath of air while under water It s is very distressing when you re out in deep water snorkelling and the breathing tube fails to perform I often take in mouthfuls of water or worse suck for a breath of air and get nothing It is therefore useless I stopped using the tube as it is more trouble than good I bought two sets one for my partner and one for myself and they both fail to perform The mask on one set broke after 2 months the metal pin became dislodged and the tightening clips on the flippers frequently fall off while trying to tighten them to your feet The bag s zippers rusted not long after use given that most people snorkel in salt water you think they would have considered rust proofing the metal Overall the quality of these not so cheap kits are embarrassingly bad We both felt awkward snorkeling with them and sometimes I even felt they were hazardous We tossed these products and bought Cressi brand gear It has changed our underwater experience 
1 0 TOO HEAVY I wanted a high quality yoga mat that was long in length because I am a tall person I thought I had picked the perfect mat when I ordered this one I didn t have a problem with the length although it smelled that new plastic stench but I did have a problem with the weight This mat is HEAVY I knew it would be HEAVY when I purchased it and being a person in somewhat good shape I didn t think I would mind it but I didn t realize that it would be cumbersome The last straw that made me want to return it was when I was in a yoga class sweating and I began to slip on the mat If I am going to spend this amount of money on a yoga mat I don t want any problems To Amazon s credit I was able to return it and they paid for postage If I would have had to pay for the return postage myself it would have cost a lot because of how HEAVY it is but I would have paid it anyway that should tell you how much I didn t like it I am now looking for a long mat but lighter and toxic free I want something that will be biodegradable The problem now is there are so many mats available too many choices can be just as frustrating as too few 
2 0 Flakey I ve been using this mat for a little over a month for a 5 day a week practice At first I was thrilled but at the end of my 2nd class I noticed it was looking a little rough where I placed my feet It s continued to get worse and worse 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice and scatter on the floor around me Since I practice in a studio it s particularly annoying I practice with the sticky side down and the jute side up The jute side is the side that flakes Practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem but then the mat inchworms across the floor 
1 0 it s not the product but the merchant I just came accross this ad and thought to say something about the price of this item Please be aware that many other merchants sell this product for about half the price 
1 0 Workout on it twice a week it broke by the 3rd week bought this machine based on the reviews on Amazon It was okay at first I workout regularly with tapes outdoors activities and started using the machine twice a week By the 3rd week it started to make noises as if the wheel was rubbing against the plastic cover of the chain We tried to see if we can fix it but it didn t work I can t use it anymore mainly because the wheel is not rotating properly and rubber plastic is rubbing against each other somewhere You get what you paid for Now I m looking to invest in something more sturdy If you exercise once every month this is the machine for you 
1 0 big mistake This was a horrible product it was difficult to manuever and control It did nothing but immediately cause my arms shoulders and wrists to hurt I felt absolutely nothing at all in the target area my stomach Not even a little It was boring and pointless to bother This machine was a waste of time to ship back and forth and I do not recomend it to anyone who wants to work their stomach muscles Its a misleading product and very uncomfortable on the back also It hurt my spine to bend in the way they said I felt the machine digging into my spine I was so focused on the pain and the pain in my arms I could not continue for more than 5 minutes at a time Dont waste your time buying this product Its expensive and not worth it 
1 0 DON T WASTE YOUR MONEY This is another fly by night workout machine that looks great in the pictures and on videos but when you take it out of the box you realize that it is poorly and cheaply constructed I own a ton of excerise equipment and this is the only piece of equipment I have had to return I have purchased so much on the internet this past year and have been very happy with all of my products That is until I purchased this Ab Doer which was a TOTAL waste of time and money The tension on the arms of the unit is way too flimsy and loose The foam around the arms is also very cheap foam in fact my daughter used it once and there was already a small chunk of foam that came off the unit She does not even have long nails The bars that connect the seat to the bottom of the unit stay in place ok when your on it but they do not lock in the base when your not on it so if you pick up the unit to move it it collapses What s really bad is the so called back massager that is located on the main area of the center stem It does nothing but hurt your back and is worthless Even adjusting the bar for different heights is a joke It s a screw not a quick disconnect This is one of those products that make a ton of money by mass advertising but will quickly fad out fast unless there are MAJOR changes done to this unit It s sad when you watch some of those excercise info mercials that have all these people with great bodies that may be fooling you into believing that the products really work I couldn t find any reviews on these until now I will never again buy a product without reading reviews from the customer themselves We are the best source of honesty on the market Save your money or just do some sit ups and leg raises if you can They work SOOOOO MUCH BETTER than this product If you do some searching you will see some of the BAD reviews about this product that are coming in Based on Amazon s review rules I cannot list where I read them from Have a Great day everyone 
1 0 john abdo xtreme Well the arm rests will not stay in their holsters they flop around so you cannot get maximum impact from the machine i am totaly disappointed with this machine 
1 0 Don t waste your money Even if the electronic ball return had been included with this product as described I still would have returned the item The mat was very lightweight with many folds in it so it wasn t really suitable for the intended purpose 
2 0 Don t Buy This I bought this stroller and attempted to use it but one of the wheels kept going flat every morning I had to order another inner tube Then on the third day of trying to use this stroller the front wheel completely bent What a piece of garbage I only had one child in the stroller and the wheel was fastened correctly and all I was doing was trying to push the stroller up a small curb The other thing I didn t like about this stroller is that there is nowhere to hang put a diaper bag I sent this stroller back and bought a MacLaren double stroller 
2 0 Not the best heart rate monitor watch This is my third heart rate monitor I purchased this one because the battery died in my last HR watch I thought I could replace the battery but when I tried to replace it I broke it Oh well Anyway I purchased the Reebok Fitness HR Watch because it was on sale 50 off retail I couldn t find any reviews on it so I rolled the dice With my two previous HR watches it was pretty intuitive as to how to set and operate them without reading the instructions With the Reebok HR watch I had to read the instructions a couple of times After a couple of training sessions I began to feel comfortable on how to operate it and use its settings There are a few PROS on the Reebok HR watch 1 The chest heart rate strap will work with Precor cardio machines with heart rate monitors 2 The chest heart rate strap s battery is easily replaced I don t know about the watch 3 It has a lot of features that you ll find in higher priced HR watches Now the CONS 1 The heart rate reading is much too small if you re near sighted or need reading glasses 2 The shape of the crystal cover causes a glare under certain indoor and outdoor lighting so it s difficult to read the small heart rate reading In conclusion because the heart rate reading is too small and there s a glare I can t read the watch unless I slow down steady my arm and position my arm at a certain angle to deflect the glare Because of this I m disappointed with this watch If you ve got good eyesight you can add 1 star 
2 0 Unimpressed compared with other brands I have used a few different brands of Stevia liquid This is defiantly a sub par version as evidenced by the additions of glycerin and water in the product I would recommend using a different brand that has neither 
1 0 poor sugar substitute The suggested 1 to 2 drops doesn t sweeten and more makes coffee bitter 
1 0 Just don t work I bought this ear plugs are uncomfortable my ears hurt and in the first use just fall down I just prefered the ones who are made of pvc are better 
2 0 Everlast Medicine ball review The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived it was very scuffed up and scratched It also had a flat spot on it I returned it for a replacement which I got and it was in the same condition Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before I would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb medicine ball and the same outcome Definitly not happy with it 
2 0 Good for a week Bought this for my son He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week Then the wheels broke He wasn t doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable 
2 0 I really regret buying this I went to a sports store and all they carried were sportline pedometers I really didn t know which one to buy so I bought this one because it was more attractive than the bright yellow one and it was more expensive than the 340 so I thought it was better somehow Even though it says that it measures steps accurately on the packaging it doesn t actually display it It only uses it to calculate the distance that you ve walked I was very annoyed by this because the 340 does track and display the number of steps walked I got over it but the thing keeps resetting in my pocket I m just going to buy another pedometer One that displays the steps walked and has a cover 
2 0 Low quality camping stove The idea behind this propane stove and grill is fantastic You have a regular burner and a small grill at the same time The execution however leaves a lot to be desired Fit and finish in this product are extremely poor Out of the box paint was flaking and various pieces required adjustments with pliers just to make them fit The igniter mechanism on my unit worked very well for the grill part but very badly for the burner part The grill plate is aluminum with some kind of coating that already had scratches when I received the unit Reading other reviews I can t help but wonder if there are two different grills sold under the same stock keeping unit number the bad kind and the good kind If so unfortunately mine is of the bad variety 
2 0 Great idea poor design I had a lot of fun with this stove while it lasted but it did not last long about six months I live on a sailboat and I used it every day maybe someone who goes camping once a year will have a better experience The burner did not simmer well the flame kept creeping back up but the grill worked great until the stove itself died It seems to have a design flaw the regulator has an unusually narrow diameter tube and the propane tubes inside the stove are flimsy and wobbly I called Century and they said this is the way the stove is supposed to be Hmmmm I did not think it would last long but I liked it so much that when it died I tried out another one This one was immediately defective and I took it back Neither Century nor Coleman seems to make a tough propane stove any more Camp Chef may be a better though much more expensive choice for a person who does a lot of camping 
1 0 Defective poorly made potentially unsafe product It is unfortunate to have to write such a review but the product received was so beyond unacceptable that I am compelled to do so The unit was received new but the hinges were already rusted the closure hasp broken poorly designed and executed the grille had sloppily attached and bent locating pins and virtually all the lid edges were razor sharp Made in China this stove demonstrates no attention to detail quality control or materials I own several other brands of camping stoves and am dismayed that this unit was ever allowed out of the factory much less off the design table Further the design of the unit is poor and execution is extremely poor if not downright unacceptable in major ways As this unit was new in the box I can only assume that it represents the low level of quality and lack of respect the US manufacturer has for customers Save yourself cut hands and returns buy another brand 
1 0 Brick tennis balls Beware These balls are extremely hard They are like hitting bricks I bought them because of the name Penn I bought a new ball machine and bought two buckets of Penn pressureless balls After 30 minutes of play they broke my racket my hand hurt and my arm hurt I am now trying to return these bricks I mean balls to SwingSomeWhere I ll let you know how it goes

1 0 Do yourself a favor and buy a GPS instead I agree with previous reviewer Dave57 I WOULD NEVER BUY A SUUNTO AGAIN Worst than Dave I simply got caught in heavy rain during a hike and my Vector was full of water couldn t even tell the time I send it to Suunto Finland for repair and they say that it leaked from the housing and kindly offered a repair for 140 Euros 
1 0 shocking I had a Suunto for 10 months The face scratched VERY easily which was disappointing However the worst thing is after swimming in a pool that I could stand up in the watch FILLED with water and died On returning to Suunto they refused to fix it under warrantee because swimming is not covered They say the forces created by swimming are to much for this watch and it was never designed for this purpose despite the sales literature saying it is water proof to 100m I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER SUUNTO PRODUCT Whatsmore the shop I bought it from say they have lots returned for the same reason and non of them were fixed under warranty either It is also very difficult to use and you cannot hear the alarm at all

1 0 waste of money like most weight loss product these were a wate of money on the plus side they did a fair job a suppressing my appitite but I did not lose even an ounce No side effects either no head aches or shakes 
2 0 Junk Plain and Simple I bought this for my 8 year old to practice hitting Although well built it is poorly designed The place where the Hit a Way attaches is not logical and causes interference with the legs The cables on the Hit a Way are so stiff that the ball loses velocity quickly and does not wrap and come back around for the 2nd hit You might get one or two hits in before it is unusable A GIANT waste of money The only reason I give it 2 stars is the construction is solid 
1 0 What a dissapointment I recently purchased a Bean round zafu and I find it didnt live up to the claims in the least This zafu came shipped to me with over a pound less filling than advertised wich wouldnt matter if the cover wasnt made so big to hold much more hulls than it came with First thing I thought after pulling this cushion out of the box was this thing seems nothing like the pictures It s saggy and about half the height of all the images I ve seen of it Not to mention once you sit on it you feel all the hulls displace to give you only about 2 inches or less of lift I weigh about 160 pounds so I dont think that weight is the problem I m very dissapointed in this product The reason I bought this was not only for the reasonable price but I thought Bean seemed like a quality company I payed 40 for this wich does seem reasonable It does SEEM reasonable That is till you tack on the extra 11 or 12 bucks for a pound of organic hulls to fill it to the level it was advertised at I bought this Product from The Comfort Store Their probably the only internet company along with Bean of course I will never buy from again Unless I learn more forgiveness meditating on my rolled up towel waiting for my extra hulls 
1 0 Shipping more than product The shipping for this product cost more than the product itself It was packaged in a medium sized box and would have fit easily into a small padded envelope 
2 0 Great idea if it only worked I was thrilled to find that a reasonably priced rechargeable bike light exists I avoid throw away battery items like some avoid taxes We have too much toxic stuff in our landfills already an I refuse to add to the this insanity However to my great disappointment the internal workings of the light seem to burn out before ever recharging properly and before the the green light goes on to indicate a full charge Then the light ceases to function at all Amazon was great in sending a replacement TWO times yet the same problem persisted I checked with BELL too to make sure I wasn t doing something wrong and I wasn t This light is a great idea albeit with some definate glitches that need to be worked out by Bell The two stars are for the great idea 
1 0 For the Love of God Don t Bother to get this thing Really folks spend the money on a gym membership go outside and play with your dog play soccer with your kids or spend time in the afternoons working in the yard or the house after warming up with slow movements and a power walk Be reasonable Just remain aware of how your body feels know your limits i e knees back elbows and don t over do it It takes time to find your own approach to weight figure management You can do it your own way You don t need this thing AT ALL This product will NOT bring you any satisfaction you ll only feel stupid for getting sucked into the infomercial and wasting time when you could ve been watching Saturday morning cartoons In the infomercial it shows you all the machines you have to use at the gym Well there s a reason people use them becuase their tried and true Those machines well worth the cost of a membership guide the user in producing precision movements THey cost thousands of dollars and are built to be absolutely sturdy You re better off using machines at the gym hey don t forget the YMCA varying your cardio between outdoor and indoor exercise and throwing in consistant measures of Pilates and Yoga if you want to change your body This is just another stupid product we ve seen them come and go for years It won t be around long folks Disappoint will occur and the probabilty that injury will occur is well within the realm of possibility 
1 0 total crap the radio has no presets so you have to manually click through radio stations til you find the one you want the clips breaks off easily the pedometer just stops working mine stopped working after 1 month i returned for a new one which stopped working in 2 weeks don t bother buying cause it won t last long enough to be worth it 
1 0 The clip is very flimsey reset button too sensitive The Sportline 353 Talking Pedometer works ok as a pedometer and as an FM radio but it has 2 issues The Good The talking part of this pedometer can be turned off or on It is nice to hear when you are rolling along 9000 steps The FM radio is very elementary but functional There is no dial to tune You push a button and it rolls to the next station There is a volume control on the earphones The pedometer uses AAA batteries that can be purchased anywhere The Bad The pedometer was constantly slipping off my waistband and bouncing on the floor It didn t break but it was very annoying Several times it popped off w o me knowing and I left it in a restaurant or in a friend s car The Ugly If I accidentally bumped the reset button on the kitchen counter or on the arm of a chair the pedometer lost the day s count and went back to zero The pedometer does not have a memory feature so the tally is lost This would sometimes happen 2 3 times a day Very frustrating The clip broke after about 3 months so I retired it I bought a Omron HJ112 Premium Pedometer and have been very pleased with it It has a teather so if the clip slips off my waistband the pedometer dangles it does not bounce on the floor It has a 7 day memory feature and automatically resets at midnight It has a clock It uses a button battery It does not have a radio and it doesn t talk but it works and works well The Sportline would be good if it had a teather a clip that didn t break so easily and a reset button that could not be pushed accidentally 
1 0 My SG4 did not work No response from Skycaddie I emailed Skycaddie contact us the day after I bought a SG4 to ask for help I have received no response in 3 weeks I played today with it for the first time A guy I was playing with today also had a SG4 Neither of us could get a distance reading despite the indicator saying we had a strong GPS signal All we got was 999 or complete blanks He has played with it four times and said it worked ok twice and didn t work twice It looks GREAT on TV It is a real pity that my unit didn t work today I plan on returning it this week 
1 0 What a piece of garbage I have had two of these units SG2 and an SG4 and all I can say is don t believe the hype While the units are an unbelievable concept on TV and work NOTE WHEN THEY WORK great the lack of computer knowledge and the unbelievably awful customer service provided by Skygolf is by itself sufficient reason to choose another product in this arena Just to relay my experience and keep in mind I have 15 years in the high technology industry to leverage open when attempting to set up these units it took almost six hours on the phone to set up my original SG2 and even then it was constantly destabilizing my system software ie endless restarts When the SG2 was stolen at an event I purchased an SG4 to obtain the next generation of the product Since the January 2 2007 purchase date I have been on the phone with no less than eight customer service representatives for a total amount of time approaching ten hours including one Saturday morning prior to a Sunday event when they requested I attend a conference call regarding my unit at 5AM NO that is not a typing error on my part California time I have purchased received Skygolf sent me one unit from their headquarters out of desperation and returned three SG4s at various points in the process to ensure that the units were not damaged I have attempted to download the software and access the website via the SG4 on five different computers and EVERY SINGLE SERVICE PACK OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS 2000 Even after I forwarded Skygolf the computer log to show them the problem software error neither the software developers nor the customer service department could figure out what was wrong and the units were never operational At this point all I can say is what a complete and utter waste of time this process has been and how frustrating to echo another review it is to deal with the people behind the product No product no matter how fabulous in concept is worth this level of incompetence during set up and operation Good luck to you if you purchase the product I hope your experience is better than mine 
1 0 Wish I had read these reviews before I bought All this air pump does is let out what little air may be in your tyres I can t think of anything else I have ever bought that was as completely useless as this It is a toy pretending to be an air pump The nonfunctional lever on the top mentioned by other reviewers indicates that it was designed as a toy I m just happy I was trying to put air in my tyres in the driveway not out on a trail In the past I have bought a number of Bell products including motorcycle helmets I now shudder to think what might have happened if I had put one of them to the test 
1 0 Pure garbage This pump comes with a hose and needle for blowing up balls But there s no way to attach it securely to the pump The instructions are completely useless Does not deserve the one star 
1 0 THE WORST PUMP EVER IT is amazing to me how something like this could even be approved for the market This pump is 100 JUNK SO Bad that I am finding my self actually writing a review about a bicycle pump The instructions were a disaster and why would I need to look at instructions for a pump Well that is because it does not work and I mean does not work at all The lever on the side is a total gimmick does nothing as the previous review states Save your money here Do NOT buy this pump 
1 0 Let me down I carried this pump on my bike because is small light and looks good But when I had a flat the pump was usless and left me stranded on the highway This is one of several Bell products I ve been dissatisfied with 
1 0 Ok if you re tire is already inflated I got this because it was cheap but since it doesn t work and I have to get another I didn t really save any money The lever on top that looks like the lever on other hand pumps actually does nothing It s completely fake nothing inside moves when you move it and it certainly does not help grab on to the valve It s just something you can play with while you re waiting for someone with a decent pump to come help you I did just manage to get air into a fully inflated tire With a flat tire I couldn t keep a solid enough contact with the valve to get air in 
1 0 Save your money don t buy this During the time I was considering buying this model I happen to see the same thing at a local department store so I bought it I couldn t wait to take it back I wasn t impressed with the cheap plastic The pump came with the adapter pre set for a Schrader valve my tires are Presta The blister pack says it can be used for both and indicates all one has to do is to take off the round end remove and reverse the plastic adapter re insert and then screw on the cap tight as per the label Seemed simple enough so I took off the cap took out the plastic insert I noticed it is in 2 parts reversed and re inserted and then replaced the cap When I put the end on the Presta valve and then pressed down on the thumb part I couldn t help but notice that the plastic would not grab the valve but was loose So I decided to change back to the Schrader type and use my adapter valve maybe this would be a tighter fit So I took off the cap and tried to remove the insert but only one part of it came out the parts separated I could not remove the bottom half I was not going to force it out I put the parts back together re inserted them into the blister pack and returned it No thanks I gave this product 1 star only because of the way this review process is set up it doesn t deserve any star or any consideration for purchase 
1 0 Battery warming doesn t work The gloves we got do not get warmer with use of the batter 
2 0 Neat idea but uncomfortable Scary looking but inpractical The wooden handle it too thick unless you already have extra large hands already if your fists are that big you don t need claws The talon shaped blades are sharp but can t dig in they can only scratch They even have a hard time cutting through multiple layers of cardboard Nice wall decor but nothing more 
2 0 Way too big I bought this watch because I wanted an altimeter but needed to return it because of its size It is HUGE looked like I had a clock on my wrist Take into consideration 
2 0 Bad experience with purchasing X Lander on Amazon Two Amazon s statements about this product were absolutely misleading 1 Usually ships in 24 hours It actually took 1 week to ship it 2 When I finally received the package it turned out that the watch didn t have leather band The band was made of artificial materials nylon and rubber or something like that I will have to return it

1 0 Don t waste your money It s not very accurate because the sleep function sometimes takes some time to wake up But what was worse was that after I owned it for two weeks the thing stopped working It was never dropped or damaged in anyway it just stopped The display just faded away and wouldn t work again even with a new battery This one was such a waste of money I ll definately buy a different brand next time 
1 0 Good idea poor execution I have used pedometers for a few years I was initially impressed with this pedometer BUT then I discovered the 360 I received did not always wake and keep track of steps The 360 I received did not always count steps even when already awake The sleep wake feature is bogus it does not work and it makes this pedometer a loser I would not be surprised if other users of this pedometer have simply overlooked the fact that their steps might not be getting counted because the pedometer is stuck in sleep Heartrate Monitors the company I bought it from was not responsive when I asked for guidance I bought another pedometer from a different dealer the Sportline 345 It s my second 345 need I say more 
1 0 Inaccurate I walk pretty much the same distance daily and this device gave me wildly different readings for the same route I could see being off by even 100 steps for variations in stride etc But off by thousands of steps Hardly worth it 
2 0 Decent Buy Initially a very good buy however after only 3 days of very light use I had an internal piston head on one of the guns break while the gun was resting on a desk and I was in another room For the look and price its a good buy but you get what you pay for in this case 
2 0 Bad guns read story Im new to airsoft and wanted a couple pistols to screw around with friends with and found these i probably just expected too much out of them being about 8 a gun you shouldnt expect too much Well me and a friend began shooting at each other and the BBs curved largely to the left Not just a little but one of them made a near diagonal line to the left They re really light although expected with cheap guns and have a really clumsy feel They at least look kind of neat and the plastic orange tip is mainly hidden by that attached compensator looks only I later bought a 30 gun at meijer and it shoots nearly twice as far and shoots straight These are just useful if you have too many people and not enough guns Dont expect to win with these unless you re fighting other people with the same thing And on another note my friend pushed down the magazine release and it snapped off He wasnt pressing hard it was just weak defective plastic 
1 0 just don t buy save ur money Well all i can say is don t buy it it does not shoot very well or hard just get a better gun 
2 0 GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE 5 STARS UPDATE THE OLD REVIEW see below WAS FOR DIXIEKIP THE ONLY REASON IT S STILL TWO STARS IS BECAUSE I CAN T FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHANGE IT OLD VEGAS CHIPS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT HELPFUL IN THIS MATTER EVEN THOUGH I DIDN T ACTUALLY ORDER THE CARDS FROM THEM I WOULD ORDER FROM THEM ANY DAY OF THE WEEK NOW JUST BASED ON THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IN AN ISSUE THAT WASN T EVEN THEIRS MY APOLOGIES TO OLD VEGAS CHIPS IN THIS MATTER I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM AND IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO CHANGE THE STARS PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THESE CARDS GO WITH OLD VEGAS CHIPS NOT SOME OTHER DEALER JIM I ordered these particular plastic cards because in my opinion they are much cooler than the paisley ones that are also offered I immediately ordered them yet when my package arrived yesterday in a timely manner I will give them that I opened to find the ugly paisley cards looking me in the face I have not yet contacted the seller to see what options I have but this is going to leave me either two options 1 return them and wait longer for them or 2 suck it up and get stuck with the ugly cards I will repost once I have spoken to them 
2 0 Everlast Medicine ball review The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived it was very scuffed up and scratched It also had a flat spot on it I returned it for a replacement which I got and it was in the same condition Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before I would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb medicine ball and the same outcome Definitly not happy with it 
2 0 Cute But Low Quality The gloves looked great online but in actually the quality of the product was not what I imagined The gloves lacked padding on the inner hand and palm Instead it had a thin sheet of nylon The closure was not secure enough so I was able to slip my hand out even with it fastened on On the bright side the gloves were pretty and I had no problems returning the product back to Amazon com 
1 0 not that great The leather pleather outting of the glove is soo thin that if you plan on doing any sparring plan on it tearing I used them once and tearing occured during padwork and sparring I would recomend getting a glove with a thick leather so you know that it will last through the beatings 
1 0 Unsure I ordered it for Christmas but I didn t get it until December 27th It s now in a closet waiting for another gift giving occassion 
2 0 What s going on with Leatherman s these days I am quite dissatisfied with the quality of the new Leatherman tools I purchased two Leatherman Squirt S4 s and the Leatherman Micra from Amazon recently and was surprised to see that all of them arrived scratched up like it was used before Some scratches were wide and deep enough to cause cuts on your hands when you use the tool I purchased the Leatherman Charge XTi from another vendor which was also not of high quality that Leatherman was once known for I have owned the original Leatherman Wave since it first came out and have had no problems with it It seems like the newer models are being mass produced without some type of quality control Or maybe someone is repackaging used Leatherman tools and selling them as new I will not be buying anymore Leatherman tools until they start making high quality multitools as they were once known for If you want to buy one of these either for yourself or as a gift I would suggest you go to a store and look at it before you buy Make sure there are no scratches or smeared letterings or any other problems The ones I recieved were definitely not good enough to give as gifts 
1 0 Not A Good Choice I regret buying this gun It broke within four days of buying it We did just enough shooting to adjust the hop up for accuracy and it fired great It was really accurate The gun was made of really cheap plastic and the trigger stopped working Right now we re waiting for a RMA on it I would recommend paying a little extra to buy a more durable gun I bought another gun that cost 55 and that one is made of much better plastic and feels much more durable 
1 0 Airsplat Service Stinks avoid them I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son s airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat a shortened M 4 airsoft rifle s weaver rail Yes I could go out and find screws the proper length but I though I d make Airsplat do their job So after several e mails with the service department they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size Wrong The diameter of the new screws is so big they won t fit through the mounting bracket on the sight Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws Take a pass on Airsplat The sight seems ok for the price 
1 0 Very Disappointed The specs on the bag stated that there were mesh panels for drainage and ventilation Well if there any I sure couldn t find them Not a good quality in a bag used to place wet equipment The bag also has an awful smell that will hopefully dissipate over time I m very sorry that I purchased this bag 
1 0 Do not buy This is a useless product I do not exercise much and I do not even get a burn from this machine The DVD is boring and the instructor speaks in a mono tone It looks like it is low budget 
1 0 Worst product Unfortunately I purchased this product Thermometer and compass are not at all working Thermometer always shows 65 F and Compass allways shows Err I highly recommend NOT to buy this on 
2 0 Works well unless you re under water Bought mine sometime around Christmas and took it into the water for the first time on a trip to St Thomas last week It died within 10 minutes of being in the water It was never more than 5 down while I was snorkeling While I never tested the compass or thermometer against known accurate ones it seemed to work well enough for my purposes Just keep it dry 
2 0 Not easy to use can t recommend Overall not terribly happy with this units user interface and design The spartan instructions require pressing buttons referred to in the manual as SW1 SW2 etc but they are not labeled as such on the device You toggle through modes that are abreviated on the display with just 2 letters to tell you what they are TR CH what Just an unfreindly interface all around Look for a better unit 
1 0 Terrible too bad I can t rate it zero stars Don t buy this compass if you need to know any direction If you know about where the sun sets you will be more accurate than this compass It is impossible to use in the field A waste of money inaccurate to the max impossible to maintain it level etc Just junk They should give them away 
2 0 Neat small and decent functionality questionable quality Had to return the first one due to non functioning thermo and fault compass Small is nice for hanging it on keys or pack but the same smallness makes it a little hard to opwerate one handed I also have a Brunton compass that fits the hajnd much nicer We ll see how long the 2nd one lasts 
1 0 Don t do it One of the handles would not go in the digital unit did not work and had no instructions on how to work it and when I would use the unit the little keeper ring on the side would cut into the side of the housing and cause some drag or friction They told me to send it back for a replacement and I m STILL WAITING and WAITING So I Would rate this unit a 0 How do I get my monies back 
1 0 CRAP I bought this gun thinking it looked like a cool and fun gun I go through 1 freakin war with it and the thing wont cock any more and pieces are falling off it I know how to treat guns but this is ridiculous and for the record im not a kid im just to lazy to sign up 
2 0 Its alright I ordered this gun because it was such a great deal When it arrived i took it out of the box and the barrel was cracked a big crack nothing a little gorrila glue can t fix though Also the accuracy isn t consistent it is always about 4 or 5 inches off from about 20 30 feet I had to put the back part of the laser off the sliding mechanism to get it to be accurate otherwise it was 3 feet high The pellet also starts to curve after 15 feet or so too So this gun was a good deal but isn t the best quality gun i ve had You have to load it from the top of the gun which means taking off the laser putting in the bbs and putting on the laser again The magazine doesn t even come off It still has decent speed and isn t crap it s just bad It was worth 15 bucks though 
1 0 Uncomfortable even while sitting I purchased these Teva s for Kayaking These are the most uncomfortable sandals I have ever worn They are even painful while sitting in a boat I do not recommend them 
2 0 totally inaccurate The only thing on this that works well is the watch the altimeter thermometer and compass even after being calibrated give incorrect readings the stopwatch is difficult to start and stop and reseting it to zero takes some patience it looks cool and the time is correct but it is definitely not a reliable device in the least 
1 0 Wobbly As others have mentioned already I found this thing to be very very wobbly I never ever felt comfortable riding with my almost 4 year old son on this thing It just felt too unstable I returned this after only a few days 
2 0 Good design badly executed I bought the trailer to take my granddaughter with me when I rode on vacation When I assembled the trailer the chain was twisted I bought a chain tool to break the chain and straighten it Then the chain kept falling off the front chainwheel The sprocket was badly bent I bought a large screwdriver to straighten the chainwheel By the time I got it all working my vacation was over By the time I see my granddaughter again she ll have her own bike I m going to try to find someone with a small child to give the trailer to 
2 0 the position of the child wasn t straight it was almost tip over I rated 2 stars because the joint from the kid s bike to the parent bike was too lose and the child was almost falling off from the bike I also contact the company who made this product and they told me that they will send another part that will make the child s bike straight but I never recived the part I am very disappointment about because the safety of my kid is first and they didn t help me I hope that in some future purchase the company can assist me on my needs Thank you 
1 0 doesn t work on laptops Just to warn you this product does not come with a USB cable and it doesn t work with most laptops I have had You need a desktop for this product and the website for the product is not very helpful at all The ecaddy is great but the caddylink is next to worthless 
2 0  i ordered this item and reding the other review i expected good results however i havent seen any results at all i have to say theres just no subistute for old fashioned exercise 
1 0 Disappointed Front wheel was badly bent right out of the box and needed to be replaced Box had no signs of damage so it looks like it was put into the box this way I replaced the front rim at my own expense and assembled the bike only to find it also needed a tuneup The gear shifters were not adjusted properly and shifting would often result in the chain jumping back and forth I didn t want to pay for a tuneup and hope there wouldn t be other expenses down the road to deal with so I decided to return the bike and buy something local I can get a look at before we buy 
2 0 you get what you pay for My complaints about this stand 1 By far the worst thing about this stand is it leans too far forward There s not enough counter weight so a slight pull on the bike will cause the thing to tip If it wasn t for this I might say well I guess it s alright for 79 dollars 2 The clamp isn t strong enough to hold the bike securely If you clamp to seat post for example it will rotate on the seat post 3 The thing that tightens the clamp is made of plastic I m assuming it will break fairly quickly 4 The rotator is made of plastic I haven t tried rotating on the seat post where it would put any weight on the rotator but I doubt it will hold it In my opinion this product should not be sold If you just want to clean your bike on a stand it s fine but for anything that requires any force like taking the pedals or crank arms off forget about it 
1 0 Inconsistent quality I ordered this item thinking it was a pair When I received it and realized my error I ordered another of the exact same item When I got it I found that it was half an inch wider than the first a different shade of color and the pile seemed thinner and flattened Now I m ordering a pair from a different company Hopefully the higher price indicates better quality 
1 0 Not worth a penny I bought four of these and all of them broke within the first or second use making them completely unusable 
2 0 Not 3 Liters I measured the reservoir and got only 2 liters plus a cup 
2 0 HMMMM I try to use this but don t work good The best option is play in a court 
1 0 Bad Investment This is not what I expected it to be at all It did not come with a pole and it did not improve my skills If at all it made my wrist hurt more 
1 0 Jarani The advertising was not clear as to what your getting it does not include the stand for the ball assembly 
2 0 Not Good I tried this on the day I got it to see how it felt The velcro is so strong that when I tried to take it off the velcro ripped the top layer of the material right off I would not advise buying this I was dissappointed in the quality of this product 
1 0 Fold n Go The best ever If you don t have on buy one But buy the bag 
1 0 STOP Do not purchase this item Like you I m sure I saw this machine on television mistake number one and then ordered it online without ever trying it first This machine is a joke If you cannot get your legs over your head then MAYBE this machine is for you But this is NOT for serious users who stretch everyday I can do more with my 5 stretch band from Target than I can with this big heavy space taking piece of junk The resistance is zero and just laughable over all Save yourself the money and frustration buy a lightweight no hassle stretch band 
1 0 Airsplat service stinks avoid them I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son s airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift The screws were too short to attach it to his airsoft rifle s weaver rail Yes I could go out and find screws the proper length but I though I d make Airsplat do their job So after several e mails with the service department they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size Wrong The diameter of the new screws is so big they won t fit through the mounting bracket on the sight Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws Why by a gun from these guys If it arrives broken you pay to ship it back Want a refund You pay a 15 restocking fee Take a pass on Airsplat 
1 0 Fine light but poor make did not survive battery change Its light was okay although it could not quite cover an entire page of a book The main problem is it s too shabby to survive a battery change so you will get just 40 hours of use before it runs out Also finding 3V Lithium batteries is not easy 
1 0 Not 10 pound weights 5 pound weights Not Amazon s fault but Everlast s Even the box promises 2 10 pound weights but it is in fact a 10 pound set of 2 5 pound weights This is not a bargain but fairly expensive Quality is just ok Not flimsy or dangerous but not what I wanted either 
2 0 Sand Causes Bulkiness The description doesnt mention it but the weights are sand filled bags When using all 5 of them at the same time the weight is very bulky and uncomfortable 
2 0 eh I got this because it was cheap at K Mart and thank goodness I can return it The ball is really small I love how they omit the size from all of their information I didn t pump it up with the pump so I don t know how good that is I used an air compressor the other equipment isn t too bad but I was really getting this for the ball which just so happens to be a piece of poopola I wouldn t suggest getting this 
2 0 Bad for Beginners good for intermediate players I had a different experience than the other reviewer I would also consider myself a beginner golfer but the Medicus has not worked for me It might work if you have never picked up a golf club and you are learning for the first time but if you are trying to improve your swing it doesn t help You develop a way to swing the club without breaking the hinge but it is still a bad swing I heard from a golf pro that it is good if you already have a solid swing and you are trying to improve it but not good for beginners 
1 0 Be careful They are spare parting out of the new boxes They say it will be delivered in its original carton but they don t mention they have been opening up the boxes and swapping out the new console boxes with returned ones The box came with two bright yellow strapping bands and certainly looked sealed when I signed for it at delivery Later that evening when I cut the bands I was surprised when the top lifted open the staples on the carton top were not attached and the box was already open I cut the box open and started laying the parts out when I pulled the carton containing the console out the box end flap was open and smashed up where it had been put into the styrofoam every thing else looked undisturbed I pulled the console out of the box and could see that it must have been returned the bubble wrap was torn and the six screws to mount it were missing I called schwinn and they are going to send me the six missing screws and I called Amazon to tell them what was going on I would have sent it back but I had cut the box open and don t think there is any way I could cram it all back together Just look the box over carefully when they deliver it the staples on the top were carefully centered between the holes where the longer staples that originally sealed the box were removed They sure fooled me into accepting a opened box 
1 0 I wish I knew how to rate this The console that came with mine is broken so I haven t been able to use it I have been told by the customer support people Schwinn Bowflex since the middle of February that a replacement is on it s way even the supervisor said this to me Hear that ticking Yeah that s the clock on my warranty it is just going away without ever even getting a chance to try the thing out Am I happy NO Maybe I ll write another review when I get my new console and I can tell you how wonderful this piece of equipment is until then I m one heck of a ticked off customer Save yourself the headache and just go to the gym 
1 0 Where do I start I notice several other reviews mentioning faulty defective consoles arriving Well I received my first Schwinn 438 about a month ago I put it all together and realized they did not ship an AC adapter with the machine I contacted Amazon they told me to either send the machine back for another or contact the manufacturer I contacted the manufacturer on Saturday they were closed I contacted them the following Monday and they told me the item was on back order but I could buy a compatible adapter from Radio Shack I did I came home excited to use my elliptical unfortunately the console did nothing but beep at me very frustrating I contacted the manufacturer again they advised me that the console was on backorder and would not be delivered for at least 2 months They recommended I send the unit back to Amazon for a replacement I did so I spent the better part of a night taking the thing apart and repackaging it quite a job trying to squeeze it back in the box About 3 weeks later I received my second elliptical Same faulty console problem after spending another couple of hours putting the thing together Contacted Amazon and demanded a full refund and return They did pick the unit up and did not make me take it all apart this time but I am still awaiting a full refund I have since purchased a Vision Fitness elliptical from a real fitness shop in my area I am extremely happy with the unit although it was a few hundred bucks more This was one horrific experience with Amazon I wouldn t recommend buying this product seems like they are shipping out defective units 
1 0 Cheap Cheap Cheap This pedometer is so cheap it isn t worth the 1 88 pricetag Unless you want to cheat yourself this is not the pedomter for you You gain 20 steps just putting it on your pants then walking to my co workers desk five steps from mine I gained about 30 steps By the end of my work day I had apparently walked 11 953 steps that I mostly acquired turning in my office chair and I won t even go on to say how many steps you gain driving in your car On top of all this the company wouldn t refund me on the pedometers I ordered for my co workers 
2 0 You get What you Pay For This pedometer is not very reliable It is very inaccurate in its count It counts a step at the littlest movement I put it on counted out a hundred steps and checked it and it said 260 Just moving it to look at it recorded more steps If you want something really accurate spend more money 
1 0 Missed A Step I am the captain of a walking team and I purchased several of these pedometers as incentives for my team members I wore my pedometer before giving the rest out just to test it On the very first day the pedometer lost count of my steps on three occasions and by the end of the day one of the buttons had fallen off I do not feel comfortable giving these pedometers to my walkers I should have invested a little more money per item to get the best value for my money 
1 0 pedometer I brought this pedometers for my church s walking program and we are not happy with them My pedometer keeps falling off with a leach Also the biggest thing is that it keeps restting to zero If I had to buy over again I would not buy this pedometer 
1 0 has very low light switch is broken after only a couple of uses more of a novelty than a useful flashlight need to shake it a lot to get a charge and even then the emitted light is too low to be useful the switch has also broken and we havent even used the flashlight more than a couple times would not recommend buying this flashlight trying to return mine 
1 0 No light whatsoever I should have read the previous review before ordering because this product did not work at all The on off button did not work click The light produced a very faint light less than a cell phone emits Don t buy this product there are better flashlights out there 
1 0 Disappointed I purchased 5 of these for Christmas presents I tried one out in order to demonstrate at the proper time Number 1 This was dead in the box So were numbers 2 3 and 4 I didn t bother with number 5 Every flashlight was shaken more than what the measly instructions suggested Speaking of instructions they tell you to make certain the light is off before attempting to charge There is a rubber button that doesm t click or sound in anyway do there is no way of telling what the on or off position is Real junk says hummer made in China and all five are going back

1 0 Dissatisfied The item was broken when I received it Also It is not what the picture looked liked Very poorly made 
2 0 not as durable as advertised This front fender worked well for a few days until the attachment mechanism thing snapped when I went over a medium sized rock 
2 0 80 pointless This Fender is WAY to short on a 17 frame with 26 wheels 80 of the frame were it suppossed to stop the mud and bricks hitting fails badly the rear part is abuot 5 + to short to stop most of the mud I got it to stop bricks damaging my Giant bike frame and failed 2 stars for build of it and the 20 of mud it actualy stops DO NOT buy this is you plan it for the same reason i got it for 
1 0 Broke first time This might work fine if you use a bike rack to transport your bike but I laid it in the back of my pickup and it snapped Not very durable 
2 0 What do you do when it is windy When it is windy the top of a canopy like this needs to be removed to prevent wind damage No information is available on how long it takes to do this I called D C America and they say they are only distributors and buy it overseas and have no idea and have no manuals available online for me to look at They said it takes a few hours to assemble or disassemble One retailer I spoke with Fogdog guesses it would need to be disassembled to remove the top but he admitted they have not tried assembling it So it appears from what these two sources said that every time a wind storm comes up it would require half a day to disassemble it then reassemble it not something I care to do Are there any owners out there that can answer this question Can the frame be left up and only the top covering removed If so how long would it take to remove the top covering Is it easy to do It is a nice looking unit but unfortunately the sellers cannot answer the most basic question for an item like this Thanks 
1 0 This Knife Is Dangerous The accessories that come along with this nice are great albeit somewhat impractical who s going to use a slingshot anyway but the thing that stands out most about this knife is the plastic handle Survival knives with hollow handles can go either way as far as usefulness and quality but this handle has a cheap brittle feel to it that suggests easy breakage It s not too hard to conceive that the blade could break off from the handle under enough stress which makes this blade a dangerous one to use Do not buy this knife or any other knife with a hollow plastic handle 
1 0 Useless The motion sensor wouldn t turn it on It does not maintain calibration Cold weather numbs it I m tossing it out 
1 0 Don t Risk It This product never worked buttons were defective it wouldn t stay on it wouldn t calibrate The seller Sky Box USA wouldn t exchange or refund because I was outside of the 30 day window this was a Christmas present and a very disappointing one at that You ll want to look elsewhere for technology that should be as reliable as a Casio watch 
1 0 Poor compass Don t count on this compass or you will get lost It is not the least bit accurate 
1 0 AVOID HOT IMPORT TOYS First the directions on assembling this product were in impossible to understand CHINGLISH 2nd the gun broke immediately upon use Hot import toys never answers their phone and never returns calls THEY WILL NOT HELP YOU Don t throw your money away on this one 
2 0 Convenient if your PC s security isn t important The IR link for the Polar hear monitors is great It allows you to transfer data 2 ways from your PC you can download your exercise data and also change the settings for the watch from the computer This is great because it means no scrolling through abbreviations on the watch with the tiny buttons The biggest problem with the IR link is the driver that needs to be installed on your computer For whatever reason Polar decided not to pay Bill Gates to get the software recognized as being compatible with Microsoft When installing the driver from the included CD warnings and error messages pop up to discourage you from proceeding which will compromise all security and firewall features that you might have There is no updated version available for download from the internet I went ahead and installed the driver but since doing so the computer has not been functioning properly and I ve been getting those send error report don t send error report pop ups from Windows Polar denies responsibility and insists that their driver is fine for use I m no computer expert so I don t know for sure but I don t believe them 
1 0 Don t buy it seriously I m pretty good at getting devices up and running but this thing is a complete mess They don t have the software figured out and the instructions for trying to fix it when it s not working are preposterously complicated Note that it comes with no directions of any kind In fact it arrives with an unlabeled mini disc with no indication of what it s for what it is how to use it whether everyone needs it or anything else Nothing but the blank disc Note that this device failing to work is a Frequently Asked Question on the Polar web site and they have a list of about thirty things you re supposed to check most of which they don t explain as far as what it is you re checking FOR In other words they say Check the whatever setting but they don t tell you anything about what that setting should be or what might be wrong with it Most of the instructions are outdated don t apply to current version of Windows or don t reflect current versions of their own software Mine will be going back the first thing from Amazon I have ever had to return 
1 0 one armed exercise I received my Valeo Ocelot training glove still waiting for the other Bubble pack had only one glove in it Amazon HELP has no concept of partial shipment 
1 0 bad balls These balls are horrible they don t bounce like regular balls worse yet once they come up from the ground it does not come up straight it goes to the sides most of the time 
1 0 The book never arrive to my hands Well today Feb 25 of 2007 the book still don t arrive 
1 0 Horrible These ping pong balls were a waste of money None of them bounce correctly They either bounce off to the side or the only bounce a couple of inches They are also really soft and make a terrible sound when you play with them The seam is evident on all of them 
1 0 Painful I bought this ab roller after my chiropractor told me that I needed to strengthen my abs without straining my neck The neck support that it comes with does not support the neck or head in any way but forces all of the weight of the head onto the uppermost vertebrae of the neck Ouch I would strongly recommend AGAINST this purchase Not only does it not work properly but the foam pads were stained upon arrival Gross I will try another model 
2 0 KEYS PRO TRAINER AB ROLLER IT MAY BE A GOOD PIECE OF EQUIPMENT BUT IT S TOO BIG IT S BIG BECAUSE YOU CAN LEAN ON IT AND DO LEG LIFTS ETC BUT ALL I WANTED TO DO WERE CRUNCHES IT WAS HARD TO PUT TOGETHER ONLY BECAUSE THE SCREWS WOULD NOT FIT INTO THE SLOTS I ALMOST BROKE MY FINGERS I GAVE IT AWAY AND BOUGHT A SMALLER ROLLER THAT WORKS BETTER FOR ME 
1 0 Piece of c p I can t believe they sell such a piece of c p After inserted the 9V battery I just pushed the button to start shuffling one time and I heard a cracking noise right away One piece of the mechanism fell off and I could hear it when shaking the box Of course the shuffler was broken Wished I could have read the first comment before buying that piece of c p in some store 
1 0 Piece O Crappo This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really really hate This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler 1 Pet Dog s Chew Toy 2 Door Stop 3 Play Street Hockey 4 Stress Release Stomping Toy 5 Mother in law Birthday Gift 6 Modern Art for Coffee Table 7 Nerf Ball Target Practice 8 Condom Dispenser Kind of think about it this is a great toy Have fun PS If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler you might like it 
1 0 junk I wouldn t recommend this shuffler to anyone It shuffles more from one side than the other When through shuffling on the left side the right side is only half through The cards will jam in the tray stopping the rest of the cards from coming down The switch just works part time you have to stop and restart several times 
1 0 flimsy sticks brittle net I bought this for my four year old for Christmas The net was broken on the second use when my four year old lightly banged it on our car bumper A week later his friend also four broke one of the sticks when taking a shot with the feather weight plastic puck that comes with the set Don t waste your money Even for little kids it s probably worth it to just go ahead and buy real equipment that will last 
1 0 DO NOT BUY THIS RAMP it really deserves a 0 rating non skid surface is a joke it is slick as glass tripod dog could not get any traction with single hind leg golden slipped off side and hurt her leg learn from my mistake there is NOTHING positive to say about this product 
2 0 old model The present model is not the newest available and it has the disadvantage of hurting the nose by prolonged use The newest presentation has solved this problem 
1 0 The worst machette I have ever owned To call this a bad machette would be to generous It is more accurately described as a machette shaped object As other have noted the blade is thin too flexible easily rusts and fails to hold an edge The handle is poorly made and mine had sharp edges where the handle halves were joined If you use it without wearing gloves this tool will do more dammage to your hand than to the target vegetation Th sheath material is 1 step above paper Technically it will hold the machette on your belt But if you draw the machette with anything other than utmost care you will cut the sheath I can t believe a company with a valuable name like Coleman would put their brand on this embarassing piece of garbage 
1 0 It looks useful but only from a distance This tool will not take an edge either with a grinder or a file It is very flexible so that the energy of a blow goes into flexing the blade rather than cutting stems which has undesirable consequences for your hand If you are looking for a useful tool keep looking 
1 0 Useless These Coleman machetes are essentially useless They are so lightweight and flexible I don t know what they intended them to be used for They will cut some weeds but they won t cut through brush or any woody plants thicker than maybe 1 2 inch I have used a few of these as they are the most commonly available at the hardware stores where I live They also rust badly You re much better off with an Ontario Knife machete or another better machete 
2 0 Net reduces tramp size We were very disappointed with this style trampoline enclosure As it only attaches to 4 of the eight legs it essentially reduces your round trampoline to a much smaller square We were constantly trying to find ways to pull it away from the jumping area as it sort of caves in We finally gave up and purchased a new one that attaches on the OUTSIDE of the poles that attach to all eight legs 
1 0 watch how you shop I was looking for a trampoline and I kept looking around for the encloser trampolines I purchased the 13 foot trampoline encloser but I didn t realize that the trampoline came separate I have the encloser kit witch I spent 70 00 on and no trampoline When I looked on the internet I never saw that the tramponine was separate and it wasn t clearly explained that it was just the encloser part I also found out that the size of the trampone is not standard therefore in order to utilize the encloser kit I have to spend another 110 00 for shipping on top of the shipping it cost me for the cover and the encloser kit I am really upset that this is costing a large amount of money just because they didn t specifically say that the encloser kit needed the trampoline Bevery careful it is not every day that you go out and buy a trampoline and the encloser kits are totaly separate I am very disapointed 
2 0 too hard for little ones These noisemakers are too big and hard for my one year old she bonks herself with them My toddler and preschooler are not particularly interested in them They make fairly interesting noises but are awkward to hold and shake and are somewhat heavy for their size No one really plays with them much I would not recommend them 
1 0 Don t buy this product if you plan on using it long term more tha a year 1 Calories shown during a workout are about 1 5 to 2 times actual I do have the right weight entered in my user profile 2 Machine broke right after warranty ran out No manual No reasonable support I paid 850 including shipping It is now sitting in my bedroom in a state of partial disassembly Nothing about fixing this is intuitive Some of the nuts and screws are so tightly put on you cannot budge them I am going to throw this junk out and buy a non schwinn elliptical that has a better warranty and real servicabilty Customer support at 1 800 864 1270 is practically useless Save you rmoney Buy something else 
1 0 BEWARE I loved the machine until it broke THERE S NO FRIGGIN TECHNICAL SUPPORT OR REPAIR OPTIONS from Schwinn They don t care 
1 0 Awful Experience Do Not Recommend We received this product for Christmas in 2005 and within two weeks the console broke We contacted Schwinn immediately and was told we would receive a replacement console It is now May 1st and the console we need is still on backorder 5 MONTHS It is absolutely ridiciulous I call each week and I get the same response Unfortunately we should have contacted Amazon within the 30 day period to get reconciliation from Amazon Lesson learned there The product when it was working was fine But the pain since then is not worth it I do not recommend this product 
1 0 Overhyped Dangerous We bought this trainer over 4 monhs ago from a local fitness store From the beginning the heart rate programs never worked properly I train using a Heart Rate Monitor so I can follow my heart rate during excercise If we tried to use the Schwinn s 418 s HR programs it read anywhere from 40 to 60 BPM too low What that meant is that the machine kept on increasing the resistance thinking my wife or myself were cruising along at a nice 99 BPM when we were going aerobic at over 150 Not only is that dangerous especially for someone who never trained before but it made 30 of the machines functions unusable Add a display that s hard to read controls that are anything but logical and this unit is a loser no matter what Consumer Reports says On top of that spare parts took forever to get delivered and when they arrived the machine still malfunctioned The only thing good out of our experiance was the sales person who worked with us to exchange the Schwinn for a better trainer from another company Bottom line stay away from the Schwinn 418 there s a reason Schwinn only put a sx month warranty on labor and electronics they knew this machine is worthless don t you find out the hard way 
2 0 Warning Broken after 350 miles a post mortem After 350 miles of moderate usage 6 5MPH average at fairly low resistance for 40 minutes daily a piece of metal snapped on one of the arms rendering the trainer inoperable Unfortunately this was considered a wear item and was not warrantied by the manufacturer since the elliptical was used very lightly perhaps 20 miles max during the first year of purchase warranty period I put the majority of mileage on the machine over the past four months and while it was great for burning calories I never really felt that it was a quality piece of equipment It appears that the manufacturer knows what parts of the frame are likely to break first and conveniently labels these wear items thus making repair expensive and difficult this is in spite of the fact that the piece that broke was a non moving load bearing support piece Seems a little fishy to me Throughout the life of the machine I was constantly tightening bolts to fix the popping and banging sounds that occurred after moderate use and observed that the wheels would often attempt to jump out of the tracks with heavier use After about 70 miles I noted that the wheels were leaving large greyish streaks in the tracks from where they were wearing down against imperfections in the track surface I believe this was also partly due to too much play in the interaction of the wheels and tracks allowing the wheels to jump the tracks a little which each revolution This machine does not feel very sturdy and throughout the last month of its very short life gave me a creepy sense of impending doom whenever I used it somehow I knew it was about to break and unfortunately it did My hunch was real enough that I began shopping for a replacement several weeks ago Please shop around I would not recommend this machine for people looking for a moderate to high intensity workout but it may be fine for slower walking or jogging paced routines that place less stress on the machine s mechanical components If you are an infrequent user this model may be OK but if you plan on using it every day I would recommend that you keep on looking Note that my machine was a 428P which at the time of purchase differed from the 418 primarily in the computer and heart rate monitoring The frame is identical in the 418 and 428P which appears to be no longer sold Since the problems with my machine were directly related to body construction they are appropriate for a review of the 418 Unless the manufacturer has made major improvements the problems I experienced are likely to still occur Visual inspection of the pictures here leads me to believe that no major changes have been made to the frame construction 
1 0 Customer Service really SUCKS with this company I just bought this through Amazon and then put it together pretty quickly Packaging was lousy as others have already mentioned and 3 pieces were either missing or broken so I had to call for them First customer service rep was ok but the next day I found the pedal crank making a sound and called back but the next rep claimed that I put the pedals on wrong and refused to exchange the main part containing the gears I held up the phone to the machine so he could hear it and he acknowledged hearing the noise but said I would have to open up the unit and identify the broken or loose piece on my own The unit came w that part already sealed so I don t know how they can expect me to spend my time playing maintenance technician on their product Although the product appears to be engineered well any company that s not willing to correct their mistakes deserves a negative rating 
1 0 Schwinn Fitness 212 The first Schwinn Fitness 212 that was sent never arrived because it was damaged in transit The second one arrived but does not work After calling technical assistance and being instructed to re examine the contacts which I did it still does not work This is absolutely useless They will have to do something 
2 0 No instruction manual My bike did not come with an instruction manual This seems to be a recurring problem with this company 
2 0 What is the lengh of the bars The only reason why I am NOT buying this product is because the description doesn t give the lengh How stupid I am sure I am not the only one to turn this great product down Come on think a little and tell us how long it is 
2 0 Not the easiest This stopwatch has an amazing array of functions but is difficult to use sometimes it behaves erratically and starts timing up instead of counting down or starts all over again when the countdown is only half done Don t know if it s really misbehaving or it s just on some obscure other function when I think I set it for countdown Operating manual is available online pdf and it s several pages long 
2 0 not so great I was hoping to get a water bottle that was leak proof and would not sweat I got neither It is pretty but that is about it 
1 0 Great Rebound Sadly Poor Quality This would be a great rebounder if it were not so cheaply made One month after happily using it a spring broke then another It is one of the least expensive models out there and I guess there is a reason for that Best to save your money and buy a more expensive model 
1 0 I don t happy with this Product I not recomend to buy I thougth that de signal is powered to rise 16 miles but it s not real And the comunication is good only in open staces like one in front of the other Anything that is in middle of the recievers cause interference or bad comunications 
2 0 Mororola I previously owned and used the 5 mi version to communicate with my wife while I am going to and from the school bus stop for the kids From the bus stop the 5 mi unit was iffy I purchased the 16 Mi units thinking the little extra power and range would make for better receive at the bus stop It was worse We received no signal whatsoever not a peep Don t buy this unit Save your money and buy the 5 mi unit 
2 0 Forget about 16 miles Just did a A B comparison between the SX800R 16 mile range and the Midland GXT 450 10 or 12 mile range Neither radio came anywhere near the effective range advertised The Midland lost communcation after 1 2 of a mile apart in the woods I then tried both radios on a flat open road At 2 9 miles apart neither radio could pick up it s counterpart It wasn t until we hit the 1 8 mile mark that the Motorola picked up some static from the other Motorola Still nothing from the Midland At approx 1 5 miles apart the motorola worked fine I gave up with the Midland The reason I did not give the Motorola a 1 star rating was because I like the weather band feature Bottom line is that unless you are in an airplane with no obstructions at all or curvature of the earth to worry about forget about getting anywhere near the advertised range A good rule of thumb is if you can see the other person then you are in range 
2 0 Moms and Dads GET THIS Moms and dads this toy is off the faheezie It is so much fu 
1 0 i don t understand my daughter would love a trampoline and i would love to buy her one but i don t know which one to get her the airzone 8 trampoline seems perfect but i also read the reviews for the airzone 13 trampoline which got terrible reviews i don t know what to believe can anybody help 
1 0 Is it my tampoline or is it just THIS trampoline I bought this exact one maybe a year ago About 2 months later it just collapses Set up is not the onlt thing that is hard actully trying to get a high jump is VERY difficult This is a little kids toy but most little kids don t just like baby bounces do they I would not recommend this trampoline to ANYBODY 
2 0 seems like a clever design but ultimately not very effective at least for me I was attracted to the Thermoskin product because it looked more comfortable than rigid splints for night wear and because Thermoskin advertised that it could be worn while sitting during the day The product indeed has a clever seeming design and it is well manufactured But ultimately this product seems to me to be too floppy and unstable to consistently stretch out the area of the foot that FEELS to me like it needs to be stretched I e the area along the sole of my foot that I can feel stretching out in the mornings when before getting out of bed and while sitting up in it I press my toes hard against a looped cord or towel that stretch significantly diminishes my pain upon standing up out of bed The velcro fastenings are indeed secure but the product s sock like sleeve and ankle cuff move around some even when the straps are cinched down as tight as they ll go as a result what feels like an appropriate stretch typically disappears in about five or ten minutes of normal movement and friction in bed while lying down Worse the angle created by pulling the strap up through the buckle in front of the lower leg just doesn t create the proper stretch instead it just makes my toes feel crampy I m going to try a rigid split which may be less comfortable But I believe that I need to be strapped into something that consistently maintains a proper angle which the Thermoskin product doesn t And I d rather incur some discomfort if it will actually help me get well than continue to use this not too uncomfortable but ineffective product from Thermoskin Perhaps others have had or will have better results with it than I have had and I have no medical training nor deep insight into the anatomy or physiology beyond what I ve read on the internet so consider this to be very much a layman s review I ve been suffering from plantar faciitis now for about four to five months with little improvement and I can t compare this product to others that I hope might be more effective But I was very disappointed in this product and regret having spent the money for it 
1 0 BAD WAS BILLED BY THE COMPANY AND THEY NEVER SENT IT HAD TO CHALLENGE THE COMPANY TO GET A CREDIT STILL WAITING FOR MY BILL TO SEE IF CREDIT WAS DONE 
1 0 Get another lubricant Most enthusiastic cyclists and bike shop clerks I talked to dislike this product I ve used it a number of times myself and I would never use it again especially after I discovered better products It turns your chain and drive train into a black mess Finish Line was better TriFlow was recommended by a number of cyclists 
2 0 Roller Derby skates Nice looking skates but very stiff boot and runs too small Don t like the stiffness of the boot Will not buy another RD product 
2 0 Don t Buy DO NOT BUY THIS MAGAZINE IT has been falsely advertised It does not hold 70 rds like it say but really holds only 30 It is the exact same magazine that comes with the High Power Steyr I bought two of these thinking they were 70 rounds and got them today I feel completly ripped off 
1 0 Please Do Not Buy We purchased this ATV for our son who turned 7 in February The first time he rode it the battery came loose and disconnected We fixed that within a few minutes and he continued riding it The next day my son came in after riding it and the throttle was loose I tried to tighten it but the Allen screw stripped and it would not tighten In addition the rear axle was bent from shipping We called service and they sent us a new throttle and tire rims not axles I did not even try to replace the throttle because I knew the Allen screw was not capable of tightening properly So I went to the local hardware store and purchased a stainless steel screw and was able to correct the problem The next day after he was riding it the steering was out of alignment so I twisted the handle bars and force them to straighten out I have to do this every time he rides the ATV The kids rode the ATV yesterday and I changed the speed key switch to the lower speed so my 4 year old daughter can ride it I have change the setting about five times and the switch broke It will no longer change to the slow setting It is either on fast mode or off Needless to say that my son does not want to ride on it because he thinks it will break every time he does 
1 0 Terrible I purchased two of these one for each of my sons I received them quickly and the packaging was in good shape When we took the first one out and tightened the handlebars and so on to get it ready to charge and ride everything seemed ok But the wires where you plug the charger into the 4 wheeler had to tightened and so did the place you turned the key to change speeds Got it charging we think Then we start on the second one We take it out and the charger is half melted Ok not too good but since we ordered two we thought we could just use the charger from the other one since they were the same Well when we plugged the charger to the second four wheeler after about 1 hour we went back out to the garage where it was charging and the charger we were using that had come with the first four wheeler had started to melt Nevermind that the house could have caught on fire So apparently someone had plugged the original charger in and that had already happened rather than someone just having packaged a defective charger Nice for someone to pack it back up and send it to me used and defective The first four wheeler turned on and ran ok for a few minutes so it must have been charged we went ahead and plugged it up as the instructions said as if we had received it brand new like we thought we had When it was used the first time it ran for a little over an hour with only the the light popping out of the front with every little bump And the light didn t work While trying to re attach the light we found several places that needed to be tightened up We can t re charge it though because the only good charger between the two was melted When we first took these out of the boxes they were small big enough for a 3 or 4 year old but they looked pretty sturdy much better than the plastic ones you get from Walmart and I paid close to the same amount They were difficult to get out of the packaging because there is a metal frame in the box that needed to be taken apart but that should have been good to protect during shipping However when you think about how you are going to get them back in the metal frame and box and shipping to send them back so someone can possibly see how bad the whole mess is you start to get cranky and tired I will admit that I haven t tried to return them I am quite worried that it will be as much trouble as these things have been already I am tempted though because I would like to let people know about this type of problem before they waste their money Imagine how dissapointed I was that right before Christmas I couldn t give the kids two of their bigger gifts because they were junk I am VERY upset So now several hundred dollars times two that could have bought very nice Christmas presents just flushed down the drain 
2 0 Quality is questionable keep looking Purchased three of these at Christmas Horns and lights did not work on but one another was missing keys when delivered luckily interchangable Within 5 days one four wheeler had a faulty throttle and quit the drive train fell out of the other with bolts going everywhere and the third had two bald tires which burst All this before the new year turned I contacted the company and they offered assistance by sending a box of parts in the mail However they offered no assistance on actual repair telling me that any man can do it with a few tools After several hours and a visit to the tire shop I fixed the bikes and they seem to work fine for now I obviously question the quality of the product and be aware return shipping is not an option b c these bikes are heavy and it would be cost prohibitive I would buy at a store where I could take back if needed Good luck 
1 0 I got screwed I ordered a product that showed a correct hinged replacement fixture for my Igloo cooler but when it arrived what showed up was a completely different product of lesser stature and quality I will never order from them again 
1 0 Buyer Beware This is not the same model I bought but it looks like it s built the same way I bought the InMotion Trampoline by Stamina and it was completely destroyed in under 3 months with regular use It didn t have springs but had elastic bands that ripped off When I called for warrantey information I had waited too long it is only guaranteed for 90 days I d give it negative stars but I have to rate it at least 1 star to get the review to show up 
2 0 Flakey I ve been using this mat for a little over a month for a 5 day a week practice At first I was thrilled but at the end of my 2nd class I noticed it was looking a little rough where I placed my feet It s continued to get worse and worse 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice and scatter on the floor around me Since I practice in a studio it s particularly annoying I practice with the sticky side down and the jute side up The jute side is the side that flakes Practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem but then the mat inchworms across the floor 
1 0 Way to Big This tricycle is simply way too big While the seat position is adjustable even when adjusted this thing is simply huge I imagine my 2 year old will have to double in leg length to be able to ride this monster By then he ll be 5 or 6 and be plenty big enough for a normal size bike so I just don t get the point of this Why in the world would someone build a trike so big I did like that the trike had large pneumatic tires and was fairly sturdy at least in terms of construction I suppose if you have a really large child that wants a trike instead of a bike maybe this monster would be OK I did have a few issues with design and or build quality though First the grips are fairly fragile plastic and I imagine will break after just a tumble or two Second the way the seat adjustment works is simply by sliding the seat clamp up and down the main support bar This would be OK but the seat clamp was too big for the support bar so I had to shim it with something to get it to stay in place Overall I m just not very impressed 
2 0 Great Looks and Potential But there s some buts This watch has a great look and much potential under the hood but I am having to return mine because of a defective altimeter it gives readings of up to 1000ft difference in altitude over the course of a few days in the same location during the same kind of weather I was also disappointed to find that the alarm was barely audible certainly not loud enough to get my attention if it is under my sleeve and the metal finish of the watch and band is extremely scratch prone I cannot recommend this watch for the price it sells for even if the altimeter worked correctly 
2 0 Product is solid but it rocks your house I hate to rate this item poorly but it didn t work well for me I installed it in my basement It s hooked between two joists that are right under my living room floor everytime I hit the heavy bag the living room sounds like someone is taking the place down Solid product for the right location 
2 0 Not pleased If your toes get hot it has a zipper for that useless Better off getting a rectangular if you need more legroom Its small Even the long one for a big guy I wouldnt use it for anything but the summer and you will most definatly need a good pad 
1 0 Pain in the butt to get into The bag is nice and everything but the zipper does not come down very far and makes the bag tough to get into Also my feet got cold because of the zippered area Not really sure I understand why it s there My feet never get warm usually cold I liek the material and the look Also seemed to keep me warm on a 60 deg night 
1 0 this bench is horrible its rickety the bar stands are right where you would want to grip the bar so your either way too wide or close on your grip with a constant battle to not pinch your hands when putting the wieght back up it is also very hard to adjust and often get stuck in incline position the stands get in your way again because it obstructs your range of motion not worth half the money it goes for 
1 0 Useless The compass is wholly unreliable The light button turns on in your bag thus draining the battery One of my worst Amazon purchases 
2 0 Could be improved I figured I d give these a shot since I ve heard good things about them First off though to put these tees in the ground you have to guide them with a finger otherwise they ll bend The control and distance differences for me seemed negligable compared to traditional wooden tees Also because of the sharp edges there are now some nice grooves on the sole of my new 905R I wouldn t recommend these tees if you have an expensive club you don t want dinged up unless those extra five yards really mean that much If you have a slower swing speed than I do though mine s about 105 110mph the grooves might not be an issue The only reason that I gave these even two stars is because they last forever When I was trying them out I was playing 18 holes minus the par 3 s without breaking a single tee Overall though they aren t really suited for me as is 
1 0 Poor design The HR monitor buttons got stuck in the down position on 1st use no use any more Also the shape of the back suggests it is designed for small wrists not at all comfortable on mine 
1 0 Careful This product was dificult to get a heart rate reading on unless you are walking would not give a heart rate even at low running speeds I used this product 4 times and both heart monitor buttons fell off 
1 0 Workout No Sitting Yes Don t waste your money unless your workout is sitting on the couch This monitor is sold as providing unobtrusive reading of your heart rate during your workout Since you have to stand still to get an accurate reading one has to wonder what type of workout Reebok did to substantiate this claim Get a strapped monitor for working out While this is a great idea the design doesn t match the intended purpose 
2 0 Garbage I only had the gazelle for one month when the noise began It started as a low annoying squeak but gradually the noise increased to the point where it is difficult to hear anything else Very annoying Also the calorie monitor is no where near accurate and the heart rate monitor is worse While it is a low impact machine it strains the ball of the foot because of the awkward angle of the pedals This is not the machine to get if you want any sort of a workout I am selling mine and buying an elliptical machine Do not waste your money 
1 0 former supra now an edge i bought a supra model gazelle at sears for 179 00 i thought it is so light and the shock absorbers made a good form of resistance well after a year the welds cracked for the shock absorber holders and are useless so i took them off the guy at sears where i bought the junkpiece says Ew man too bad Remember that the light tubuler construction while making for ease in transport also means ease in breakage Another machine meant for looking good in leotards sipping a sports drink and put it away if you start sweating if you dont the sweat will rust out the weld joints and who knows where you ll be catapulted to when the next thing on it goes maybe Maybe Tony little will give a surprise visit to you in the hospital 
2 0 You get what you pay for I bought this bag for a 7 day bivouac hunt in the North Dakota Badlands The average nightly temps were 40 50 F The bag was warm during these windy and chilly nights The bag compresses down reasonably small and is relatively light weight On my second night of the hunt I was zipping up the bag and the zipper broke right off of the bag It didn t just come off it literally broke There was no way to fix this in the back country I had my hunting buddy wrap some duct tape around me at night and then unwrap me like a giant tamalie every morning He spent big for his bag and of course had zero problems with it Oh well for the price and free shipping this isn t too bad of a deal just remember to bring plenty of duct tape with you 
1 0 Terrible Awful Brutal Not for Gym Regulars I receieved the Valeo padded straps and headed off to the gym after waiting a week for the product to arrive with shipping costs more than the cost of the straps which is rediculous I purchased them after I lost my previous pair of TKO Fitness straps after beating on them for about 4 years with no problems I put on the Valeo straps and did one pull up and one of the straps ripped in half right on the seam where the neoprene pad was sewn in My advice this product is poorly made and cheap A complete waste of money Go with something better and I would avoid the padded straps because the extra stitching weakens the strap fabric 
2 0 Not for serious sports I give it two stars for the Snorkel the mask and the fins are just JUNK The Mask The mask is a purge mask meaning it has a small disk that in theory lets you blow any excess water that enters the mask by just blowing The problem is this any speck of debris that gets caught between the disk or a simple malformation will cause water to constantly enter the mask AND if you happen to suck in via your nose you ll definately get a mask full of water The Fins The re a strap type fin which is good BUT they are so tight you can t wear any dive booties or dive socks which comes in quite handy if you re walking over coral rocks or any other sharp objects The biggest issue with the fins is the strap comes off while swimming This set was for my wife and hers came off I didn t think to much of it until mine did too You might say buy smaller fins but they run in a Size x to Size X so you can t buy any smaller The Snorkel is ok It s a little short but it works 
1 0 Uhhh Ummm Why should I pay 20 dollars for this when it comes free in a 5 dollar comic book 
1 0 Flimsy construction We would like to send this item back The construction was flimsy and the assembly is very cumbersome One of the pieces broke when it was being assembled The item was inexpensive but not worth the trouble to assemble 
1 0 Stiff Finger Holes painful I found these gloves to be OK for short rides but the stiffness of the material around the fingers made it painful I actually had to remove the glove from my right hand after a while because the pain was getting annoying Granted these are Mtn Biking gloves I don t understand why they would make them so stiff as to actually dig into the hand I ve tried to break them in but after a dozen or more rides they are still stiff 
1 0 Wrist Breaker I saw this design and thought it was a great idea After using it twice my wrists still hurt Now I know why I couldn t find this design at my local sporting goods store 
1 0 Still waiting since before Christmas I ordered the Pogo Roo Pogo Stick on Dec 6 2006 and I am still waiting for it to be shipped They just bumped it back another month to mid May for delivery and yet if you go to the web site it says it is in stock Best of luck to anyone who wants it within 6 months Very poor service 
1 0 Was not one in picture The pogo stick that I ordered was not the same one that was sent to me in he mail I have to say though that the return was easy The company had UPS come to my house and pick up the product and I was given a full refund immediatly The item was not great but customer service was good 
2 0 Learn English For one the gun doesnt shoot 380 fps Secondly they spelled enhanced enchanced They may have even done this on purpose seeing as you are taking a chance by buying the gun It s about 50 50 whether or not the gun comes to you in working condition 
1 0 No Hot Import Toys Do not buy this gun from Hot Import Toys That is my main point It took a very long time to get to me 8 days and when it did it was broken Not that it was shattered or it was jammed It just didn t work The piston seemed to be fine the motor seemed to be connected the gearbox seemed to be in tact the batter although a little hard to install was charged and the trigger was connected to the gear box I thought that I could return it for either a working gun or just a refund No I e mailed HIT over 7 times over the course of a couple weeks Nothing I got no response no notification nothing I continued e mailing them because they didn t even post a phone number to reach them at on their site HIT is the worst company to buy from ever From what i see and know this gun seems to be quite the MPEG I would have loved to use it to its fullest with my friends but unfortunately I bet you anyhting that HIT will decide to wait until the 30 day warranty has expired before they e mail me back telling me of how the warranty time is up and that they aren t allowed to exchange my product BUY FROM AIRSPLAT Trust me This is a good gun Fast accurate good looking Do not waste a month of your time waiting for it to arrive having to find its broke waiting for them to e mail you back and then have to live with a broken useless piece of potential Airsoft gun So trust me don t buy from Hot Import Toys 
1 0 GUN DEFECTIVE NO CUSTOMER SERVICE The gun did not work When we emailed Hot Import Toys they gave a suggestion on how to fix it That didn t work We emailed them asking for a new one No response We emailed them again asking for a paid return label since we paid over 20 in shipping and handling They told us to take it to Fed Ex and tell Fed Ex it was defective and that Fed Ex wouldn t charge shipping Fed Ex doesnt work like that We called this company numerous times left numerous messages no return calls We emailed Amazon and complained Got a response from Amazon and had to pay over 19 out of pocket to send it back to Hot Imports Amazon says they will credit our account I strongly suggest to take your business elsewhere No invoice was enclosed with the product My sons friend also ordered from this company and the gun did not work either 
1 0 DO NOT BUY MONKEYS COULD MAKE A BETTER GUN My friend and I both bought this gun We both charged it for the recommended time and it never worked I could throw BB s with my toes faster than this if the gun worked on a good day In ten minutes only 1 BB came out of the barrel and it just rolled out It doesn t work nuff said All it s good for now is to be my back scratcher Buy a pack of bendy straws to shoot BB s they will work better than this gun Thank you for your time Good nigh 
1 0 Don t even compare to ICS I have an ICS M4A1 I am basing my thoughts on this based on what some of the airsoft forums I am registered to have said on this I am registered on Arnies Airsoft Core and Airsoft Retreat 1 This gun is from a very very unreliable company Well so you have more chances of getting a bad gun than you do for getting a good one This is common knowledge among the airsoft community 2 Lets say you buy 4 of these guns each of them costing 100 dollars Even over a 5 10 year span that adds up to a lot of money being spent on a gun that breaks consistantly People who have skirmished with an LPEG Low Powered Electric Gun find that the exterior can actually break if shot at with an AEG that shoots 330 FPS with 2g standard for companies like Toyko Marui ICS Classic Army G G Airsoft Elite The one thing that this suggests that the gun is badly made 3 The gearbox part of gun that fires bbs broke on mine In short it has a metal gearbox made of the cheapest metal known to man The purpose of this for the company that makes to this get money It is very very weak Definitely not worth it 4 The Hop Up on this gun is non existant The fundamentals of hop up is a backspin is added to BBs to increase range and accuracy Effective range of this 50 feet not meters Effective range of my ICS M4A1 with a aftermarket tightbore added is 150 feet 5 This gun will get laughed at Some children walk into an organized skirmish with this LPEG telling people that it will own all others and they will cry home when players with real AEGS destroy them I suppose it is fine for backyard wars but who on Earth would spend 100 dollars for a crappy gun for backyard wars 6 The cost does not equal quality If you think about all of the accessories that come with this gun light laser ect then account for shipping from CHINA then the packaging costs pre molded styrofoam you will realize that this gun is very very cheaply made You do not want to be spending so much for so little quality The laser itself can sell for 20 dollars Put it short it is not worth it 
1 0 great idea poor execution We bought two pairs of these his and hers sizes Large and Regular direct from the manufacturer The gloves in both sets were of different sizes and workmanship on everything was poor and clearly would not stand up to regular use Too bad because the concept is great 
2 0 Didn t Work or Hold Up Well I purchased these so I wouldn t slip on my sticky mat when my hands sweat However they didn t work well for this purpose because there is only one elastic strip that goes between your first and second finger and it allows your hands to slip right through the yoga paws Additionally after only a few classes the sticky material started coming off of the yoga paws particularly on the foot paws I guess they would be okay for someone who doesn t ever have sweaty palms and who doesn t do any intense postures Otherwise I would recommend doing what I do now use a pair of weight lifting gloves with a leather suede palm for extra traction on your sticky mat 
2 0 Great IF you do not sweat The product is well made and a great idea for travel without a mat However I bought it so I would slip less in my postures once I started sweating However although the paws don t slip on the floor surface your skin slips out of them when you sweat making them worthless Guess I will stick with having a towel around 
2 0 too big Too big and cartoonish also very hard to get hands and arms in or out when fully inflated 
1 0 They Are Cheap For A Reason Other buyers have warned me that these cards are cheap for a reason Over 65 of the decks are marked and unusable That means that at most 25 of the 72 decks will be OK for poker play unless you re lucky I have purchase casino used cards before and honestly they are not worth the trouble 
2 0 Cheaply made Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that the other cars joystick control broke So now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work but are wondering when that one will break too I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior The controls are cheap and will break eventually The cars are very loud but on the positive side the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them I would definitely NOT recommend this product 
1 0 Worst Customer Service in the world We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy s for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member Both of them were missing the charger for the battery and other hardware so our kids couldn t even play with them They were very disappointed What is worse Razor s customer service is TERRIBLE They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt Of course since they were gifts we didn t have the reciept Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement which won t be for a couple of weeks Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers All this hassle all the hours on the phone when they could have just sent us the missing chargers like any decent company would for such a high price item Our poor kids just looking at their motionless bumper cars Of course we can t actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it Happy Hanukkah to you too Razor 
2 0 You get what you pay for I didn t want to invest a lot of money in an exercise bike as I plan to use it while recovering from surgery This one seemed to be pretty well rated and the price was very reasonable It does the job but only just I ve had it for about 2 months and the monitoring device has stopped working reliably Sometimes it tracks speed distance calories time and sometimes it just won t come on At first it worked great Also the seat is not very stable and is a bit wobbly Not in danger of falling off or anything but just not a secure connection to the base Overall the bike works about as well as you would expect one for this price to work but I did hope for better quality 
1 0 I can spit a watermelo seed further than this piece of junk This gun is absolutley terrible The third time I shot it the thing broke The pellets it came with were not even perfect circles and you could not load them I would tell you more of how bad this was but I really don t want to waste any more of my time 
1 0 15 5300 Silent Magnetic Resistance Upright Bike I bought this on amazon and used the free shipping and received it about a week and a half later Took it out of the box it s pretty simple to put together took about an hour But after about 20 minutes of riding the bike on tension 6 the rubber belt has flipped off it s wheel like a bike chain off its gears The bike is now completely useless as there is no resistance anymore And I can t get to the belt to try and fix it because the cover is impossible to take off without breaking it Tried calling customer service but they are only open on weekdays 9 5 going to have to call them from work on Monday Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a more quality item than this It ll save yourself a trip to the dump too This bike is a piece of junk 
2 0 exercise bike review Description of bike was misleading Weight limit of person using this exercise bike should have been part of description Small print in booklet accompanying bike says it is unsafe for more than 250 pounds Although I weigh slightly less than this I am afraid to use the bike for fear of it falling apart I would not have purchased the bike had I seen this limit in the description Also the directions for operation of this bike are very complicated I thought I was purchasing a simple exercise bike not such a complicated piece of machinery This bike would be perfect for a younger more athletic slimmer person 
1 0 not food Read the ingredients Contains refined flour and sugar hydrogenated oil corn syrup and artificial colors For someone who may be sensitive to chemicals diabetic or hypoglycemic this would be a poor substitute for real food I personally would become ill from ingesting this sort of thing Always read the labels and be sure that the product is safe for YOU 
1 0 Learn from my mistake I put this mount on my M 44 today and I am not impressed There is side to side play due to the 1 32 or so gap between the side of the scope mount and where the original sight seats Not a whole lot but you don t need much play to have your zero out after a couple of rounds All of the set screws are loose in their respective threaded holes One of the set screws stripped the scope mount threads before any tension could be placed on it The screw that passes through the sight ears was to short to thread the included nut on so I mounted it with the original set pin for the rear sight The mount did not line up with the barrel when mounted and this was obvious to the unaided eye the mount was pointing left of true and I don t know if the scope would be able to compensate I don t think Loctite will be able to hold the set screws in place once a few rounds have gone down range Some of the supplied allen wrenches didn t even fit the set screws I have not fired the weapon with this thing mounted and I am tempted to just toss it and chalk it up as a loss The design could work if a little more attention was placed on the manufacturing process On the plus side it was cheap and the shipping was quick 
1 0 Please save your money This compass fails to do the one simple task I purchased it for which is simply telling me which direction I am going I spent for a compass made out of crap materials It works only for the direction you set it at For example if you set it while facing north it will be correct when you go north but if you change directions the result is completely random This compass only works for one direction and therefore it is utterly useless for a car situation where you actually gasp might turn absolute rippoff 
1 0 Deffective Temp Senor Plug in Wire Please advise me if I can get a new Plu in senor Temp wire plug in this item come in defective and dont work Please advise ASAP Thanks Walter Ga 
1 0 does not work The first one I bought started going crazy within a day The ecreen showed unintelligible symbols and the like EVentually I could not even power it on I was told by PNI Global to take out battery and let in sit for 12 hours Did that then it started breaking down again The temp sensor did not work because anywhere I placed it it was affected by other sources of heat or cold They sent me another one which did the same thing Now I have sent my second one back and they are going to test it and probably send me another one my third The good news is that they are nice in customer service 
2 0 A Real Puzzle This is a nice heavy item perfect for covering your trike But I have yet to figure out how to put it in place I vr tried all sides and in between but have never gotten it on like the picture My son yes he is a grown man put it on better than I had on my tries but the front wheel is still out They need to put some arrows on it or something Barbara Lynch Williamsburg Va 
1 0 Not Happy I was very excited to order this bike As I started to put it together I noticed that some of the prepackaged parts for assembly were missing I still attempted assembly and noticed that pre drilled holes weren t even close to being inline with the display The largest drawback and thing that upset me was that I didn t pay close enough attention when purchasing this it is DOES NOT allow for adjustment from seat to pedals I m 6 3 tall and not being able to adjust for my height makes this completely unusable 
1 0 At least they look nice These knives are terrific unless you actually want to use them I threw these knives into soft pine wood and they bent like crazy One of them bect almost 180 degrees If you want to throw these into something softer like pillows these may work but don t expect to throw these into wood 
2 0 Not Bright Enough to Illuminate the Road or Obstacles As a bicycle enthusiast who has owned CatEye products for nearly 20 years I eagerly attached this light to by mountain bike and went for a spin around the streets and trails of Manhattan Unfortunately I was rather disappointed with its overall usability The light uses three intense bluish white LEDs that are very easy to see from a distance when facing the light However these are not powerful enough to illuminate a trail road or pothole In short the light is excellent tool to acknowledge your position to oncoming motorists and other cyclists The flashing mode is especially easy to see Yet the light is simply not powerful enough to illuminate the ground before you Hence it is basically useless if you are trying to avoid potholes on roads or vehicle barriers on poorly lit bicycle trails Pros Good Construction Multifunction Waterproof Cons Insufficient brightness Uses AAA instead of AA 
1 0 Doesnt work with Thule T2 title says it all Dont purchase this to use with the Thule T2 
2 0 Arrival took 15 days The item was packaged well but it took over 15 days at normal shipping rate The lighter for it stopped working 15 minutes after it was opened Anyone want the rest of this can What a waste of time 
1 0 I feel Cheated by the terrible quality I recently bought the Gaiam 4mm Eco Conscious Rubber Yoga mat because i want to practice my yoga on a environmentally friendly high quality mat After receiving this mat i am EXTREMELY disappointed I feel cheated They claim that it is 4mm but i measured it to be 2mm between the bumps and maximum 3mm on the bumps The mat is very flimsy stretchy and slippery After 1 use it looks like it is rubbing apart Gaiam claims that it is a natural rubber mat but it sure does not feel like a natural rubber mat I have used a natural rubber mat at my studio but it is completly different that this mat Even my instructor questions whether this is actually a natural rubber mat since it feels so different than the high quality natural rubber mat at the studio If i wanted a cheap mat I would have just bought one of the low quality PVC mats I should have spent the extra 5 10 and bought a mat from a company that is know for their quality Dont make the same mistake i made 
1 0 Surprising and not in a good way Not very bright for an LED AND guess what This is about 2 1 2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy toes Given the picture shows a spike on it one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something well the spike is more like a thumbtack I realize the images are provided by the manufacturer so I don t blame Amazon but there is NO excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this 
1 0 BUYER BEWARE This case is mainly MADE OF PLASTIC Don t be fooled by the aluminum description only the corners were aluminum the rest just PAINTED PLASTIC The case came poorly packaged The box was too small for the case The case had scuff marks and scratches on it Obviously NOT BRAND NEW This was the worst purchase I ve ever made on amazon Will never buy ADG SPORTS again Their label was crooked on the case too Looks like a 4 year old put it on DON T WASTE YOUR MONEY TRUST ME 
2 0 Great Idea Great Followthrough BAD COMPONENTS I purchased 3 of these for a very old bike with no holes to mount a water bottle One of them worked perfect snug fit and everything worked The other 2 had nuts that were too large to fit in the plastic This is my second and last purchase from Zefal I was happy it wasnt made in China but i guess the French dont believe in good quality merchandis 
1 0 Mio Not all it s cracked up to be Okay I have owned the Mio for 9 months now and I agree with all of the above complaints it is not accurate it can be difficult to run and check heart rate at same time it s big and clunky looking etc etc My biggest beef is that this watch broke 6 months into the game The heart rate monitor got stuck and rendered the watch useless I returned it to Mio with my 10 00 check and 2 months later i still have not got my watch back I complain regularly and they reassure me that it is being repaired in their factory They assured me that finally after I threw a fit it would be shipped last week still no watch The watch not only sucks but the company sucks as well save your money and buy an ironman 
2 0 A Stopwatch will work better Though the concept of a Heart Rate Monitor without a chest strap sounds convenient the MIO is of absolutely no use during your workout You have to stop your activity be it running biking or walking to measure your current Heart rate as your hand has to be steady The calories feature does not measure the calories burned accurately and was off almost by 100 calories 
2 0 cover not advised for rainy climates There is nothing wrong with this product it s how you use it We almost ruined our 300 trampoline in it s first week by using this product We put it on our new trampoline and it fit fine It rained the next day and filled completely with rain water causing the trampoline to nearly collapse It took a huge effort to remove the water out of the trampoline cover and we have not used it since Trampolines are constructed using fabric that is breathable and will let the rain run through By covering it you don t allow it to drain Unless you live in a VERY dry climate I don t advise using a cover 
1 0 TOO MUCH WORK This cover works well with keeping leaves and such off of the trampoline but every single time it rains I have to spend an hour or so getting the standing water out from the middle It is a back breaking job and it is hard to understand why trampoline covers are not made to handle this correctly More damage is done to the trampoline with the heavy water sitting there than leaves and limbs falling on it This is a worthless item 
1 0 Terrible I bought this for my pilates class and in middle of my plank my feet slid right out Very dissatisfied socks do not have enough elasticity to stay in place I much prefer the yoga socks where each toe is apart from the other I would not recommend these for anyone 
1 0 Cramping I take yoga in a gym The class starts as the aerobics session ends I bought these socks to help keep my feet warm during class Using the socks my big toes were uncomfortably separated from the rest of my foot I expected more elastic They made my foot cramp during the class Because I had worn them once I could not return them Now I do not know what to do with them I should throw them out but I spent money on them 
1 0 Walking Great Running Not I got this watch to help me decrease my times for 5k and it defiantly not 95 accurate I run 10 11 minute mile yet both on the treadmill and outside this watch was reading 7 5 to 8 minute mile Distance was also off by +20 when running Speed and distance 98 accurate for walking 15 min mile 
2 0 disappointing The handles on these knives while having good balance are the weak point These knives aren t meant to be thrown After minimal use they broke at the handle 
2 0 Zermatt Daypack This backpack is a great size but the zippers are nylon and are already separating and getting stuck it would have been better with metal zipper 
1 0 I d rate it 0 if there was a choice I bought this unit two months ago and since that time I have used it sparingly I went to turn it on today and it was dead So I went out and bought a new battery and replaced the old one Still dead I tested the battery on a meter and it was full of juice unlike this so called rugged unit A total waste of money be forwarned 
1 0 P O S Have been using this for a couple of days now and sorely disappointed If you move the compass of your own choice or it falls off the windshield you need to recalibrate it I ve been sitting at stop lights and seen a 10 swing of direction I have no intention of keeping this because of its lack of user friendliness 
1 0 A Loser If it were possible I would rate this item at no stars completely undependable Requires constant recalibration lasting for all of a few minures Have tried all the suggested remedies including new batteries nothing works Next stop is the recycling center 
2 0 You get what you pay for I will not recommend this product I use it in my car and most of the time is wrong If you really need a compass you better read all reviews I usually do it but I couldn t find about this product and well lucky it was only a few dollars 
1 0 Dead on Arrival I should have heeded the bad reviews on this site I purchased this as a Christmas gift and tried to set it up for the recipient It was dead on arrival I tried a new battery still dead on arrival Both batteries tested OK clearly it s a dead unit I contacted the new manufacturer NOT PNI as advertised and am awaiting a response I can t recommend this product 
1 0 Not very good This item was not very good setup instructions poor lighting poor cannot view screen at night forget it 
2 0 Good for a week Bought this for my son He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week Then the wheels broke He wasn t doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable 
1 0 BEWARE I will never deal with this company again My product arrived late and was obviously very old due to the corroded batteries in the airsoft gun It would not work after we cleaned it and I got no response from the company I had to throw away the gun along with my money I have enjoyed Amazon in the past but would appreciate them reviewing who they allow us to do business with Thank 
1 0 DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE I bought this product on a Friday and arrived on a Thursday Good shipping time but a horrible gun The pieces are hard to assemble and made of cheap plastic The whole gun was made of a cheap plastic which is not worth buying I payed 30 for this gun and wasted my gift card for my birthday Complete waste The laser s wires split the gun does not shoot fully automatic and the FPS feet per second is slower than my Berretta Pistol Also the binoculars are cheap as well it is just a gimmick to make you buy the product Use your best judgement when buying this gun but it was not worth the 
2 0 A Dream that did not come true My little girl was supposed to get this bike for her birthday 8 28 and due to missing parts I was under the impression that i was buying a new bike not a used one For the price i paid i should have gotten a new bike not a used bike that no one wanted We have been having to go and order parts for the bike The bike came with scratches and the bottles of paint that came with it were all dried out The box that the bike came in was in horrible condition it seemed as if it was left out in the rain for about a year Then someone tried to tape the box together and ran out of tape There were holes all over the place and i can see why i am missing most of the bolts and nuts We were very disatified and when i called to complain the girl who answered hung up on me I am very unhappy and this will problaly be my last order with this comapny 
1 0 secure it junk I would easily be able to rip this box open I refuse to put a 600 dollar hand gun in a piece of garbage like this Any criminal with a little hand strength could easily get into this box quickly 
1 0 Misleading and disappointing The overall steel frame and structure of it is good but there are too many flaws with this product I recommend going with something else Flaws 1 Bands do not give you good increments of resistence If you want even resistance on each side you go from 20 lbs to 40lbs in one setting which is crazy 2 Workout and Assembly manuals are terrible Especially the Workout manual what use is a machine if the correct use of it is not demonstrated What does that really say about how much Stamina cares about people using it correctly without injury and getting good benefit out of it Only about 10 exercises are really shown the rest are just single pictures that let s you vaguely guess at what you are supposed to do except that many are for some other machine not this one I m sure someone will get injured from incorrect use 3 Many of the pictures are misleading such that you can t actually do many of the exercises suggested or inferred by the pictures One customer service person told me the pictures were of some prototype machine Ridiculous 4 Several construction pieces I received were bad and caused problems but replacement parts were shipped with no problem albeit it meant waiting a week or so for each one and then time to reconstruct the machine I had to replace the main Rail and a main leg support frame piece because they were both welded wrong 5 Leg padding is inadequate and painful 6 Doesn t seem to be a product that is understood or cared about by Stamina no one I called seems to use it or really can tell you about it For a company that claims to care about health and fitness they really don t show it with this product or support for this product I d go elsewhere 
1 0 One Size Does NOT Fit All Youth I bought this for my 5 yr old and he can t even get it on his head He wears other youth bike helmets so I wouldn t recommend this item unless it s for a 2 3 yr old Now I have to pay half the price in return shipping 
2 0 Don t buy it This bigwheel is so poorly made You have to affix the pedals and they do not stay on We put duct tape around the rod that holds the pedals on so they would stay The seat back has cracked already and we ve only owned it one month The tassles on the handles don t stay in and the wheels are completely smooth so they offer no traction Lastly there is no breaking mechanism Anyone who remembers riding a bigwheel knows that having a break is a must if you like to skid out Keep looking 
2 0 All flash Not very good quality A real colorful and flashy bike however there were several things wrong with it 1 the tires had so much excess rubber it had to be trimmed or else it rubbed 2 The back wheel had to be completely removed to loosen the bearings If not done the bike would basically come to a stop by itself 3 the main front sprocket is slightly bent so the chain falls off constantly 4 the bike if VERY heavy maybe that makes it sturdy but it also makes it tough for a 4 year old to ride I should have just bought a bike off the floor at Wal Mart or Target for half the price 
1 0 Wimpiest Pilates Ring in the world I ordered this Pilates ring because I had used one in my health club big mistake It is plastic with little resistance and is totally useless Wouldn t even be of much use for a wheelchair bound old lady The vendor sent it fast though 
1 0 Parts missing Horrible The trampoline came in with 3 out of the 6 legs missing This is the second product form Stamina that came in damaged I would NOT recomend to anyone 
1 0 Breaks in no time Well first of all I never folded it up because it was very difficult to fold so I would just roll it into a closet I would jump on it everyday for an hour and it was great low impact exercise I had it about 3 months and the suspensions snapped and I had a good shock as my feet suddenly hit the floor hard I weigh 110 lbs I really wonder how long this trampoline would last with a heavier person 
1 0 Utter crap If I could give them 0 stars I would I don t know why they even still make these as they should be illegal and so should all that laminated foam rubber stuff they use in karate The materials break up easily the stuffing shifts and starts flying all over the place I could give tens of reasons why these are not only inferior but complete garbage right out of the box Everlast in general simply isn t good low quality materials design and workmanship but these win the prize for all time worst sports equiptment in my book I recommend buying entirely Ringside and this is coming from an experienced full contact fighter 
1 0 Terrible Video for Several Reasons If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me I urge you to buy something else 
2 0 Cheaply Built + Mine Was Defective The description for this product states heavy gauge steel construction but this only applies to the top section The bottom straight section is made of cheap plastic On top of that of the 4 holes for the screws to go into mine had 2 of those stripped with a metal backing completely missing on one of them Even the cheap logo stickers where placed completely off center though that I could care less about If I had to do it all over again I would have purchased Perfect Pushup by Bodyrev which amazon sells 
1 0 DO NOT BUY FROM WESLO DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCTS FROM THE WESLO COMPANY I just received my Weslo Cadence C44 Treadmill and have attempted to assemble it The handrail holes are not drilled in the proper spots so that they may be attached correctly to the console The Customer Service numbers are all disconnected Their website gives an additional number to call and a recorded message tells you to either call the now disconnected numbers or puts you on hold for about 2 minutes before it hangs up on you I have wasted an entire afternoon trying to contact them This company is a complete scam If you are even considering buying one of their products your money is better spent getting your head checked 
2 0 Cheaply made Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that the other cars joystick control broke So now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work but are wondering when that one will break too I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior The controls are cheap and will break eventually The cars are very loud but on the positive side the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them I would definitely NOT recommend this product 
1 0 Worst Customer Service in the world We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy s for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member Both of them were missing the charger for the battery and other hardware so our kids couldn t even play with them They were very disappointed What is worse Razor s customer service is TERRIBLE They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt Of course since they were gifts we didn t have the reciept Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement which won t be for a couple of weeks Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers All this hassle all the hours on the phone when they could have just sent us the missing chargers like any decent company would for such a high price item Our poor kids just looking at their motionless bumper cars Of course we can t actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it Happy Hanukkah to you too Razor 
1 0 What a Joke Who would sell a treadmill for a weight limit of 250 lbs Are only skinny people allowed to loose weight Please find a brain and make it those of us who REALLY need it 
1 0 Does not keep accurate count of steps For several days I wore the watch in conjuntion with a belt affixed pedomoter to establish the accuracy of the watch On every occasion the watch did not count all the steps 
2 0 Wet Hair Yes it does go and come off your head easier than most swim caps but it doesn t keep your hair dry at all 
1 0 If you like overpriced junk you ll love this Basically the title says it all I figured for a 100 dollars I would get a nice green and that the break would add to the challenge Basically this is a poorly made toy that shouldn t cost more than about 20 dollars much less a hundred Like I said in the title if you want an overpriced piece of junk then you hit the jackpot with the Tru Break Putt n Hazard The only thing this is a hazard to is your wallet 
1 0 No stars Never received product Ordered 6 of the flashlights on Dec 3 for Christmas presents E mailed seller several times to find out where order was they never answered my e mails Good way to do business 
1 0 Light lasts a very short time and it s hard to shake I was disappointed in this product and returned it and bought crank type no battery flashlights instead There were two things I disliked about the Diamond flashlight First the light lasted a very short time after shaking vigorously for a couple of minutes they recommend just 90 sec for a full charge I turned the light on and in less than 5 minutes it was very dim and almost useless I tried this a couple of times with the same results The other problem was that shaking it for 90 sec turns out to be a LOT more work than you would think I am much happier with both the light output and the ease of use with the crank type flashlights I replaced these with 
1 0 Real problem Getting the flashlight is a real problem After paying for expedited shipping on Dec 1 meaning Dec 8th at the latest arrival Still waiting on the 17th Called customer service who promised to call back in 10 minutes Never heard back on status Filed a claim for reimbursement on the item 
1 0 Looks good but thats about it I just bought these gloves and wore them for the first time at the gym I now have painful calluses in my palm The glove does not have adequate cushioning for weightlifting Apart from that they look good on your hand but does not do the primary job of protecting your hand 
1 0 Notice the upper left corner Thi is HotImportToys at their finest They are advertising this as a bullet bb proof mask for use in airsoft That leads me to question why in the upper left corner it says Not suitable for children under 3 years Now why would it say that This mask is meant to be a toy yet H I T is saying this will stop bb s Don t they realize that by misleading people like this those people could be seriously injured or even killed I think this really needs to be looked at by Amazon This could seriously kill someone 
1 0 read it be for u buy hurts to wear and u can barly see out of it dont get it 
1 0 You can die My buddy died wearing this mask Well he didn t die but he lost his eye The mask got hit in the mesh and broke and all in his eye 
1 0 wow i dont have this item but how can you expect this to be a good mask if the list price is 100 and they are selling it for 2 50 
2 0 Very little heat I bought both the Nordic Gear batter heated gloves and battery heated mittens Neither product provides adequate heat The batteries work but you get only a tiny bit of warmth I see from the other reviews that my complaint is common I wish I had read the reviews before buying 
1 0 Battery powered gloves little heat for a lot of money I bought these gloves for my wife who has problems keeping her hands warm The description of the gloves would have you believe that the battery powered gloves using D cell Batteries would provide heat to the hands for 6 to 8 hours In actuality the battery will only provide heat for 35 to 40 minutes before it ends To make matters worse the only heat provided is to the palm of the hand no heat is provided to the fingers I did not use a cheap brand of battery for these gloves The first battery that I tried it takes one D cell per glove was Duracel with an experation date of 2013 in other words brand new battery with lots of shelf life left That battery provided heat for 40 minutes before dying The second set of batteries that I tried with the same experation date were made by Eveready That battery lasted 35 minutes You should also note that the Duracel fits poorly in the connector case and the Eveready battery fits even worse These gloves are on their way to Goodwill Maybe they can be used by some one as work gloves or something If you are considering these gloves think again The chemical packs work much better although they the chemical packs do have a shelf life It just seemed such a waste to us to use a chemical pack for a one hour walk and then have the pack continue to provide heat for another 4 to 6 hours Still that is better than using up two D cell batteries for less heat that only lasts about 40 minutes 
2 0 A good product but you might do better I trained for a marathon and several 10K races using a heart rate monitor They are very good instruments for training and I recommend them to everyone who wants to lose weight or get in shape After you ve purchased one or two of them you become a better shopper I purchased an F 4 for a friend and I was very very disappointed in the battery life when I found out how soon the battery in the main unit wore out Some of the newer heart monitors Nikon for one have user replaceable batteries so you can save a lot of money and time replacing batteries after one or two years 
2 0 Good for a week Bought this for my son He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week Then the wheels broke He wasn t doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable 
1 0 Surprising and not in a good way Not very bright for an LED AND guess what This is about 2 1 2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy toes Given the picture shows a spike on it one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something well the spike is more like a thumbtack I realize the images are provided by the manufacturer so I don t blame Amazon but there is NO excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this 
1 0 smooth beginning then horrible squeeking starts I was impressed by all the reviews that said that how quiet the machine was when I bought it Assembly was not so bad 2 5 hours Then the squeeking started Just about after 100 calories burned there would be a two distinct squeeks at a specific position of the flywheel We called technical service and the service person called back on the 5th day he needed to respond before 5 days and scheduled a visit for a day 10 days AFTER that The technician inspected the machine and said that such sound was normal and adjusted the tension on some screws and left Now the squeeking is starts right after beginning the workout It is LOUD As in you need earplugs loud Another call to tech support 
1 0 DO NOT BUY Don t be fooled by the positive posts I am convinced they are bogus This is just a cheaply made toy at adult prices 
1 0 Broke on first use Need I say more The ball flew off with the plastic connector and wound up in the neighbor s yard Thankfully no one was hurt 
1 0 Less than a day already broken When I saw that most of the critical parts the ones that bear the brunt of the force were made of plastic I told my wife this isn t going to last long In the very place I had concerns is where mine broke A simple metal pin instead of a plastic one would have made all the difference I also just noticed in these customer reviews that right after someone posts a negative review a positive albeit anonymous review is posted That always makes me wonder 
1 0 piece of junk Broke first time I used it When it worked it was highly inaccurate I own a radar speed detector Save your money 
1 0 Broke the first time I used it The first time I used it I hit it about 20 times before the ball broke off and went flying into nearby woods My Mom had ordered it from Sharper Image She called them and they said the would replace the ball They never did I have not found a place to order replacement parts 
1 0 This product is a waste I don t recall ever being quite as disappointed with a product as I am with the Swing Groover II Last night I went to the driving range to check some yardages of my clubs just so I could verify the accuracy of the Swing Groover I was hitting my 5 iron between 180 190 yards most of the time occasionally hitting 200 My 7 iron was flying about 165 yards Tonight I just finished setting up the Swing Groover My first few swings with a 5 iron produced readings of 133 yards I warmed up a little more and started hitting the 7 iron These swings produced readings of 121 yards with an average of 121 This product is designed to indicate swing speed and yardage hit The yardage is off by about 50 yards but believe it or not I think the swing speed indicator is probably pretty accurate With the 5 iron it was indicating a little over 70 mph I ve had my speed tested before with the driver and it registered a little over 100 mph so this number of 71 73 with the 5 iron sounds reasonable I m not sure if I just got a defective machine or what exactly the problem is but I m very disappointed I m very inclined to think I just wasted 150 My suggestion is to keep looking for other products because this one is horribly inaccurate 
1 0 Mmmm Pork skins and cow hooves Hydrolized Gelatin is the 3rd ingredient after the chocolate coating and protein blend Do a search on that and you ll discover that it comes from processing pork skins and cow bones Mmmmm Doesn t that sound good What s more this gelatin protein is incomplete so it doesn t really do anything to help grow or repair muscles It may taste OK but you can find protein bars with higher quality protein in them Or just eat Jello if you really want gelatin Avoid ones with collagen too Same issue 
1 0 Misleadinng I ordered a wobble balance board from Everyting Fitness and it came from Karate Depot and doesn t even look like the product I ordered I only give 1 star because I can t give zero starts 
1 0 The item broke after 1 use While this is a cheap product and worked great for the first application session use of 20 min the second time I tried to use it the belt failed after 5 min Even after getting new batteries which turned out NOT to be the problem I tried to get the belt to work like before but realized I was scammed It is a cheap plastic belt that seems to be the answer to all your problems but really just creates new ones 
1 0 Ab Sonic EMS Fitness Belt I really think I wasted money for buying this stuff it s just worthless and not working at all 
1 0 One more piece of junk Yes you ll feel your muscles contracting If they were really contracting to a degree worthy of being called exercise the contractions would scare the heck out of you You d either feel like your whole core was paralyzed or you d be going into an spastic involuntary crunch Don t worry that won t happen The machine isn t strong enough Try this Tense up your abs more a little more relax and do it again a few times for a minute or so thats already WAY more exercise than you ll get from the Ab Sonic If you re a therapy patient who has a poor muscular awareness perhaps this will help you begin to get enough feeling back to move on to a real exercise program If your spinal cord is severed this may be all you can do to get a little musuclar stimulation fine This is not exercise It may remind you to tense your abs in order to not look like a fat slob but why not just remind yourself It s not powerful enough to do do any real strengthening and even if it was it by passes the most important part of your workout the will You aren t learning the effort of tensing the muscles or tolerating greater stress you re just electronically agitating the muscles In the end this has ZERO effect on strength muscular development work tolerance and function Are you in therapy No Then why are you trying so hard to avoid moving your body 
1 0 where s the product I received a phone msg from the vendor two days after I ordered this item from Amazon A day after I received an email advising that they could not ship my order to a california address and if I had another address outside California to ship it to I thought it was strange since I only have one address I was looking forward to geting this item too 
1 0 A must NOT buy I bought this item based on other people s reviews I m sad to say they were wrong Maybe it s just my individual toy but it really did not work properly out of the box The gun starts doublefeeding pellets as soon as I started firing it It sprayed pellets in everywhich direction except for where they were supposed to go My recommendation well just look at my title 
1 0 Doesn t work well at all When I got this gun I thought it looked really cool but when I tried to shoot it the bullets just rolled out of the barrell The few bullets that did shoot worked well I did not have a good experience with this gun 
1 0 misleading Let me just start by saying this gun is terrible The images are misleading the gun looks to be of a shiny more durable plastic but it is a dull black And it smells really badly at first Not once did the gun shoot over 100 fps and is sold at 300 My friends didn t even notice being shot I have a 300 fps pistol it leaves welts through jeans This ISNT 300 fps It s a rifle fit for an infant who s been dropped on their head and thinks it s good never even shot farther than 80+ feet bad buy 
1 0 You get what you pay for I bought this elliptical three month ago unwilling to pay big bucks over 1 000 for recommended models hoping to make an exclusion from the rule No it did not happened Starting with the errors in assemble instrucions in the manual inaccurate display readings and so on ending with a squicky and noisy piece of equipment Their customer service is just a place to order parts although they sent me some parts I broke when assemling a threat on the bolt a couple of broken by me plastic part I noticed that I m using this machine more rarely because I just don t like the way it works If I new what I was going to get I did not buy it 
1 0 broke after a month I bought this for my wife because of it s low cost You get what you pay for She uses it a few times a week After a little more then a month the left pedal broke She is not overweight at all so that wasn t the problem I ll spend the money for a good one next time 
2 0 Not bad for the cost This is a very heavy machine so make sure you have help if it is going up the stairs It is fairly quiet not silent It is shakier than I had hoped The wire to the monitor came broken 
2 0 Not so silent I recently purchased the Stamina Elliptical It took me a day and a half to put together The meter didn t work so I called customer service and they sent another one out immediately It makes a lot of noise and it s not very sturdy I would return it but it would take too long to dis assemble I wouldn t recommend this product 
1 0 spend more get more I bought this pedometer for myself and bought my wife a 20 Omron pedometer and hers is far superior Easier to set up more accurate durable Lesson spend a few dollars more for something that works well This one is disposable junk 
1 0 Not Bad If Your Expectations Are Low This imported sword is actually a long dagger about the size of a WWII era bayonet In the scabbard it is all of 15 inches The construction fitment of parts finish and overall quality is poor Definitely a mass produced low quality item The blade is plain stainless steel and would not hold an edge It would properly be labeled a Masonic ish sword as the symbolism on the handle guard and scabbard do not strictly conform to those of any branch of Masonry There are prominent red crosses and a few Knights Templar ish symbols but no one that knows anything about Masonry would mistake this for a genunine implement The blade is sharply pointed so this is NOT something children should play with It looks okay hanging on the wall in the scabbard but that is about all it is good for The price is not a bargain it is about right for a Chinese made import of this size and quality As long as you don t expect more that what I have described you might like this item 
1 0 Only good for looks If it is kept in the hilt it makes for a decent wall piece If you pull it out of the hilt it is not a good thing My sword has a bent blade and a bent handle which was noticable while in the hilt I would not spend the money on this item 
1 0 One trip and returning to the store If you need a starter or disposable bike carrier this might be okay but not suitable for longer trips or valuable bikes Good parts Cheap 99 Bad parts 1 Cheap 2 The adapter for a 2 reciever hitch is horrible you ll have to shim it jury rig something or go to a parts store and pay for a workable one 3 Way too much sway which is obvious as you put it together Turning corners in town have you checking your mirrors with concern Multiply the effect for highway speeds or bumps Would need to rig something 4 Straps holding the bikes Cheap rough on your bike and not very tight In summary if you want to spend alot of time rigging it up to save a few bucks it might be worth it but out of the box I wouldn t trust any worthwhile bike or vehicle with it 
1 0 Do you have a 2 inch hitch Read this I gave this product one star because it was the lowest option What I really give it is this WARNING The outback hitchback 4 product is a dangerous piece of junk I installed it on my Suburban which required the needs to be redesigned adaptor to 2 inch and put one full sized and three kid bikes on it It swayed a range of 10 12 inches newly installed My wife had went on the Target web site earlier and read that the sway was normal By the time I had traveled 1 3 of the way back to the Bay Area from LakeTahoe in the middle of the night I noticed in the lights of the car behind me the hub of the full sized bike wheel sticking out from the side of the vehicle I pulled over in the dark and checked it out Due to the constant side to side motion of the winding mountain roads the main metal braket had bent and the sway had increased to a now dangerous 2 feet Needless to say the rest of the four hour trip was nerve racking Roping the rack to try and stabilize it I m taking the rack back to Target 
1 0 Don t waist your money The first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame Two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit The seller forwarded the photos and complaint to Texsport and they sent us another top When we put that top on we found the same thing That is when we found the frame was 4 longer than the top There were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner After cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together When next spring comes we will replace this one and I can assure you it will not be a Texsport product 
2 0 Too high and heavy I got this Zafu meditation cushion It is round in shape and too high and bulky to be comfortable to sit on around 9 inches high and 15 18 inches in diameter It is also pretty heavy around 4 pounds due to the sheer size I could not sit comfortably on it due to this reason returned it I would recommend trying it somewhere before buying The filling seemed of good quality 
2 0 WHAT CAN I SAY IT WORKS LIKE A HOOK FOR CLOTHES OF MY WIFE 
1 0 poor quality I got this item to give a a gift I got it fast however opened the bag to find out the zipper was completely broken It wasn t worth returning it because if you ve opened it you can only get a 50 refund and have to pay shipping which would have cost more than what I would have been refunded Don t bother with this one 
1 0 junk Three of these broke Granted the company sent me two replacements for nothing after the first one failed but to no avail My wife received something similar from SPRI doctor s tubing and it has lasted for a few years now 
2 0 Ummmm I might be an idiot but maybe this thing should have come with some instructions on how to put it on Haha So many velcro straps and what not Neither me nor my father who s been on the police force for 30 some odd years could figure out how to put this thing on properly Again maybe I m just an idiot 
1 0 Universal Mount isn t The literature describes this unit as a flat mount ski rack compatible with any factory installed roof rack with crossbars Hardly My vehicle is a 2006 GMC Envoy with a factory roof rack This rack is the same one used on many GM SUVs so great numbers of them are out there These racks have crossbars with a reverse wing shape that are tilted forward presumably to reduce wind noise The Thule universal mounting system will not conform to these crossbars and will only mount with the ski rack tilting forward or backward at a silly angle It can be used in this conformation but it looks odd Also the ski rack indeed locks over the skis boards but the mounts are not lock protected so the entire ski rack and contents can be easily stolen with standard wrenches My searches found no alternative to this rack however and it does work for the intended purpose 
1 0 Pricing Problem This is a 22 tee ball Maybe they have the decimal in the wrong place since these should cost about 2 at your local sporting goods store Maybe they comes 10 or 12 to a package but it doesn t say that clearly on the page Bottom line is don t buy this until they clarify the pricing issue 
1 0 Not worth the money too many issues I was unable to use this treadmill for several reasons One the belt will not stay centered It shifts to one side and then starts rubbing on the metal guides intended to keep it centered If I were able to get the belt to turn with out a large amount of force the second problem it would soon be torn by the guides As I said the second problem is the belt will not move without a lot of force I had to lean over and put so much force down that after only 3 minutes my legs were cramping If I tried to stand up and just walk normally the belt would not move Also like others several of the plastic knobs were broken and it was either a used unit or the numerous scratches happened during shipping 
1 0 Junk This is the worst purchase I have made from Amazon or anyone else The first unit arrived with several parts broken and the tread immovable After a number of calls to tech support it was decided to return and replace the unit Amazon promptly replaced the treadmill This one had a movable and usable tread but the electronic display did not function My friend at tech support did not have a clue He suggested that he send me all the electircal cables used on this unit It is not clear what I am to do with them I strongly recommend that anyone wanting a manual treadmill puchase it from a diffrerent manufacturer 
2 0 TOO BIG TOO HEAVY This is not as described it is very hard to move heavy and bulky If you have a place to set it up and leave it fine but this is not going to be pulled out every day for a stroll in front of the TV as described Performance wise it seems very nice and is a good solid piece of equipment but definitely not an item that can be put away after each use I m disappointed 
1 0 Never got one in one piece After 2 attempts at having this shipped to me and both times having it arrive broken I have given up this model It s a shame that the poor packaging on the machine is the reason for the rowers rating If you can buy one at the store it may be a great unit but don t let it go UPS 
2 0 Not what I expected This is not the fault of Amazon or even the product I wasused to a gym quality rower conceptII which allows a lot of resistance The Integrity 3000 allows for hardly any resistance I am in the process of sending it back The machine itself was good but did not offer enough of a challenge An expensive lesson 
1 0 I can break it with my eyes The goal arrived at my house assembled wrong then after it was fixed be me I successfully put it together which was relativly easy After several moderately hard training sessions two large holes were in the net That is on top of the fact that the pins that hold the net together are weak The weakness in the pins causes the goal to collapse if there is a shot off of the post Overall this is probably not a good buy 
2 0 Doesn t maintain temp handle falls off I own two and have had problems with both Even when pre heated coffee tea is luke warm 3 hours later Sturdy product should be for it is pretty heav 
1 0 Choose another product Prior to purchasing this item I read a review that one should instead look towards a product that pulls up from the base of the foot and not the toe I wish I heeded this advice because on top of fasciitis I developed severe toe pain by using this product I then had to by a second product anyway that thankfully eliminated the toe pain Even though this is less expensive than other night splints it may do more harm than good Go with a firm non toe injurying splint instead 
1 0 Didn t Work for Me Maybe the S120 will work for you but it was nothing but trouble for me I bought it because of the great features and price but returned it because of all the problems 1 The manual is anything but friendly e g after completing the 11 steps to set the date you are then told that there s a short cut Thanks 2 After spending much more than an hour with the manual just to get the basic settings in I m off to exercise Great start the reading is my usual pulse around 55 then it drops out to 0 Ok maybe the contacts are too dry so I wet them Off I go again and the pulse rate measures 204 then to 0 Ok maybe the chest strap is positioned poorly Different position same result measured pulse rates all over the map I decide to forget what the monitor records and finish my exercise Final result I got periods of reasonable heart rates but lots of time the values were either 0 or over 190 The next day I try again with the same result drop outs and then sky high readings It went back later that day 
1 0 TARGET SHIPS FAST BUT BEWARE ORDERING IN JANUARY I ordered the Igloo quick and cool 150 from Target I had it 2 days after ordering It was a very nice cooler but very clearly quite used Back it went Be careful ordering from Target in January They have to do something with those Christmas returns Check out the product carefully 
2 0 Everlast Medicine ball review The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived it was very scuffed up and scratched It also had a flat spot on it I returned it for a replacement which I got and it was in the same condition Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before I would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb medicine ball and the same outcome Definitly not happy with it 
1 0 slow leak This airbed leaked slowly from day one I sent it back and got an exact replacement that also had a slow leak from day one I do not recommend this product 
1 0 Flashlight Don t ever buy this It is a rip off and a gimmick Your hands will get tired really fast for shaking the flashlight and 30 seconds of shaking will not even get you 5 minutes of light with consistent brightness Even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever Other flashlights that require cranking can give up to 2 hours of light for 1 minute of cranking if you get the right one 
1 0 EVERLIGHT IS LITTLE LIGHT LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIGHT FLASHLIGHTS THE PARTY THAT SAID THERE WAS ENOUGH CHARGE DURING SHIPPINS IS A LITTLE SHAKING IN THE HEAD IT TAKES AT LEAST A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF OF SHAKING BEFORE THERE IS EVEN A GLIMMER OF LIGHT AFTER THAT IF YOU DON T CONTINUE TO SHAKE IT DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY THIS LIGHT MAY POSSIBLY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE BUT THERE ARE OTHER LED FLASHLIGHTS WITH BATTERIES THAT ARE SUPERIOR TO THIS ONE THE POWER USED BY THESE LEDS IS LOW AND THE BATTERIES LAST A LONG TIME 
1 0 Poor light Looses charge fast I have been purchasing a few of these self charging flashlights lately to find the best one This one puts out a a poor amount of light It also does not retain its charge well You will have to shake it frequently to keep it charged I would say it is one of the worst ones I purchased 
2 0 Just adequate It holds my bike but seems unstable I still can t figure out where all 6 straps go on my car and the support rails tilt downward towards the rear instead of upwards Plus probably the biggest concern there is no means of strapping the bike to the rack user must tie the bike down every time My bike hasn t fallen off though 
1 0 Nothing but problems The light came without the batteries that were supposed to be included Batteries were very difficult to find and quite expensive Even with batteries the xenon light did not work So now I have a very expensive led flashlight with hard to replace batteries The case was nice however 
2 0 The Rubic s cube of shelters If you want to picture yourself wrestling with poles and pins while camping then this is the item for you The instructions are made only to confuse things more It could be made so much more user friendly Once it s up it gets a thumbs up 
1 0 Do not purchase as shower Not strong enough to hold even 2 gallons of water in a shower This is shown with a shower hanging in it but the only way it would hold it is empty Not usable as a shower Good if you are looking for privacy or changing room but not for a shower 
1 0 Don t waste your money This product does not work The vendor is great though They refunded our money very quickly We were very disappointed because it is a great idea 
2 0 Spend your money on something else I already have a good quality FitBall stability ball that I really like and only bought this set to get the DVD I had planned to give the ball to a family member but unfortunately it is of poor quality and not burst resistant so it will probably just get thrown out The included pump is a piece of junk so even if you do want to use the low quality ball you ll need to find another way to inflate it Finally Mindy Mylrea is a good instructor but the music sound quality were lacking and I ended up not liking the workout so in the end I got rid of the dvd as well 
2 0 Low quality I love the workout dvd that comes with it but the ball developed a slow leak after only a few uses Very disappointed with this product 
1 0 Where in the world is this company Do not order from this company as amount will be charged to your account as mine was and I never got the item I emailed the company and never heard a word Amazon is crediting my account after I made a complaint Unsatisfactory company 
1 0 Kind of like eating a candle Now I am a firm believer that breakfast is a very important time in your day Yesterday morning I was driving to the dentist s office when I realized that I had forgotten to eat I started to have quite an anxiety attack so I pulled over at the only available place A Gas Station Nothing really caught my eye as something I would like to put inside my body Now this was no ordinary Gas Station This was a special kind of one where they had hot food behind the counter including supreme pizza chicken drum sticks and even breakfast style food like a little sausage egg buiscuit combo sandwich Sure the food smelled alright but the thought sickened me that one of the mechanics or gas pumpers may have had oil grease or even gasoline on their hands when preparing these dishes While I was peering over the counter trying to scope out just how filthy their hands were something to my left caught my eye It was a golden box of something called a Powerbar The name had me sold immediately a food that creates power and they were even individually sealed to prevent the repulsive hands of the workers from contaminating them I m going to eat a POWERBAR was the only thought on my mind as I purchased 4 of them on the spot I hopped back in my VW Cabrio and sped off down Livernois towards the dentist s office I unwrapped one of the Powerbars It looked just like a normal candy bar but the name told a different story Just how much endurance and stamina would one of these provide and for how long What kind of advantages would I gain I thought I had found my new favorite food Finally a food that defines Howard Tuttleman as a person That is until I took my first bite My first bite literally took me 2 minutes to chew up enough to be able to work it down my throat It was a tough rubbery nugget inside the chocolate that stretched out a bit like taffy Every bite had the same grimy and bitter flavor with an atrocious after taste My mouth felt like I had ingested a whole bottle of Elmer s glue and every crevice between my teeth was gummed up with it I reluctantly continued to eat the entire bar My stomach began to feel as if I had eaten lead I felt no extra power in my body If anything the Powerbar significantly weakened me by making me feel ill I was convinced that I had simply picked a bad Powerbar so I unwrapped another one to give it a second chance By this time I was in the Dentist s parking lot If I went in now I could make the appointment on time but I had to try for more Power Big mistake The second Powerbar was no different It felt like the Powerbars were fighting my stomach I finished the second Powerbar feeling even worse My third Powerbar however was the worst of the bunch It was a different flavor and I nearly threw up I felt 20 pounds heavier My teeth and lips felt like I had been eating drywall and were covered in chocolate and grimy nugget I simply could NOT eat more than 2 bites of the fourth one no matter how much I tried It was time to go inside My dentist was a little ticked off that I was late and got really annoyed about all of the Powerbar remains stuck in my teeth Apparently I wasn t supposed to eat for a while before my appointment I felt sick for the rest of the day I gave my dog Morris the rest of the 4th Powerbar to see if it would work on a dog but it just made his butt really powerful that night and was a real pain to clean up after Please beware the name of this product is deceptive unless it is supposed to mean that the Powerbar ITSELF is powerful and will overpower YOU Later howardtuttleman co 
2 0 Poor Quality Stitching I am disappointed with this product as I thought I was ordering the stretchout strap which is all nylon and very durable which I give to my patients This one is made of nylon and elastic The stitching broke within 2 days of minimal use The elastic may be more comfortable on the hands but the stitching is poor quality and just fell apart Go with the Stretch Out Strap which I have been very pleased with 
1 0 huh how can this table be used with FACE HOLE either 1 use no sheets ie client lies directly on vinyl or 2 fitted sheet covers hole ie client cannot breathe Neither of these 2 options is even remotely acceptable 
1 0 LifeGear Travel Lite Massage Table Disliked table Each time table was set up legs had to be attached by the support rods This was not an easy process nor done quickly The face hole in table was not useful to me and was very uncomfortable 1 Star for this item is too much for my usage and review I sent it back 
1 0 Even at a discount price not worth the money We have in the past owned an In Step single jogger It wasn t perfect but it certainly met our needs It always needed to be tipped back to change direction and it rusted a little because we left it outside If we had stayed as an only child family it would have continued working but with the addition of another baby we decided to sell it After being in transition for over a year and now that the weather is warming up we decided to get a double jogger for strolling We purchased the In Step Run Around LTD 2 Jogging Stroller in hopes it would meet our new needs The problems of the single stroller seemed compounded in the double stroller My husband had no problem getting it together but complained about the cheap caliper style break it doesn t stop the stroller and barely even slows it down It took him the same amount of time to work on the break as it took him to assemble the whole jogger After that we placed our three year old and our 18 month old in it for a test ride When placing them in we encountered our next problem the seats even at the highest point are super reclined They wanted no part of laying back but instead were both utterly thrilled to sit far forward and mess with each other As for the straps a six inch long safety label sewn to the webbing made it almost impossible to thread them through the front buckle So off we set on our test drive It was really hard to push and almost impossible to turn After a while we figured out that letting the kids sit so far forward threw off the balance of the whole jogger The only way to make it partially work was to let out both seats to the fully reclined position criss cross the shoulder straps and constantly yell Stay down kids if you sit up one more time I m going to sit in it and make you push me Well we got home from our test run and my husband pulled out the cardboard box and with a resigned air began the job of taking it apart I don t recommend this item In all honesty our Radio Flyer Pathfinder Wagon does the job more effectivel 
2 0 Damn this stroller sucks I ditto the previous reviewer i thought these seats were adjustable was I wrong there is only 1 position and that is practically laying down suck 
2 0 Very Very Wide Straps are horrible We know strollers This is our 5th stroller over 4 kids We decided to try a dually Pros Plenty of room for 2 children both about 25 pounds Cute CONS We re reviewing what we consider to be an expensive stroller In our opinion the added expense shouldn t equal just an extra seat but better design and higher quality 1 While the dimensions are listed in the description the relative size to every day objects are not discussed Objects like say doors This stroller won t fit through 90 of the doors in the world You basically had better only expect that it go through the front door of your house or plan on Parking it in the garage next to your suburban The doorway must be a 3 0 door 36 inches wide That s usually only your front door Forget about pushing into or out of any interior doorways which are generally much smaller 2 The straps are awful Again our 4th stroller Worse one of all Incredibly incredibly difficult to use I m actually flabergasted at how difficult the straps are Despite having tightened them up as tight as possible the two year old was out in under 10 minutes once she decided to be out 3 Impossible to allow the children to sit up Again adjusting the straps to the utmost the angle of the backrest remains extremly steep Perhaps to counter balance the lack of effective straps 4 Hand brake is setup for the left hand Appears to be reversible if you want to work on it 5 Hood can not be lowered to cover front of children If say you are walking into the sun morn or evening the kids are completely exposed Conclusion Very frustrating buy Wouldn t recommend it at all 
1 0 Avoid This was one of our worst purchases Rental gear that we have used on previous vacations works better The snorkle and mask were constant problems leaking filling with water etc We had to stop snorkling every few minutes and finally just gave up 
1 0 Lame If your looking for cheap snorkel equipment this is the way to go but the fins are low quality and I would only wear them if I wanted to get laughed at 
2 0 Stick to Just Losing weight the old fashon way the jacket works well for shedding water which isn t really losing positive weight the pants rip during the first work out i ve purchased two of these hoping in good faith that the pants woouldn t rip but they did save your money unless you just want to jacket 
1 0 save your money received this suit yesterday and used today for first time you do sweat but as one of the other reveiwers mentioned i took off the pants and they tore horizontally thru the crotch seam one wearing and kaput written to valeo will see what they repl 
2 0 Works but cheaply made The suit will make you sweat if that s what you are looking to do I had rivers running out of my sleeves and pant legs but the pants tore within weeks on the inside seam I was using the suit about 5 times a week with a vigorous treadmill routine It will likely last longer and be fine for occasional recreational uses but buy something more substantial for a serious workout You truly do get what you pay for 
1 0 a waste of cash I received the exercise bike put it together as soon as I got it and started using it Just looking at it I had second thoughts about buying it Ten minutes later it broke Some part in this cheaply made product broke on the inside I contacted the guys who sold this to me to get my money back but they never got back to me One more thing Even if it hadn t broken the resistance setting on this thing is horrible You get absolutely no resistance on it That means no workout 
1 0 Portable Mini Exercise Bike Received the bike in our office as a possible incentive for our wellness program and no one was able to use it You can t get it to pedal The cheaper way is not the way to go on this type of bike You need a heavier base and very smooth cycling This model runs on a fabric type band on the inside MADE VERY CHEAP I DON T RECOMMEND 
1 0 Shipping and Hanlding Exceeds Purchase Price This tiny item ships for 2 more than it costs I ll purchase it elsewhere 
5 0 Which is the biggest monster This monster is great my old millionaire nan came over recently to tell us that she was about to take us out of her will because we had too much money already and as luck would have it she had to use the bathroom during that same visit We heard this scream from the bathroom and when we broke in we found our nan dead on the floor luckily she hadn t gone to her attorney s office to sign the new will and we got our share after all thanks toilet monster you were worth the 15 + 5 shipping we paid for you 
5 0 Thank you Smitty this bike rocks On the basis of the first review here I ordered this bike and couldn t be happier with it This is the first piece of exercise equipment I ve ever tried that is worth the space it takes up I use it every day 
5 0 Great tool for horseback riders The gripmaster has helped me strengthen my left fingers which is so important in the use of my reins when riding I took it with me on vacation to Florida and two of my friends one older who wanted to use it for arthritic hands and the other just for stiff joints saw it started using it and loved it So I ordered two more 
5 0 CAT fan My son is 5 years old and absolutly loves this digger It was easy to put togther and is very durable I would highly recommend it He also likes that it has tracks so he can sit on it and move it where he wants 
5 0 good for office work I bought this ball as an alternative to a regular office chair I am able to work on my abdominal muscles while surfing the web or other computer work It helps me to stay focused on the work and not get frustrated with not being able to move around It is exactly what I was looking for 
5 0 You definitely feel it This machine really makes you feel it I like the fact that it also stretches your back which feels great The only thing I can say is I wish it folded up for better storage but other than that I like it 
5 0 Good Workout Make sure you do other forms of exercise and good diet habits to compliment this I like using it when I m at home and don t feel like going to the gym I cardio running or something afterwards It s really effective if your form is correct 
5 0 exercise ball This is a great exercise ball It is great in helping your body tone up by balancing yourself using the ball with various floor routines Let me tell you It is very hard to balance yourself on this ball and I can really feel my muscles working out It helps strengthen your muscles and gives you better balance and flexibility this is a great product 
5 0 Nice package ball and pump The last ball I had requirted the bicycle pump to fill it I m just too lazy to run out and find the bike pump every time I need a little more air The pump that comes with this ball doubles for filling other things too At my kids birthday party I used it to fill some inflatable decorations and I ve used it to fill an air mattress So two things the ball is easily inflated and the pump is handy 
5 0 Great Product Great product I just received my ball today I couldn t wait to work out If I learn how to stay on it that would be saying something I will always recommend Max Fitness 
5 0 For More than Just Playing the Guitar I recently decided to try and teach myself guitar after having stopped for a while One of the suggestions i got was to get a Gripmaster and when i checked it out I found this gizmo could actually help in more ways than just strengthening my fingers I ordered one and I can definitely say it was a good investment There s a big difference in my grip now I can even crack a nut with one hand easily using a nutcracker of course I can t wait to try the 7 lb one 
5 0 If you Need Finger Strength Control Endurance and Coordination you are in the Right Place Let me start saying that this is a wonderful product Small light and well constructed they feel like they will last forever You can carry them with you allowing to workout your fingers at the office at home or wherever you find suitable I bought the four different color coded gripmasters Black heavy Red medium Blue light and Yellow extra light I only found the resistance of the red and black ones useful for me but my wife loves the blue and yellow ones It was a great buy because of their high quality and affordable price The product comes with a foldable instruction booklet where you find details for six different exercises Trigger pinch This one simulates the movement of squeezing a trigger and it isolates the index finger for enhanced strength and coordination Gross grasp This one strengthens fingers thumb wrist and forearm for a firm grip Hook position This one strengthens longer muscles in forearm and wrist while stretching smaller muscles in hand for greater motion and endurance Tip to tip pinch This exercise strengthens specific fingers thumb smaller hand muscles and forearm for greater control and endurance Wrist flexion It strengthens wrist and forearm muscles Key pinch Strengthens thumb and index finger for greater stability and coordination At the gripmaster website you can find more exercises for different activities and sports If you are looking to crush hands when handshaking this is not the product for you but if you need finger strength control endurance and coordination you are in the right place 
4 0 Good Quality little light I originally bought the Blue 5 lb Red 7 lb and the Black 9 lb Gripmasters for my 14 year old boys The Blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger The Blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so I ended inherited it It is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light this makes it good for use anytime anywhere I have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever If I had to do it again I would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip probably have started with the Red Just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping the challenge is working out the fingers It is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers It has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts Great product excellent for finger or hand exercise good quality 
5 0 I m so pleased I love my treadmill My son put it together for me and he had no trouble I love all the options on this treadmill I use only the basic so far but I can see the benefit in having the pre programmed workouts I can t wait to get there to try it It s hard to say enough about this machine It s a great MACHINE 
4 0 Good choice I received this from my husband as a birthday present It figures he was going to get something with the name IronMan =P I ve only used it for a week but I think we re going to have a long and happy relationship Tho I ve found my husband using it more then I am Its easy to fold up which is important as I m not the strongest woman in the world But I leave it out as I know that if it s folded and put away I probably won t use it However this sucker looks so cool that I really have no desire to put it in the closet Everything on it is convinent with one exception They made the display easy to see but it blocks the TV LOL One star off for that = 
5 0 Works fine every single time I use the IR interface with the Polar s625x running computer and I have never encountered a single problem I usually use the interface in to different computers a notebook at home with XP and a desktop at work 2000 and in both computers it works nicely You have to be careful and follow the directions that come with the IR interface Install the software and drivers before you connect the device to the computer I love my Polar watch and the IR interface is an excellent complement for an excellent product 
4 0 does the job Initially I had some trouble figuring out the right port to use But now it works and I ve used it constantly for at least 2 years 
4 0 Purchase assembly and performance First off you can find this price lots of places It is probably the minimum sale price allowed by schwinn I choose to buy mine through AMAZON becasue I got 3 back with my visa free delivery and didn t pay sales tax That made up for most of the cost difference between the 212 and the 213 I wanted the extra programs Delivery was smooth except they had to come back once for me to sign for the delivery No problems with the packaging in our case Assembly took about an hour and a half It was pretty simple and the tools you need were included which was nice Overall this assembly was much easier than most things I have put together The bike is stable quiet and smooth Easy to ride and easy to adjust between the big guy and the little woman Overall we are very pleased and look forward to years of use I didn t rate this a 5 cause we ve only had ours a week 
5 0 Great Bike and good delivery I did read all the reviews and was afraid something bad could happen during delivery My fears proved wrong I received a heavy package not damage with all contents inside The bike is working well and it is really a great exercise bike 
5 0 exercise bike My physician told me to exercise or else so I looked at Comsumer Reports and listened to friends who spoke of a recumbent bike Amazon s price was great and I have been delighted If you like to read and exercise this one s for you 
4 0 I love it Wow it s not often a person gets excited about exercise equipment but my Schwinn 213 Recumbent bike arrived today I have read several reviews about the condition of the box when it arrives My bike arrived in a timely manner The box had taken a minimal amount of abuse and was mostly intact Nothing inside was broken scratched or bent The instructions were crystal clear It only took me about 30 minutes to have it up and running The hardware comes vacuum sealed onto a piece of cardboard and clearly labeled The hardware for step 1 is labeled step 1 etc I have never assembled anything with the ease in which this went together It is a solidly built piece of equipment I only tried it out for a few minutes but it is quiet pedals smoothly and has a ton of features Ok now for the things I don t like the list is small but worth noting The fan and digital display is not angled enough for you to get any benefit from the fan nor can you read the display Only if you are very short and have to sit close to the screen can you read it with ease I am 5 10 and the fan does not adjust to blow on me I can just barely read the display from where I have to sit A book holder would have been nice That is it The things I like far outweigh the things I don t It comes with 10 pre programmed routines manual mode timed trials etc You can even input how many calories you want to burn and it will count down the calories instead of minutes I haven t used all the features but so far I am thrilled to death with my purchase and despite some of the negative things about it I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable way to exercise 10 15 06 Ok I ve had this for a week now and I want to shout from the rooftops how comfortable and great it is I solved my problem of not being able to read the screen very well but taking a crow bar and GENTLY prying up on the top edge of the metal plate that the read out screen is attached to Take the electronic screen off before doing this The plate bent up just enough that now I can read the screen just fine I still don t get much benefit from the fan but the fan doesn t really blow hard enough anyway I have tried out the easiest program and it is amazing I can t begin to say enough about this bike If you truly hate exercising this is the bike for you Schwinn has taken an activity some of us dread and has transformed it into something I don t mind doing I am using this bike along with the Weider Crossbow another piece of equipment I can t rave enough about as my total body workout I hope to be slimmer trimmer and stronger 6 8 weeks from now Also I want to mention again how quiet this bike is while operating When I used a treadmill I had to either blast the television if I wanted to hear it or use headphones which were uncomfortable once I started sweating This bike is so quiet you can have the television or stereo at a normal volume If you are interested in an exercise bike that is comfortable and versatile this is the bike for you 
4 0 Very intense workout I love these workouts They are very intense and the results are almost immediate however this series is not for beginners The best part of these workouts is your left feeling it for at least a day My only complaints with this series were the lack of attention Billy paid to the lower half of the body and the bands are sometimes cumbersome to use with certain moves All in all this was a great purchase for me I will probably purchase the new Bootcamp elite series 
5 0 It s better to light a candle than to curse the darkness I write a lot of reviews on books but seldom write one on a product However I feel like breaking my trend by reviewing this lite I like I suppose just about everyone else keep looking for the lite that is right for all people for all purposes If It exists I haven t seen it yet The plain ordinary battery flashlight has remained essentially the same since I got my first as a kid 60 years ago They often fail you when they are needed batteries are expensive but overall they serve a purpose About 50 years ago a hand held magneto lite appeared As long as you kept squeezing it it gave a light comparable to a normal flashlght It was similar to a lite sold for use on a bicycle where it was powered by the turning of the wheel However as soon as the bicycle stopped the light went out For some reason they disappeared off the market A few years ago a new almost similar magneto lite appeared The biggest difference is it made a lot of noise when squeezed They don t appear to have been very popular This Faraday principle Lite has been made very popular due to TV ads More because what they don t say than what they do say many people are disappointed upon getting one The ad flouts the idea that it can be seen for up to a mile So what we learned in the military that a lit cigarette can be seen hundreds of yards away at night So if that s not you were looking for it is meaningless to you In fact it is very poor at casting light on a suface more than a few feet away For this purpose it can t begin to compete with a normal flashlight and if that s what you want forget it As a matter of fact those little LED keychain lites can do just as much and can be picked up for a buck at the Dollar Stores They last for a couple of years weigh next to nothing and you ll always have one with you I Leave them around the house and they are handy to look for something in a dark spot or for the occasional time you need to find a circuit breaker panel or find your way in a power failure These lites are so weak you can t assume they will meet your expectations in a store or from watching a TV ad My advice is try and compare with a Key Chain lite one might serve you as well as the other at a huge difference in cost 
5 0 So Farr So Good We just got it I first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine and I let it sit for a day and a half It lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time Shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long We are in the Caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight This works perfectly 
5 0 Cytosport Vanilla Muscle Milk Fantastic product I am a group fitness instructor and I use this product everyday I add a banana peanut or cashew butter plain yogurt ice and water this is in lieu of dinner I don t get hungry and it really keeps my energy levels up 
5 0 Yes it works This was a gamble since it isn t cheap and the results promised are no different from any other supplement ad campaign I only tried Muscle Milk because I read up on it after seeing it endorsed by an NFL athelete during an ESPN interview I started using it about 2 months ago and have been consistant with the servings daily Two months later my strength has increased my mass has increased and my body fat has noticeably diminished My workout routine and diet was always the same before starting on MM but the results since using MM have made an impact there is nothing else I can attribute it to The fact that it also tastes great is a nice bonus but given the definite results of MM I would still use it if it tastes like battery acid Do not fool yourself it is loaded with fat It relies on you to workout steadily and maintian a clean diet for you to realize it s true benefit You will not get sculpted by using MM without commitment you will only get fatter But if you are committed and use MM as suggested it will most certainly produce a change in your appearance 
4 0 Treadmill safety key Safety key was fine except I purchased treadmill without book and it was not the size I was looking for I took a chance at the size so my own fault 
5 0 Ab review The item was very easy to assemble and it works well and certainly seems to do what it says It is great 
5 0 It s so much fun I don t actually own one yet but my boyfriend does so I ve been sneaking over to his house to use it until I make room in my own home for one When I first used it I was like some of the other reveiwers disappointed that it didn t work my abs the way I expected but then I realized I wasn t doing it correctly It makes it pretty easy to use your legs and arms instead of just your abs so it helps to focus at the beginning on just using your abs and nothing else and then you can really feel it The strap is way too small though I usually just put my fingers under it but there s no way to do somme things that the lady on the video does like sticking your arms through the strap and holding them straight and I have pretty small arms The range of motion thing is great and feels so good on the back which is the complete opposite of doing crunches on the ground I used to do about 1 000 crunches a day but then I started getting bruises on my back from them and I pretty much hit a plateau where I wasn t seeing any changes in my abs I have so much fun using the ab lounge while I watch TV too it s a great way to make the commercial time go by I would recommend that the people having problems with this try to go slowly and really focus on working just your abs it makes it so much more worth it 
4 0 Great mat for the price I bought this mat for my exercise bike It was large and gave my floor great protection I would recommend this mat to anyone that has exercise equipment 
5 0 Sturdy Indestructible So many children and even adults bounce on my ball whenever they come over and happen to see it That s not what it s supposed to be used for but it just shows how sturdy it is My friend who is probably about 250 lbs didn t even pop it 
5 0 Love It The backpack is great It is a wonderful tool for dogs with lots of energy You can fill it with lots of weight and they love carrying it It secures well and dogs love it If you give a dog a job they really feel useful and I think they appreciate it a lot 
5 0 very useful and durable for what it is I ve had one of these for 13 years ONE For THIRTEEN years It still works great PLEASE use it carefully if you re going to use it You can very easily give yourself a very nasty case of some obscure or not repetitive stress syndrome To completely avoid that and any similar problems you ll need Dr Sonnon but in the meantime just be careful 
4 0 Good for recovering lost strength due to injuries Two years ago I tore one of the transverse ligaments in my wrist playing racquetball which was the unfortunate combination of a dusty court 200 pounds of player moving about 15 miles an hour a poorly timed forehand and very hard wall I had two surgeries to repair the injury and it was mostly successful The biggest side effect has been weakness in my injured wrist and hand I have moved beyond squeezing toys and putty but I lacked the strength to do weight training This device has been a tremendous breakthrough for me I have been able to make some rapid gains in my strength without risking injury with weights I am already seeing the difference in just two weeks If you are recovering from surgery such as carpal tunnel or other wrist related injuries I strongly recommend making this device part of your recovery plan Of course check with your doctor and or physical therapist before starting up a new exercise 
4 0 Not too bad This is the first product I ve ever bought to work out my forearm so I can t compare it to anything else but I will say it does work I ve noticed a strength increase in my forearm in just a month of using it It s comfortable and easy to use I would like the highest resistance to be a little harder though 
5 0 Just awesome I used to try to strengthen my fingers using the Gripp balls and later the Gravity Gripp which were grip balls that were also 1 pound weights However they were bulky hard to get a grip on and heavy and pretty silly looking So when I saw the picture of these awesome little gizmos in a catalog I ordered one right away They are about the same price of the Grip balls but they are SO much cooler Not only is this good for fitness training they re even better for musicians my instrument is piano These are light and flat and they fit right into a purse I don t feel silly using this out in public if anyone asks I just let them try it and they are immediately hooked I carried my blue one around everywhere until this weekend when I gave it away to a friend It is difficult to know which tension to use I m a woman with small hands and found that I am right between the blue and the red I use the blue one for 4th and 5th finger left hand I can usually handle the red one for everything else but the booklet says that repititions are more effective than heavier tension I use mainly the blue one now I hope to work up to the red but that will be a while I m also going to buy a couple more so I can work both hands simultaneously I do have one caveat make sure you use these correctly Don t overdo it or try to use a heavier tension to just to feel all macho Like any weight training you have to press the buttons precisely to isolate the muscles Don t use your whole arm just to get the button pressed I found that if I started to cheat I got a little wrist pain and felt the beginnings of tendonitis another reason I m staying on the blue tension for now Oh and buy your Gripmaster here at Amazon They are 15 each everywhere else 
4 0 Good Quality little light I originally bought the Blue 5 lb Red 7 lb and the Black 9 lb Gripmasters for my 14 year old boys The Blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger The Blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so I ended inherited it It is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light this makes it good for use anytime anywhere I have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever If I had to do it again I would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip probably have started with the Red Just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping the challenge is working out the fingers It is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers It has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts Great product excellent for finger or hand exercise good quality 
4 0 Fingers are Thunders Yes I like it after using for 2 weeks my fingers were strong Good thing is that this exercise helps in smooth blood flowing in your body 
5 0 Everything I wanted I went to a lot of stores trying out many differnt treads and researching what I should get I need a good unit that s going to last This one was one of the models I kept seeing and hearing good things about I loved it in the stores but Amazon had a better price and I didn t mind waiting a week to get it I ve been using it now for about 3 weeks and I can see why I kept hearing good things about it It s really sturdy and there was a lot of attention put on the little details Everythings right where it should be it s very quiet and very sturdy I d reccomend it if you want something your going to use every day 
5 0 Thank you Smitty this bike rocks On the basis of the first review here I ordered this bike and couldn t be happier with it This is the first piece of exercise equipment I ve ever tried that is worth the space it takes up I use it every day 
5 0 Great Product + Great Price = Great Way to Work Your Hands Forearms I recently purchased a pair of the Gripmaster Hand Finger Exercisers in order to help build forearm strength As I was unsure which tension would be appropriate I bought one each of the Light Blue 5 lbs tension and Medium Red 7 lbs tension grips I ve had them for a little more than a week now and I just love love love them Perhaps that s a little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up for exercise accessories but I really do enjoy the grips I leave one out on my desk at all times and get in a little work here and there when I stop to read a document or whatnot The Gripmaster Exercisers are different from conventional grips in that you can either work your entire hand at once or each finger individually great for guitar players I ve heard One side features four small levers each with its own spring that can be squeezed together or one at a time The plastic on the flip side is molded together so that you can work your whole hand as one unit The black rubber cushion is removable and you can place it on either side of the grip It s an awesome idea and allows for maximum versatility Just for reference I m a female in relatively good shape but with painfully little forearm strength my biceps are huge from years of Tae Bo though The 7 lb Medium Red grip is do able but challenging The 5 lb Light Blue grip on the other hand makes for a much easier workout I oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things and I only feel it after a number of reps If you re a female and not in great shape you ll want to start out with the Light Blue grips or even the Extra Light Yellow ones and work your way up Out of shape guys can probably get away with the Medium Red ones to start If you ve got good hand wrist forearm strength don t even both with the lighter tensions skip ahead to the Medium Red or Heavy Black Although I ve only owned my Gripmasters for a week or two and can t personally vouch for their durability they do seem sturdy and well crafted My fianc s brother an amateur boxer and guitar player used his for years without a problem so I have faith that I ll be squeezing these babies well into 2015 Kelly Garbato Couch Potato Turned Fitness Fanati 
5 0 Great tool This tools is really really great It helped me to overcome the problem I faced while playing guitar specially the barre chords 
5 0 Works fine every single time I use the IR interface with the Polar s625x running computer and I have never encountered a single problem I usually use the interface in to different computers a notebook at home with XP and a desktop at work 2000 and in both computers it works nicely You have to be careful and follow the directions that come with the IR interface Install the software and drivers before you connect the device to the computer I love my Polar watch and the IR interface is an excellent complement for an excellent product 
4 0 Nice Home Bike Bought this bike for my wife It arrived a day late for the next day delivery The packaging was a little crumpled but the contents were ok The directions for assembly couldn t have been more clear and easy to understand It took me about an hour taking my time to put it together The bike seems solid and sturdy enough to last a long time Also very comfortable 
4 0 Great but a couple snags and advice My box arrived somewhat banged up but apart from a cosmetic scuff on one handlebar it was OK BUT after 2 days I started hearing a noise seemed to come from the interior of the pedals gearbox sounded like a loose object bouncing around I was afraid I would have to ship it back I called Schwinn and the woman asked me to take the pedals off and see if I could reproduce the sound I assured her it was not the pedals She said yes sir now please take the pedals off I did and it was the left pedal Sounded just like the interior Anyway they will send me new pedals so problem solved Sounds like they have encountered this problem before Also I was frustrated by the inability to see the blue display screen so I bought 2 doorstops removed the standard mounting screws and used GOOP adhesive to make the screen lean forward Now I can read it Someone at Scwinn did not do the Q C on that screen issue Anyway great bike now I m happy 
5 0 Baby Einstein does it again Baby Einstein has done it again They have created an engaging learning toy that both babies and parents love The best part of it is they call it the activity star It s what many of those cute babies in the customer images are smiling up at The activity star has different settings for playing music on short play and motion activated It s also got a smiling face in the center and lights on each star tip that flash along with the music My 3 month old daughter loves the smiling face and flashing lights Compared to other play mats in the same price range this one is the best in my opinion 
4 0 Keeps baby s attention We bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old He would just lay in it and would be entertained for a long time which bought me time to do housework around him etc You can take the hanging pieces down and hang up other objects so that there s always variety I d say he lost interest in it though at about 7 months when he learned to crawl I bought mine used on ebay and it was worth the 35 I spent I wouldn t spend much more than that 
5 0 This gym is perfect We originally set this gym up for our son when we moved into our new house and had nowhere to put him he was 3 weeks old As time went on it just became convient to put him on the mat close to us It was really fun to watch him grow into all the toys He started by just swinging his arms and finally has learned to grab and interact with the toys He loves the star in the middle He could spend all day talking to that thing alone He loves this gym so much that we take it everywhere we go I highly suggest this gym for any baby It is something that us or the baby couldn t live without 
5 0 motivating workout I bought this DVD set at a warehouse store yesterday and I ve just finished the first workout There are some familiar moves from the original TAE BO tapes but these exercises are much more challenging The Billy Bands add resistance to the basic moves This allows you to get a strength cardio and flexibility workout in one The choreography is really simple so that even the least co ordinated people should be able to stay in step This is a very challenging workout and might be a little difficult for people who are not in shape If you are moderately fit you ll find this workout to be fun and very motivating According to my heart rate monitor this workout burned a little less than 700 calories so it will be a great substitute for a jog when the Seattle rain hampers my enthusiasm to exercise outdoors 
5 0 Very cute item for practical joke It had special meaning for me because when my two daughters were little they are now in their late 30s I taught them to flush finally by telling them there was a toilet monster that would come out and get them if they didn t flush I caught them both with the Toilet Monster joke and it was quite funny and led to some fond reminiscences It is more funny than scary though it does give you a start when you first open the lid 
5 0 I Bought It And Think It s Great Most posters here haven t actually bought used a Toilet Monster It s a really great joke prank We bought one and used it for my mother in law She was stunned and a bit disoriented then wait for it she laughed really really hard It s not scary just startling The way we installed it if someone opens the lid and seat they won t see it so it s best to try on women Great for the price 
5 0 Which is the biggest monster This monster is great my old millionaire nan came over recently to tell us that she was about to take us out of her will because we had too much money already and as luck would have it she had to use the bathroom during that same visit We heard this scream from the bathroom and when we broke in we found our nan dead on the floor luckily she hadn t gone to her attorney s office to sign the new will and we got our share after all thanks toilet monster you were worth the 15 + 5 shipping we paid for you 
4 0 its pretty big I bought the large for my 90lb 11 month old lab great dane mix and it is pretty big on him Admittedly he s still pretty skinny despite his weight but I had to tighten the straps all the way in order to fit him Probably better for broader dogs but I m sure mine will grow into it o The quality is excellent and there s plenty of packing space overall I m pleased with it especially for the price If your dog is skinny narrow I d order the next smaller siz 
5 0 So Farr So Good We just got it I first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine and I let it sit for a day and a half It lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time Shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long We are in the Caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight This works perfectly 
5 0 EASY TO SHAKE USE NICE EMERGENCY FLASHLIGHT This flashlight is simply awesome if you just have a little common sense This is meant to be an EMERGENCY flashlight and if you use it as such it is great This is definately not a spotlight type of light and it isn t meant to be But when you need some light in an emergency a little shaking and you have some light It s starting to dim Just shake it some more and voila more light You could be lost miles from anywhere and you know your batteries are not going to go dead on the walk for help I don t know why people are giving this bad reviews This is so easy my 6 year old niece can shake it and get it working And if you are smart enough to shake it like the instructions say the light will last longer then people on here are saying If my 6 year old niece can figure it out I would think that adults could too But there are always going to be people out there who complain about everything This is an emergency no battery SHAKE flashlight I think some people were expecting a flashlight that would shake itself You should keep one of these flashlights in your vehicles campers boats kids rooms etc How many times have you went to get a flashlight and the batteries were dead and you couldn t find new ones This one has worked everytime I have uesd it But then again I do have common sense This flashlight is Great 
5 0 Yes it works This was a gamble since it isn t cheap and the results promised are no different from any other supplement ad campaign I only tried Muscle Milk because I read up on it after seeing it endorsed by an NFL athelete during an ESPN interview I started using it about 2 months ago and have been consistant with the servings daily Two months later my strength has increased my mass has increased and my body fat has noticeably diminished My workout routine and diet was always the same before starting on MM but the results since using MM have made an impact there is nothing else I can attribute it to The fact that it also tastes great is a nice bonus but given the definite results of MM I would still use it if it tastes like battery acid Do not fool yourself it is loaded with fat It relies on you to workout steadily and maintian a clean diet for you to realize it s true benefit You will not get sculpted by using MM without commitment you will only get fatter But if you are committed and use MM as suggested it will most certainly produce a change in your appearance 
5 0 A Traveler s Dream I use this pillow in the car and plan to take this on the plane I do not like the neck pillows and prefer the rectangular shape of this pillow It rolls up to a nice compact size 
4 0 Well made but is part of a system I guess I did not read the description an adapter is required to PROPERLY use this I will either buy the special adapter or adapt it to my bike rack 
4 0 Solid Quality We got this bike for our 4 year old and it is sturdy and rugged enough to last the next few years The assembly instructions looked intimidating at first but since many pieces are already pre assembled you can skip most of them It was a lot easier than anticipated The only reason why I gave it 4 stars It had a deep scratch paint chip on the frame But since I got this during a sale for a great price and considering it was needed the next day we kept it anyway 
5 0 GREAT BIKE I BOUGHT THIS BIKE FOR MY SON FOR CHRISTMAS AND HE LOVES IT NO PROBLEMS WITH IT SO FAR IT IS BUILT WELL AND THE PRICE WAS AWESOME 
4 0 Affordable rugged alterative to like a bike This really is a cool pedal free bike We got it for our three and a half year old and he really likes it Friends of ours with more disposable income bought their daughter a Like a bike which is about twice the price I have yet to discover any big difference in performance The Like a bike is certainly nice looking if a bit precious since it is constructed primarily out of wood The Kettler looks fine however more like a real bike in fact and less like a museum piece The only reasons I wouldn t give the Kettler five stars are 1 you need to assemble it and the instructions are not great my husband who is generally a handy guy managed to get it together but not without some swearing 2 the wheel covers make it hard to inflate the tires 
5 0 Best Buy Ever We bought this bike for our bike mad son when he was 1 My hubby had to take the seat off so that he could totter around on it By the time he was 2 he was literally racing around on it gathering up speed and then picking his feet up and cruising along for ages Needless to say he was cycling on a proper bike shortly before his 3rd Birthday He just got on the bike for the first time and cycled off His sister is now nearly 2 and is already following ing his footsteps Dont just think about it buy it And the sooner the better Other friends have bulkier versions but the kids cant handle them like this one And forget the versions with brakes the kids should only go as fast as they can handle 
5 0 Worth the money Our 5 year old hated riding her bike with training wheels because she felt like it was too tippy and we wondered if she would ever figure it out Then we found this one got it for her for Christmas and she loves it After 3 months she can now ride a traditional bike with NO training wheels and she was the youngest on the block to do so It is all due to this bike I never would have believed it since she was petrified of riding a bike WITH training wheels before And when the other girls on the block took off their training wheels there were lots of tears they screamed for their training wheels back And their parents had to run along side them for days trying to teach them how to balance but our daughter just took off and we didn t even have to help her Now we are loaning out the Scoot so the other kids can learn to balance too In fact I just ordered our 3 year old a bike with pedals I m pretty sure he can ride without the training wheels too the way that he speeds around on the Scoot It was well worth the purchase 
4 0 Good but the natural wood one is better The cord wrapped handle is a great idea offering more of a real sword like look as well as a firmer grip My hands tend to get sweaty and slip around a bit with long practice particularly with the sealed lacquered finish on most bokken This wrap really helps though it needed a touch of glue to get it to stay in place The two piece guard design is a nice enhancement too Though you really don t need the guard at all for many applications it is nice looking and appears stronger than the original It s still a fairly cheap piece of wood compared to an ironwood version but at this price it was 9 99 when I bought it you really can t go wrong A nice enhancement over the basic bokken I do however prefer the natural wood version to this one as it looks pretty bad once you start using it and the color scrapes off Nevertheless if you want an inexpensive practice sword this one is recommended 
5 0 this shade tent is the best We bought this tent to travel with our newborn to the beach and it is amazing the setup is quick and we are the envy of all beachgoers It is lightweight and well constructed I highly recommend this to all who desire shade and comfort 
5 0 The Massage Stick works This is the best I love it and use it to roll out the muscles in my tight calves Its made me a better runner My husband loves when I take it to his tight shoulders I can massage him so much longer than I could before This is a great purchase 
5 0 Must have for enthusiasts Never thought I d own a hyd pack but now I don t know what I d do without one This company offers free lifetime tip replacement Previous reviews are accurate no initial taste or odor Take proper care for long periods of storage rinse with lemon juice or baking soda and you ll enjoy a long life out of this Zippered pocket is nice too 
5 0 FINALLY This is exactly what I wanted I ve had so many slipping problems in my Ashtanga yoga class Both my hands and feet would slide and it was soooo hard to hold poses Here is the answer It works great I m very happy 
5 0 Great product I was skeptical of buying this because I wasn t sure if it would work and would stop me from sliding around on my mat in my heated yoga class I had been using a towel for a while but it wasn t helping this product is amazing and I don t slide around at all anymore I even bought one for my friend and she loves it too I bought a yellow mat because I loved the brightness and the only thing to be aware of is that the lighter colors show dirt more obviously it washes out but it s visible during class Definitely worth the money 
5 0 WHY PAY MORE This is a fantastic product at an incredible price I am amazed by the quality and the free shipping makes it even better It has completely eliminated my lower back pain the chiropractor never did that Buy this table 
5 0 Sturdy stable easy and it works We researched for a secure and good value inversion table and decided to buy this model This is a very low price for such a good quality inversion table The ankles are comfy and secure The DVD shows how to incline gradually and adjust it just right As you assemble it you can notice that there is little room for something to go wrong from its good engineering design The best part is using it It feels so good to feel your spine expanding and blood flowing to new areas I can t wait to use it again We love it 
5 0 For wiffle ball or for training your horse This wiffle bat is light and easy to use Substitue it for a whip or crop when training your young horse It will not hurt the horse but will get the horse s attention 
4 0 Very Nice Hydration pack One thing I really like is that there was no plastic or rubber taste on the first use It holds enough for long bike ride and was cold all the way to the end of the ride It feels good on your back too It helps in this Florida heat Cons The mouth piece is hard to hold onto because of the 180 degree angle It would be easier to have a T mouth piece I will be looking for a replacement 
4 0 cubicle farm survival This is a minimalist kit which isn t really suited for everyone it is also overpriced for the items in it What it is good for is to get you thinking what YOU need in your survival kit and to understand that you can make it very compact Overall it s a good starting point and a lot better then nothing 
5 0 Love it Love it Love it My table was shipped on a Thursday and at my house the next day As someone mentioned the directions make it seem more difficult to assemble than it is There aren t that many parts to put together A tip Because of the weight of the box I recommend opening the box and taking the parts to their destination individually Ours is on the third floor and I took about three or four trips to get everything up there I use it daily and really miss it if I don t get to I could really go for some inverting right now I found the cuffs very comfortable Shoes boots are helpful but my body has adjusted to hanging from my ankles even in socks I should get commission on these things The first weekend we had it we had a birthday party for my sister and everyone tried it and many will buy it GREAT deal 
5 0 skates These skates were a bithday gift for my child The really fit well and will roll well even on our dirt drive 
5 0 Best Santa Present This skate was purchased for 6 year old granddaughter and given as a Santa gift the hit of the day Although she hasn t had much opportunity to use them yet she did try them out one evening at an indoor rink and they seemed to work just fine They are nice looking and fit is true to size 
4 0 Twist Board exactly as designed I wanted a simple portable way to enjoy moving my body more This is it I just hop on it during commercials or when I need to get up and move from my desk It works 
5 0 Great bike for beginner riders My husband and I purchased this bike to replace my 4 year old son s 12inch toddler bike Our son loves that the bike looks like a big kid s bike with it s hand brake I was concerned that my son wouldn t be able to squeeze the hand brake hard enough to make it work but he has had no problems In addition the bike still allows him to brake the more traditional way by pushing the pedals backwards This bike will be a great transition into the next level of bikes with gears and hand brakes 
5 0 Great Product at good price I purchased the Valeo 10lb medicine ball for my son who is training for basketball This ball has a very durable rubber covering and has some bounce to it This ball also has the same bumpy grips and dividing lines like a basketball Plus it is the same size of an official size men s basketball Color is also very nice 
5 0 awesome bag i use this bag while attending classes in college and it is perfect for all my needs 
5 0 Classic Backpack In these days and times backpacks bookbags etc have become so outlandish This is a classically styled all american backpack No bells no whistles just a good ole standbye bag Hard to find now a days 
5 0 THE WORLD BEGAN ON AUGUST 14 1953 that s the day that the first WIFFLE BALLS invented a year earlier went on sale in this baseball crazy country Mr David Mullany created the first Wiffle Ball in Fairfield Connecticut after seeing his 12 year old son struggling to throw a curveball Mr Mullany to whom we bow down and show obeisance cut eight oblong slots into plastic orbs that were used to package cosmetics and the Wiffle Ball an American institution was born Oh Wiffle Ball Wiffle Ball it nearly compels me to wax poetic I m now 46 years old but the love that I have for the game of Wiffle Ball will possess my heart long after my body has any capability to throw a breaking pitch My Brother and I were born to a beautiful baseball loving woman Shirley grew up following the Cincinnati Reds and as a child she acquired a nickname based on a long forgotten Big League pitcher As an adult she worked for the Los Angeles dOdGers and the Los Angeles Angels that was before they became the California Angels and then the Anaheim Angels and then the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and then the Chicago White Sox victims She instilled in her two boys and one daughter a love for America s pastime In fact my sister was the first girl we ever heard of to play on a boys Little League team But when we weren t on a baseball diamond with 7 other guys and when we couldn t scrounge up two other guys to play a game of Over The Line at the park my Brother Doug and I were battling it out in a game of Wiffle Ball in the yard We had some outrageously competitive games in our Glory Days We perfected the art of pitching a Wiffle Ball and baffled many a batter who tried to hit us I remember 1990 and a young athletic college student who claiming to have played Wiffle Ball throughout his childhood challenged this old geezer on the UCLA field behind the John Wooden Center Well my screwball was only breaking about 10 feet that day and after taking it for strike three about a dozen times he just shook his head and I concluded that whatever game he was playing as a child it WASN T what my Brother and I called WIFFLE BALL If you have never owned a Wiffle Ball you ve never really been alive my dear friend Although they do tend to crack between the oblong cutouts after some time especially if you hang too many curveballs for my Brother who swings with great authority they will last for countless hours of baseballesque bliss and excellent exercise They can be used anywhere outdoors because the Wiffle Ball weighs only two thirds of an ounce and if Doug never knocked one through a window neither will you And although the Wiffle Ball is light it does not follow that it should be taken lightly After San Francisco Giant man do I hate the Giants Kevin Mitchell won the 1989 National League MVP award he publicly stated that he had really learned to hit the curveball by playing a lot of Wiffle Ball the previous off season One of the greatest hitters of all time San Diego Padre Tony Gwynn used to hit Wiffle Balls off of a batting tee because he could tell from the spin where he had struck the ball Play with a Wiffle Ball and you re in Big League company The Wiffle Balls offered here are the regulation 9 inch variety And SURPRISE They re still made in the U S A The day production moves to Communist China I ll jump Twelve Wiffle Balls are currently going for 14 95 that s only 1 25 per ball Do you have any idea how much fun you can have with a Wiffle Ball Well take my word for it you ll get more than a dollar and twenty five cents worth Now all you need to do is get the regulation Old School plastic yellow banana bat Of course if you really want to splurge you can purchase the newly invented aluminum Wiffle Ball bat Funny story My dear ol Ma bought an aluminum Wiffle Ball bat as a gift for my Brother on his birthday But she wasn t sure what size to get so she called the company How old is your son the representative asked When she said 41 he laughed loud and said I think you ll want to go with the heaviest model One of the great disappointments in my life SERIOUSLY is that they didn t think to organize Wiffle Ball competitions until Doug and I were in our 40 s We scouted out the competition at the Wiffle Ball World Series here in Phoenix a few years ago Players fly in from all over the country We figured that even at our advanced age and with my arthritis we could still give those young studs all they bargained for and more if we polished our long neglected technique over the next year Alas it never happened what with work and life and all the other crap that gets in the way of Wiffle Ball play But that doesn t mean YOU can t fly into Phoenix next year and win the title Get to it man Get yourself a dozen Wiffle Balls a banana bat and start practicing Hint the ball breaks in the direction of the solid half Want to throw a drop Make sure the solid section is on the bottom at your release point Then get inventive there are innumerable variations on that theme You can thank me for the hint when you see me You ll recognize me because I m always the guy who picks up the suitcase that comes around on the airport luggage carrousel with a plastic yellow bat strapped across the top of it 
5 0 wheelchair gloves my second pair Knew exactly what I wanted small woman with small hands and small fit perfectly great deal 
5 0 Great bike rack This rack works perfect for me It as easy to assemble and its easy to use It folds up to put in the corner of the garage when not in use My bikes have curved cross bars so this mounting style was my only option and it works great 
4 0 Its Kool Its a good sword i put it through my room door no prob 
5 0 Very good for the cost It cost 3 times its price just to ship I didn t really expect to be amazed but it is sturdy if plain The sheath doesn t really make it a decent wall display but I think it will out last any cheap show sword 
5 0 Sleek quality This is a beautiful slim sharp functional fast knife The knife is slim and with the clip can be carried easily in your pocket The safety on the end of the knife is a little stiff but can be adjusted so that it is easier to slip on or off The pocket clip is reversible allowing you to carry the knife point up This is a great feature because when the knife is carried in your pocket point up you do not have to swing the knife around in your hand to get it in position for opening The knife can be deployed much quicker when carried in this fashion The speed safe index opening flipper works very well opening the knife quickly with just a little pressure on the mechanism No grand flourishes thumb strength or wrist flicking is needed to open this knife The finish is good the quality is great everything about this knife is amazing A great knife to own 
4 0 OPENS BETTER THAN IT CLOSES The Leek is a wonderful knife but its sword like point is subject to breakage Throwing the knife into a wooden target will invariably break the tip which is what happened to two of my Leeks Fortunately Kershaw lives up to its lifetime guarantee policy and quickly replaced both of my broken knives with brand new ones no questions asked I just shipped them the knife explaining what happened and a week later got back a new knife The knife itself opens beautifully though I ve found that the liner lock sometimes sticks and isn t that easy to depress with one hand 
4 0 Nice Ninja Weapon It s an ok knife That picture of it can trick you If you look at the middle of the page it says we ship black if we are out of silver Don t get me wrong black knives are cool but the handle for it is like some kind of green The odds of actualy getting the silver knife is like winning the lottery so I hope you like black weapons The tip of it is silver if you look at it closeley Just try not to poke an eye out When will you need a LED light on a sword Unless your fighting ninjas in the dark Do you know why this weapon is so cheap I think that it s shipped from over seas so it may take a while to arive Just don t challenge your nextdoor neibor to a duel to the death the day after you buy this and you should be fine P S If you re looking at my account name I am not neil meislin but I am related to him 
4 0 Sharp and comfortable I am very satisfied by this short sword and by its cutting abilities The sheath however is very soft and prevents the sword from quickly putting in it 
5 0 Awesome This sword is awesome I thought it would be cheap metal because of the price but it is even better than some of the other swords I bought for more money 
4 0 Item is nice The item is nice but 15 for shipping on each blade is outrageous I know that if you shipped two of them together it wouldn t cost 15 for both of them let alone separately And everyone wonders why their items are so cheap 
5 0 cool ninja sword this ninja sword is nice and has a light on it that makes it even coole 
5 0 lots of cushion The yoga studio where I take classes has a very hard floor and I have bunion problems This mat is the solution There is only one downside to this mat standing one legged balancing sequences are alot harder with this mat However since I take 3 power classes a week and 4 ballet classes a week I like the challenge The upside is you don t have to worry about putting a towel under your knee or anywhere because the mat is to thick I did place a skidless towel on it and it does move around quite a bit so I would not recommend using a towel over this mat it just won t stay in place I will take the not so bad with the overwhelming good with this super squishy mat 
4 0 Happy with this mat Overall I m very happy with this mat At first I wasn t sure I was going to like the mat because it had an unpleasant smell but the smell disappeared within a week or two I also initially didn t like the fact that the mat was rolled so tightly that it wouldn t lay flat but I solved the problem the same way a previous reviewer did just turned it over 
5 0 thank you thanx for the great mat i hope to become a better golfer because of it 
5 0 not for all kids This bag is much better than the normal bop bags as far as rebound action The old style falls all the down to the ground an then SLOWLY comes back to standing position This one much more like a real bag snapping back and not hitting the ground unless you hit it to hard of coarse My kid s are 4 and 5 years and only use the bag SUPERVISED being taught PROPER punching elbow knee and kicking strikes I would never leave this bag alone with them to thrash on it would break real quick and with a h20 base not good GREAT FOR YOUNG KIDS TO LEARN ON NOT BEAT ON the key is always learn to strike GOOD then worry about how hard 
4 0 Excellent product for the money I live in san francisco and we bike everywhere so I d been trying to find a new bike trailer for my 2 5 yo daughter who outgrew her front mounted baby seat Everywhere I went the trailers were priced at 250 plus I was a bit skeptical about buying this Instep because it was a no name brand wrong it turns out that its made by Schwinn although it was priced at about half the price on others When I research the product I found it to be lighter than the pricier brands It runs smooth easy to attach detach I keep the stroller front wheels always mounted so that I my daughter falls asleep and i wnt to walk around she s can continue sleeping I recently did grocery shopping with the trailer and my daughter It has a rear compartment that fit 3 traderjoes paper shopping bags an additional bag in the front with my daughter and one more on the rear basket that is mounted on my bike I ve also taken my daughter an another of her friends it sits two kids and they loved it Overall a very good product although not a sleek and cute as others like the burley but its lighter and priced much below comparable products 
5 0 Attractive dependable and useful to keep in your glovebox as well as a pocket or purse This knife s single blade a bottle opener nail file and two flat head screwdrivers one large one small come packed in a slimline aluminum case There s a can opener too though I ve never tried to use it and a panel on one side that can be engraved It s an elegant package and lightweight Once you re used to this little buddy you won t want to carry the standard red plastic version The only caveat Don t take this to the airport It will be confiscated NOTE To avoid losing it you can attach a cord or thin chain to the small ring at the end With this a woman can attach her knife to her purse and will be automatically reminded to return it when the task is done A man can attach the chain to a belt loop Until I did this I had several walk after lending them to someone who needed a knife just for a minute 
5 0 Allen 5 Bicycle Rack Very well made product easy assembly and mounting The no wobble feature is excellent Highly recommend this product 
5 0 Allen Bike Hitch Mount This bike mount is solid and well made The instructions were clear and easy to follow for assembly There is absolutely no play or wobble when traveling with bikes mounted The only weak spot is lack of padding on the vertical frame to prevent scratches on the bike frames We added some padding and taped it on and it works fine however 
4 0 As advertised The item was delivered quickly As advertised have not hadany problems at all the stiching was fine I would purchase again from this supplier 
4 0 Great when no one backs into it This rack was great and easy to install But I never got a chance to put my bike on it for the night I installed it some person backed into and ran off What made it even more sad was the bolt that locks the rack into my hitch was bent in the hitch Since I was poor and not willing to pay someone to cut it off I painfully unscrewed it which took hours and blisterd hands Over all I though it was a great rack I just wished someone did not back into it but I know for a fact it did some harm to that persons car truck 
4 0 fits almost all helmets The mirror and its attachment is better than the ones I have purchased however the attachment does not addapt to all helmets I have two helmets by Specialized one I had no problem attaching to the other the helmet bindings were in the way and could not get the mirror attachment to fit properly It would be to your advantage to research and design the mirror attachment to fit all helmets This would help the buyer from purchasing a new helmet just to fit the mirror attachment Whether or not you print this review does not matter to me This review is intended for your design department Thanks for the mirror 
4 0 Handy little mirror This is our second set of eyeglass mirrors They are easy to use and once you get used to using them you don t want to go anywhere without them I even find myself checking my mirror when I m walking and don t have it on One drawback that we ve found is that if your frames are flimsy they could get bent But that hasn t really been an issue for us Give these easy to use mirrors a try I won t ride without one 
5 0 love the color works like a thermarest easy to roll up and store Wish I didn t have to buy the carrying case separately 
5 0 Just Buy It If you re looking here you re obviously interested in playing better golf and therefore YOU NEED TO OWN THIS Jim Hardy has figured it out Forget everything else you have heard about the golf swing and listen to why the proper thing to do is take the club to inside and up on the backswing keeping the clubface closed until you reach the top wherein you rotate your forearms to make the clubface open and on the downswing you need to keep your arms behind you some might say stuck while simultaneously coming over the top to get the club out in front of your body and swing well to your left to complete the through swing i e never down the line Yes this sounds like the exact opposite of everything you ve ever heard But then again employing your current method are you truly satisfied you are getting the most of your abilities In most cases if one is being honest the answer is no So it stands to reason your technique is wrong and instead of blaming yourself it s time to give Hardy s Plane Truth a try In addition to the video series which is amazing I would also recommend both of Hardy s books as essential material You want to get them all to keep reinforcing the proper fundamentals and since each has subtle differences in description and new drills you re more likely to find the keys that really make the difference for you 
5 0 Perfect Fit The Thule Sidekick was the perfect size not too big not too small It did not appear clunky big on top of the car nor was it too small to fit anything in The assembly was a snap did it with only one person no problem It withstood freeway speeds in Oregon rain without even letting a drop of moisture into the box Highly recommended 
4 0 Good product at a cheap price I was looking at the bigger cargo boxes but everything seems so big and heavy I need a cargo box that I can put up alone on top the Acura MDX just the right size The box was easy to assemble less than an hour It is also easy to attach to the vehicle The box looks like the more expensive boxes on top of my vehicle and color matches well with my silver MDX I just wish the plastic was a little thicker but I think it will hold up well The box is sturdy after assembling i 
4 0 Overall good value This item was fairly easy to assemble Would be easier with 2 people but I put it together in less than 30 minutes It was easy to mount onto the roof rack as well Bought this for a long car trip but wanted to take a trial run with it of about 500 miles round trip On the trip we ran into some rain and a couple of quick downpours The carrier held up well I had a couple of drops of water on the inside and that was my fault It was obvious that it was from the unused holes in the bottom for attaching it to the roof rack and I forgot to use the covers for those holes Overall it help up great and expect it will do well for our trip to Florida 
5 0 Favorable experience with Kurt Kinetic Trainer I am very happy with the trainer Most impressively it is much quieter than my previous mag trainer I can easily listen to music while riding without the music being so loud it bothers the rest of the family I ride about 30 minutes a day on it it is a great part of a cardiac risk factor prevention program 
5 0 When the weather is all wrong This Baby Is Alright I purchased the Kurt Kenetic two months ago and am thrilled with its performance and quality If you are considering purchasing a trainer fluid trainers are the way to go Basically there are four major types of trainers Magnetic Wind Rim Driven and Fluid The later is the best hands down Fluid resistance trainers are more quiet smoother and more realistic than any of the others mentioned The only drawback to the fluid trainer is that over time they can leak resistance fluid There are three companies that have solutions to this drawback I highly recommend that you research all three and test them out where possible A good review page is Roadbikereview com The CycleOps Fluid 2 is ultra smooth and quiet They have a limmited warranty on thier products but are known for standing behind their trainers for life and will fix any issues probably for life The One Up Trainer has all the advantages of a fluid trainer but uses no fluid in its designe it is made in America and carries a life time warranty The Kurt Kinetic which I decided to purchase is IMHO the best because it utilizes a sealed fluid unit and therefore is guranteed not to leak These three units are roughly the same price around 260 00 Steep Think of it this way This product is going to be your companion for many winters so don t buy a loud crappy one with crappy customer service You ll regret later that you didn t spend the extra 75 or 80 on a quality product I also tested the Blackburn Fluid 100 bucks cheaper not bad for price but since it is new to the market I was unsure about durabillity or how well they stand behind thier trainers after warranty expiration I have heard amazing testimonials of how Cyclops Kurt and One Up have replaced parts and even whole trainers no questions asked Google these three companies and see for yourself 
5 0 Excellent Product Practice sword is of superior quality For the price it cannot be beat 
5 0 Good Price Great Product I found myself staggered with sticker shock while shopping for a decent pair of MTB glove 30 40 dollars No offense to the makers of these woefully overpriced digit protectors but please I did some research on the web and the Harbinger gloves received good reviews from a couple different sources The price was a fourth of the competitors so I thought why not try them out The gloves are great and I have been very pleased with their performance Not only do they have a cool look factor but they also are well made There is decent cushion no gel unfortunately built into the meaty areas of the palm where you would expect and need it Additionally the velcro connection comes a little higher on the wrist for full palm protection which I like Another nice touch is the tough material used in the palm around the thumb and fingers It serves the dual purposes of protection and grip It is definitely tough and has handled some hard hands first touch downs On the downside I know I might get sweaty hands this summer live in SW desert because the palm area is all plastic verses leather Yet this is a fair trade for the protection and rugged construction If you dont want to spend 40 bucks on gloves and dont need to have a gel cushion these are the best bang for the buck 
5 0 Get a Bowflex Body You won t believe how many exercises you can do on this home gym It takes up very little space and there s even a diet plan included 
5 0 Excellent product with challenging instructions I just wanted to comment on Sarah s comment which highlighted 3 intelligent men and her took seven hours to put it together My son wanted to time me and watch me put it together without help I agree if you treat the instructions with intelligence it will be complicated I took it in parts after reading it fully twice After all the small parts pole height adjustment apparatus rim backboard i carried it all outside and put it togehter One picture was complicated becuase of the small detail being overshadowed by the backboard Overall I got it done in parts total time 2 5hrs with breaks in between Have fun and enjoy watching your kids smile brighten 
5 0 Very good basketball Let me just start this review out by making it clear that i am a huge basketball NBA WNBA CBA fan I picked up this basketball and started dribbling it I was amazed at two things First of all it bounces really high and you very rarely have to keep pumping it up like you do with some other basketballs You can use it both outside indoors although it is geared for more indoors then outdoors Second of all the grip of the basketball is very good so it won t slip out of your hands This has been the only basketball that i have actually owned that doesn t slip out of my hands To wrap things up i will end my review by making it clear that you should go with Spalding and BUY THIS BASKETBALL 
5 0 good gun great price this gun is the best deal for anyone who wants to get started in airsoft it comes with a ton of accesories and although it says it only has 200 fps the distance is much greater and the hop up the only reason i would not reccomend this gun is if you play tournament cause the people who do that have way better guns O yea make sure u buy extra clip 
5 0 Magazine for M4 M16 M83 Only Airsoft Electric Gun great if you need more mags get this it fits perfect it is exactly what it says it is 
4 0 Nice mag Its weighted and feels quite real It only holds 40 bbs unlike said in the product review Buy a bunch of these at the same time because this company has outrageous shipping charges I recommend taping two together facing different directions to reduce reloading time in a match 
5 0 Sawyer Premium Insect Repellent Does a fine job on furniture with a flea problem Instructions indicate for use on clothes against mosquitoes and ticks The active ingredient permethrin is suitable for killing insects indiscriminately Has no odor and recent research indicates its effects on humans is minimal 
5 0 Perfect yoga strap The Drishti Yoga Strap is just great I ve tried a lot of straps in my time practicing yoga Several different studios borrowed friends etc This one is excellent It s 2 feet longer than standards straps but it s offered at the same price as standard straps what a deal It s also thick and sturdy I would certainly recommend this product 
5 0 Perfect My doctor told me that riding a stationary bike or swimming are excersize that I can do with my arthritic knees He s right I love this bike It s comfortable and the computer provides different programs to use or make your own It s everything I wanted it to be I was especially pleased with the service I got from Amazon The bike came in a box that was not strong enough for this piece of equipment and was pretty banged up when it got here The computer on the bike was broken and the tools and hardware for assembly were missing I notified Amazon and they had another bike here in two days and paid for the shipping of the old one back The second bike was not packaged any better but it was not damaged as was the first one I love the quality of the bike and the service that Amazon gives Thanks Amazo 
4 0 Execelent inexpensive Bike I purchased this bike for my wife It is an execelent product for the money it is very sturdy easy to assemble as long as your a little mechanically inclined Its true if your less than 5 2 you will need pillows to get close enough to the pedals Im 6 2 and there is still room to move the seat back Product arrived ahead of schudle and in good shape My folks purchased a bike for 1200 yes it is nicer the preset programs and overall looks but not by much I would buy this again if I needed to Negatives screen hard to read for shorter people and you have to plug it in to a wall outlet 
4 0 Comfortable Quiet I ve had this bike for about a month now and it runs smoothly went together fairly easy and best of all ITS QUIET Something I seriously appreciate in exercise equipment is when I can actually hear the television over the machine The complaints about the box falling apart during shipping is legitimate The bike I received had a cracked cover because of the dent in the box arrived when I was at work or I d have sent it back When I called for service I was greeted promptly promised a replacement cover and told that although they were instructed to tell me ten days they d bet more like 3 5 They even suggested that I consider where I was in the setup before I assembled the bike and whether or not I d want to take it apart to put the new part in Very positive experience now if I could just get myself to spend more time on it 
5 0 So quiet I thought it wasn t working I ordered the Schwinn 203 just a week ago It was eligible for free delivery and I took advantage of that offer It stated that it would take extra time for delivery however it arrived within a week Though several have stated it was difficult to put together and took several hours my highly non mechanical wife and I had it together in about an hour and fifteen minutes The directions are a bit tricky but knowing that in advance from the other reviews helped Once we were finished assembling it I got on it and started it up and began peddling I was sure it was not working correctly becuase there was absolutely no sound at all mechanical or otherwise I then reached over and increased the resistance and found out it was working correctly My wife and I both use it and love it I am 325 pounds and it works great for me and based on several nights of extreme sweating during my workouts I don t expect to be 325 for long Super bike Very pleased besides this is what my knee surgeon suggested for rehabilitating a knee I torn up last year and it s doing fine 
5 0 Golf toy This is an item that will bring smiles to the faces of everyone except the person putting with it as long as the control unit is in possession of someone else It is also useful for true accurate training but a little humor never hurts 
5 0 Christmas 2006 gifts My grandson is very happy with this gift It was well represented and arrived in plenty of time for Christmas I would purchase from this retailer again 
4 0 Works Great but doesn t come with file holder so make sure you have one or you will be doing this all by hand not to safe Missing file holder is the only reason I don t give it five stars 
5 0 Excellent quality makes a difference As the blow up float toys come and go the Sea Breeze float still looks like new and is still the preferred float The only problem is sharing We love it 
4 0 NBA Microfiber Composite Ball The ball is good overall One big issue however is that it picks up dirt quickly and becomes slippery to the hands then You ll notice this well as your hands become dirty after using the ball for sometime Yeah I used it on a indoor wooden court 
4 0 Good ball Only the pros know the difference I bought this for my brother as a Christmas gift He is an avid ballplayer and he loves it He says the surface feels a little different than other synthetic balls but it plays really well 
4 0 Lightweight and effective One has to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this product based on one s needs or requirements IMO the pros and cons are Pros These tabs weigh only a few ounces but can treat up to 20 liters They are very effective at killing off viruses bacteria Giardia and Cryptosporidium EPA accepted This product is great if you can t build a fire or boil water Cons One tab for one liter so unless you stock up you can only support one person for 5 days if you use 1 gal or 4 liters per day for roughly 10 Compare this to 96oz 56000 drops of Clorox for 4 and it only takes 16 drops to treat 1gal of water Katadyn claims that their tabs leave virtually no taste to the water but I disagree There is a very strange taste in the water that is less tolerable than chlorine IMO Minimum treatment time is 30 minutes for both Alternative Boil water for 5 minutes at any desired quantity at virtually no cost 
5 0 Soothing This product is wonderful It sure helps my son rest comfortably with a variety of music We received this when he was a newborn and he is now 2 5 years old and still loves it We keep it right next to his twin bed so he can turn it on whenever he wants and since he knows how to change the music he is in control of what he wants to hear 
5 0 Finally a full nights sleep I had this set up in my daughter s crib when she was a baby It would light up the room just enough for her to feel comfortable but not so much that it kept her awake The music is very soothing and not as cartoony as you would think The unit would turn itself off after a period of time so I wouldn t have to creep back into the room hoping not to wake her This is a wonderful crib toy I would recommend it for any newborn especially those who have a hard time falling asleep 
5 0 Best Water Bottle I agree that this is hands down the best water bottle on the market Take a regular water bottle and add a flip up bite valve that prevents leaks just like on camelbak hydration backpacks The bottle also includes a removeable straw so you can drink without having to turn the bottle upside down My only criticism is that the bottle is hard plastic and may break more easily than the soft plastic water bottles that you can buy elswhere However the lid is a standard size and will fit on most other water bottles Thus by combining the lid from this bottle with other water bottles you can get the best of both worlds Also it would be nice if the bottle had an insulation option so as to prevent condensation from forming on the outside of the bottle 
5 0 Great energy bar My husband is an airline pilot and since they took away his crew meals he needs meal replacements There frequently is not enough time between flights to grab a bight to eat in the airports This is his favorite flavor and often the hardest to find in the store Thanks for offering these by the case 
5 0 Very happy I was worryed becuse the price was so good as to what the quality of this product would be but as it turned out the hats where great and well worth even double what I had paid I got a cubs hat for my son who is seven and my boyfriend for Christmas Both of them had asked for one and both decided to get on for the other one Unbenonced to eather on I ordered both hats at the same time and had them delivered Words can not discribe the joy that both of them had to discover that they had matching hats to wear at the same time Now both of them want tickets to a cubs game so they can wear their hats to it I don t think I will be able to get such a deal on that 
4 0 little League I ordered this for My daughter when she played t ball She played on the cubs team and it was great Very durable and adjustable 
4 0 we like it My daughter loves this toy It s brightly colored and she loves the honking legs The tail part is only about six inches long so unlike the previous poster I really don t see how a child could strangle themselves with it 
4 0 Bang for the buck This is a very good lock in this price range The rubber shield on the outside prevents rust and the light on the key fob is useful at night The only downside is the key You must make sure to insert the key all the way before turning otherwise you might bent the key 
5 0 This thing is great This is the best product of its kind that we could find We bought an extension as well All the pieces are light and easy to move I highly recommend it It s a good thing Amazon sells it since ToysRus is discontinuing it 
5 0 pogo stick My kids love it they play for hours in the garage It keeps them away from the television and computer in the winter They are also exercising while having fun 
5 0 Great Bike for a great price What a beautiful bicycle I thought it was black and white from the photo but it s a really lovely forest green and white It was really easy to put together myself My husband is really excited about it He s pretty tall and this bike is more comfortable size for him than his last cruiser Very happy with this purchase Great price too My own Schwinn cruiser came from a local shop and was twice as much 
5 0 EXCELLENT QUALITY AND SIZE Don t listen to the uneducated reviews here These are great for hitting the heavy bag speed bags focus mitts etc The length of these 108 makes them easier and less bulky when using bag gloves The 170 180 are for sparring and competitive bouts That is why Ringside makes different lengths There is also a 120 length which gives me that little extra coverage but these are excellent wraps 
5 0 Excellent good quality wraps for those with smaller hands These are excellent wraps but as people have noticed are junior wraps As such they re 108 long and are good for teens or women with smaller hands Men should use 180 wraps Everlast sell full length mexican wraps and you can buy them on Amazon 
4 0 Good Bag I have owned this bag for a few years and have found it to be an excellent bag for the gym My size ten running shoes fit fine and it is easy to store behind my seat in my car I am not sure if someone with a large shoe size say 13 and above may have some trouble or high top shoes basketball shoes may find the bag a tight squeeze Overall very satisfied 
4 0 Great alternative to expensive treadmill My 12 year old daughter and I put together the trampoline in a few minutes I use it for exercise I watch TV or put on the iPod and run on it Of course the kids like to use it to jump It is lightweight and easy to move around Highly recommended 
4 0 38 mini band trampoline the trampoline itself is very hard and good condition for its size but the blue cover for the edge which is round i will rate it a 1 is very poor for the price paid for yes it boke already that is the blue cover for edge and i had it for at least 2 weeks on 
5 0 Love it I paid less for this item then I would at a store and it came to me I didn t have to carry a heavy item out to my vehicle hassle with getting it into the trunk and drag it into the house It was right there on my door step waiting for me I love Amazon 
4 0 Razor pro scooter When I first got this scooter it was so hard to unfold that i thought that it was broken but you just have to be presistant the other thing i don t like is how carfull you have to be to not go over or into any big cracks because the scooter will stop suddenly and be dangerous overall this scooter is really fun and worth buying 
4 0 Fun but a tad flimsy This works pretty well to get back and forth between classes although you can tell that it s a toy at heart If you re looking for something fun and easy I recommend this scooter 
5 0 A great economical item We are teaching my 6YO to ride a bike but it s not going well He wanted a scooter so I got him the Razor A2 and ordered the Razor Pro for me Very nice Supports my weight is easy to maneuver and is inexpensive The only problem is folding it up again when we re done this is sometimes a bit tricky 
5 0 Great fun We bought this for our 2 year old on his birthday He loves it His older brother 3 1 2 has the regular Razor scooter but that was too difficult for our 2 year old to use as it does not stand up by itself This kiddie scooter is more balanced and as a result our son can keep up with his older brother Good for the younger kids but it does not go as fast as the regular Razor As a result he will most likely grow out of it in a year or two Definetly worth the money though He just loves it 
5 0 Perfect therapy ball I looked at several therapy websites to find the perfect sized ball from my 2 1 2 year old autistic son to use to bounce on everything was too big and too expensive This ball is just the right size and price and it was delivered quickly 
4 0 Comfortable and cheap Included pump is very weak Better to inflate the bed using your own mouth 
5 0 Victorinox Rocks I had the original solid red Victorinox that was borrowed and never returned It was about 10 years old and still going strong so I purchased this one I came back and bought about 6 more in sapphire amethyst and red for Christmas gifts Everyone loved them Small in size but a real workhorse and easily hangs on your keyring without excessive bulk It came in handy opening the boxes that were taped and the blade easily opened the plastic packaging that comes on most items now I definitely recommend this product If you have very large hands or need a larger blade buy a larger knife otherwise this is the one you want 
5 0 Kermis take me away The Kermis is bad to the bone fast This is not a bike for the average fred The Kermis is super stiff and fast and handles high and tight There is an element of stability on climbis descents too as the bike is a flat out roadster I m thinking of naming my first pet or kid Kermis in hommage to this great road machine 
4 0 Buy it for the foot straps The bad news first The extension cables are VERY stiff and they re shipped in a tight loop Don t expect them to straighten out easily And they don t come with extra clips to attach them to the foot straps I just swap cables from whichever Bowflex station I m not using and get a much better feel The ball is a ball It does the job The little pump they supply with it isn t great but it also does the job Maybe you ll tone your arms pumping up the ball There s no check valve in the ball so be prepared to get the pump out and the plug in FAST once it s fully inflated The mat looks a bit cheap but it s comfortable and it does keep you from sliding around The video is decent Even if you already know what you re doing it s worth watching to see how to do the moves using a Bowflex So far I wouldn t say you ve even come close to justifying the purchase price But those foot straps are just BRILLIANT Once you ve gotten them adjusted they ll go on and off with no problem making it easy to add stretches to a regular workout without losing your momentum But once you have them secured they won t come off or even shift much when you re performing the exercises That may sound like no big deal but I ve used straps that took forever to put on and wandered all over the place while doing the movements The four points for cable attachment are well placed and solid I ve been doing resistance stretches for a LONG time and these are the best straps I ve ever used They re worth the price of admission 
5 0 Don t Give Up So Easily This mat is great My advice for all you yogis that can t keep your hands from reenacting Starsky and Hutch during downdog is to be a little patient or just creative You have two options other than getting upset and throwing your new expensive mat in the back corner of your closet First I recommend that you buy an organic degreaser Give your mat a couple of sprays not too much give it a scrub with a brush hose it off and hang it out to dry This should help Option two is to put your mat in the washer on delicate cycle with cold water and baking soda Don t use soap unless you really want to be embarrassed the next time you start sweating in your sun salutes I put my mat in the washer and haven t had any problems but I m not sure if Manduka would actually endorse that With that and a little bit of wear and tear you should end up with a solid mat 
5 0 Great for a 4 year old I bought this for my son who is 4 He loves it and can operate it whith out any help Good quality and can take alot of abuse 
4 0 Sportline 350 Pedometer Trainer The directions for this product were userfriendly which made the calibrations easy to set up However at times the product is very sensitive and reacts to any kind of movement i e driving to work Therefore for the most part its very efficient and the benefits of knowing how many steps I take each day has been invaluable 
5 0 My nephew was thrilled He s always been a Colts fan but with their Superbowl hype this football couldn t have come at a better time Happy Birthday D Can t offer anything but good reviews on the quality and look of the football 
5 0 great to add to collection great condition made a perfect gift for a friend collecting nfl footballs and the dolphins are my team she won t forget her gave her this one quick service great packaging 
5 0 very good gun i ve had this gun a little over a mounth now and it still works great don t bother useing the scope though it s a peace of junk the guns not acurit enough for it anyway this gun is great for mid range rapid fire don t get this gun if u want a sharpshooter the folding stock was broken when i got it but a little bit of vel crow fixed that easy the strap also broke but a zip tie fixed it don t get me wrong this it a tugh gun it s been drop banged up and runs like new so yea get it 
5 0 whoa now Allright thuis gun is so much more than i was hoping for its accurate and its an incredible price its pretty hard hitting i was putting holes in a cardboad box from 50 feet away im not new to airsoft and i really wish that my first gun was as nice as this one if you take it out to have a little fight with your friends i reccommend extra clips the mag capacity is about 45 and the load time is annoyingly long a very good gun for all abilitie 
5 0 Great Durable Band I purchased the light and medium resistance bands over a month ago and they are still going strong I use them a couple times a week during my pilates workout and they work perfect 
5 0 Lovin his new ride We bought this for our 8 year old son for Christmas He absolutely LOVES It It goes just fast enough and is well designed for a comfortable ride Brakes work very well Riders need to start off slow and get a feel for the turn radius Given the chopper style long nose quick tight corners usually mean you are in for a fall I suggest getting a motorcycle style riding helmet for safety Easy to put together a no brainer Well worth the cost He told us he loves feeling the wind in his face shirt sleeves flapping I think we have started something I may not want to deal with as he gets older Future Harley riders look out 
5 0 Pyramid Retro mechanical Bicycle Speedometer Very satisfied to find this speedometer available Perfect to put with my Schwinn Cruiser Deluxe 7 had been searching for something like this for awhile Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for retro gear 
5 0 Great Chicago skates I am a 71 yrs young female I purchased these Men s skates for myself I bought a size larger and they are very comfortable As an older re learner these skates worked out just great The wheel s don t have speed which is what I was looking for They are indoor outdoor skates They work better for inside skating A great price and a great quality skate Especially for a beginner the Wheels No matter what age you are these skates are the best I love these skates 
4 0 loved them i bought these skates as a christmas present for my daughter and she skated around the house all morning for me this was a good buy 
5 0 Feeling Safer on the Run While I live and run in what I consider a safe neighborhood I feel just a little safer having this baby on my hand just in case and especially when it s still dark in the mornings I also carry it when I m walking my dogs in the afternoon 
5 0 This is an excellent watch I bought this watch for the altimeter for climbing in Colorado I recently went in January and it worked nearly perfect Every location I could find an elevation marker the watch was within 10 feet The thermometer works well also it just cannot be on your wrist to read the temp correctly The watch looks great I wear it to work nearly every day I would highly recommend it 
4 0 A bit surprised I bought the X Lander because I am a pilot and wanted a bit more information when I needed it The watch is well designed and of good quality A few things did disappoint me but I think they are outweighed by the features however It appears that it does not have a second time zone Why they would not include this is beyond me As a pilot I want local time in 12hour format and zulu time in 24hr format A traveler would want time here and at home It is not there but is on other models they offer The dial is not the easiest to read and I had to use a magnifier to see the units information on setup such as feet vs meters and celsius vs farenheit The display needs to be more vivid The company does offer a white face with black numerals which might be better It is a nice watch but not the greatest execution of the concept especially for 300 
5 0 best gun ever this gun is awsome it is the best gun you will ever get for such a good price and guns that are 10 20 or even 30 dollars more the gun is very very light and looks great you can take of the front and the arm rest to make it look like as machine gun or something scope is great and is a super accurate gun i have shot a can down from farther than 40 feet one shot the laser is not super good and hard to use but it comes seperate so you can put it on or take it of whenever a bb might ratle around in their once in a while but it will fall out over all greatest gun ever 
5 0 SWEET I am the leader of a team called POINT 0 I got this gun about a week ago it rocks my socks It shoots about 300fps or maybe a little more The scope is ok and the laser pointing thing isnt to hot but it gives you an estamite at night It holds 21 pellets and doesnt go out very fast the cocking thing is at the top But do not use this in a war with automatics you wont compare unless your sniping I am the leader of point 0 and this gun rocks 
5 0 Best Airsoft Gun EVER I order this gun from HIT on April 11 and i got this baby at April 14 Quick shipping and delivery This gun is very powerful 350 380 FPS with 0 12g 6mm BBs Very accurate too 5 5 to HIT and 5 5 to this gun 
4 0 Been hit with many other guns but WOW This shoots hard I ve been shot by many other airsoft guns but this one really packs a punch my back looked like it had measles after fully automatic The automatic really drains the battery quick though and when its dead it will scare you that you broke it but no it s just the dead battery The metal gear box is extremely reliable and helps it shoot fast This gun is a little overwhelming when looking at it to assemble but be patient it s actually easier than it looks I highly recommend this gun 
5 0 Great gun this gun shoots hard and fast this is a metal gear box so it last forever This is a must buy believe me i know about airsoft guns and this is good 
5 0 best gun for the price this gun is the best for your money and then some great battery life very accurate and strong perfect for competition All metal parts great value probably the only gun you will find with metal gear box for this price its a steal 
5 0 TOP quality lunch bag This lunch box is top quality with lots of room for snacks and even lunch for two The quality is superior and I highly recommend it There is an area for your flatwear salt and pepper shaker and other compartments for snacks There is even a compartment for your soda I have been shopping around for a quality lunch bag and this one is it Great for travel work and picnics for two 
4 0 Reveiw after use of Outdoor Products Ripcord 2 Liter Hydration Pack Graphite I feel this product provides excellent Value for the occasional biker or hiker While cycling I had filled the hydration bladder with water and ice I also carried a 32oz bottle of gatorade in the the storage area There was still plenty of room for snacks keys clothes etc I purchased a Sony portable CD player radio It fits nicely in a special compartment with the headphone wires coming out of a slot in the top of the pack My radio also has a remote which is great when you don t want to stop The chest and waist straps hold the pack comfortably yet snugly to your body so it is not bouncing around The one negative that would report is the bladder hook Rhis is what the bladder suspends from inside the pack I think it should have a latch or something to hold it more securely What I found is that when you take it off it may slip off and then it pinches the hose which prevents drinking I try to keep the velcro that closes that part of the pack close to the hook This seems to help Overall though I am very pleased with my purchase 
5 0 bumper fun These cars can be summed up in two words FUN and LOUD I have two and my four year old loves it and so do all his friends They work great throughout the house and hold their charge really well I am even thinking of getting a third They do leave little marks on the wood floors but it cleans easily Well worth it 
4 0 Bumper Buggie Review When the buggie arrived it didn t work I had to call Razor s Customer Service Dept Their service is awful The Senior Agent was very rude I managed to figure out the problem on my own The electrical unit was not connected Once it was connected it worked fine We have two of them The kids love them They are lightweight and ride well on carpet Overall the product is good 
5 0 Thera_Band Latex Exercise Bands I am very pleased with this product It is good quality easy to use and well worth the money 
5 0 Just as expected the bands were sent in a timely fashion and were exactly as advertised Great folks to work with Now if they could sell me some motivation to use them daily I d sure buy that too 
4 0 Shipment was delivered right on time I d do business with these guys again The shipment made it on time and was just as I expected The only reason they got a four star was because one of the poker chip trays was damaged when I opened the box 
5 0 Great Basketball Yea man soon as I got this basketball in my hands i had to play basketball right away nice grip and it came realy quick less then 4 days great B Bal 
4 0 Small Workout This little device is easy to put together and easy to use Not for intensive workouts however you can pretty much use it anyplace you re sitting down That could mean even while the TV is on Like all exercise equipment if you don t use it you lose it 
5 0 Works great Works great keeps me from spilling on myself especially when I have ice in there Doesn t slip fits just right Easy to get in and out The bottle top screws right over it I can toss it in the silverware spot in my dishwasher to wash 
4 0 Good enough for my purposes Hot water in my flask doesn t stay hot enough for a whole day out and this is a good way to bring my tea or coffee up to temperature I haven t tried heating water from cold it is always at least warm when I start It takes several minutes and the wait can be a bit tedious but it does a good job The clip which is supposed to hold the heater onto the side of the mug doesn t it flops about so I have to hold it to keep it properly immersed It cools off quickly and is reasonably easy to clean with a small brush 
5 0 A full body weighted workout that is intense and challenging without being gruelling This is the first Cathe strength workout I ve tried and I found it to be intense and challenging without being gruelling However keep in mind that this is an advanced workout so intermediates like myself will probably need to lift less weight than Cathe I generally used 1 2 to 2 3 of what Cathe was using in order to complete the workout Cathe uses a variety of equipment in this workout including a barbell several sets of dumbbells a full club step and a toning band but I was able to get by without the barbell step or band although my modifications may have further lowered the intensity of the workout The main workout on Muscle Max is 68 minutes long but the DVD also offers several premixes Upper Body Only 42 minutes Upper Body Push Pull 33 minutes Lower Body Only 23 minutes and Timesaver 56 minutes The full workout breaks down as follows Warm Up Lower Body Chest Back Lower Body Shoulders Bicep Tricpes Core and Stretch the DVD includes subchapters under each of the above categories see Cathe s web site for a full list of exercises plus video clip During the warm up you are constantly moving rather than performing static stretches but I liked that Cathe still managed to thoroughly stretch each muscle group that was going to be worked Also Cathe constantly varies the count which adds interest as well as varying intensity to each movement Another thing I liked about this workout was that Cathe allows plenty of time between exercises thereby providing you with an opportunity to rest AND to change your weights as needed I also enjoyed the upbeat music some of it vocal Overall this routine left me feeling completely worked out yet not exhausted which means that it was enjoyable and has little dread factor I think that both advanced exercisers and intermediates who are will to modify can get a great workout from this video highly recommended 
5 0 Coleman camp stove This is a must for car tent camping The main burner will boil 2 qts of water in about 5 minutes Large enough to cook a complete meal small enough to be easy to pack 
5 0 A great way to go for campground cooking A great multifunctional stove with lots of room Extremely functional with three burners and the side flaps helped keep the wind dust and other campground debris out of your food Propane is the only way to go when you re cooking in the wild Woods were doing some backwoods camping While the stove has lots of room for cooking it folds down nicely making it a great compact pack along A must have for any camping trip 
4 0 Good bike computer The computer is really good and installs quite easily The only problem is the setting instructions for the functions In 11 languages They are not very good As noted in another review I read 
5 0 Shows what you really want to know This bike computer tells you all the things you really need to know without giving you a whole bunch of stuff that would only complicate its use It is simple to install Works great Is easy to navigate And is actually kind of fun to use I love being able to get a small report of my bike ride like average speed distance etc And when I m whipping down the trail I really like to look down and see how fast I m going or get other statistics without having to stop and push a bunch of buttons 
4 0 Must have for sports team This bench is a must have for outdoor sports This is the second instabench we have bought as the other one wore out It is sturdy and can comfortably fit a coach along with many players on this bench The bench itself is a little heavy and bulky but portable enough to throw into the car and go The frame is made well There were only two issues that I had with the bench The first is that the plastic material on the bottom of the seat separated from the top seating material Second is the carrying case ripped after a few months of carrying it back and forth to the fields The top sides ripped along with where the shoulder strap meets the material on the bag therefore the rate of 4 stars 
5 0 Fantastic Cards These are great cards they can be bent and even get wet and the are still good as new They are easily cleaned with a damp cloth Perfect for the avid card player 
4 0 Nice toddler helmet I bought this helmet for my 3 year old He likes it it seems to fit well seems to adjust fairly easily received good reviews from Consumer Reports The only thing I don t like about it is the chin straps seem to twist a little bit between the ears and chin My son hasn t complained about this being uncomfortable but it looks like it might possibly be I can t see any way to straighten them out all the way from ears to chin it s just the way they are attached to the helmet Generally though I am very happy with it Oh another thing in the photo the helmet looks almost red white and blue It s really dark gray and black I think the photo doesn t show this actual helmet but the design style and stars are the same 
5 0 Great helmet This is a great helmet My daughter has been very happy with it and loves to wear it 
5 0 xl camp cot I have camped for several thousands of nights in all types of weather Over the years I have had a wide range of camp cots including the same style as the xl camp cot but not the same size This cot will provide everthing that I m looking for My sleeping bag is wide and fits very nicely on the cot The cot is eazy to set up and take down and fits nicely in the handy carring bag The only down side to the cot is it s not a back pack cot but again neither is my sleeping bag In short it s all a good fit and I hope to enjoy it for years to come Thanks Da 
5 0 Medieval Sword Sword looks awesome very heavy and cool Blade is strong but not sharp for collector purposes handle and point where blade connects to hilt is very shaky but can be fixed quickly Overall sword and scabbard are very realistic and cool looking 
5 0 Great product Received as promised easy to assemble and works well though the fly wheel is making noise and will most likely require servicing 
5 0 So glad I bought this stroller My daughter is 2 1 2 years old 32 lbs and I wanted to get back into jogging After reviewing many strollers I decided on this one for it s price and features swivel front tire rubber tires tray for myself and my daughter snacks and juice keep her from getting antsy on my runs I wasn t sure if she would be too big for a jogging stroller but she fits very comfortably in this one and hasn t complained during any of my runs It handles great too My only complaint is that I have not found it as easy as other reviews say it is to fold up I have a SUV so it has not been a problem but I must say for me it does not fold flat at all and I am not sure it would fit into a trunk But most reviews have have said it folds easy Not sure what I am missing but 
4 0 Great buy This is a great stroller and an awesome price on Amazon I wish I had it 2 years ago It folds nicely and isn t very heavy to lift in my van I use it for walking and the swivel wheel is great 
5 0 LOVE IT I bought this coffee pot for home use in utter disgust with drip coffee makers Having had three different drip coffee makers stop working in one year I decided to go with something tried and true And while you can t set it up to turn on by itself I will never have to replace it again The color is beautiful It is a snap to clean up just throw it in the dishwasher And the coffee tastes so much better I now use less than half the amount of coffee grounds needed by a drip maker and am getting more flavorful robust coffee and no bitterness I guess this is one thing that modern technology can t top I will never go back to and electric coffee maker 
4 0 Different color than shown I just ordered this basket and it came in a totally different color Instead of the purple blue it is a light aqua blue color The basket is still cute it just doesn t match my daughters bike as well as the other color would have I am sure she will love it just as much I just wanted to give everyone the heads up 
5 0 THE BEST RACQUET EVER This is one of the best racquets I have ever purchased Ever since I used this racquet I have been playing better The racquets smooth motion makes it suitable for people of all skill levels 
4 0 Fast and furious Arrived just in time for the snow my grandson who is 9 had loads of fun however it requires the user to have good balancing skills like a skateboard I would have given it a 5 star but it could have been faster had the plastic footing been a little thicker to eliminate the base from warping up in the middl 
5 0 neat idea I got this for my daughter awhile ago but due to no snow I had to wait to actually see if it worked Well it did Nicely made and durable Daughter loved it 
5 0 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa The best bike ramp I have ever used This ramp is good for going slow or fast My friends and I went as slow as we could over it and we did not get stuck This ramp will not breack I live in an area of the country were it snows all the time and this ramp can handle the seasons This ramp has been outside for two years and is in great condision 
4 0 Awsome This is a real good ramp I just got mine and me and my dad are going to build a roll in ramp to put in front of it so you can come down it and get some major air Overall a really good ramp besides the fact that it sometimes may move just a little but nothing major It is good for even people who have been skateboarding for long time They are fun and you will have hours of fun 
5 0 bowflex series 3 treadmill I looked in Consumer Reports for the best treadmill for my dollar and deceided to buy this model I absolutly love it It was very well priced through Amazon com and I thought the shipping was very fast About two weeks which is not much considering the weight It is very heavy and well constructed It does need to be put together but I did it with my twelve year old daughter in about an hour with no difficulty Everything is so well laid out for you and the instructions were great The treadmill is comparable to fitness center models Very easy to operate The folding is easy and it comes down very gently I am very pleased with the Bowflex series 3 treadmill in every aspect and I thank Amazon for making it available for such a good price and free shipping to boot 
5 0 Schwinn Roadster Trike A quality product Low to the ground so very hard for a little one to tip over Easy to assemble Can t wait for the snow to disappear so we can take it outside Have been riding it inside mostly using our legs we re not yet 2 yrs old to scoot around However our bigger cousin just turned 5 yrs old had a blast with it and could still peddle without grinding his knees into the handle bars This trike will last a long time and thru many kids 
4 0 A lot of trike for the money Very impressive though it s a bit big for my two year old He can t reach the peddles yet but manages to push himself around without too much trouble I think the size is really more appropriate for a three year old or a BIG two year old Seems solidly built very sturdy stable and sporty looking 
5 0 FANTASTIC This little trike is wonderful My 2 1 2 year old loves it as does our 5 year old neighbor The ride is smooth and the low center of gravity allows for the racer instinct of most toddlers without the high risk of tipping over I looked for a trike for many hours days and am so happy with this choice 
4 0 Good for the money This is a pretty good quality pack for the money It looks good and feels well built The height adjustment is a little tricky to adjust until you get used to it It uses velcro panels to hold itself in place plus a locking strap to secure it once it s adjusted and you need to pull them both out to be able to adjust it up or down It was very comfortable to wear over the course of my very first 2 day backpacking trip My only real complaint with this pack is that one of the accessory loops on the bottom of the pack which was securing my tent to the outside of the pack ripped about 3 hours into the first day which required me to figure out another way to carry my tent Fortunately there are plenty of extra loops pockets to hold things and clip thing on with and I was able to use those to secure my tent to the pack So you do get what you pay for but this is probably one of the better packs out there in this price range 
5 0 Fun way to practice Great fun way to practice chipping in my backyard It provides a great way of having a backyard practice chipping game with my friends Another product that I found quite valuable is The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide Key Techniques for Becoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better by Patrick Leonardi This book has very practical information on the short game and long game which lead to my improvement on the golf range and on the golf course For leisure reading I also suggest New Rules Polite Musings from a Timid Observer by Bill Maher This book is hilarious very funny observations about famous people in the world 
5 0 Surprising I bought this bottle after reading a review that claimed it kept ice for 24 hours My girlfriend unwrapped the box on Christmas day and filled it that afternoon It had ice still 2 days later Sturdy effective and comfortable to drink from I m going to buy myself one too 
5 0 very nice 6 day cooler however it only a six day cooler if it rarely opened but it a great 3 day cooler in hot weather for normal opening to get drinks out of thant that is very impressive as most coolers can go more then a day or two when there opened frequently 
5 0 Great Product at Super Low Price I can t not imagine having a great machete and it s easy for me to imagine many things I would want one for This one is cheap not very big and of good enough quality and the kukri style is great for cutting brush chopping and would be fine of fighting too if you had too Truly unless you have more money you want to spend on a machete or really don t need one because you never leave your house out of fear and don t play Jumanji or perhaps you have no arms this machete is for you With care chop on chop on SamKoche 
5 0 Nice Product No Problems The best thing about this lantern is that it is rechargeable No extra batteries needed just plug it in and go It is a quality lantern that is bright and functional Overall I am very pleased and I would recommend this product to my friends 
5 0 Best Investment This was a present on our girls 3rd birthday She rode off an on from 2 until 9 She loved it so much we couldn t wait for the battery to run out For the rest of the day she would only stop long enough open another gift then back to the car Quick to learn how to drive it Loud a little bit but hey it s a kids toy If they didn t make noise the kids wouldn t like it Great Toy Great Value 
5 0 Finally a skateboard for a girl I purchased this skateboard for my 7 year old daughter Her older brother is into rollerskating and she wanted to share in his activities however she didn t like the boy skateboards She loves her new Barbie skateboard 
4 0 Kinda Gritty Very cute skateboard Very girly The only thing wrong with it is that it s very gritty on the top which I m assuming it s like that so that you don t fall off however it hurts ouch Other than that it s cute 
4 0 Bike It s ok The bike is packaged well and is easily put together if one does not use the instructions Good sturdy machine A bit pricey 
5 0 Great buy 55cm is for people as tall as 5ft 5 So this works great for my wife but not for me She is pregnant and so safety was my number one criteria for selecting this This is an amazing anti burst ball 
5 0 Great device but let s be realistic I love this Ab Wheel but some of the reviews here are ridiculous like when a woman claims it burned off 20 pounds in a month That s 72 000 calories or 2400 calories a day To put that in perspective you d have to run 24 miles a day every day to take off 20 pounds in a month just through exercise Let s say you can use this devise for 3 minutes before you tire out Heck give it the benefit of the doubt say 5 minutes That means it might burn off 50 calories a day If you did that every day unlikely because your abs would want some rest you could burn off just under half a pound in a month And that s based on some pretty optimistic assumptions So it s not a weight loss device But it IS a great ab strengthener better than anything else I ve use It ll tighten up your stomach like crazy and as long as you do some cardio to burn and keep the fat off you ll end up with a great flat ripped up stomach 
5 0 Pretty Simple Can t really go wrong here A metal post some rubber grips and a couple of wheels It works great and was the cheapest I found Just a tip if you ve never used it before don t try to be a tough guy and do a rep from your feet You may be tough but you might also hurt your back Start on your knees until you know for sure you re a tough guy 
5 0 Best tires you can get I have been using Michelin tires for the last 3 years and I won t use another brand Hands down the best road tires you can buy Worth the money 
4 0 Wish I d been able to try them first The Good I couldn t find these in bricks and mortar stores at all and it was a relief to purchase them affordably through a vendor I trust The 1 lb weight inserts make it easy to adjust the weight with the cuff on or off I have been using them for about two weeks and the effect on my workout and my legs is tremendous The Bad The cuffs are adjustable with two LONG velcro straps that wrap all the way around the ankle No matter how carefully I wrap them I just can t get them as tight as I d like Straps which wrap double back through D rings would have been much more useful The cuffs tend to ride down and dig into the tops of my feet Cushioned by gel or not I can t exactly call that comfortable I m not sure whether this is specific to this brand or typical of ankle weight cuffs Overall I do wish I d been able to try these and some other brands before I purchased them However I m delighted to have found them and with the results I m seeing 
4 0 Don t buy more than one bottle I was taking Hydroxycut but it stopped working GNC lady told me to switch to this First it worked GREAT then about half a bottle down it stopped working Had to take more and more Went back to GNC Told me that anything like this will work when you first start and you have to start switching it up or taking more and more and more and more Told me I should switch product every one to two months Just wanted to recommend that you don t stock up on just one It will work for a while but plan on changing once you don t feel the effects anymore 
5 0 Victorinox Swiss Army Knives in general They are made so well operate smoothly all the time and fit so many useful features into a small package The other review about them just doesn t hold water You can open the knife with a few keys attached without a problem The keyring has to be on one end or the other but it is really not a hindrance 
5 0 Excellent Producr My son was very happy with the product good quality and well worth the money 
5 0 Portable fun While there are those who will deride this product as an air matress with sides it is really a lot of versitile fun for the dollar It gets you on the water cheaply and efficiently It packs down small I ve had mine for the past three years and have taken it on all sorts of water from calm ponds to pretty big waves in rivers with fairly strong current I ve never had a problem It holds me and my now 6 year old daughter perfectly It replaced my old canoe and it has the following advantages 1 the bag fits easily in the trunk of my compact sedan 2 I don t have to worry about the boat flying off the top of my car on the freeway 3 the bag fits easily in the trunk of my compact sedan It is seaworthy I have even taken it out on Lake Superior on a very calm day and on day paddles into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness I love it 
5 0 Built to last a lifetime I bought the large and X large sizes I would say the large size is standard for most travel but the X large is best for packing clothes because they quickly fill up space The large size also includes a small zippered carrying pouch 
5 0 Don t call it a spork The traditional spork never impressed me much This thing is a spoon with a USEFUL fork on the other end and a serrated knifelike bit that might come in handy here or there Consider the spork s obvious habitat is eating typical backpacker food when packing typical microwaveable foodstuffs at the office or the stuff in your wide mouth vacuum bottle at the field jobsite The Light My Fire Spork fits the bill to perfection 
4 0 Yellow Nylon Lanyard I was hoping for more of an around the wrist type Lanyard but this is around the neck and the clasp was not to my use I needed it for the use of carrying around USB Flash Memory but the clasps where to large to fit into the holes made for smaller Clasps I would say these are still nice for the gym teachers and ref s out there that need them for the whistles 
5 0 Simple Step Stool This litle gadget has come in handy on a number of occasions It s collapsable strong light and easy to use I wish the price was under but the best price I could find was on Amazon com and it s what my wife wanted and loves We also bought one each of these for our grown children and they use them constantly A GOOD PRODUCT 
5 0 The best racquet This is the best racquet I ever have I d been using Wilson for a long time 5 racquets This one is the lightest and the most powerful I have improved a lot And no more pain in my elbow tennis elbow Thank you for such a great product 
5 0 Heavy bag spring coil This spring is of industrial strength It can definitely support a heavy weight punching bag of 75 to 150 lbs Better than any made available at your local hardware store It s only about 4 in long so it does not take up much space However if your ceiling beams are not structurally sound no spring coil can adequately prevent damage to them by absorbing the shock of using a heavy bag 
4 0 Great combo set shame about the online info I am writing this review primarily to let people know what to expect from this product since Amazon Toys R Us don t seem to have a clue even the image was provided by a thoughtful customer I bought this in store at Toys R Us because sizing information was not available online except for the size of the box for some bizarre reason and I didn t want to take a chance with getting the wrong size So let me share that information with you this helmet is suitable for head sizes from 20 5 to 22 I think overall that this is a great set but I marked it down a point because it does not include elbow protection From my own experience learning to skate or even snowboard I can say that I would generally fall onto my knees or the heels of my hands so knee pads and wrist guards would be perfect for me But with a young child who knows This is for my neice I am not a parent and whilst I am generally happy with the set as it is I think it would be nice to include the elbow protection which is afterall available in other sets but does not appear to be available separately to make a complete safety package Perhaps we are supposed to buy and extra set so we have the elbow pads and two sets of knee pads or perhaps I am a touch too cynical 
4 0 Good accessory for your tent cot I recently purchased the tent cot and decided that it would be best to have the rain fly to go along with it The rainfly fits snuggly with elastic corners Also there are straps that attach to the ends of the cot with clips The sides tie down in four places to prevent it from flying around when you don t have it fully zipped up My only gripe and the reason it doesn t get five stars is that I think it should have just come with the tent cot in the first place rather than having to order it separately 
5 0 Wonderful treat Treated myself to a yogitoes mat and I love it It s very absorbent great for hot yoga and very non skid It allows me to focus on my practice rather than the distractions of slipping feet or hands Wonderful tool 
5 0 Yoga Cushion I am very please with my purchase It is nicely constructed and a beautiful purple color 
5 0 GoFit 40lb Weighted Vest I recently purchased the GoFit 40lb weighted vest and it s everything I hoped it would be I was looking to add weight to my speed walking workouts and this vest has proved to be a good choice The weight is balanced well between front and back of my body The shoulder straps are comfortable and have given me no problems in hourlong walks The velcro straps are adjustable to fit all but the largest of waists to insure a snug fit and no movement I have even used the vest when working in the yard and weight lifting though it does hamper some bending movements The weights can be taken out if you need to make it lighter I am well pleased with my purchase 
4 0 Red Nylon Lanyard I was hoping for more of an around the wrist type Lanyard but this is around the neck and the clasp was not to my use I needed it for the use of carrying around USB Flash Memory but the clasps where to large to fit into the holes made for smaller Clasps I would say these are still nice for the gym teachers and ref s out there that need them for the whistles 
5 0 cool sccoter I purchased two of them for my twin boys and they really love it it is made pretty strong and can be folded easily The only negative point is that the wheeler can not be extended too much so probably we will need to buy a taller one in a few years 
5 0 scooter this is perfect the purple is a dark purple and my girl loved it there s no confusing this scooter with her sister s which is pink she loved it and can t wait to get it outside to ride all day thanks 
5 0 great product We already have a few of these but not enough to go around They are a lot of fun and hold up well A good buy 
5 0 My Daughter Loves It This scooter seems better than the basic one because it is sturdier It also has a fender type bracket over the back wheel so she can rest her foot without inadvertantly pressing on the brake It can be a little difficult for a child to fold and unfold She is 10 and got it for her birthday 
5 0 Smooth Sailing Scooter The scooter ride is really smooth FAST transportation and really fun down hills The breaking is pretty nice and I like the wheelie bar too You guys will love it get it People say scooters are only for little kids but I m 18 and i m loving scootering around campus to classes and etc Everyone does it and it really holds more than 143 lbs 
5 0 great performance i m just turning 14 and i started skateboarding about 3 months ago i got one of those cheep walmart special skateboards and i couldnt do anything with it then i got these bearings and popped em in and they are slick and smooth i swear this made my board a good 20 times better 
5 0 Awesome value These are just as good as everyone says smooth as silk and very quick Just to give you an idea I get a good 40 50 feet of travel from one push using these bearings They really are the best value out there 
4 0 Light tiny efficient and HOT MSR s Pocket Rocket is a great little cooker Best for going light and fast Perfect as a shared stove among two people and even better for simple boiling or melting snow for drinking water I would suggest this stove for use with a maximum pot capacity of two liters more than this and it becomes a little unstable If your menu is simple and you live on instant meals that require only boiling water this is the stove for you Because this is a stove designed for the minimalist it is tiny and has a very concentrated hot spot so if you are a backcountry gourmet and want to cook pancakes and eggs you might be better off with a stove that has a larger flame spread Again great for boiling water and melting snow but not for actual cooking 
5 0 i could not be happier with this knive i just bought this knive and iam very pleased i bought itbecause of the tool it has like the screw driver instead of cork screw and stuff like that not to big not too small just right 
5 0 Outstanding knife I looked at many different variations of Swiss Army Knife before I decided on this one I couldn t be happier This has an excellent variety of tools for everyday jobs the screwdriver heads the small blade the scissors and it s great for outdoor use at picnics camping or canoeing the saw blade the large knife the toothpick There are still a few tools I haven t used but overall this is one of the best mixes of tools for the money 
5 0 Great for the price paid Great for the price paid Kid loves this Sqarepants products 
5 0 Great product great price Don t pass this deal up Short review This combo is an exceptional deal For the price you get three callaway balls and a swiss army golf tool Alone the swiss army tool is over 30 35 bucks 
4 0 Freestand Any bag that doesnt have a stand will not be perfectly stable without movement Just the way it is So if you think you can by pass this point than forget it But if your looking for a bag with a little more freedom to move because of space or living arrangements than you will be happy with this one but you got to remember its freestand The biggest debate is water or sand does it really make a difference The best tip I can give is not matter of which one but what s under the bag that helps the most from keeping it sliding on the floor when in use When considering water or sand water is easier to empty out than sand but sand doesnt evaporate or get moldy If you have purchased this bag and your not happy because it is freestand than forget the freedom of movement and fill the base with cement there s an answer for everythin 
5 0 Can t say too much more My thoughts on this bag have been pretty well covered by other reviewers This is a great backpack with LOTS of storage space and the shoulder straps are much more comfortable than my L L Bean I recommend this bag 
4 0 Golf Clubs These clubs are great for a starter The best part is the price I wasn t sure if I would really like playing so I didn t want to go out and spend a fortune I found these clubs in the store and they were well over 100 so I went with Amazon and got free shipping The clubs arrived much sooner than expected and I paid a lot less I am very happy with my purchase 
4 0 To the guy who gave a bad review Do you even know what you are talking about I may be a kid but i have been airsofting for 5 years now 350 fps is nothin My ak47 airsoft gun goes over 410 Next time please know what you are talking about before you give a bad review 
5 0 uhhh Typical Aegs shoot 280 310 and most fields that are moderated have a 350 fps limit so 400 fps aegs is great if u wanna play by yourself or in a non official place i also sure hope that a sniper can shoot 500 being they are normally single shot theyre not in the same categlory so your not comparing apples and apples this is a very nice gun it is expensive for the parts included and the functionality this gun is defidently not a beginner gun so i only reccomend it for people who have owned 2 or more aegs previously AEG TM ICS CA AIM M4 G P G G Ect 
4 0 Not Bad Not Bad at all a Definite Thumbs up Another reviewer said I think this product needs a few improvements but in all it is a strong value proposition Here s what I would improve if I were in charge 1 A higher resolution screen so that the GUI could present more information 2 Macintosh compatibility 3 The PC cable should be included As it stands the cable and PC software costs nearly as much as the device itself I say As far as the higher resolution goes I wouldn t want the print to be any smaller especially if you have to deal with direct sunlight otherwise you would be hard pressed to see the readout Concerning issue 2 3 I have no comment because I did not purchase the software However concerning the unit itself I have noted the following improvements which will allow me to grade this product 5 stars Noted suggestions for modification to the eCaddy 1 The clip should remain however the eCaddy should be attached to the clip via a strong pull cord This will allow quick and easy interaction to the eCaddy I have to suck in my gut to work the eCaddy while it is on my belt 2 The order of the Hole Par Handi buttons should be switched to Handi Par Hole Again this will allow for quick and easy interaction to the eCaddy due to the respective position of the Player buttons 3 A thin plastic slot simular to the Player Name Slot should be added to the back of the eCaddy so the user can insert a card with the abbreviate names of selective Golf courses It is very difficult to remember the name of 1 2 10 4 THIS IS A BIG PLUS AND SHOULD BE A MAJOR CONSIDERATION The players default score should automatically be set to the value of par for the hole This will certainly please the user of the eCaddy Currently I will preset the values before we tee off because I know No One will get a Hole in One on a Par 5 hole It is very unlikely that they will get a Hole in One on a Par 4 hole and it is rare to get a Hole in One on a Par 3 hole This way it is possible to not have to be as busy with the eCaddy for many holes Before this product came along I had created a spreadsheet that I uploaded to my Palm Pilot which worked well but was very difficult to read in the sunlight and tedious to use the pen to keep track of the scores while keeping up with the pace of play As far as the price is concerned I feel it s about right if you were able to purchase the unit locally Depending on who you purchase it from after shipping and taxes you may spend close to 60 I would feel very comfortable spending 50 tops for this product Nonetheless the eCaddy was a definite blessing Mike Taylor 
5 0 Exquisite cap Just the perfect cap It fits like no other swimming cap It won t pull you hair when removing it neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning Very resistant material and a great finish Awesome colors 
5 0 Good for not pulling your hair I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother in law but after he opened it we all tried it on I have very fragile long hair and normally swim caps rip the hair out when I m trying to put the swim cap on or take it off This one came on and off so easily without any hair pulling 
5 0 This is a great cap I m on my 5th cap now I think Silicone is great and lasts forever Unlike rubber which can snag hair and latex which some people are allergic to silicone fits smoothly over wet hair has a glossy finish so it looks great and doesn t lose elasticity I have a some advice if you want to try this product that I ve learned overt the years 1 Always rinse and hang dry I ve left wet caps in my gym bag and after a month of two of neglect it develops black spots I don t know if it s mold it doesn t wash off and you ll have to buy a new cap if you don t like the spotted look 2 Pull it on gently I ve ripped one when I was trying to stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it It s not cloth so you have to be careful This goes for latex and rubber too 3 Wet your hair first If your hair is dry when you put it on you will trap air under the cap And since it s not a permeable material the cap will start to come off while you swim because of the air trying to escape inside 4 Pick a fun color That s it Have a great swim 
5 0 Build Your Routine If you can stick to a workout routine this home gym is perfect for you After a bit of assembly you ll be able to do all your exercises at home 
5 0 Freakin Awesome This is something that I have wanted for a very long time When I first starting seeing the Bowflex on those terrible TV Infomercials I thought Wow what a piece of garbage Later on while serving in the US Air Force over seas my squadron had managed to tactically acquire one Along with the rest of our daily regiment of physical training a few of us would spend half an hour or so each on this odd looking apparatus It quickly became obvious that this was in fact not a piece of garbage Just as the few of us using it were showing some impressive results and starting to convince the rest of the squadron of its worth we were deployed to various points of interest throughout the Middle East When we returned the Bowflex was gone and we were all very upset about it It has been a few years now and I have since left the service I sent my body into a sort of accelerated atrophy alongside a bit too much of partying to include too much drinking and too much eating I recently re started some of my training but I could only describe my progress as slow Then I came back to the Bowflex found a good price for it on Amazon and went for it It takes a while to set up so unless you are patient and fairly adept to the use of Lego s I would suggest that you not expect to use it the day you get it If you do as I did I would suggest that you start out slow as I did not I went with one of my old routines which pretty much kicked my back side for about three days and after only one workout The machine comes with a variety of assembly workout diet and overall health aids Keep in mind that the weight loss guarantee only counts if you follow their workouts and diet plans closely Now for the only part that matters Here it is It works Now here s the disclaimer It only works if you work Just like any other machine weight set pair of running shoes etc this machine is nothing unless you routinely use it for a workout If you already have a few machines sitting around you house that have say clothes drying on them then this is not for you Don t spend the money on this if you can t stick to a routine Just buy a nice TV and sound system If you can stick to a routine this is perfect If you want it to work a bit better add a little cross training such as running or swimming 
5 0 Good and basic system The Bowflex is a replacement for one of the older models original by Schwinn that my husband has used consistently for 12 years It came in one huge box and took the two of us half a day to put together The directions and diagrams were pretty clear One piece was broken but they sent out a new one within the week and it is now complete They have changed the power rod holder so we can t salvage most of the old ones My husband did figure out a way to position two 50 lb rods into the new slots so he could use more resistance It is not as compact as the older model but it does fold up somewhat Overall he is very pleased with this purchase we paid less for this one through Amazon than we did in 1995 
5 0 Bowflex Sport Great deal Great price Free delivery You can t beat that I use it every day and have lost 30 pounds 
5 0 It s pretty amazing Combining the simple easy workout with the eating plan my body changed what seemed like instantly I HIGHLY recommend this I m on week 5 and have already dropped two pants sizes 
5 0 the correct machine for me I got this a few years back and it is a very important member of our household still My wrist was smashed in an auto accident many years ago and i no longer have the ability to hold free weight above my neck the possibilities are atrocious With the bowflex if i let go for any reason the potential catastrophe is avoided There is no stress or strain except for the muscle group you are trying to focus upon Well made well designed and very well built Like our Dyson vacuum this is a quality product utilizing quality engineering It may be perfect for the elderly or female male non bodybuilder athlete because of it s non need for a spotter and the ease of changing resistance I am happy with my build i don t want to be bodybuilder if you do this may not be the correct machine for you like it is for me at 43 that is my opinion and like all the others i m sticking to it thank you for your tim 
4 0 WARM gloves BULKY Battery Gloves are toasty perform as expected and are a sweet luxury after a long cold day on the slopes HOWEVER the D SIZED batteries 1 per glove are considerably more bulky than what I expected Most reasonable people would anticipate having to use 3 or 4 AA batteries but no just one bit fat chicken roastin D sized battery Good product but consider whether wearing the big ol D s around your wrist all day will get on your nerves or whether you ll barely notice being bundled up and bulkified anyway May also interfere with cinching up your jacket sleeves when it s really nippy out 
5 0 Deceptive and uninformed review by other reviewer If you notice that when an item is that cheap on ebay that the shipping charge is always Huge to more then make up for the difference Yes it is cheaply made and not designed to last but so are all similar products so it is at least par for the course in that regard Just trying to even out the review I didn t think the other review was fair 
4 0 What I expected I think that the sword itself is great the casing is cool and the mounting wood is nice The only things I didn t like was that the keychain Greiver fell off once I took it out of the box I also wish there were instructions for installing the mounting wood to the wall and gunblade Otherwise I think that I got an amazing deal 
5 0 Keep her running To keep the active mom going when baby arrives No need to change your routine just because baby is here pass along the healthy habit 
5 0 use them every week they do not squeeze my ears and head and the diopters finally let me see well 
5 0 Golf balls move The display is pretty much perfect but as a display it is supposed to keep balls facing forward A litte bump inside holders allow balls to move 
5 0 Very Good Whistle I like this whistle s slim design I wear it when shopping in rough areas If I am apprehended I intend to use the whistle to draw attention to me and the assailant This whistle is much louder than my voice and carries well across other sounds 
5 0 Simple Tiny Perfect an an outdoors locater If you camp hike or ski then this is a great whistle to use Pealess means the cold will not matter and it will blow no matter what the weather High pitched and piercin 
4 0 Leadbetter Swing Trainer It s about conditioning If you aren t prepared to use the Swing Setter a couple of times a week for ca 5 10 minutes each time you probably won t get the benefit it has to offer The CD and literature do a very good job of helping you to define your training regimen to which you need to add only the discipline to execute it on a regular basis The effects it has had on me are as follows a despite my impression that my grip was solid it forced me to assume a stronger more compact grip that has helped me with my tendency to fade the ball b it has helped me to revert to being more of a hitter than a swinger which I used to be when I was playing better by forcing me to increase the speed of my swing especially the backswing and to delay release thus stopping my tendency to cast The quality of construction is excellent I can t imagine wearing it out although I see that the magnets can lose strength over time My main problem has been with a looping swing inside to outside So far the Swing Setter does not seem to address this problem I can still loop and have the magnets release at the desired time I would think some of the other hinged swing trainers would be a better help with this problem I do recommend the Swing Setter if for no other reason that if you have the discipline it will serve as a conditioning device to use during the off season Good luck 
4 0 A Great training aid but This is probably the most complete training aid that covers set up swing plane grip and tempo However i still need video and PGA pro to correct my swing Here is the fault that i found i can snap the lower ball with flipping my left hand and coming steep on downswing This is not a cure for all but it helps The other disadvantage is the magnetic force in the balls diminishes fast 
5 0 First Training Aid I m a 13 handicap and I ve never bought a swing trainer before but I saw the infomercial and thought it was worth a try It arrived yesterday and I went through the warm up and practice First the grip felt very uncomfortable Over the years I had settled into a very comfortable and very incorrect grip This device corrected it immediately although I didn t know it at the time After going through the routine described in the directions I went out to the backyard and hit wiffle balls My grip still felt funny but my tempo swing path and release had improved 100 in just a few minutes This morning I went to the driving range The improvement was dramatic My iron shots were longer and straighter but that uncomfortable grip caused some stray shots with my driver After about ten driver swings I got the hang of it and WOW There s a screen out at 250 yards On a good shot I usually hit it on one bounce Today I was hitting the screen 15 to 20 feet up off the ground Thanks David I can t wait to get out on the course tomorrow 
5 0 Have all the gadgets and this one works I am an avid golfer since the age of 18 and over the years I have tried all the gizmos to get rid of my shots that drift to the right or slice under pressure I have tried the Medicus and still slice and other gizmos swing jacket junk to no avail The swing setter worked for me It showed me a flaw in my grip by the way this flaw was not noted by several instructors and others I routinely play with and also stressed cocking of the wrists to help get on plane I tried it and my shots immediately straightend out and now go straight or slightly left still some over the top but getting better every day I recommend combining this with the Swing Rite for a powerful swing You will still have to work with it a few times per week but it can be swung in the garage or back yard so you don t look like a goof on the range Give it a try it is cheaper than most lessons and certainly helped me Good Golfing 
5 0 Sing with Me Magic Cube This was another gift for my grandson s 1st birthday he loves music and is fascinated with the buttons on each side of the cube and enjoys pushing them I m not so sure he understands that he s adding instuments when he pushes each button but as it lights up and the cube makes music he totally enjoys the experience 
5 0 Great bag Doesn t look like the typical lunch bag that a child would carry and does a great job of keepin cold food cold even without ice 
5 0 GREAT BAG WARM VERSITLE LIGHT DURABLE The Eureka kids 30 grasshopper is an awesome sleeping bag and a great value We have two girls ages 6 and 8 who we purchased the sleeping bags for On an week long camping trip in early spring twice the temperature dipped into the thirtys and once into the low thirtys Our girls stayed toasty warm and comfortable in their grashopper mummy bags These bags also pack well and have a good zipper For the money these bags simply can t be beat 
4 0 Good quality for the price There were a few minor imperfections but i m overall happy with this sword The attention to detail and replication of Cloud s weapon are commendable 
4 0 I like it The sword itself is awesome to behold Though the guard was only minorly spot welded and is loose from just a few minutes of play No I didn t hit anything Blade is heavy would look good if it were not scratched so bad Can be polished up If you know people to repair this I suggest you do so Cool sword Chinese craftsmanship Should you buy it Hell yeah 
5 0 Wooden Sword I m very happy with the craftsmanship of the swoard and the delivery service The exactness of the finish and the wrap was done with every bit of care as a swoard made of metal My son was also very happy with the workmanship and quality when he opened it on Christmas Thanks everyone G Hanso 
5 0 Does The Job With a job that is extremely sedentary 3 days sitting all day at a desk 2 days putting on 220 miles or more sitting in a car this has been a most welcome purchase 5 to 10 minutes on this each day has greatly relieved my low back discomfort to the point where I m able to continue this heavy work schedule in relative comfort If compressed discs are your problem you ve got to try this after first checking with your physician 
4 0 Inversion Is For me I looked at several inversion tables before deciding on my Life Gear and have no regrets in buying it I am 6 2 and weigh 220 lbs and it performs beautifully for me It is well built and the memory foam makes it comfortable to lay on It was easy to assemble and took only a short time before I was using it I have found that just a few minutes will relax me and has helped my arthritis too I no longer have pain in my neck or between my shoulders I would strongly urge people who have had back surgery to consult with their doctor before using any inversion table because they do stretch your back 
5 0 Worth the wait This item in the green was on backorder which I didn t know when I ordered it The seller offered to ship out a different color in this style but I really wanted the green and it was well worth the wait Has scissors tweezers two blades one has a file on it and a toothpick There s an attached ring for easy attachment to a key ring The edelweiss flower design is clear and graphic very pretty 
4 0 Great idea It s actually called a tent organizer and it works fantastic Just hang it from any tent pole and fill it up with whatever you don t want on the ground toilet kit socks towels etc What a great idea 
5 0 Don t pay more for lesser quality With the entire market for rocker and wobble boards so overpriced for what you get it s nice to see that you can get a quality product without paying 50 + more Solidly built of high strength plastic resin and rubber I find this board much stronger and more comfortable than the wood ones I even told my chiropractor that the Thera Band was better than what he had in his office that his supplier wanted to charge me 75 for It even comes with a nice brochure outlining the various exercises you can do with the board 
4 0 Should be standard accessory for all us cubicle peons I love this thing It was easy to assemble everything just screws on and it even comes with a little needle pump Mine doesnt stay very well after you stop punching it or break the rythm If you stick to the same rythm it doesnt pop off The suction cup holds very well but the back and forth motion causes one side to creep up slightly and it therefore loses its suction I d by it again in a second despite this Would probably hold together if i put some tape around it like someone else suggested but its not really a big problem for me People come to my desk and love it Greatest office accessory evAr 
5 0 Fantastic Item Great way to get rid of stress in the office Suction cup bottom works extremely well 
5 0 Red Hot Challenging The previous reviewer provided a lot of good information about this DVD I thought I would add a few additional comments First you get a lot of bang for your buck with these 50 Cathe DVDs they are definately worth the money This DVD has 3 full workouts Boot Camp Muscle Endurance and a Combo of the 2 There are also a number of other options on the DVD menu I workout regularly with a variety of videos DVDs but I m not that motivated when it comes to doing resitance training on my own There is some light barbell work on sevaral of the Firm Cross Training videos but my barbells were mostly collecting dust I found Cathe s DVDs when searching on Amazon When I saw the description for this DVD it sounded like the perfect fit for the equipment I have but the price was really challenging I decided to take a chance and go for it Needless to say I was very impressed and I even ordered another 50 Cathe DVD If you have the equipment barbells dumb bells a High Step Firm step and maybe even a medicine ball and you enjoy an hour of resistance training I would highly recommend this DVD It s challenging for an experienced exerciser but it can easily be modified to to fit any other experience level There is some intense ab work on this DVD too If you don t have one you might want to purchase the Heavy Resistance TheraBand Exercise Band for 7 49 through Amazon when you order this DVD Cathe uses this also and the standard resistance tubing bands aren t a good subsitute Although there is no price difference between Amazon and Cathe s website when ordering through Amazon the Cathe DVDs Videos are shipped Priority Mail On Cathe s website USPS is not an option so they won t ship to a PO Box If you live outside the continental US their only shipping options are 1 or 2 day air so Amazon is a significant savings on the shipping if you live in Hawaii 
5 0 Ever ast Medicine Ball 15 lbs Arrived promptly Is exactly what I hoped for Was unable to find this size and wt ball in any retail outlet 
4 0 Awesome product but shipping price extreme Its foam 7 bucks for shipping Nice product but will shop around for another seller next time for sure 
4 0 very elegant flying disk for night frisbee A well balanced ultimate frisbee with a small battery case The radial glowing lines and the light center result in an elegant glowing pattern in the dark Very beautiful Could be brighter if you want to play in a typical city park 
5 0 Light and easy to manage This inflatable kayak is functional and easy to transport given it s light wheight Once inflated it s easy to carry with just one arm when empty It also has a very sturdy feel once it s completely inflated I would recommend an electric pump that you can plug into your car battery charger With both seats in the kayak there is suffient room and storage space for two adults and gear I have been using this kayak mostly for fishing with my four year old son on small lakes We generally carry two fishing rods gear box bottled water and other related items along with a dry bag Even with all this stuff in the boat there is plenty of room inside and with the seats in place I have plenty of support and elbow room for paddling I haven t yet taken this kayak on down a creek or river so I m not able to comment on its use in that scenario 
5 0 Inflatable Kayak is a Hoot This inflatable kayak is a hoot I bought one yesterday and did about 12 miles on the Truckee River through Reno in it with my teenage son Yes I am incredibly stiff and sore and he s raring to go again First of all realize that this does not handle like a hardbody kayak Close but not quite It is just a pointy rubber raft after all It likes to go down the river sideways or backwards depending upon where the heaviest bottom sits But it can be easily paddled by one or two persons to float just like the real thing About thirty years ago I used to have a fiberglass kayak and went down many rivers here in the western USA I ve worn wool long underwear under a wetsuit to stay warm and have almost lost camera gear and food in rollovers I kinda know how to handle a kayak This Sevylor should not be taken through anything greater than a 4 depending upon the skill of the paddler It rides like a typical rubber raft through crests and holes It might be fun to play with solo in standing waves but it would be hard to brace into because there are no foot heel rests There is no way to stay in it in a rollover You ll just get dumped out On the practical side it only weighs about 23 pounds can be had for around 140 inflates easily and quickly with a plunger air pump sold separately is easily portaged around the rough water has a very shallow draft is made from some very tough PVC is comfortable to sit in for several hours is easy to dump water out of cleans off quickly with just a hose and deflates in a heartbeat to be folded back into the size of a medium suitcase For us it is perfect affordable handy in the waters we frequent easy to inflate deflate store I m thinking of getting another one so that he can have his own and so that I won t get quite as splashed on from his flailing paddling He can also tow old mom on the wide slow parts Sue 
4 0 nice tube This item is well made The tube is beefy and the handles are sturdy The included exercise booklets are lame They have dated black and white photos showing disinterested people doing lack luster exercises 
4 0 Nice These are exactly what they are advertised to be I thoroughly enjoy using them 
4 0 Great Heavy Bag from Everlast Wow I was really pleased with my purchase I ve never owned a heavy bag before so I didn t know what to expect I just started martial arts so I wanted a bag to practice on but I didn t have a lot of money to spend This purchase was not only well within my price range but the bag is high quality and includes a speed bag with gloves The gloves aren t very padded a boxer friend of mine told me the gloves included were really for use on the speed bag The heavy bag comes filled and is very solid the chain is heavy duty and the connections for the chain on the bag are well attached with double stitching I was a little uncertain about just what the Nevatear material was now I know My description would be a heavy duty nylon with a slight rubberized feeling In my opinion better than the abrasive canvas bags yet not as soft to the touch as a leather bag Two other purchases I would recommend are a good set of padded gloves for use on the heavy bag I purchased some padded grappling gloves and for the speed bag you will need two things 1 a swivel attachement I bought the Everlast plastic ball swivel for about 15 at a local Academy Sports Store and 2 you will need to make or purchase a backboard and stand or wall attachment I made mine from 2 x 6 s and 3 4 MDF All in all a GREAT purchase I couldn t be happier 
5 0 More than I expected This kit also includes a speed bag The item description never mentions that Which is awesome but I already ordered one because I thought this didn t have it However it is a small speed bag so keep that in mind The bag gloves are very budget just like they state So I doubt they will last long The heavy bag is fully packed so the box is about 70lbs Other than that this is an exceptionally good value esp with the free shipping 
5 0 Worth every penny This product is fabulous for peace of mind The kit is comprehensive enough to give security for 72 hours I bought some for my sisters and they love them too As far as 72 hour kits go this is a lot of bang for your buck 
5 0 Convenient Resistance training I purchased these for my parents who are both in their 80 s in order to bring some resistance training into their exercise programs My Dad takes 2 mile walks and manages the snow blower in the winter My mother does some treadmill walking They really enjoy using these bands and I think it is benefiting them They are simple to use and effective as if you work hard enough you can definitely feel it 
4 0 good this gun is a good gun after the first charge the problems are the clip jamms and u need to get a screw driver the laserr is in accurate thats all thats worrng good things are after the first charge its powerfull and accurate Its nice and ajdustable for anyones fit Its worth i would think atleast 50 bucks Its just a good gun nothing special 
5 0 Great Gun This gun is really cool It has decent aim great fire power and the charge lasts a long time The only thing i find a little usettling is the fact that the clip only holds about 20 bb s at a time but hey you can t have everything Anyways great buy 
5 0 Great Cushioning I am use to doing abs work and pilates on the carpet but my carpeting did not have enough padding so I decided to order an exercise mat I a very please with my order I noticed the difference right away The cushioning it gives my lower back is awesome 
4 0 Nice Light Very nice Good coverage of light Lights can always be brighter in my opinion Easy installation and good battery life 
5 0 Suunto Vector This is the second Suunto Vector watch i have owned Only because the first one was lost The only two draw backs of this watch is battery life and my band broke twice in two years Seems to me they could offer a much longer life battery and a band that would hold up alot better the battery lasts about 6 months only For the price of this watch 230 you think tehy could do alittle better Other than that i love the watc 
5 0 Sounds like a good purchase I finally convinced my wife we needed to purchase a couple of these for training My sons and I will begin training in Kendo soon I have a few regular swords not the display only variety and are very excited with purchasing some practice swords I understand these come highly recommended after speaking with a couple of Amazon customer 
4 0 portable folding table review This is a excellent product for certain needs It is unmatched for ease of transport I can easily carry four of them at once The only drawback is that these tables are limited in how much weight they can hold This makes perfect sense of course If they were sturdier they would be heavier A common sense approach to usage place heavier objects toward the ends and the legs rather than in the middle on the hinge will insure safety and longevity of the product All in all a very good value 
4 0 MUST HAVE LARGE HANDS IT IS A GREAT FOOTBALL BUT IS HARD TO GRIP IF YOU DON T HAVE REAL LARGE HANDS AND IS SLIPPERY 
5 0 this is good get this gun but dont even concider getting the elecric version its a huge waste of cash there like 70 80 and they only get about 20 feet of range when u point it at a 45 degree angle up yeah its that bad but this gun shoots good 
5 0 how to shoot i just got this gun today and i just opened it but where is the lever or w e u cock the gun with to shoot I dont wanna break the gun right away so please someone with this gun reply and tell me how to shoot it 
5 0 Great for camping or in your lunch box Our family are backpacking campers We make a big deal out of loading our backpacks with everything we need while striving to keep them as light as possible I bought one My Ti Titanium flatware set for my husband We all loved it so much that I ordered more for me and our son They are light weight come with a link to keep them all connected and we prefer them to the sporks When we aren t camping they are in our lunch packs and or picnic supplies Amazon com had them at the best price 
5 0 A wonderful pocket knife with pen to write with inside My husband and his friend likes to hike and one day he and his friend met some people out of state they wanted to share email address no one had a pen pencil so my husband s friend pulls out his pocket knife and inside it is a pen to write with Everyone was so excited to know there is a swiss army signature with a pen to write with inside My husband looked everyone where in stores for this same knife set cause he wanted one just like it could not find it so I did some searching on the net and bought it for his Christmas gift he was so excited to receive it on Christmas morning Thanks 
5 0 Great addition for tent camping I ve spent years camping with a bag of clothes half strewn around my tent so a new tent led me to check this out to see if I can stay organized The closet comes in its own thin carrying case It looks complicated at first opening but it s easy to insert the fiberglass rods zip down the corners adjust the Velcro seams and BOOM you ve got a very sturdy and roomy set of shelves for socks shorts t shirts towels and medication There s a zip down mesh cover to keep things out of your stuff yet keep it ventilated and it rolls up out of the way Pockets on the sides for pop beer cans wallet and the like are very handy and hooks for keys on both sides let you keep things where you can find them easily There s even a pocket on the back that stores magazines and maps But the value is in keeping things organized OFF the tent floor where you can see that stuff without having to paw through a duffelbag and toss things all over your tent I m happy to have found this neat piece of tent furniture 
5 0 Great little cooler for bikers and walkers It fits a suprisingly large amount of stuff I use it every week to take drinks to sport events It s easy to pack and carry on your back and much easier than those cumbersome boxes 
5 0 Locktacular I live on a large college campus and have had my bikes stolen before but with this lock I haven t had anyone even try to steal it It s not as heavy as I thought it would be a plus and it is pretty small so it can fit in just about any larger pocket It feels solid and looks strong too I would definitely buy this lock again if ever need be 
4 0 Very nice These are definatly very accurate The seem is barely visable In pistols these dont really crack but in my aeg rifle which is 360FPS these crack at close distance But keep in mind these are light 12g s and 20g s a rerecommended for aeg s 4 out of 5 nice polished accurate bb s 
4 0 Good Beginner Trainer This is a great trainer to start with some people complain that it doesn t have enough resistance But it does for me I have had no problems with this trainer or any of my Cycle Ops products 
5 0 Very cool knives Most replica type weapons in this price range are just made to sit pretty on a shelf or wall not these Made out a single piece of stainless steel these are very solid knives As the previous reviewers stated these do come very dull but a file a sharpener and a couple of hours can fix that Once sharpened these knives are very useable 
5 0 Perfect Stylish Deadly I would like to note I am NOT a fan of the Riddick movie Though A blade this unique tends to get your attention reguardless This knife is very practical It s a solid piece of metal all around I own a pair of these and used them on a grounded wooden post for hours Yet after my use they shown no sign of bends Chips or dents They shipped to me dull But hey I don t mind sharpening them myself A word of caution You can seriously injure someone with these Their odd form makes them very deadly if sharpened as well as mine are 
4 0 Thera Band This product is pretty much what I expected The latex is a little dusty looking not a clean crisp red at all However it gets the job done for those pilates exercises 
5 0 Great helmet for a large noggin I had gotten my wife a new bike and needed to find a helmet for her above average sized cranium The Bell Triton was it It fit perfectly the first time she put it on and adjusted it I would recommend it for anyone with a good sized head on their shoulders 
5 0 Nice Fit for larger Head I had a hard time looking for a larger helmet that would fit me i even tried using Giro Altas II but not quite Good thing bell triton fit s just right 
5 0 Great little kitchen This is a great little camp kitchen just the right size without taking up a lot of room at the camp site I have another camp kitchen bought from a well known outdoor supplier but it s massive in size and more suited for extended stays the Guide Gear Camp Kitchen is perfect for weekend camping and shorter stays It s compact both set up and in it s carrying bag it ll take up hardly any space while traveling Perfect size for a camp stove on the top table with a smaller propane or charcoal grill on the side table The hanging pantry is strong and rugged with plenty of room to stock food paper supplies etc This is a well thought out and designed kitchen and while compact has everything you d need to enjoy the great outdoors I highly recommend it Buy it try it You won t be dissapointed 
5 0 Great camp kitchen I haven t used this camping but I set it up in my living room as soon as I got it in the mail and it took about 2 minutes It looks great and I can t wait to try it out camping this summer with my family of five I know exactly where I am going to put all of my camping dining essentials on this kitchen 
4 0 Well thought through except too wide for regular cages It s always satisfying to see that a determined manufacturer can significantly improve even the simplest of devices It s a pleasure to hold and use this bottle I like Not having to tip your head up to drink since the mouthpiece is connected to a straw inside that goes to the bottom I ve never seen this design before Easy to flip open with one hand yet you don t have to pull hard with your teeth like in standard designs Absense of taste compared to plastic bottles I don t like Diameter of the bottle is too wide to fit standard cage all the way It takes a lot of force to push it in about 2 3 of the way and it doesn t go further It hasn t flown out during riding yet but I am looking for a wider cage now not easy to find Why not make it standard diameter for bike cages 
5 0 Nice bike for the money I m a small person at 5 2 so this 24 Denali is perfect for me I bought the 26 one and liked it but it was too big so gave that one to my husband The bike was easy to assemble no problems with delivery very quickly I like the way the Denali shifting system so u can see what geer your in similar to my mountain bike It Shifts smoothly rides very nice this is my first road bike and am very pleased with it 
5 0 A great investment for a razor sharp knife This is the best knife sharpening system I have ever owned The kit has 2 medium sharpening rods 2 fine sharpening rods a booklet a VCR instruction tape the plastic storage case which doubles as the base I can easily keep my Spyderco Delica knife razor sharp also my Wusthof kitchen knives Even the serrated knives This kit takes all the guesswork out of keeping the right angle to sharpen your knives 
5 0 The perfect sharpening system As a hobbyist woodworker who works primarily with hand tools I ve had to learn how to put a razor edge on things like plane blades and chisels While I ve managed to master that skill can shave hair off my arm with these tools putting a sharp edge on my kitchen knives has been a nightmare I ve tried numerous methods none of which has worked well About a year ago I puchased the Spyderco sharpening kit Read the manual watched the DVD put my kitchen knives to it and ended up with pretty dull knives Frustrated I put this kit in a kitchen drawer Fast forward to last week The kitchen knives are dull again and none of my sharpening systems work on the knives So I pulled out the Spyderco again and gave it another try This time I tried sharpening my serrated bread knife After just a few strokes it was good as new So I tried it on the straight knives again but only got a modest increase in sharpness Now convinced that some of my kitchen knives are made from inferior stainless steel I tried sharpening my Swiss Army Knife Again after a few stokes on the Sharpmaker I had a wicked sharp knife I was down in the workshop today sharping my plane blades and chisels The last plane blade to sharpen was for a scrub plane the blade on these is very convex so sharping it is always a challenge Fortunately it does not need to be super sharp and never has been The Sharpmaker was sitting out so I said what the heck and gave the scrub plane s blade a few freehand strokes on the Sharpmaker no sharpening jig to hold the blade like I normally use For fun I tried to shave hair off my arms AND IT WORKED I couldn t believe it this Sharpmaker makes sharpening TOO easy It s American made very well thought out and works amazingly well when your blades aren t made of junk steel What more could you ask for 
5 0 knife sharpener this is the best and easiest knife sharpener ever you can sharpen anyting with it but I use it mostly for knifes any knife serated stainless it works great on filet knives it is quick and easy I believe the brown stones are the key they make getting a bad knife easy to sharpen one you might think about taking to a grinding wheel but in a few minutes the damn thing will be sharp enough to cut hair best of all the knife will hold an edge after sharpened I bought one of these 25 years ago I still have it and it still works great I had to buy one for the motor home since I don t sharpen the knives in there before we go and once you have sharp knives you don t go back I love this sharpener mostly because my wife uses it too we always have sharp knives thanks for a great product thanks Ti 
4 0 Works as it should Works well Much faster than the cheap metal swivel that has only the hook If you don t have a wealth of speed bag experience be prepared to re learn when you upgrade to this swivel 
5 0 Perfect Great swivel action tough construction easy to remove for adding air to your speed bag Worth the price 
5 0 gooses review the Jo is a popular fighting weapon in the orient It doubles as a fancy walking stick and can be displayed in a house as an artifact Getting hit with this would probably be like getting hit with a brick because it is approximately an inch in diameter this is a long weapon with some weight to it so it is best used for thrusting or using ones own motions against them I had a friend who perhaps put it best when he said I never thought paying 20 bucks for a stick could be such a good deal 
5 0 Better then it has to be This review is for Nike T 90 Club Team 32 panels I bought this ball for less than 15 thinking I couldn t go wrong I hadn t used Nike balls before so I didn t know what to expect It turns out that this ball flies better is softer is rounder and is better stitched than my more expensive adidas balls Great practice ball and pick up game ball I would have no problem using it in a small club match either As far as my 30 adidas balls Not a chance 5 Stars based on performance vs price I hope you get as good a deal as I did through Eastbay Athletics 
5 0 A good sidearm for basic games I recently recieved this gift as a birthday present The batteries that it came with had a little juice in them already and since the directions said to discharge them completely before charging for the first time I fired off a few dry rounds and a few BB s The blowback is quite impressive I find myself shooting dry rounds just to see that nice blowback action The batteries are charged via putting them in the gun and attaching the charger to the pistol butt so far I ve had no problems The gun looks and feels authentic I have not tried the flashlight during games just yet though it seems very powerful after shining it in my eyes accidentaly p The main problem I had was with the magazine To get it out of the gun you must pull it out there is no magazine release button This wasn t too much of a problem for me just new However when I was loading the BB s into the magazine NORMALLY the two halves of it popped open sending the spring and BB s flying I put it back together and taped the sides together as reinforcement and it works fine now Recommended for all not so hardcore players 
5 0 the best sidearm This is a very realistic pistol The blow back makes it look almost exactly like the real thing It s range isn t as far as rifles but it still shoots across the yard When you got shot with them from 10 yards away they still hurt a little One time my dad brother and I were battling in the front yard and a lady in her car slowed down to see what we were doing 
4 0 Nice bag color isn t like picture We just got this bag today for our son We got the short version of this bag but I don t see that version on Amazon anymore The outside is a very nice rip stop nylon material and soft and cuddly and the zipper is very smooth The inside is a little scratchy but I am sure it will be better after a washing The drawstring around the hood pulls nice and tight to keep out the air The only thing I was disappointed about was the color The picture on Amazon and on the box it came in is turquiose The bag is definitely NOT turquiose It is a darker blue closer to navy color And the yellow is more of a mustard color not a bright yellow and the inside is dark gray But my son likes it anyhow and of course it doesn t affect the quality of the bag I like the fact that the hood turns inside out too 
5 0 Great Travel support I purchased three of these units to mount in a utility trailer They did a great job on the trip of holding our bikes rock steady Very easy to get the bikes in and out of Great product 
4 0 Helps make your Nalgene usable This is a quite good item I looked at a number or similar items on amazon and this one seemed caught my eye It certainly does make drinking from a nalgene or similar mine is actually from a different maker but of the same style much easier My only qualms are that it is slightly expensive for a simple piece of plastic Also it is a little irritating to have to take it out and replace it everytime you want to refill the bottle You can fill over it I suppose but it reduces the flow rate so that you have to fill much more carefully and slowly which reduces one of the advantages of having a large mouth bottle I also kind of wish that there was an easier way to access the lip of the bottle than having to unscrew and rescrew the top each time but that is a general issue with the bottles not this lid But overall a very useful purchase 
5 0 ramp review This is a great skateboard ramp for kids who are really into skateboarding If space is an issue this is a great product It is very sturdy for any type of skateboarding tricks I would recommend having an adult present at all times when folding the ramp because it is very heavy The wheels on the side make it very portable My boys are 13 and 11 and they LOVE it 
4 0 Good Quality for the Price I was overall very happy with the performance of this tent for the price aournd 100 It recently survived well while being used for over a week of backpacking in Denali National Park in Alaska The weight is slightly more than typical backpacking tents but the price and features make up for that It survived over 40 mph sustained winds one night with no damage The two doors and size are decent for 6 foot people without being too cozy The vestibules are very handy for storing your boots On colder nights it did get a fair amount of condensation on the inside of the tent though Overall a good purchase 
4 0 Nice gloves excellent for the price Finger tips a bit too long not a problem just turned them down very comfortable relieves stress on fingertips and palm nice design and fit Hard to beat for this price 
5 0 Didn t know what to expect After reviewing some of the other devices to hold the iPod Mini in place while exercising selected the Armband Carrier It more than adequately fills the bill of what I was looking for Occassionally you might have to adjust the tension on the armband to keep it from slipping down your arm but it holds the iPod firmly in place It can cause some chaffing if you wear a sleeveless shirt if you walk or run with the device If you sweat a great deal while you exercise I would advise removing the iPod from the holder after you complete your routine Would recommend it to anyone who asks 
5 0 help does this gun use 6mm or 12 and if i do use 12s will it damage the firing mechanisim 
4 0 Great Gift I actually bought this for my husband He loves it it has a lot of great features The only thing that we found was that you had to really wet the device in order to get it to read the heartrate 
5 0 Haven t run into a Pelican case that was anything but good This case was ordered to hold some medical equipment that must travel with me on my about two weeks per month business travel The good part is that this case will probably survive falling into a black hole The bad part is that it takes up half my carry on suitcase But that s what you pay to have protection for expensive equipment 
5 0 Keeps Cold Feet Warm We use these socks snowmobiling in 20F temperatures and they keep your toes from getting numb when you re are outdoors for a long stretch Note the amt of head from the batteries is very small but it s enough to keep your toes from numbing out on the trails The don t get hot and they are not made to keep your feet warm inside The amount of heat they produce is not enought to notice in a heated home or office Battery life on high is about 10 hours maybe 12 hours on low setting l 
5 0 Good workout This product does what it claims it will do Put in the time and effort you ll feel great Of course I don t ever expect to look like the model on the box However I feel good and I think I look a little better than when I started Only doing it a few weeks but enjoying it 
5 0 Comfortable Mat I have had my fare share of yoga mats and this one rates as one of the best The thickness 1 8 inch is just perfect not too thick so it s easily portable but thick enough to provide adequate cushioning What I really like about this mat is that it has the right amount of stickiness and grip in a word it is comfortable 
4 0 A very good mat I bought this mat because my gym recently began offering yoga classes and the mats they supplied soon got pretty grody This mat is longer and thicker than the gym s version looks a lot nicer and has a good tacky feel under my bare feet And it was cheaper than comparable mats at local stores It s easy to hand wash and comes with instructions so I can keep it clean Overall it s a great yoga mat 
5 0 excellant quality We didn t know what to expect for the good price But what a surprise this thing is built very sturdy extremely easy to set up maybe took 2 minutes It is very very quiet Extremely happy with purchase 
4 0 Good value I was looking for a bike trainer but did not want to spend 150 and up Took a chance on this one after seeing it being sold by Nashbar and Performance It seems to be quite solidly constructed and holds the bike very steady and secure I got it set up in 5 minutes without any difficulty Only 3 levels of difficulty but this does not seem to be much of an issue It is not too loud but also not terribly quiet about as loud as our washing machine Overall for the price I paid 80 this trainer meets exceeds my expectations 
5 0 Well Built and Easy to Assemble The clear instructions make this piece of exercise equipment easy to put together It s also very sturdy and offers a wide range of exercises 
5 0 Exceptional Equipment for the Money The first thing that I thought was this is a lot of equipment for the money It comes well wrapped and is easy to assemble Took me about an hour It s relatively sturdy although there is some minor movement of the frame when changing exercises eg the frame will move slightly forward when moving from leg lifts to dips Overall I do not see how they make money selling it this inexpensively based on the good quality of this machine Keep in mind that in order to use the chin up bar there needs to be enough clearance from the top of the machine to the ceiling as your chin will touch the top of the machine Most residential ceilings are about 8 feet 
5 0 Great Computer Easy set up and directions and great functionality No problems what so ever picking up the wireless signal 
5 0 Beveled Edges If you are trying to decide between a wood or foam yoga block I can highly recommend the foam blocks with beveled edges because they are very comfortable When you are pressing on the blocks they are firm enough to withstand your body weight but not overly firm so they make your hands hurt from the pressure Blocks tend to encourage proper form because they allow you to slowly work into poses and provide the needed support when you can t reach the floor in a pose The lightweight blocks are easy to move from side to side and they can work as an extension of your arm There are many ways you can use these blocks and once I started to do the Yoga Step By step workouts yoga practice sessions I found I really did need to buy softer yoga blocks to try some of the more advanced positions The Rebecca Review 
5 0 Like my dog its ugly but I love it anyway Three things to consider in a yoga block size material color This thing is purple = ugly The material is foam and this block will still be around 1 million years after I die for a more environmentally sound purchase try cork for double the price of course Finally I like the size of this block most blocks are 3x5x9 this one is 4x6x9 which means that its more stable 
5 0 Works great The shipping was very quick on this item It arrived in less than a week Points for the seller I just started using this item and I m very sore from using it Its working wonders various chest areas Took me awhile to get comfortable using it I eventualy just gave up on the work out instructions and started doing what feld most comfortable and easy on myself 
5 0 Go Figure I bought this for myself to play with I m 35 and after all the presents were opened and toys video games and everything were forgotten about 4 hours after Christmas this was the ongoing favorite of the season Everybody younger down to 8 and older to 45 had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching It s already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such This is a GREAT present for 11 18 boy Fair warning though there will be some good spills on the fairly short steep learning curve helmets knee pads blah blah are a must and a video camera 
4 0 Ok product for the price Got this for my 4 year old niece s birthday she is really into Dora so she was happy with it The skootskate is simple to put together but not necessary the most durable materials Then again you get what you pay for I got this on the Friday sale for ten bucks along with some books so that there is no shipping charge My niece is happy so can t complain much about that 
4 0 DORA SKOOTSKATE GREAT ITEM BUT REALLY TOO LARGE FOR 3 YEAR OLDS MAYBE GOOD FOR 5 OR OLDER 
4 0 good basic paddle good deal pretty decent utilitarian paddle i think this is a better deal than all the other low end paddles out there since shipping cost was zero 
5 0 Great paddle Lightweight well made Excellent kayak paddles I highly recommend these 
5 0 SeaSense Aluminum Kayak Paddles Very comfortable They may be just a tad too long for a shorter person 
5 0 Suunto Universal Bike Pod wireless Transmitter The Suunto bike pod is easy to install in a few minutes and worked as advertised paired with the Suunto T3 Training Effects Heart Rate monitor Unlike other wireless cycling computers used in the past the Suunto bike pod does not require micro positioning on the bike and continues to send reliable signals to the Suunto T3 even in bad weather and over rough terrain Although bike pod includes provisions for mounting the Suunto T3 on the handle bars this configuration is not required for use The Suunto T3 is a wrist worn training effects and heart rate monitor and works fine when worn on either the left or right wrist receiving wireless signals from the bike pod as well as the Suunto heart rate transmitter worn around the chest 
5 0 this is a great product I bought a flybar 800 a few months ago and its the coolest thing ever You can jump super high on it and the people that work for flybar are awesome i emailed them when my ruuber tip broke and they responded a few hours later and sent me a new one for free 
5 0 flybar 800 This is one of the best pogo sticks on the market you can go about 6 feet high jump off of stairs 
5 0 Flybar 800 The Ultimate Pogo Stick My three sons and I saw these pogos demonstrated at the Cleveland X Games a couple years ago We could not beleive what we saw This is unlike any pogo stick you have ever seen For the money it s a tremendous value and their customer service is the best I have come across They also make a high er octane version called the Flybar 1200 which supports larger riders For adults yes adults will love this thing or kids this is a must have this Christmas My youngest son can t wait for their next model Flybar 400 due in 07 I believe An absolute 100 thumbs up Jim Woods Akron Ohi 
5 0 Great I bought this for my brother he loved it I was worried that it is a little big but apparently fisherman have a lot of stuff He said it was just right 
5 0 Great for a re beginner I bought this bike for myself and I love it I got it for half the listed price It was originally intended as a starter to introduce myself back in to biking at 30+yrs old but I m going to stick with it The other buyer with the bad experience must have gotten a bad bike The brakes are excellent and the bike itself including shocks are just as sturdy as my husband s expensive pro bike The 24inch is perfect for me being barely five foot two and doesn t seem too juvenile in stature or in color I highly recommend this bike 
5 0 Ouch I burned my hand but it was ok I got to keep 3 of my fingers They work fine but they re a bit too hot 
4 0 Emergency Lantern This is a fine product and very adequate to meet our requirements We received it promptly in good condition 
5 0 My GE lantern has given me years of service I bought a red GE Lantern a couple of years ago I have used it for power outages walking my dogs morning and night during the winter and rarely I ve even used it for camping I haven t done any definitive studies but the battery life seems to be longer than the 16 hours GE states I find the light to be strong enough to read by During dog walks the lantern has all but been submerged in rain and it hasn t phased it And it s performance has not been affected by colder temperatures even down in the teens Though I have to admit neither the dogs or I wanted to be out very long in weather that cold The workmanship is very nice I recently looked at Coleman lanterns and they have gone to a flimsy plastic top The GE lantern is built very sturdily but is light enough to carry in one hand and still control a leashed dog The only downside I ve found and I don t consider this a big issue if the lantern is knocked hard enough say you slip and fall down a ravine in the rain the batteries will slip out of place somewhat and the light will either dim or go out It is easy to fix just transfer both dog leashes to one hand turn the lantern upside down unscrew the base enough so the batteries can be settled back where they belong and tighten the base back up I would definitely purchase another GE lantern 
5 0 Very cool Product This product generatesa lot of attention I like this one very much and looks very cool and very handy It is very small when compared with other products in the market for a similar kind The bright red LED is kinda OK Ball point pen is very handy though the quality of the tip is not very good 
5 0 Great beginner racquet I started taking tennis classes at my community college a couple weeks ago I picked up this racquet because it was cheap and light with a big head It has performed very well and my game is good enough to play with some of the more experienced players that have 200+ racquets 
5 0 The best umbrella I ve ever seen I bought this for my husband last year and it s still in good condition We love it The whole family can fit under it It keeps the wind out really well due to the double layers It never ever turns inside out 
4 0 Pretty Good The are pretty comfy and definitly help out your hands and wrists during workouts Unfortunatly the wear out pretty easily a the seams I saw them cheaper at Hibbets after I ordered them from here Oh well only like a three dollar difference I ll know next time when I get another pair in about two months 
5 0 Excellent Camping Tool But Hotter Than a Traditional Slow Cooker This is an excellent idea and greatly expands menu options while camping You have to remember it is not a crock pot though the 6qt container is steel and not stoneware I didn t Therefore a crock pot dish that took 10hrs on low was done in 30min on low with this product certainly this is not the product s fault but owner error A very good product highly recommended for campers and tailgaters 
5 0 Happy Soldier I m currently in Iraq and I ordered this bike although it took a while to get it not uncommon in a package that is 90 percent medal I was happy when finally I recieved it I had a little trouble putting the brakes on and warped the alumimum screws that hold the brakes cables to the levers After my small mishap I was on my way riding in 30 mins or less I ve had the bike for about three months or more and it has stood up to all sorts of terrain and weather During the summer tempertures can reach 130 during the day and I had no issues with paint or the mechanics period Now its the winter season and tempertures drop down to 30 and it rains often still no major damage or issues other than a little rust on the four screws holding the handle bars in place I ve taken this bike threw rocks dirt asphalt and plenty of sand After a quick spray with the hose and wipe with a dry rag the bike is just as glossy and bold as the day I took it out of the box Overall I am very pleased with this bike and plan to bring it back to the States with me when my tour is up 
4 0 Schwinn Women s Ranger Bike Living in Europe my husband and I were dubious about ordering a bicycle for our daughter who lives in USA However knowing the reputation of Amazon we risked it Our final choice was the Women s Ranger by Schwinn It was assembled by a friend without any problems as the excellent manual was most comprehensive The bike is beautiful and we and our daughter are thrilled It is made of high quality components yet is fairly light It is sturdy enough to handle the roughest city streets which is where our daughter will be cycling The gear shift is smooth and effortless and the brakes excellent As a footnote the first bike arrived with slight defects was returned to Amazon who sent a replacement before even receiving the first bike back We were most impressed The second bike is perfect It looks so good too quite important for women 
5 0 Totaly Impressed with ours The wife and me each got a set and tried it out today We were surprised everything was great quality and looked nice The fins are great cut right thru the water The snorkle is also great kept water totaly out in waves and when diving The mask was good ok You can t go wrong with this package Wish I would have got the other US Divers kit with the little better mask and same fins for a few bucks more We are happy Dan Melissa 
4 0 OUR PERSONAL CADDIE Bought this for my husband for Father s Day Delivered in no time He loved it I let him do the registration etc because he has more patience than I It works very well Bought the vice like attachment too so it could go in every golf cart we use including our own I LOVE IT I have trouble judging distances and this is our co toy now The battery went dead too soon We called Sky Golf and they are sending a free one out posthaste We even bought the 19 95 warranty for one year It s worth it 
5 0 Great Tool to Improve Your Game and Your Knowledge of the Courses You Play I have used this unit twice and have been more impressed each time First time was a loaner from my favorite golf shop and the second was the unit that I just purchased My reaction WOW Great tool for golfers at all skill levels The information presented appears to be extremely accurate and is much more accurate than guessing or finding a marker and then interpolating distances I found the IntelliGreen feature extremely useful I was able to shoot at several greens unseen whereas before I would have laid up in a safe visible landing zone short of the green The target lists were consistent with the features I was concerned about on most holes If anything I found the target list to contain too many items I found registration and set up a bit tedious and would like to Sky Golf make it easier Be sure to read the installation instructions in the manual very closely Your internet browser MUST be set to allow cookies from Sky Golf Otherwise you may spend all day and never get set up or be able to download courses The variety of plans for course downloads is adequate but I wish they would include at least a 1 year subscription to the basic PAR Sky Player course download plan with the purchase of the unit Others have complained about quality and construction I don t know what their standards are but my unit seems well constructed and of very high quality material Bottom line if you can afford it and you re looking for a great product to improve you knowledge of the golf courses you play then this product is for you 
5 0 Looks nice good quality Can t beat this cabinet for the price Pine wood makes it very light but sturdy Looks nice on the wall 
4 0 bike Seems to be a good bike Haven t had time to ride it much yet 
5 0 Love it This was such an unusual and unique idea I gave it as a gift and the person really liked it It s different than the usual type of world series champions type posters The artist who made this was very creative 
5 0 Amazing mat I ve been doing yoga for 7 years I ve gone through a couple of regular sticky mats by now I don t like how they get stretchy after a couple of years so I decided to buy something more durable I love the texture of this mat it s very solid feeling with a good bit of stick and it doesn t move around at all It has just the right amount of cushion to it and I use it on a hard floor I also bought the Lumi towel large size also by Manduka to put on the mat since my hands and feet tend to sweat by the time I get to the middle of my routine and this can make any mat slippery I didn t have any trouble with the coating on the mat it wore off after a little bit and I used the towel until it did I also didn t agree with some of the other reviews saying it was too heavy It s a bit heavy but not too much to carry around all over I made a carry handle from a yoga strap looped over both ends of the rolled up mat and throw it over my shoulder 
4 0 Manduka 71 Inch Yoga Mat Great mat Provides good purchase even when getting sweaty It is a bit short if you are above 6ft like me to do Ashtanga but is great for Hatha Yoga 
5 0 All around exercise mat Expensive but I use it for aerobic and occasional high impact exercises as well as yoga Very satisfied 
5 0 It fulfils its responsibilities I have recently purchased this item I think that it is cheaper to by the new tube than buying patches for holes in a tube 
5 0 Actually 4 75 Stars A little caveat this review is actually for the exact same flooring system in the 1 x1 size tiles which worked out better for me because they are a little more flexible in terms of configuration for a smaller space That said these floor mats are really great I wanted to create a home gym space for doing floor aerobics step workouts as well as pilates yoga weighted workouts etc These fit the bill absolutely perfectly They are stiff enough that there s no danger of ankle instability because of a too soft surface but they are soft enough that when you do floor work they provide excellent cushioning My knees used to kill me when I would do a runner s stretch but now I actually go ahhhh as I m doing them which is great Not even a smidge of discomfort They are also really great for absorbing the jarring of high impact activities Talk about an ankle knee and hip saver The ONLY discomfort I still notice and I really think it s just me is during floorwork when I m on my side to do leg lifts I have some problems in the area of the greater trochanter bony prominence at the top of the femur But I am very sensitive in that area due to running a marathon recently so again I really think it s just me Anyway I just can t say enough good things about these mats I highly recommend them Now to address the title of my review My ONLY complaint about the mats and I m echoing another recent reviewer on this is that when I first put them down they slid all over the place on my hardwood floors Because they are not completely wall to wall in the configuration I had them this was a problem I was able to solve the problem completely though by buying one of those sticky under carpet anti slip pads that you can get very inexpensively I found a yoga sticky mat placed underneath did the trick as well But I would have had to put about 3 yoga sticky mats underneath to cover enough surface area to keep it from slipping In short if you have hardwood floors like me I don t know how they would perform on carpet or other surface you d have to see another review to check on that I highly recommend these mats without reservation provided you are willing to shell out a tiny bit of extra dough to get an anti slip pad to put underneath Also if you do be sure to get one that covers the whole area of the mat or very close to it Otherwise if you come down on a part that s not protected during a lateral move you may find yourself sliding across the room and losing your balance A little expensive but really worth the investment in my opinion Happy sweating to you or whatever activities you plan to use the mats for 
4 0 Ironman tuff Great flooring system Easy to assemble and very strong Expensive but worth it 
4 0 Good product good price minor issues These mats are easy to use and pretty durable but I find them to be too slippery Not enough friction A thin rubber surface would be much better 
5 0 Great bike By wife and I bought both the men and womens model They were a great buy arrived on time and were easy to assemble They re comfortable to ride and seem to be well built Enjoy 
5 0 A very Good Deal I ultimately purchased 4 of these bikes for my beach house They are very reasonably priced and provide a sturdy ride They look like a true beach cruiser and have fenders a feature not often found on less expensive cruiser bikes They are easy to assemble They were shipped quickly and arrived safe and sound The ride can be a bit stiff but for the price you cannot complain 
4 0 Well built These gloves are extremely high quality They do a great job of protecting your hands and for most exercises they do help your grip The have the best wrist support of any glove I ve used to date However as mentioned if you have small hands the added padding rubber in the gloves will decrease the circumference of your grip in general This is a problem for exercises like deadlifts chin ups etc Also the material inside is a bit like felt When your hands are sweaty these gloves basically adhere to your hand on the inside and it usually takes me 1 2 minutes to get them off They may just need to be broken in more but I ve used them for 3 weeks thus far 
5 0 Great bicycle prep I have 6 children 4 couldn t ride bikes The scooters teach balance without worry about pedaling The kids feel safer because they can hop off easier Now 5 out of 6 of my children are riding bikes and the last probably will be soon Great toy 
5 0 Perfect for a 7 year old Bought it for daughter s Christmas gift She loves it Cool color Adjustable height is useful for her short height She is very proud with it Bigger wheels gives a bit more stability 
5 0 Razor A Kick Scooter KICKS A S Purchased for a Christmas gift The larger wheels and stronger construction was just what my son needed He had the orignial A scooter for several years but is now a teen and was in need of a new razor with stronger construction He was also wanting the wheely kick bar over the back wheel Overall the A3 gave him everything he needed to continue enjoying the Razor Kick stand would have been a nice addition to this model but no big sweat can just be one more thing to break in my opinion Price on Amazon couldn t be beat Price was by far the best from a host of on line sites I checked Shipping was great deal and came quickly within 3 or 4 days after ordering it just a week before Christmas In the word of my son Santa be very very good to me 
4 0 free weight dumbell good product easy to use good price like having the neoprene cover over the metal makes it softer to hold 
4 0 apex roman bench for the price not a bad piece of home gym equipment cushion could be softer but overall it works the back abs real good 
5 0 Apex Roman Chair I am very satisfied with the Apex Chair I used one many years ago in a gym I looked on line and found it on Amazon com Apex instructions were very easy to follow This peace of equipment is very well constructed and is very good for your lower back and abs 
5 0 Perfect Perfect way to ensure you are drinking the minimum requirement of 8 8 oz servings of water each day Fill it up in the morning and make sure it s empty by the time you go to bed at night Very sturdy and best of all NO plastic taste to your water 
5 0 Excellent Stroller We bought this stroller not only for jogging but also to use at places like Disneyland The swivel wheel makes this stroller the easiest thing to steer and our kids love it Our kids our three and one both fit in the stroller comfortably The only draw back to the stroller is it does not have a cup holder for the parents 
5 0 I love this mat i use this mat for yoga martial arts and many other exersizes it is very soft comfortable plus it has a cool look it seems to be very durable and doesn t slip even when i am sweating bullets i believe it is definatly worth the money i spent this is the best mat i have ever had 
5 0 Nice little gift I bought this for my neighbors little girl and she loved it It was easy to put together just took a few minutes and away she went Great price and I got a big hug 
4 0 Easy storage I like how this thing folds up nicely so after scooting around downtown the kid not me I could fold it up when we enter grand central market without hitting anyone in the shins As for age requirements the manufacturer recommends 5 years of age I say that s about right but get padding for every possible body part and make sure to teach her him how to fall correctly ie not on unpadded body parts like your hands And red works for boys and girls so if you re thinking about the pink or blue one and for some reason it s double the price stick with this 
4 0 Razor scooter The scooter is fine the post office lost the package though I called the company and they told me they would issue a refund only after so many days weeks and would not send a replacement unless I was willing to pay for it in advance I opted to purchase another one through a different company that used UPS instead of USPS more reliable shipping Several days later the first scooter arrived three weeks late the cost to return it was high enough that it made more sense to just keep it So now I have two and only needed one I realize USPS is at fault for the shipping but a better action plan from the seller could have resolved this quicker The scooter was a present for a birthday I ordered in plenty of time to receive prior but ended up with a very late present 
5 0 great scooter what are you waiting for quite reading my review and get this great scooter 
5 0 Simply Amazing This gun shoots fast hard and accurate Plus all the extras you get with it are just awesome 
5 0 racquet the racquet isnt orange lol it is yellow and grey ive used it since it first came out and i love it strings break a lot it seems like i have to get mine restrung about every month but other than that its a good racque 
5 0 Great racket Good for all levels of play Now I have been playing tennis for 8 years and I must say this is my favorite racket I have used I have been using it for about two years or so and plan on using it for many more It seems Head Liquidmetal rackets are gaining alot of popularity and I have seen more players using them within the last year or so For me the strings break roughly every 3 or 5 months However if you play at a less competitive level They will break twice a year maybe If you re just starting to play tennis I don t think this would be a good racket to begin with however if you play for a while and find yourself enjoying the sport and wish to play long term this is the racket you need Enjoy 
5 0 Perfect Bike I was actually surprised at how much this bike exceeded my expectations It s more than quiet it s SILENT Very good resistance settings and even a nice variety of programs The bike is sturdy and easy to put together It s compact and doesn t take up a lot of room and the seat is also quite comfortable I couldn t be more happy with this purchase For those concerned about the shipping issues that were raised my box had a dent or two but the contents were fine and there were no missing parts 
5 0 Top of the line This is the best wind up light you re going to find I advise everyone to get one for that unexpected event Our power goes out about twice a winter from ice storms and this is one of my favorite lights and can be depended on along with the light from the freeplay plus I got mine at the local Target store and I think it was only 35 00 and well worth it 
5 0 pros and cons of buying this gun some of the pros of buying the sniper rifle is it shoots crazy fast and is very accurate I shot my uncle with it and it made him BLEED none of the kids in my neighborhood want to fite against me any more some of the cons of buying the sniper rifle is the safety can t be pushed to hard or it comes out the handle starts getting kind of wobly and mine came off the battery takes longer than it says to charge to work please take my advice because I have had this gun for more than a year now and I know it front and back 
4 0 A few things about a gun First off those of you calling it a clip should know that a clip is a nonremovable ammunition storage device attatched to or built into the gun itself Please call it a magazine actual name for it And a full metal jacket isnt a full magazine of amunition its a bullet with a full metal casing like say 30 06 round Second dont complain about the scope because it is a decorative instrument you can buy better scopes if your hardcore but if you are hardcore then get a real gun this gun is good for shooting your little cousin from far away Its a great gun dont get me wrong but its not meant to be used and abused like a ww2 garand or bar It s plastic it shoots things I m probably reinstating most of what everyone else said but thats just one more reassurance So yeah get this gun if airsoft is a hobby for you NOT A SPORT I also suggest getting 20g bbs and maybe a speedloader or 2 cause mags are so expensive and this gun pours ammo like water Have fun P S Though they may noth have the trigger finger ability spring airsoft guns have a tendency to be more accurate and fire harder with heavier bb s If you are playin with friends i suggest getting a 30 dollar rifle with 250 300 fps shoots like 300 350 
5 0 Baseball lovers are treated to 500 plus cards My grandson loved this beginners set of 500 plus cards And what a price About a penny apiece 
5 0 BBW Friendly I am a plus size person 6 tall with 69 hips and within the 400 weight limit This chair fits me perfectly and feels so sturdy I did a lot of research trying to find a chair that would accomodate me and my friends and this is the one I will be buying more The manufacturer of the chair states that a 300 pound person can use this chair and it will withstand vigorous use We work in conjunction with STR Labs to develop and administer destructive testing of our products Our reality check is for a TRAVELCHAIR product to withstand twice the force exerted by the recommended weight limit in an agressive situation 
4 0 Clever and useful I never found the fork part of a spork to be very useful Now we have this Light My Fire spork and I have to wonder why nobody thought of this before Nearly perfect for typical backpacker meals probably MRE s too If you ve a friend or relative over there send em one 
4 0 Good tennis racquet It is a good one Strong and to some extent heavy I improved a lot 
5 0 Dietary Supplements couldn t taste any better This has to be one the best Protein supplements in the market And more importantly the taste is just unbelievable The Banana Creme and Vanilla flavors are the best From a Supplement Facts perspective each RTD bottle is packed with 32 yeah 32g of Protein and only 14g of Carbohydrates The Total fat is 16g which might be on the higher side again 6g of which are in the form of MCT Medium Chain Triglycerides that are typically burned as energy and aren t stored as body fat All in all it works really good for me and if you are an active person like I am you should prolly go get yourself some GNC also sells this for like 3 bucks 
5 0 Great Product I do upside down situps with a 50 pound vest on and a 25 pound dumbell in each hand I weigh 185 pounds No creaks bends or falls great produc 
5 0 Hang Me UP Being a bodybuilder I hoist heavy weights all the time a major stress especially when it comes to squats I ordered the boots when I realized I had shrunk to 5 10 5 from being 6 0 5 I was thusly very happy when after approximately 5 weeks of hanging 5 times a week 10 15 min intervals that I am nearly back to my original height 6 0 25 I highly suggest this product as a supplement to good emphasis on good chiropractic care To those who have will order this product don t be discouraged if it seems to hurt your back at first that s totally normal because your back is trying to readjust while the discs which cushion the vertebrate start rehydrating Also it will take some time to find the strap tightness that s right for your legs Generally tighter on the top strap and looser on the bottom is a good combination p s Hang from a real pull up bar and make sure you have someone to spot you if you are not strong enough to pull yourself back up the bar to unlatch yourself 
4 0 Wayfinder a guiding light This has been a great addition to my truck a useful compass and outside thermometer without going to the expense of a navigation system and without having to learn another techno gadget My only complaint is that the display illumination could be a bit brighter I realize that a bright light on the dashboard could impair one s night vision but a bit more contrast on the display would be helpful at night 
4 0 Good in daylight Need flashlight at night My unit was really easy to install no wires just suction cups for the main unit and no tools required for the temperature unit I drive mostly during the day so I like the unit but those who do night driving cannot see the DIM LIGHT I had to remove unit in order to pass the VA state inspection In cold weather the temp guage sometimes does not work Also about the temp sensor If you place it too near the hot parts of the radiator it will not be accurate while driving in town or when stopped Behind the front license tag is great I put an old license tag under the new one and drilled holes to hold the temp sensor That method works great I really like the automatic calibration feature 
5 0 great size weight We had been looking for a light weight backpacking tent with enough room for two That seems simple enough unless you ve actually been inside of some of the two person tents Some of the expedition tents meet the size requirements but are too heavy to be considered backpacking tents We have just used this tent for the first time and we are so far pleased Plenty of room inside for two adults with large sleeping mats and sleeping bags and a bit of gear A large vesitibule on each side provides plenty of room for packs I believe this will be a great warm weather tent with all of the mesh The night we used it it dropped below freezing We woke to a ceiling rainfly covered in ice on the inside Didn t really expect that with all of the ventilation but as it was ice it didn t drip on us I ll chalk this experience up to extreme conditions until we use it in warmer weather One thing that I don t like although thus far it has not been an issue is a seam running through the middle of the floor It has been taped and sealed at the factory but I just don t like the looks of it I will seal it again before spring use and edit this report as we are sure to end up in a downpour here in south Texas The tent is in fact lightweight and roomy and so far I am pleased I will amend this report after having enountered weather with it 
4 0 the weather started getting rough This really is a great tent Three people can sleep in it but I ve found it best for 2 people because then there s still room for all of your stuff or a dog lol I ve used it for 3 years and it never disappoints I ve been in one good thunderstorm in it and it did great and didn t leak at all It s very easy to set up especially when you arrive at your site after dark It vents really well but best if you face the vented side into the wind Just don t forget to open out the little cross vent with the on the other side The inside pockets are really handy and I think you can get a net that you can hang from above for more storage 
5 0 nice detail bike has very nice detailing paint has a nice shine really like the fenders to help keep daughter clean great buy 
5 0 Focus on Abs This ab machine focuses your workout on the abdominal muscles like not many other ab machines do You ll be surprised by the results 
4 0 Good Starter Board This is a great starter board for the price My son has really enjoyed using it and the price was unbeatable Seems to be holding up well and it serves the purpose for a beginner 
4 0 bike seat Difficult to put together with just one person though not impossible Seems better for a child under 3 feet tall though my daughter and I are making do She loves it 
5 0 Worth the hassle This bike seat IS a HUGE pain to install on a bike It took my husband and I working together about an hour to get it right and there were several points when we thought it wouldn t work we persevered and got it on It is fabulous to ride with our son It is very sturdy Our son is very large and rides in it just fine The helmet slides on his head but most helmets are tricky to get just right Overall we have been very happy with this purchase 
5 0 Great warmth These keep your feet warm Not 6 hours but three Still a great help keeping feet from feeling cold 
5 0 Silica Gel Good Value This item is a good value and comes packaged in a convienent container The beads can be reactivated by simply following the manufacturer s instructions and baking in an oven the 40 gram package is nice sized for small spaces drawers however larger spaces may require more than one Overall this item is a nice value for those that do not want to buy the silica gel in a bulk package and deal with making your own container s I would recommend for anyone keeping tools or other collectables where moisture is not wanted 
4 0 Great product for medium distance runs I just bought the SpeedBelt 2 deciding that the 4 bottle belt would be more cumbersome for me So far the 2 bottle belt has worked well for me in the 5 10 mile run range It fits 2 gels comfortably and 10 ozs of water in each bottle For longer runs I d suggest the 4 bottle belt but this one is great for the intermediate range The belt fits comfortably and I didn t feel that it bounced around much at all Recommended 
5 0 Jansport backpack I have been completely satisfied with Jansport backpacks They are very well made and I love the guarantee The straps are more comfortable than other backpacks purchased My 14 year old son has had one for three years and it is still in great condition Previous cheaper backpacks have lasted a year or two at the most This model has lots of zipper pockets in different sizes for storing just about anything you d want to put in a backpack Great product 
4 0 Sturdy Stylish Backpack Very Roomy I ve had this backpack for about 5 months now and I still have a great opinion of it It holds many books and folders It can also accomodate my Inspiron laptop with a 15 4 screen The backpack doesn t have an included laptop sleeve so I found a solution by buying the Sumdex Padded Large Laptop sleeve which isn t very expensive but very protective and a perfect fit and just putting the Laptop in the sleeve then putting the sleeve into my backpack Even after doing so I still had room for a couple of books Keep in mind that this does make it a large backpack slightly bulky so if you aren t in need of something with such a high capacity then this might not be the backpack for you The backpack doesn t have a lot of organization as far as dedicated slots for pencils pens etc It just has a few smaller zippered openings If you have a lot of stuff in them you will be having to fumble around your things I didn t find this too troublesome overall though The backpack is comfortable and seems to be holding up pretty well against all the weight of my nursing books etc I am happy with my purchase as I always have been with Jansport purchases 
5 0 Great quality and lifetime warranty Hey I decided to review some things I didn t buy off Amazon but I have owned for sometime that are really great items the kind I would buy again for sure if they were lost I would say lost or broken but Jansport has lifetime warranties If anything happens to your backpack all you have to do is mail it to Jansport with a note of the problem they will fix it for FREE and send it back to you They will even send you a card while they have it telling you it misses you and will be back soon Overall these are such great products you just have to get a Jansport if you re thinking of a backpack Also I am in a review writing competition with a friend of mine and if this review is helpful which I hope it really is I would love to have your yes vote With Care Sa 
4 0 Kept us dry We pruchased this tent for our annual car camping trip in Northern MI where weather is very unpredictable We ve had other tents that took FOREVER to set up but this one was super simple I think it too two of us less than 15 minutes to have it up and ready We loved the size of this tent plenty of room for our air mattress and gear The air circulation was great too Even in the heat of the day we had a nice breeze keeping us cool thanks to a miriad of windows When rain came during the night we stayed dry though I would recommend sealing the seams prior to using this tent Overall we re really happy with this tent especially for the price and plan to use it for several years 
5 0 Just bought from Khol s Love it I just got this from Khol s They had it on sale for 11 99 When I saw it there were plenty on the shelves I was kind of curious as to what they were because of its funny shape There was a try me sign on there So in my boredom while waiting for my ride I read the directions on the back and actually tried it It was kind of funny to read wind up for light I m glad I checked out the aisle I ve never seen anything so cool It s very simple to wind up the flashlight The ball has a special roller that allows you to pump easily It s not difficult to follow the instructions Anyone could do it The lightbulb is LED so according to my internet research LED LEDs have an extremely long life span twice longer than the best fluorescent bulbs and twenty times longer than the best incandescent bulbs The design is actually very nice to the touch It s padded with some nice rubber grip so its not unpleasant to hold It s not very heavy at all It s about the size of a male s electric shaver I bought it at Khol s for more money than its listed here on Amazon I got it today and I showed my younger siblings They loved it too Basically the light is powered by the mechanical motion of your hand It s really simple to use and its a comfortable design I plan on going back to get more tomorrow 
5 0 Suunto Advisor 2nd Suunto 1st was a Vector bought in 2000 that I abused pretty good before having to get another water seal was damaged and it took on water during a kayaking trip Doubt I ll ever use the heart monitor in the mountains but it is excellent for training Highly recommended 
5 0 The Best Training Tool Ever For Endurance Athletes I after drooling over this watch for two years wishing I had one I finally got one and have had my Advizor for two months now All I can say is that if I had known how cool this thing really was I would have shelled out the 300 a long time ago Each one of the features listed above does everything you could want The Heart Rate Monitor has target zone settings average workout heart rate highest and lowest hear rate and more The Altimeter tells your rate of ascent total vertical climb and stores all the data from recent workouts in memory The coolest feature is that it will store your heart rate altitude and rate of ascent decent at intervals from 20 seconds to ten minutes so that after a workout you can scroll though and see how your heart rate was affected by altitude and acent rate I got completely geeky with this information after one workout and I typed it all into my computer so I could see what it looked like The only drawback to the Advizor is that it gives you so much information it would be great if you could download it directly to a computer for analysis There is no PC link so any analysis has to be done on the watch or typed in by hand But other than that this gizmo is perfect No problems at all so far and I use the thing for two workouts a day I am a cross country ski racer and for a long time I had thought that this would be the perfect training aid for endurance athletes and now that I have tried it I know that it is 
4 0 Adequate They get the job done but the handles are a little thin and can get uncomfortable during the last couple of set 
5 0 Good Bang for the Buck This review will focus on the specs since there is minimal information available unless you buy the bike First off this is my second Mongoose I started out on a crappy low end Cruiser model so anything even half a step up from that model is a vast improvement The Theory weighs about 38 lbs and is actually light grey in color despite the image on this website I thought I was getting a white bike and I m a little ticked it s actually grey but whateva Assembly isn t too bad as long as you have half a clue as to what you re doing The documentation is adequate but don t expect to be able to assemble this bike correctly if you haven t done it before The documentation will frustrate you But the average person can probably install the pedals and the saddle and maybe even mount the handlbars correctly assuming the brakes don t arrive screwed up like mine did The front cable had to be relocated because when it was assembled at the plant it was threaded immediately under the fork and the tire was rubbing against it so it had to be removed and resituated which entailed messing with the front cable Simple enough I suppose but this assumes you know what you re doing I couldn t install the front tire correctly because of the disc brake and wanting to be safe instead of stupid I took the bike to an LBS and had them install it It was then that I found out one of the disc pads was missing No problem I just went back home and found it in the box Apparently it had become dislodged from the housing on the front tire during transit I didn t even know it was there because I haven t worked with disc pads before It was a good thing I didn t toss the box right away otherwise I would have been SOL Just be advised however that if you are missing one or both disc pads and do toss out the box before you realize one of the pads is missing depending on where you are you may or may not be able to find replacement pads You may end up having to upgrade to a better brand disc brake Now onto the specs The front disc brake is Promax brand DSK 400 which in the world of mtn biking is the generic low end I had to do some digging around on the web to find the following site because you won t find a website It wasn t really all that much more helpful and did not help me to understand disc brakes any better but at least you ll have a better idea what to look for The documentation on the site have color images vs the black and white images that come enclosed with the bike Go here instead I wouldn t call the Promax disc brake crap but close enough Note If you plan on doing any kind of semi serious mtn biking as in on a trail considered intermediate level then upgrade the disc brakes And if you re planning a real mtn biking trip with rocks and logs and the whole nine then the Theory can probably handle it just don t expect miracles As to the gears there are 21 Shimano flavored and they work flawlessly They re a pleasure to have because there isn t the usual slipping and dragging you see on lower end Mongoose mtn bikes The only problem I had was the upper gears don t seem to want to shift into any gear definitely unless you downshift say to 2 then upshift to 3 for example and so forth for the others If you want 6 then go to 5 then upshift and vice versa This may or may not be because the cogs need to be lubed As to the ride the Theory is a dual suspension bike and you can really feel the difference vs a hard tail bike Wow Just riding on the street and going over speed bumps and rain gulleys is amazing You have very little to no shock at all because the suspension absorbs it Overall this bike is good bang for the buck but I wouldn t pay over 300 00 tops for it If you re going to go that high you can get something else with higher end parts Oh one last thing If you value your reproductive organs and don t want to find yourself numb from package to exit and or sitting on a bag of frozen peas for a week after using the bike then do yourself a favor and switch out the saddle The one that comes with the Theory is horrible Get a thicker padded gel lined split saddle instead 
4 0 Made well May be Good for hikers When the product came I realized that it wasn t what I was looking for in a fanny pack but I was impressed with its rugged construction I needed a pack to walk around Disney World and thought the two water bottle holders would come in handy I like to freeze my store bought water bottles so that they stay cold all day The water bottles that come with this pack are double wide and have a wide top meaning you can t wrap your lips around it like a store bought bottle Plus you have to wash and refill them as opposed to just buying another Dasani Unfortunately you can t use the water bottle holder for anything much narrower than the included bottles because there is just a single strap across the bottom preventing their bottle from falling through but that wouldn t stop a regular 16 oz job from slipping passed So I m returning mine but if your looking for non breakable wide mouthed water bottles in a rugged waistpack then this is for you PS for some reason the blue one is cheaper at least when I bought it 
5 0 Awesome Treadmill Smooth and easy to use Also easy to run on Not quite as portable as I thought it would be but to have a quality machine I guess it needs to be a little on the large size 
5 0 As Good as Advertised The Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill is as good as advertised It was easy to assemble and the instructions were thorough It is also very easy to program and operate No time is wasted figuring out the instruction manual I also love the quietness of the motor Because the machine is sturdy you will need some help moving it into place Go ahead and get it Ma 
5 0 Great Gun This gun was Great When I got it I immediatly Pulled it out and went to play with it Good For Kids Just starting out with bb guns Also It isn t that Powerful Overall this gun is great and i cant beleive it is 0 0 
5 0 Very fun for a youngster 6 to 10 No this gun isn t very powerful but THAT S THE POINT This gun is perfect for a young kid to learn about guns Slow enough you can actually see the BB accurate enough to hit a target routinely at around 20 to 25 feet 
5 0 Excelent For Sniping Well I originally ordered the Black UTG Black Sniper Rifle but was out of stock at Air Splat Well I could have waited 3 4 weeks or get the Green UTG OD Green Sniper Rifle that I had been thinking about ahead of time So I sent a reply e mail and they sent this rifle about 3 days later The screws you get some screws now on the newer versions the long screw that is supposed to go in the port behind the trigger is not the long screw You put in a short screw well at least for me I had tried to figure out what was wrong finally decided to call them and they told me what to do Now to the Gun Excelent Definently get a scope if you plan on being a sniper Also have your friends wear good goggles and no bear skin It will either bleed or nice a welt and if thats cool with you than by all means dont tell them untill its to late The gun itself should only be used with 20g and up Anything less will ruin the gun With 20g you can easily punch through a unopened can of soda The gun in a airsoft battle is a bit mixed Personally I stay back and take head shots at the other team s leaders and medics With the bolt action that you use you can decide when you are going to relode Also you should also get alot of white 20g With white 20g you can adjust where you fire and get even more accurate shots Pros Very accurate Very painful could be con depends on how you look at it Weighted well Very intimidating looking Cons A bit heavy for long games But you should be moving anyways now should you If you dont sight your scope or dont even get one there are no aiming sights it would be a bit wasy to miss 
4 0 ordered I just ordered this beauty The price is right the price will probably be more expensive in a few months The full tang is very sturdy The handle is usually a lil thin flat on these type of blades I was also looking at the Galaxy Viper twin blades in silver also comes in black but there s no pic of the shealth It just says it s nylon shealth It holds the 2 blades This wasn t exactly what I was looking for so I chose the Ronin BTW I got the last 1 from a seller They were out of stock last time I checked 
5 0 Super It was just what I wanted a relatively stress free low impact workout that you can do while zoning out in front of the tv Takes about 30 minutes to put together It s quiet stowable and fun My ten year old likes it too I don t have any problems keeping my feet in the straps as long as I m wearing shoes so maybe the people who were complaining about that issue hadn t been wearing shoes A really nice little machine and what a great price 
5 0 Speedo Vanquisher Swim Goggle I bought the swim goggle for my wife as a gift and she loves the product It is a lot better than the swim goggle you would buy at a store I recommend this product for those who swim as part of their exercise routine 
4 0 good product when it s new after a several uses the anti fog starts to fail at the beginning when it is band new it works great Clear and sharp I always wash it with water and hand soap after swimming to clean up the clorine still the anti fog inner layer wears out quickly The good thing is that it doesn t leak that s the important part Over all it s still a great product compare to other models If not because of the poor anti fog thing I would have give it a 5 stars rating 
5 0 My brother the swimmer loves these googles I bought these clear color version as a gift for a young adult male who is an avid indoor swimmer According to the gift recipient they re excellent they really don t leak or fog up He was thrilled to finally find a pair of goggles that didn t get any water in his eyes but please note he doesn t swim for more than one half hour at a time so I can t vouch for whether they stay unfogged after longer periods of continuous pool activity He also said that the fit is very good and the choices of nose bridge make these goggles accessible to most face types For the price these are an excellent bargain 
5 0 Works as advertised Waterproof cases are so expensive and heavy We aren t divers but spend lots of time outdoors in conditions hostile to electronics skiing hiking fishing at the beach etc In addition to water dirty hands sand and dust are hazards This Aquapac performs as described kept the camera Canon A95 safe and dry despite immersion in swimming pool etc The picture quality was unaffected but flash doesn t work well due to internal reflections Well worth the price 
5 0 skate shoes Bratz I purchased these skates for my Grand daughter and she just loves these skates I thought that with her being only 4 years old she would not be able to pop out the wheels but she did it and off she went She tries to wear these skates everywhere 
5 0 Excellent fun I bought my son and daughter a pair of these shoes for Christmas I have a hard time getting them to wear regular shoes anymore they love to wear them everywhere they go Great way to get the kids physically active 
5 0 You don t have to be a runner to love Bodyglide I recently returned from almost 3 weeks of treking around Italy I m not a runner or a walker or even mildly aerobic and I have baby tender feet so I was very concerned about blistering On the advice of some runner friends I bought BodyGlide and coated my feet with it EVERY DAY before I put on my socks and shoes My feet were tired and achy every night but NO BLISTERS This is an amazing testament to the power of BodyGlide because sometimes I can have blisters wearing normal shoes during a normal low activity work day and I was walking for hours at a time over bricks cobblestones you name it If you are going to be traveling where you will be walking more than usual or on a differnt terrain then you are used to buy a big ol stick of Bodyglide and coat your feet every day 
5 0 Wonderful This stuff is excellent it goes on easy like a roll on and lasts the whole run whether it be 30 minutes or 6 hours even with a complete sweat I would recommend this product to all short and long distance runners 
4 0 Decent for the Me and a friend bought 2 of these They look really cool However they are not sharp at all hence only 4 stars For 15 they are really good value though The hilt is plastic and the blade is a little thin Other than that they are quite good 
4 0 pretty good price good glove wears well I use these for MMA type workout on bags blocking pads and they have worked well They give good protection even when hitting hard I have not had the problem with dye fading that I noticed with some other gloves Overall I would reccomend about the same or less than other gloves from everlast century ect and just as good quality FYI There are a lot of visible seams where the pads pockets are attached especially on the fingers that you can t see well in the picture advertised I do t think this is a big deal as many bag gloves have this I wouldn t use them to spar as these would tend to cut most people would use fighting gloves to spar anyway but just trying to be helpful 
5 0 Harbinger bag gloves Great item and great shipping Recieved product in a timely manner

5 0 Tough bag for tough workouts I too recieved this bag in a box semi beaten up but then again an 80 pound item in a lightweight cardboard box is bound to cause a little box damage And no there was no interior protective bag and my chain pack was tied with pink ribbon Now to the bag itself The toughest most well filled and economical bags I have ever seen I use light bag gloves and with the amount of filling and it s density I can punch for hours If I had the stamina without getting the sore knuckles or the wrist pain that I used to get from denser packed bags Plus it s an Everlast This is a must buy for anyone who is looking for a heavy bag Good luck and TRAIN HARD 
5 0 The ball was getting soft and I wanted to pump it up I have a bicycle pump in the garage but no adapter for the ball I figured that at the price of this item I had little to lose and much to gain I got what I wanted for less than 10 bucks delivered I m quite satisfied 
4 0 Just what I ordered Hand wraps were sent quickly and were in good condition Thanks 
5 0 Awesome Skateboard My child recieved this for Christmas He Loved it so much His older brothers have big ones and now he feels like a big boy since he has one too 
5 0 Inversion I am very pleased with the quality of the inversion therapy table It is sturdy reasonably priced and it was easy to assemble Instructions provided were clear and concise 
4 0 Good for little girls Here s the deal with this item it s fine for little girls and I suppose little boys that are inclined to dance who haven t been exposed to a better dance game I got this for Christmas for my 5 year old daughter she takes dance likes dancing has never had or known about another Dance Dance Revolution game and she LOVES IT It s a big hit she s jumping all over the place adds up her score at the end of each song and it s been a great cheap gift with exercise to boot No it s not sophisticated Older kids or teens not to mention adults would grimace in pain over the ancient graphics and lousy sound For them get one that goes in their PlayStation or whatever However many 5 year old girls don t have a PlayStation or need one This is perfect for them For and shipping it worked out great for a little kid For a teen it s wasted That s the difference 
5 0 Love it This was such an unusual and unique idea I gave it as a gift and the person really liked it It s different than the usual type of world series champions type posters The artist who made this was very creative 
4 0 Back pain reliever I use my inversion table two or three times a day for short intervals of a few minutes each whenever my lower back starts to hurt or tighten up Shorter and less intensive periods of use achieve better results that longer and fewer periods of use You don t have to change clothes to use the inversion table you simply get on it wearing a suit blue jeans or pajamas You re not going to break a sweat you re going to stretch your back muscles and spinal cord which doesn t take any physical exertion You should wear shoes to help you hang upside down on the inverstion table without your feet slipping out of the stirrups I highly recommend it for people suffering from back fatigue and back pain I no longer need to take any expensive medication to alleviate back pain or fatigue 
4 0 good machine haven t had for long but it seems to be a nice deal for the money It does a lot of exercises And seems easy to convert between types 
5 0 An excellent machine for upper body workouts I bought this machine because of the low price and I was skeptical whether it would be worthwhile However I was very pleasantly surprised It is a great machine especially for beginners who want upper body workouts If you re a serious athlete or if you want leg exercises this may not be the best machine for you For me it is working out great and I have purchased other machines to give me the leg exercises I want At first I was dismayed by the fact that there were over 100 parts to assemble but they went together very quickly and easily and all the tools are included Be advised that this is only for users weighing up to 120 kilograms or 264 pounds Great product 
4 0 Good product Great price The gym is very easy to assemble took me about 45 minutes on my own The book supplies several different workouts hitting every major muscle group and you get good resistance in every workout You won t get great range of motion on all the workouts there may be times when you ll need to lean back or put yourself in a different position in order to get a full stretch but those are minor adjustments you d probably have to make on any other type of equipment The gym itself is light easy to move around the house and doesn t take up much space It may be too light and not sturdy enough in some instances and you will need to stand on the frame in the stand up workouts The price is outstanding at 180 dollars You re not going to find a better deal than this and the workout is very comparable to the far more expensive Bowflex 
5 0 Great fun My 9 month old loves this toy Before he got the hang of pushing the lever down to spin the balls he would roll it on the floor and crawl after it It keeps him entertained and he keeps coming back to it Also there are no loose parts or pieces to lose which I appreciate Great toy 
5 0 Well constructed and clever multi tool A friend who is a successful competition mountain bike rider asked me to weigh the Blackburn Airfix after I bought it He has had many occasions where his chain has broken or his tires have punctured so he wanted to compare the weight of the Blackburn versus the weight of all the individual tools he carried when he rides The Airfix weighed in at about 245 grams about 8 ounces and his tools including inflator tire levers hex wrenches and chain tool all included in the airfix tipped the scales at 337 grams about 11 ounces I suppose that a multitool may not be as convenient to use as individual tools but for handiness this seems hard to beat The Blackburn lifetime no questions asked guarantee is also very attractive So while I have yet had to put this tool into action with either my Trek 2200zr or my Trek 6000 in a world where every ounce of weight is a heavy concern pardon the pun I imagine I have made a wise purchase 
4 0 Good experience with one glitch These bikes arrived very shortly after ordering were exactly what I was looking for and were fairly easy to assemble The only glitch was that one bike was missing a fender and I didn t know who to contact 
5 0 Chrysler PT Crusier Turbo 7 Men s 26 Bik I really like this bike It s great The only complaint I have is with Amazon Com Customer Service The bike came partly assembled You really should tell customers exactly what they will have to assemble I put the seat and pedals on The quick release for the front tire was missing from the box I called customer service and they could not send me one She said I would have to send the bike back and get a new one She couldn t even give me the number of the mfg I was so mad I didn t want to send the bike back that was too much trouble I took it to a bike dealer and he put the front wheel on 
4 0 Turbo 7 Cruiser Bike I really like this bike It feels like a bike from the 50s but with all the modern technology The look is great and draws a lot of attention It is somewhat simple to complete the bike since it arrives mostly put together but the assembly instructions are the worst I have ever seen with any product I basically got no clue from the instructions on how to finish off the bike it is hard to believe how poorly they are written I was beginning to believe they sent me the wrong directions After I got it together through trial and error the brakes and the shifter were way out of whack and I had to spend 30 at a local bike shop to get these items adjusted the instructions for making the adjustment did not work The guys at the bike shop took two attempts to get it right two trips for me and they were wondering why it was so difficult to adjust After all that was done I love the bike and it rides nicely and when properly adjusted shifts and brakes very nicely The ride is comfortable and I love the seat and location of the handlebars I would recommend the bike for all the fun and looks it has but be prepared for some hassle to get it right unless you are one of the lucky ones who gets one that is adjusted correctly out of the box My suggestion is for the manufacture of this bike to fire the idiot who wrote the assembly instructions and hire someone with some writing skills I also do not understand why the brakes and shifter were so far out of adjustment did no one test the bike before they boxed it up 
4 0 Blackburn Delphi 6 0 Bicycle Cyclometer The Pros are this product has alot of functionality for the price The odometer and heart rate functions were very accurate The set up and operations get easier with use first few times you will need to refer to the manual The manual is well written and thorough The cons are the altimeter which is far from accurate 
4 0 Great all around bike computer I just received the Blackburn Delphi 6 0 earlier this week and I ve already put it through a few rides I m upgrading from a Cateye Astrale 8 that I ve had for a long time I ve started training with a heart rate monitor more seriously lately and I thought having a single integrated unit to handle both features would be great I almost bought the Delphi 5 0 a while ago but decided to hold out for the 6 0 to get the nifty altimeter features Here are my impressions about my new computer good and bad Pros The mounting bracket system is very clever and seems better that the Cateye bracket I was used to Changeble soft platic shims line the bracket clamp changing the fit for different handlebar diameters 3 different thicknesses are included which chould accomodate everything from skinny aerobar computer mounts to oversized road handlebars The altimeter function is great The altitude measurement is solid and seems very accurate The percent grade reading acts sensibly even though it lags a little this is explained in the manual The distance climbed at the end of a ride agrees very well with topographic software and works far better than the GPS based solution I had been using The Lap feature is great for capturing statistical snapshots of particular segments of your ride Had a big hill on your route and want to know how much you climbed and how fast you averaged up the grade The Delphi makes it really easy to see those sections taken out of the whole Up to 20 laps can be recorded I think of them less as laps and more as intervals The backlight feature is very cool I ve always just done without computer info at night before but this way I don t have to I m sure it kills batteries but it s nice to have Cons The average speed algorithm seems a little flaky It seems to read ay least 0 1 mph slower than one would get by simply dividing distance by ride time My Cateye always agreed well with the calculated value but the way the Delphi is figuring the average must be different This is liveable and seems to be less of a problem on routes without a lot of stopping The max heart rate reading can get ruined by frequent spikes so that the real Max HR is unknown Finishing a ride it s possible that the max HR will show something unrealistic like 235 probably due to a signal glitch or some interference Then you have no way of knowing what the true value is These spikes don t affect the average however I should mention that I ve seen this behavior on both of the standalone HRMs I ve had before so it s not unique to the Delphi The cadendce sensor was hard to mount so that the magnet was close enough to the sensor I had to put the magnet very close to the end of the crank because the crank arm is close enough to the chainstay at that point But mounted there the magnet covers the back side of the pedal spindle If you have pedals which require a hexkey from the back side to remove that could be a problem They could have remedied that by making the cadence magnet a little thicker For comparison my Cateye crank magnet was mounted in the middle of the arm with no problem The wire from the cadence enabled bracket to the cadence sensor is very long This may be good for putting it out on aerobars or something and I admit that too long is better than too short But I have a foot or more of extra cable to try to hide around my shifter cable housings and it s hard to tuck that slack away And I have a large bike frame with plenty of tube real estate to spare Unlike my standalone HRMs the Delphi doesn t calculate calories used Not that those numbers are ever accurate anyway but it would be nice for ride to ride comparison General Thoughts Overall I think it s a great computer The negatives above all are really minor issues and I haven t found a computer yet that offers as much for such a reasonable price There s a lot more to tell than I can include in a review like this I m just trying to hit the big highlights and lowlights But definitely no regrets on this end for buying it 
5 0 Great Product Love the trike it is so cute My 2 yr old got it for his birthday and loves it The instructions to put it together were not very good but it s a trike so it wasn t that hard to figure out I would recommend this trike to any Cars fan 
5 0 Awesome Trike I have 20 mo old twin boys I was given 2 different tricycles and each of my boys only wanted to ride the Disney McQueen trike so I had to purchace another one This trike has two different sitting positions has a wide wheel base for stability and sits lower to the ground My boys still can t use the pedels but love to use the trike as a ride on toy It s a great trike for younger toddlers who want to ride early 
4 0 Awesome Bag but shipping box could be improved The product itself was awesome and my son loves it It is just what I hoped it would be like The box it came in had me worried at first because it was very flimsy and tearing in certain places It made it difficult to carry from our porch to my room where I was hiding the kids C mas gifts 
5 0 definitely worth the cash this pair of pistols is quite entertaining i have purchased quite a few airsoft guns in the last 6 months and these are surprisingly the more powerful of what ive purchased dualing spring pistols is a challenge but there are ways to work the slide with 1 hand they re flimsy but with enough care and responsibility theyll last a while definitely worth 16 buck 
5 0 My daughter loves these I just ordered a pair of these for my son since my daughter is so pleased with them The wheel base is wide enough that beginners can get their balance quickly The wheels roll very smoothly The velcro attachment at the top provides ankle support and is easier to adjust than just laces A fun outdoor activity Laurie mother of Emma 8 and Kevin 11 
5 0 Great kickboard I ordered 2 of these kickboards in blue after reading another review They are not exactly the same size but we really like them They are very versatile and easy to use I do think they need to put dimensions on the website 
5 0 Exercise Band Light I have had problems with exercise bands that break fairly easily Although I have not had this one long it has shown no type of wear and I use it every day I would definitely recommend this product to someone who wants to add resistance to their workout 
5 0 Excellent excellent excellent Price Value Performance I received my fitness bands shortly after placing my order At first I was confused because I was expecting a box and instead it was a mailer envelope but I couldn t be more pleased with the product For just a couple of bucks I am able to find different ways to challenge the muscle groups in my upper body Also I can take it absolutely anywhere one could fit in my pocket Here is the breakdown of the different colors and resistance which I ve taken from the merchant s website Color Resistance Red X Light 3 3 lbs Orange Light 4 5 lbs Yellow Lt Med 6 lbs Green Medium 8 lbs Blue Med Hvy 10 lbs Indigo Heavy 15 lbs Violet X Hvy 20 lbs If you can sympathize with any of the following scenarios this product is something I would recommend for you Well I d recommend it for anyone but these are the clients who have been searching for an answer 1 You live in a tiny apartment and or don t have a lot of a lot of storage space You need something that you can tuck behind your DVDs when it s not being used 2 You don t have the means to pay for weights or weight training equipment 3 You can t afford to go to the gym or are intimidated about going because everyone there is always so friggin buff Do not purchase if you are allergic to latex It is only 90 free of soluable allergens so if you are allergic don t buy it This information is specifically listed in the product description so ignore the poor review by the illiterate complainer Other than that enjoy the product and happy toning 
4 0 good item but not perfect Works real well for leg exercises but when doing arm exercises it tends to slide downwards 
4 0 simple and fun I got this as a gift and just love it You wouldn t believe how difficult it is to balance on it without using your legs It s fun and you can just use it while you re watching TV How could that be wrong 
4 0 No More No Less This count up down timer is exactly what I was looking for No bells no whistles just timings up and down It s small and light and can be clipped or held It even has a magnet for attaching to metal surfaces I only wish it had a shut off switch so that it doesn t start counting and beeping if it s accidentally brushed 
5 0 Love it This is the same system released 4+ years ago This is the Fanny Lifter not the Box and not the Transfirmer the wider steps I was very out of shape couldn t make it up stairs without being out of breath It was very tough starting up I couldn t make it through a whole workout until almost the 10th workout I went from a size 16 to a size 6 Because of this system I have fallen in love with exercise and feeling looking great Allie Lisa and Jen are great leads 
5 0 Great Workout I just love this workout it really gets you sweating It s a great workout for beginners as well not too fast or complicated I just started working out with The Firm System and plan to use it to get back into shape You can always purchase more DVD s to keep you motivated I recommend this product to anyone who want to get into or stay in shape 
4 0 good multi purpose gadget I like this for both the biking and running walking Easy to set up the pedometer a little harder for the bike There s a long cord The front also scratched when I removed the plastic covering making it harder to read on the right side It s working great though and I m happy with the product 
5 0 Lifestyle Online Magazine southbeachdiet co uk Awesome for an advid user in Pedometer I really love this one It is accurate and consise some other pedometers out there have many complicated menus A Women s View www cosmopolitangirl co u 
5 0 Wonderful gift for your little woman My daughter love these skates so much that she did not want to take them off 
5 0 nice wow this scope goes great with the UTG Master Sniper It works very well when you tune it in 
5 0 Amazing This product is quit usefull to walk overnigth and to do works at dark sites 
5 0 awesome This was the hit of Christmas Eve I gave one to my brother and husband and everyone one wanted one It projects light way out in front of you and is a must have for power outages and walking in the evening Great product I am ordering several more 
4 0 Nice racket balance of power and control I have this for a month now It has two pices joined by rubber which reduces the shock In addition you might want to attach that rubber shock absorber which you can get under 5 in a sports store Pretty happy with it 
5 0 Great Gift I bought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it It is a great color and texture and really like the mesh cut out for breathability I think I may order one for myself 
5 0 No excuses This is the perfect companion to take on your next trip No more excuses The gym is now portable With enough resistance to give you a decent workout This gym rat highly recommend these bands 
5 0 It does what it says period As a chef in a hot DC kitchen I have tried all manner of powder and cream with the hope of eliminating or decreasing chafing At one point I even devised a kind of rosin bag of cornstarch suspended on a string THIS STUFF WORKS FOR ME And if it works for me in the hours of blistering heat and hot sweat it will work for you 
5 0 Eliminate chaffing bleeding and blistering This product is phenomenal It reduces if not eliminates chaffing when applied properly It worked under my wetsuit It works under your arms and around your neck during open water swimming It works between your thighs or on your chest when running It may even prevent blistering on your toes while running but I can t directly confirm that I d recommend reapplying every four hours 
5 0 Great product If you need to eliminate chafing from runing jogging or just active walking this is the stuff to use Rolls on like deodorant One application will last for a whole day Highly recommend 
5 0 This stuff is great This is the best anti chafing product I ve ever used I m a 40 something marathon runner heavier than the average marathoner Every marathon I ran left me with a bloody chafed mess on my thighs I just ran my first marathon with this product and not a chafe my highest recomendatio 
5 0 Tough but worth every dollar and every drip of sweat Body Max is a very tough DVD I didn t find the step choreography too difficult to learn but some of the combos were a bit quick and advanced I do recommend watching the cardio before attempting or you ll be rewinding quite a bit like I did Cathe s cuing is great especially while teaching the combo The complete workout is long and tough but completely worth it If you don t have enough time there are several premixes that have shorter lengths The premixes may be shorter but they re no less intense 
5 0 One of my favorite Cathe s DVDs This DVD is tough but don t be scared Cathe does a great job with the premixes and you can pick shorter versions of the workout I love the music on this DVD It s so much fun it makes me want to keep jumping The upper body routine is about 20 minutes long It s efficient and straight to the point I ve never seen results as quickly before Cathe will definitely delivery results 
5 0 Still the standard by which others are judged Blackburn racks are getting harder to find but they are still at the top of the pile in terms of build quality and strength weight I have had Blackburn racks on a couple bikes over the years and never had a complaint One is still going strong after 20 years Highly recommended 
5 0 Exquisite cap Just the perfect cap It fits like no other swimming cap It won t pull you hair when removing it neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning Very resistant material and a great finish Awesome colors 
5 0 Speedo Silicone Swim Cap I bought this swim cap for my wife for Christmas and she loves it 
5 0 Awsome M16 I got it about 2 months ago and it still works like new i even left it in a shed uncovered and it still works great It look very real but the only bad thing is that the sclincer does nothing to the sound of the gun THIS GUN IS AWESOME 
5 0 Works great I ve owned a Gust Buster for over 5 years now and it works great I ve had it out in the early winds of a hurricane and it worked exactly as it was intended I like the big size because it keeps the rain away from more of me than the smaller ones do Mine isn t automatic so maybe that s a problem but every automatic umbrella I ve ever owned eventually stopped working and had to be opened by hand 
5 0 Just what I expected Attractive wood finish as seen in the picture It was fairly easy to put together Keeps the golf stuff neat and organized 
4 0 Good cot for scout camp This is a good size cot for a smallish boy scout It s a little small for an adult but it fits in the tent well The only complaint is it requires a lot of strength to set up and take apart but it is lightweight and comfortable 
5 0 SUPER Light A+ Durability GREAT Price This is a great cot It is low profile and made of strong materials I was worried about the wire legs but they are very very strong So strong that it takes some muscle to get them into their holes in the frame This might be a drawback for someone who is weak in the arms It folds up easy and is very portable Also I have a smaller frame and although this cot is perfect for me a larger frame person might want to consider a wider version for comfort in the shoulder area You won t be disappointed in this one for the money 
5 0 Great portable table I had seen this table at an outdoor concert and have been looking for some time to find it Just recently I saw one being used at a resort while we were on vacation It is easy to set up and very stable We will use it for picnics as well as an additional table on our deck The carry bag is another plus No more bending over to serve food from the top of the cooler 
5 0 Be safe be seen This is a great light perfect for a be seen and backup light in addition to a stronger source The plastic handlebar mount failed on mine the first time out apparently cracking from vibration fatigue The customer support from Princeton was terrific though and they sent a replacement mount I contacted them on Friday and had the part Monday I may try to rig a velcro strap through the clip and attach that directly around the bar instead of using the supplied part 
5 0 Great backpack I bought this backpack last minute for a weekend in the columbia gorge area It worked great The backpack doesn t strain my back at all the load felt very even And the attached rainfly came in handy once as well It comes with a bunch of extra attached straps to secure all the extras tent rods sleeping pad rope etc I am thoroughly impressed to have found a good pack for such a bargain pric 
5 0 Good workout This product does what it claims it will do Put in the time and effort you ll feel great Of course I don t ever expect to look like the model on the box However I feel good and I think I look a little better than when I started Only doing it a few weeks but enjoying it 
5 0 Many Features Work out every muscle in your body with this excellent workout bench It has a lot of features for its price and it s very easy to assemble 
4 0 Good product poor packaging I had a similar experience as did others with the packaging of this product The box was literally falling apart when it arrived Luckily no parts were damaged On the plus side the package arrived very quickly The bench has lots features for the price It was not difficult to assemble It folds up very nicely as advertised It is sturdy and easy to adjust This is a very good value 
4 0 Nice equipment Easy assembly Great variety of equipment to train your body pretty sturdy great value for what you get only negatives are the rack arms are close together and you cant reverse the bar pins to rack the bar for easy access to do squats and military presses 
5 0 a great weight bench for the price I purchased this bench about a year ago I received it in 4 business days which I thought was really good It took me about 45 minutes to put it together there is alot of nuts and bolts but once I finished assembly it has been a good machine and I am still using it to do my weight lifting routines twice a week it offers alot of different exercises what I really love about it is the lat tower which alot of benches do not have until you get into the 300 400 00 dollar range which I was not willing to spend that much at the time For the price of 129 bucks and the options you get just can beat it I am very happy with this machine This machine is made by impex fitness and I definitely plan on upgrading to another impex when Im ready Chris V 
4 0 W Trimmer I love the procuct and it does provide the reslults predicted However I would like to see the band width widden a couple inches or I would like to see something like this maybe in a vest shorts combination to achieve the same results on my chest and upper stomach 
5 0 It s a real sweat machine It is a very good product Works extremely well when you using it while exercising Really makes you drip of sweat from your waist area 
5 0 Great drinking cup My boy loves his drinking funtainer It has never spilled on his lunch box even though I have put it in different positions including upside down It it great because we can take it on a car ride and it will NOT spill all over the car if he drops it and it will keep his milk cold and even warm chocolate hot The straw that pops up when you open the lid is a plus and I have not had to replace it and the year is almost over Very durable I love it and I m planning to buy more It is well worth the money and I bought it for 15 00 
4 0 From Ancient to New Recently we had a chance to use a Bongo Board about 40 years old It was all wood with quite a large drum The one we just purchased for my 8 year old daughter is great for many reasons It is so portable that it has become a take it anywhere with you activity The drum has an elastic cord so that it does not completely detach from the board when balance is lost and balance is frequently lost Finally we have had her friends try it and from initial angst to quickly getting the hang it has become a great confidence builder for them Great investment for year round fun 
5 0 Great Stroller I bought this stroller to replace my Combi Ithru but found that I needed to keep it Although this Schwinn stroller has proven to live up to its reviews has one slight draw back The recline position is a bit to far back for mall strolling making it a bit uncomfortable for the baby Aside from that the schwinn handles tough terrain like a Mercedes Benz or Cadillac Its great Baby loves the outdoors and the comfort of this stroller It has ample room and keeps her protected from the elements It steers like a dream Grandma loves the fact that it turns on a dime No extra effort needed The big wheels and shock absorbers make it a smooth ride too for the sleeping baby My daughter is 13 months old 24lbs and 32 inches tall and still has plenty of roomto grow into The stroller has great storage space below and the handle is height adjustable The only thing I don t really like is the upmost recline position is a bit to far back and seems uncomfortable for baby the reason why I kept my Combi I thru Aside from that I recommend it to anyone taking long walks in multiple types of terrain This one can handle it all Happy Strolling 
4 0 Great Stroller Very very good stroller And very convinient too This stroller can be used on different type of terrains and is very maneuravabble The only thing that I don t like is that the seat cannot recline or can be made straighter My husband tried to work something out but the thing is that the manufacturer haven t thought about it 
5 0 foose ball replacements Excellent service and a quality product at the right price I had no luck finding foose balls locally 
5 0 Completely satisfied I have stopped at least 5 shops Walmart Sports Authority Target etc to find foosball replacements but no avail the table was acquired at a charity auction but had no balls The foosballs were shipped exactly and timely as promised and still having a lot of fun playing with family and friends 
4 0 Works Great although expensive I just switched from a Suunto T6 to a T4 and this PC pod works seemless between the watch and PC It is about 2x a paper clip and with the USB connection it is easy to carry Although a little pricy from the competition if you want a system to track your running and easily monitor it the T4 Foot Pod and PC Pod work very well Down side is the software which does not support MAC come on Suunto 
4 0 Versaflex Stretching Machine I love this machine The strech is allowed to happen at a slow and gentle pace and the legs are nicely supported The only draw back is the retraction process sometimes I have to push a little futher in order to release the latch to pull the legs back in Other then that b e a utifu 
5 0 Versaflex is a joy to use I am a dedicated martial artist that has been frustrated in my attempts to attain greater flexibility Despite my previous instructor s claim that these types of machines are a waste of time money I decided to investigate the potential effectiveness of the Versaflex Based on this investigation I purchased this machine in the very short amount of time that I have used it I am really happy For me it makes stretching very relaxing comfortable I am very impressed 
5 0 My favorite goggles ever I ve tried lots of goggles These are my favorite I didn t like the sponge goggles because the sponge was leaky and fell apart quickly And I remember the days when the one piece goggles were popular but those never fit me very well These are adjustable strap and comes with three nose pieces so you can get a custom fit And it s comfortable like the one piece goggles and has a no snag silicone strap 
5 0 Tinkerbell Slumber Sack I was very pleased with the quality of this product It was perfect for the 11 year old it was purchased for not too short just right Sincerely Terri J Sullivan 
5 0 Perfect This is exactly what I was looking for I had a very similar roller at my gym Club One and loved it but left the gym a while ago A previous reviewer states that this product might be useless without the weight attachment Don t worry it comes with it and it works perfectly I interchange standard sized weights all the time have tested with up to 30lbs 30lbs is KILLER on your wrists and I m a fairly strong man If you want a gym quality wrist roller BUY THIS NOW 
5 0 mk23 i just recently bought this pistol and am very proud of it and i was wondering if the lighter 12G bb s will damage the gun because on shorty s it says only use 2 can you guys help me out 
4 0 Great Jumping Rope I am very happy with this product It s made of the best material for speed and the timer beeps if you set it I had initially rated this product with 1 star because it was twisting up so much that it became too short to jump over But my brother fiddled with it and discovered that unlike the rope in the picture there should be a gap of the plastic rope so that it s not right up against the handle So now I would give this product a 4 star rating because the manual should have mentioned it and the sellers should have known that 
5 0 Excellent Wraps Bag gloves Great if you are serious with your kickboxing or any other martial art pad drills or sparring even Wrap easily and securely nice and snug real leather soft but good padding and supports inside Great wrist and fist supports upon impact I d buy them again Need more color choices now 
5 0 very nice This door gym is incredible I have been getting great workouts with this My arms chest back and shoulders have all been noticably improved within a week Great workout Throw in a few miles of running and you have no excuse not to be ready for summer 
5 0 Very good for the price On the advice of my chiropractor I decided to buy an inversion table but didn t want to spend a lot of money because I feared it would be yet another piece of equipment that would end up collecting dust in my spare room along with my rowing machine and exercise bike So I purchased this Calm system because it was inexpensive and I figured I could sell it or send it back if I ended up not using it Well so far I and my spouse have found it to be very good for relieving back pain and best of all you don t have to spend a lot of time on the machine About 3 or 4 minutes a couple of times a day is all it takes to relieve lower back spasms and stretch out the spine Also the machine is quite light weight and easily folds to shove in a closet or behind a wall unit Overall I am pleasantly surprised and would recommend this system There is no need to spend a lot of money in order to experience the benefits of inversion therapy 
4 0 Exercise It s a nice rope with great length My only problem is it really stings if it hits you Overall it is a good robe 
4 0 Harbinger 331000 Speed Jump Rope I am very happy with this jump rope It was very easy to adjust to my height I have not jumped rope in years and wanted something new to add to my workout I am enjoying this jump rope very much It is very light and user friendly 
5 0 more of a question i am a huge fan and i cant deside between the 2 sakabatos the one from true swords or the one from china are there any differences which one is stronger i plan on it being a swinging sword so i dont want a flimsey sakabato please help me desid 
4 0 Have scooter will travel Our very busy toddler 17 months old is having a good time with this scooter It is very well made especially for the reasonable price The wheels do not scratch our wood floors unlike some of her other toys She is our third and we have had our fair share of similar toys This one is one of the better ones The only down side is that it could be a little lower to the ground She is above average height and can just reach the floor well enough to push with her feet Our older girls were petitie and this would have been too big for them at the recommended age of 18 months Once they are in their twos our girls have preferred trikes so I m also not sure how long this will last as a favorite but it can definately be handed down or given to friends as it is going to last for years 
4 0 ScuttleBug Scooter is terrific We purchased the Razor Scuttle Bug Trike for our two year old daughter and she absolutely loves it She spends hours each day zipping around on it and it is sturdy and lightweight My only suggestion complaint is that it is not adjustable in height She is a bit tall for her age and it would be great if the legs extended a few inches Would likely fit best for children ages 18 months 2 1 2 years and under 35 tall Item comes pre assembled and folds up flat Highly recommended 
5 0 My Kids Loves it and so does My Back I struggled with the decision to buy this trike thinking it seemed kind of cheap and plastic compared to the metal trikes of my youth However I ended up getting one for my 3 year old and am going to order another for when my 1 year old is old enough Whoever invented the rear handle steering mechanism is a genius and me and my back thank them I no longer live in fear of daddy push me since pushing doesn t require bending over to that terrible pushing a tricycle stance The trike itself is lightweight and easy to maneuver It has a low center of gravity and doesn t feel quite as tipsy as some I recommend it 
5 0 Great if you do not have a lot of space The Power Blocks are great if you don t have a lot of space to keep a full set of dumbells Changing weight is very easy and you can go change weight in 5 pound increments In addition to the 45 pound set you can get an upgrade to increase the weight of each to 60 pounds for around 150 
4 0 Great Bike We just got this bike for my 4 1 2 year old It is a very sturdy bike that is easy for him to ride He is 45 inches tall and has about 1 5 inches clearance over the center bar On the box it said this bike could be used for children much shorter but I don t see how It is a little bit of a struggle for him to get on the seat but once he is on he has no problems riding it Overall the bike is very nice with 2 types of braking a back pedal and hand brake The styling looks very nice and it arrived with no damage I would have given it 5 stars but the directions for putting it together were awful The enclosed directions were for bikes and features that this bike did not have and I was flipping back and forth trying to find relevant directions Putting it together is somewhat intuitive and I did figure it out but better directions would have been much appreciated 
5 0 Essential to Air Soft Parties Practice Etc for Anything Over 10 Rounds I usually do not endorse a product as a must have due to the diversity of personal preference in not just air soft but the firearm community however this item is the only exception to my rule I got this speed loaded to compliment my MP5 with a 100 round drum and anyone with Carpel Tunnel Syndrome can testify to it s a real pain to load THAT much one at a time To satisfy this problem enter the speed loader Pretty simple design and execution open top hatch and insert up to 120 airsoft rounds place nozzle on top of magazine and prime accordingly That easy Easily loads a 30 round magazine in less than three seconds It s inexpensive and easy to replace if it breaks which it shouldn t unless you took it in the field and was dumb enough to put it in your front pouch and cracked it when you dove for cover Sounds ridiculous but I ve seen it done by the Air Force guys I play with But let s face it if you only have so many magazines drums you re going to want a speed loader to make emergency quick loads in the field and what better way than to carry it with you I strongly suggest you carry it in a side pouch I carry mine in my BDU pant leg pocket below my hip holster for easy access although I try to carry more magazines in my tactical vest to avoid using it as a last resort I strongly recomend against placing it in a pouch in front of you like in a tactical vest since it s made of plastic not metal Lastly a warning don t go too overboard with the primer Sometimes if you re not watching it you ll overload the magazine drum and spray airsoft all over whereever you happen to be and either you ve wasted ammo or you have to clean it up unless you re at a friends house let them clean it up 
5 0 If you dont have one of these BUY IT NOW If it were possible I would buy one of these for every airsofter in the world YOU NEED THIS LOADER Most guns come with those stupid loading tubes that require you to push the bbs down with a stick That is the worst thing to use while youre getting shot at This will speed up your loading time dramatically BUY 
5 0 speed loader This speed loader worked great by reducing loading of a magazine from a few minits to a few seconds Great during an airsoft war 
4 0 Definetly Worth 89c Its better then shakin the bottle jams atleast once per fill but its only 89c Buy a few and you ll survive Slam On 
4 0 Decent pair First I want to make a slight correction to the previous reviewer s text the size weight of the gloves doesn t change according to the size of your hand but rather to the size of you the user of the gloves If you are an average sized male you will be hard pressed to find a sparring partner if you only have 10oz gloves nobody in their right minds would agree to spar with you because with such small gloves the risk of injuring the receiver of the blows goes way up Hence 16oz is the standard size for sparring gloves Women can use 14oz and children 14oz and 12oz depending on how big they are The point with heavier bigger gloves is to protect your training partner Anyway on with the review these are good all around sparring gloves Their over all quality is quite good and even the velcros are done well so you could use these for thai boxing as well without scratching your partner s neck and shoulders when clinching However I found that when you put more power behind your punches your knuckles tend to come through a bit so they re not the safest gloves around Still they are good enough for pretty much anybody who s looking for a good pair of gloves for sparring I recommend that you get a separate pair of bag gloves or 10oz gloves for bag and mitt work since hitting the heavy bag and focus mitts harden the leather which again makes the gloves more dangerous to use in sparring Remember to wrap your hands and wrists when hitting the heavy bag in order to avoid knuckle wrist and shoulder injuries Everlast is a good company and for the most part they make quality products These gloves do what they are supposed to do 
4 0 Exactly what I expected Similar to other reviewers I was looking for a bench that I could do both abdominal and lower back work This was the only decent bench that fit the bill within this price range The construction is nice and sturdy the assembly was no problem and overall I m very pleased The only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating for me is the lenghth I wish the main section were a foot longer which would allow me to more easily use it with dumbells for chest work Although I do love how you can raise the thigh support for curls I wouldn t have known to do that if it weren t for the photo on this site Bottom line good value for a versatile bench 
4 0 I like Stamina Ab Hyper Bench Stamina Ab Hyper Bench has sturdy construction It is well built for home gym 
4 0 Good Bargain This bench was the best combination I could find that did both sit ups and hyper back exercises It works suprisingly well for what it costs The lower leg holder can be set low for back exercises and set higher for sit ups The padding and covers seem decent Lots of adjustments It s not as heavy duty as the ones at gyms but for at home I am satisfied 
5 0 Great item and good price This bar is great when used properly i e make sure the door is closed when you use it I was surprised how well it worked much better than relying on someone to hold your feet while doing situps or cruches 
5 0 INCREDIBLE STUFF I recall first hearing about Bag Balm at an adult Scout Leader training retreat One of the participants started talking about Bag Balm and how he used it for everything from burns to lip balm Needless to say I was intrigued and upon returning from the retreat did a little more investigating When I asked my wife whether she had ever heard of the stuff she immediately said that she had and that one of my toddler nephews was then using Bag Balm under a doctor s direction for pesky diaper rash I then began to question some of my horse riding buddies They too had heard of it and used it with very positive results I immediately went out and bought a big tin for my medicine cabinet and a couple of small more portable tins to keep around my office and car and use as lip balm I couldn t be more pleased I have used Bag Balm as an excellent lip balm and have used it on minor cuts and abrasions as well Rubbed directly into the skin Under Band Aids You name it The stuff as originally touted by my Scouting friend seems also to have antibacterial properties Now I am not a doctor and I don t play one on TV so please don t take that as some sort of prescription Putting it in a nutshell Bag Balm is incredible stuff and it works I highly recommend it THE HORSEMA 
5 0 The best product for cracked heels bar none I write very few reviews but I just wanted to share my unbelievable success with healing my cracked heels I have fought this battle many years with no success I started using this stuff 3 weeks ago along with a heel sander and I only have a small scar that I suspect will go away I cannot believe the results I only wish I had taken pictures to proof the results But who wants to look at UGLY cracked heels LOL it WORKS 
5 0 Awesome Stuff This has been used by our family forever We use it on burns diaper rashes cuts on our animals and just about any type of open wound it works wonders Plus this trial like size makes it perfect for the diaper bag purse drawer or first aide kit 
4 0 Not bad for the price I have used this bench for a little over a week For the price you can t go wrong It is sturdy and seems to be well made The adjustment is smooth and locks firmly in place Great for lying leg lifts All and all this is a good bench I would have given it five stars but the description says it can be fully up right for use during military presses this is not true it can almost go vertical but not completely Still I think you would be happy with it I am 
4 0 Great gift idea I bought 3 of these for holiday presents this year and everyone loves them Inexpensive but not easy to find I was told easy to use My dad labelled 2 boxes of balls on Christmas morning 
5 0 Zip N Hit Works Teams Hit over 0 400 I got great results coaching 2 teams last season in 2006 using the Zip N Hit as a training aid in addition to live Batting Practice We would work it into our routine for pre game drills and starting practice drills With every player maybe getting another 20 25 swings at a moving ball at each practice and pre game session over a season it adds up to 200 300 extra swings that you can t get from live BP which takes too long you must retrieve balls Both of my teams last year batted as a team over 0 400 in both Bronco and Pony I had several players bat over 0 500 and 0 600 too It also helped them develop a level swing which improves the Batting average and become better situational hitters Other opposing teams also began copying us Perfect for pre game warmups where you aren t allowed live BP i e regular games tournament games Our league is now buying one kit for every team in our league as basic equipment The players can even help drill themselves 
4 0 Zip Hit Durability Durability seems to be an issue The cord breaks or unravels much too quickly The sleeve inside the ball becomes grooved and slows the ball s travel on the cord A sleeve made of a harder slicker material would improve both ball speed and reduce cord wear Possible materials are hardened aluminum stainless steel polished teflon based plastic or polycarbonate 
5 0 Great Camping Table This table is so easy to assemble and is very lightweight for travel We go airplane camping in a Piper Super Cub so lightweight compact and sturdy is a must for us It comes in a handy travel bag It s a great table at a great price 
5 0 Kershaw Knife is excellent product I have had one of these for 10 years but recently purchased a second one because I was having to move them between the RV and house This case on the newer version is so much better and the second handle is a great improvement Every outdoor person or cook should have a Deluxe Blade Trader in their set 
4 0 Chicago girls skates I ordered these for my 7 year old daughter and she loves them She wasn t really used to skating either but has done very well on them Not too many falls and learned easily Great item even for beginners Kim Collin 
5 0 Recommended Very sturdy and reasonably priced My daughter is just learning to skate and loves that she has her own skates that are just like the one s at the skating rink I would recommend these to everyone 
5 0 Unbeatable for the price I am a year round bicycle commuter in Chicago who teaches classes on bike safety and riding with children I ride all the time at night often with my kids in tow We bought this as part of a set for my son s bike two years ago It is absolutely phenomenal in it s visibility durability and ease of use I cannot recommend it enough I have something of a fetish about visibility when we ride our bikes at night I have bought just about every blinkie light out there This is my favorite along with the Blackburn Mars tailight with 7 LEDs including two amber side lights Mind you the Mars is more than 3x the cost of this Bell light Pros extremely visible multiple flasher modes easy on off feature for when you are locking up in a public place long battery life Cons the red shield can fall off when the bike is dropped or hits a hard bump We solved this problem by putting a small piece of electric tape on the top edge 
5 0 Bright Light This was purchased as a gift for a duck hunter He had used other head lamps but absolutely loved this one for the brightness and accuracy of the light when he moves his head I would highly recommend this product 
5 0 This is much better than my previous Petzl headlamp I bought an older model of the Petzl E32 P Myolite 3 Headlamp a couple of years ago for a trip to the Grand Canyon Although it works well when on the move whether for hiking at night or finding your way to the water cooler or latrine it has two drawbacks when using it in a fixed location a even when using the 3 leds which is the less bright option it is so bright that one can not easily use it for reading nor can one use it in ones tent without disturbing your tent buddy b even when using the 3 leds it is so bright that it is difficult to use it to read since it makes the white of the page reflect back at you Also the weight is a bit heavy on one s head It is for these reasons that I just went out and bought the Black Diamond Zenix IQ for my upcoming trip to Yosemite I have been playing with it in my apartment tonight with the lights turned off and I can already tell that this Black Diamond model is far superior to the Petzl I bought 2 years ago The Zenix IQ has the following features it is much lighter and more comfortable than the Petzel it has 6 brightness settings as opposed to Petzel s 2 it has 3 settings for the two LEDs and it has 3 settings for the ultra bright bulb it has a multi function colored LED that acts as both a headlamp finder in the middle of the night when you wake up and are looking for your headlamp and as a battery meter to warn you ahead of time when your batteries are starting to get low 
5 0 Great Swim Cap I had trouble getting water in my ears before wearing this cap Now no problem It keeps my hair fairly dry or at least drier than with other caps I ve tried It s easy to put on and take off no hair pulling It s lasted well so far Much better than wearing a cap with a chin strap 
5 0 Great Sleep I highly recommend the Wenzel Raised Insta Flex Air Bed over any other air bed out there I have had two other brands and Wenzel is the best Having a bad back sleeping on an air mattress is not something I look forward to but because of the height of this bed and just all around general quality I have had no back problems and have slept great The built in air pump is a dream as well 
5 0 Great lightweight stove Coleman should keep it up I purchased a Coleman Exponent F1 Ultralight stove this past spring in preparation for a trip to the Cascades in Oregon I have owned a liquid fuel stove for years MSR Whisperlite purchased in approx 1992 and have loved it but as I am getting older I have been wanting to trim my pack weight down I have found the following advantages to the F1 Ultralight 1 Easy to use Simply unscrew the burner head open the pan supports screw the burner head back down screw stove onto canister light match twist valve and you are cooking with gas 2 No priming The liquid fuel stoves required priming and pumping which made them harder to use than I would have expected With this stove you simply turn the valve and light No waiting for the generator to heat up 3 Very light weight The stove assembly itself weighs less than just the small fuel bottle for my liquid fuel stove alone This thing is a feather on the back The disadvantages are there as well 1 Canister stoves rely on the low boiling point of the fuel to force fuel vapor up and out of the canister and at temps close to or below the boiling point which is close to 0 fahrenheit the stove simply will not work For me where and when I camp this is not an issue 2 Fuel cannot be used as an emergency fire starter 3 Fuel is EXPENSIVE compared to white gas or unleaded gasoline The owners manual claims this stove only works with Coleman Brand canisters but I have found that any threaded canister of 70 30 Butane Propane blend works I have used Brunton Coleman MSR and some odd black Canister I bought at a gas station in Oregon with it all with excellent results Compared with other canister stoves such as the MSR Pocket Rocket Brunton Optimus Crux Snow Peak Giga Power Stove or Primus Yellowstone Techno Trail the Coleman Exponent F1 Ultralight had the design that made the most sense to me sported the lowest weight 4oz lower than its nearest competitor and from what I was able to determine in impromptu in store testing appeared to have the best pot stability of the group with pot supports that spread out nice and wide One tidbit about this however is The Evernew 1 3L Titanium cookpot is oddly shaped on the bottom and sits and a slightly odd angle on the F1 I have tried many other pots and this is the only one I have a problem with The issue is whith the oddly dimpled bottom of the Evernew pot and NOT with the Coleman stove SUMMARY If you camp where the temps aren t freezing low weight ease of use are important and cost of fuel is unimportant then this is the stove for you However you must carry some other sort of emergency fire starter in lieu of having stove gas to start wet wood If however the cost of fuel is going to be a factor for you or you are going to go mountain climbing or whatever you will want to bypass any canister stove at all and just go with a gasoline model instead The Coleman F1 Ultralight is the lightest of the group of stoves I had considered had the best design and came in at a price point that I liked For the majority of backpackers out there I would say this would be the best stove for you 
4 0 Nice size ball for two I bought this toning ball so my girlfriend and I could work out together It s a little heavier than I d recommend for small women but boy do you feel it when you re done 
4 0 Ausar007 Yankees MLB Cap Fits Most People its a slick slender Apparel with the MLB Logo on the left side A true Authentic cap It can be worn any given Yankees Home games Its a all natural navy blue cap with the white NY symbol in front It has an adjustable velcro strap to fit it to your liking Also an already curved shaped brim for under 30 dollars with fast shipping and handling Only the true Yankee fan will appreciate it s look and Major League design 
5 0 REALLY NICE RESULTS Hey if you are thin and you are on gym you should use this product it raelly goo 
5 0 Highly Recommended It gave me a lot of energy and I was able to lift a noticeable amount of weight on my first work out using the product I also noticed better and faster results from using No Xplode I like it 
5 0 The BEST Creatine + Nitric Oxide workout surge The two most respected bodybuilding supplements are 1 Whey Protein and 2 Creatine They are also considered natural products or food products While whey is without a doubt extremely useful creatine does not help everybody I have used creatine monohydrate in the past and I found it to be useless It was so utterly ineffective that I just felt robbed of my hard earned money My tub still sits in the cupboard I have never used any other supplement products other than the ones that seem to be on the safe side as these both are I heard about NO XPLODE from some bodybuilders who seemed to think it was probably one of the best supplement products to come out in years I researched it and it appears that BSN has formulated a surging Creatine + Nitric Oxide drink that seems to work with most people Not everybody sees results but this stuff worked for me and that is what counts Although NO XPLODE contains some serious chemistry see below and possibly some debatable compounds Guanidino Propionic Acid GPA and Glycocamine it is probably well worth the very low level risks for the results 40 minutes after taking this stuff I can either cardio high intensity for 30 min flat maybe even more and complete a full range of compound weight lifts in the gym without feeling any interruption in my power No fatigue The surge is exactly as it promises You will feel that you have nitro pumping around your body It sets in at about 20 minutes for me I feel a little woozy at first disorientated then my brain picks up and my body feels energetic Put it into action and you will see results It also boats a CEM3 type of creatine that prevents you from bloating up like monohydrate does I never have stepped much outside of what is considered safe but in my opinion NO XPLODE is standing on the fence saying I am about the best bang for your buck without any serious side effects So far this stuff is getting very good feedback Yes it contains lots of mind boggling ingredients but if you are looking for the creatine edge even if creatine has never worked for you before then NO XPLODE is probably the one It can also help build muscle but even if it doesn t for you it is still worth it for the surge I am very glad that I got it Very Serving Size 1 Scoop 20 5g Servings Per Container 40 Amount Per Serving Calories 36 Calories From Fat 0 Total Fat 0g Saturated Fat 0g Cholesterol 0mg Sodium 150mg Potassium 75mg Total Carbohydrates 9g Sugars 0g Protein 0g Vitamin B6 25mg Pyridoxine HCL Vitamin B12 120mcg Cyanocobalamine Folic Acid 400mcg Magnesium 360mg Phosphorus 500mg Calcium 75mg NO Xplode Proprietary Blend 20 500mg NO Xplode Contains a patent pending nutrient suspension matrix Efforsorb Delivery System NO Meta Fusion patent pending L arginine AKG Citral M citrulline malate L citrulline AKG L histidine AKG RC NOS rutacarpine 95 gynostemma pentaphyllum 95 gypenosides NAD nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide Muscle Volumizing Creatine Matrix patent pending CEM3 creatine ethyl ester malate 2CM dicreatine malate Betapure trimethylglycine Glycovol glycocyamine GuaniPro guanidino proplonic acid Cinnulin PF aqueous cinnamon extract keto isocaproate potassium Ener Tropic Xplosion patent pending L tyrosine taurine Endurlac glucuronolactone l tyrosine AKG methylxanthines caffeine MCT s medium chain triglycerides vinpocetine 99 vincamine 99 vinburnine 99 Phospho Electrolyte Replacer Calcium phosphate magnesium oxide potassium phosphate sodium phosphate Glycerol Hydrating Polymers Potassium glycerophosphate magnesium glycerophosphate glycerola stearat 
5 0 excellent luggage carrier it is very good luggage carrier to withstand the weather conditions since i used it in the trip when i started it was raining n not drop of water could enter through it and i was worried since i had all my clothes packed in it it is very convient to install n uninstall with enough capacity to fit your things in it 
4 0 big screen The large display is nice The altimeter and compass don t seem to hold their programming and need to be recalibrated ofte 
4 0 Nice addition to the world of Hiking and Camping First off let me start by saying that I really like my Summit watch It is large some may go so far to call it HUGE but it is surprisingly lightweight on my wrist and quite comfortable to wear Those with bad eyesight will STILL be able to see the easy to read digital readout of the time barometric pressure altitude and compass The numbers are quite big so they are difficult to miss The altitude reading measures in increments of + 1 foot which is about as good as you can get I like that But what I really like about the Highgear watches that I haven t seen in other brands which offer similar features is the visual image on the face of the watch telling you what the weather conditions are or will be No kidding this watch will actually show you whether or not it is sunny partly cloudy or raining Pretty dang nifty if you ask me The barometric pressure reading is only a small part of predicting the weather however after months of use I have to say that my little watch is WAY MORE accurate than my local TV Weatherman I d say somewhere around 75 of the time what my watch says is exactly what the conditions actually ARE Not bad It s a feature I would VERY much like to have on my Suunto and Casio models with similar functions Until then I ll rely on my trusty and much cheaper Highgear Summit If you are considering making the purchase of a wrist watch that offers the digital compass altitude and barometer functions before MAKING that specific buy do some homework and wherever possible seek out a store where you can actually SEE the watches in person Being able to guess the size of a particular model using a picture on the computer can possibly mess up your purchase Find the best price and pull the model out and actually TRY IT ON before you buy For me the Highgear Summit was a good purchase however if you would rather enjoy these same functions but in a smaller package try the Highgear Axis or possibly the more stylish but much more compact and WAY MORE expensive Suunto Observer Either way doing a little homework will pay off in the end Happy hiking and I hope this helps you in your efforts to buy the right product Good luck 
5 0 Excellent flag football flags Just like the ones used in college intra murals excellent stitching and look to be very durable Fast shipping and great deal 
5 0 Great Bike As Advertised My 24 month old son loves this bike it was fairly easy to put together and works well Thanks 
5 0 PLENTY BIG STILL HAS STYLE My middle school daughter was always struggling to fit her books in her old backpack which up until this year worked fine I went on line to find the roomiest one I could and still get style color choices and outside pockets We were amazed at how much room this had inside Now all her books fit nicely and she loves the extra pockets so she can easily find her lunch pens pencils her cell phone and other extras 
5 0 A 20 day test I just returned from a 20 day trip and this new backpack went along It is comfortable commodious and just the ticket I have a 25 year old JanSport backback still ticking but a bit tattered that I have used and used and I expect this one will provide the same service It s great 
5 0 Satisfies this law student s needs I have ridiculously large books and a half hour walk to and from the train station each day Unlike every other backpack I ve tried the straps of this one have yet to start ripping or fraying apart from the bag The only feature I miss is a buckle connecting the two straps across the front of the chest so they don t pull apart at the shoulders However the bag is heavy duty and roomy and I m easily able to fit my laptop Con Law book maybe the largest book ever made Crim Law book 2nd largest ever and pocket dictionary Overall if you can get as good a price as I paid for it I would recommend it to any student or other user 
5 0 fast service backpack just what I expected and I got it really quickly THanks 
5 0 Much more comfortable than the darn chest strap The Power Glove is a great replacement if you hate wearing a chest strap They always hurt my chest so when I saw this I ordered it and I am glad I did This is so much easier to wear when I go for my walks or do the stair stepper 
4 0 Not bad These were a little smaller than expected so if you have really big hands look to see if you can get a bigger size A little tight at the wrists but these have great padding and serve me well 
5 0 Alright I ve been kicked out of two country clubs for using the Butthead Golf Club Cover and it appears the only club that allows my membership has been Playworld Putt Putt There s also no dress code involved there Now on to the review I strongly endorse this Butthead Golf Club Cover because it adds an element to golf that would otherwise be forgotten fun Those teets really help my handicap like you wouldn t believe Many clubs have a problem with this cover because they re incredibly elitist but when I think of golf I think of cow teets and that s why I refuse to play without it 
4 0 mostly dry I used mine for two weeks snorkeling in Hawaii It isn t perfect It does take on a little bit of water sometimes when you go below the surface but it isn t enough to cause any problems It is pretty easy to clear by just giving a hard quick blow You probably won t find anything better 
5 0 Speedo Silicone swim cap Excellent quality much easier to put on than the cap I used before 
5 0 works for me This swim cap is easy to use and thick enough that I can t imagine it ever ripping or tearing 
5 0 Good value I bought this hiking pole to take geocaching with me It s sturdy lightweight and retracts for easy storage It s also nice that it absorbs shocks A good product for the money 
4 0 Great for the Price Looks like this is what I need for short hikes A little on the heavy side but good for day hikes 
5 0 Great flags Just like the ones used in college intra murals excellent stitching and look to be very durable Fast shipping and great deal 
4 0 A great basic gear bag I got this gear bag and love it It doesn t have a lot of the features you ll see in higher priced bags its really just a durable mesh duffle bag but its great for someone who has a lot of gear they want to carry and perfect for couples who just want to tote their fins boots masks snorkels and any other small gear like defog gloves knives wrist compasses computers etc 
5 0 Sturdy stylish functional I have used the bottle to take tasty beverages with me on the road while playing sports to drink while I am in class The bottle washes easily in the dishwasher The narrower profile fits easily in cup holders I highly reccommend the N Gen It is much larger than 24 oz If you fill it all the way to the top you have nearly a quart of capacity It is the best functioning and looking drink bottle on the market You can also use the bottle as I have to pack small items which you want to be slightly more secure while traveling by air and also keeping some items out of the rain in your backpack 
4 0 Fun for impromptu get togethers I bought this croquet set late last summer for backyard get togethers with the neighbors None of us had played before so we didn t need top of the line and the price was right on this set It s everything it needs to be weighty colorful and compact in its case The widgets are pretty bendy but if they bend out of shape they bend right back Turned out to be a good investment A word of warning if you have small dogs put them in the house before you let your neighbors loose with mallets and round projectiles My little dachshund picked up the bad habit of chasing the balls and pushing them further off course It was funny until she darted into the path of one bright orange ball which made solid contact with her little head She s fine now but is no longer a fan of the game All in all I would highly recommend having a set like this around if you have the room in your backyard and fun neighbors 
5 0 Question Hey can you please tell me when the next platinum timberlands are going to be in stack 
4 0 Great classic boot I don t usually select items by quot name brand quot so I tried many other boots before I tried the Timberlands But none seemed as well constructed or was as comfortable I have had them for 4 months and they have proved waterproof in rain and puddles thus far and have shown very little wear 
5 0 Always in style Timberland s are in no matter what the season I mean you can wear them with a pair of khaki shorts in the summer or all your tight winter gear You know you can t have just one pair or one color so just go ahead get them 
5 0 Great Gun Great Price Some people talk trash on this gun and on how it s not upgradeable First of all if you can find a better gun for 85 bucks I d be amazed Second of all for just 89 cents you can buy some teflon tape and wrap up the hop up receiver boosting you another 70 fps Search online for tutorials Second There is a tightbore barrel out which will boost you only about 20 fps but greatly increase your accuracy UTG also has a drop in cylinder upgrade coming out So there are upgrade they just require manual labor and you can t just buy them ready to go If you re willing to put time into your gun it ll be well worth it I love this gun I m shooting abou 
4 0 Quality Everlast gear I have been practicing mixed martial arts for four years and I have gone through all of the major glove brands In my opinion Everlast has always provided gloves that provided the most effective wrist support which means less twisted wrists especially for beginners Everything else is well done but not exceptional it s comfortable and provides durable padding although I myself have only used the 16 oz versio 
4 0 Handy for short workouts Assembles easily and doesn t take up much space The quality is good but I don t think it s strong enough for heavy use It s great for small workouts in front of the TV though 
5 0 High Quality Product I didn t know what to expect but these turned out to be very good quality They stretch well and return to shape They don t feel like they are going to snap apart when you are in the middle of exercising I was very pleased with the product Be careful though if you have a latex allergy I also got excellent service from the company I would definitely do business with them again 
5 0 The most used pocket knife I own Of all the many Swiss Army Knives I own this is the most used Not only is the Pocket Pal small enough to easily carry in a front jean s pocket its simplicity makes it perfect for quick use for fruit peeling paper cutting and a whole host of tasks 
5 0 No Slip Step This step is great It really adds variety to my home workout I use it on carpet and it really stays put It doesn t slip on the carpet and I don t slip when I step on it I was a little worried because it didn t have a rubber stepping surface but it really doesn t need it with regular athletic shoes 
5 0 Excellent Exerciser I have arthritis psoriatic diabetes high blood pressure heel spurs and Osteopenia a pre Osteoporosis state and I m 240lbs A real grab bag of conditions to deal with I saw what happened when my Mother broke her hip and I really didn t want to have that happen to me But how to exercise Using a warm therapy swimming pool was about the only exercise I could do and that will not provide the weight bearing exercise needed to re form bone Just walking around is cheap but I m a female and my neighborhood is not really well lit and has gone downhill a bit too I just didn t feel safe walking around at 2 am or whenever I was up for exercise Besides there were hazards like uneven pavement high curbs and all the issues of weather to deal with I had seen the ads on TV for the Gazelle line of exercise equipment and it seemed to be ideal for me I could exercise my knees and hips in regular gravity conditions or add resistance if I needed to without any arthritis taunting up and down impact on my joints No more worries about where I was stepping and into what I could exercise whenever I wanted and not disturb anyone in the neighboring apartments I could go as far as I liked and wouldn t have to worry about being exhausted from going too far from home and not being able to make it back So I got the Gazelle and I LOVE it I chose this model The Power Plus for my use but also because my best friend is 340lbs and this will take up to 350lbs From the way it is constructed which is very strong and SOLID I m not sure that s really it s upper limit This is not some flimsy cheaply constructed rip off It does not move sway or walk when I use it Yet with the handles on the side I m able to lift the back of the Gazelle up onto the front wheels and move it fairly easily which really suprised me since it is such a heavy duty machine Any downsides It did have a small bit of squeaking at first but it never got to the point where I d be worried that I was disturbing anyone Because it is built so solid it does command a bit of space Not too much but it is not a model that will fold up so you ll need to commit room for it and enough room for the swinging motion I d want to safety fence off around it to protect pets and kids from getting too close when it s in action Over all I am VERY pleased with this item Well done Fitness Quest 
4 0 a flaw but easy to fix I bought one of these based from a review I pretty much agree with her the machine is great and it gives a good workout But she forgot to mention the thing can cause your feet to get sore I tried wearing high quality running shoes and it still hurt I received an advice to attatch foam strips to the runners that you stand on and that has solved the problem So far I have not used the pistons so it s just a cardio workout I have Tony s tapes he sells on his website and his music cd s and I do get a very good workout I have lost 13 pounds so far by using it and I noticed it defanitely toned up the buns 
5 0 Works great for cars There s not a lot of information out there on using this extractor for cars because I think most people buy it for boats instead So I m going to talk about how well it works on changing the oil in your car In summary it works great It s really nice being able to change your oil on your own time and at your own home without getting dirty I m never going to Jiffy Lube again It even works great on my lawnmower Using the extractor is very easy Just remove your dipstick insert the extractor s tube into the dipstick hole until the end reaches the bottom of the oil pan it might take some practice to get a feel for this part Once everything is in place pump 10 20 times This will cause a the extractor to suck out the oil like a straw It takes about 15 minutes for 3 quarts That s also why I recommend the 6 liter model instead of the 2 5 liter one so that you can suck out all the oil in one shot Some people wonder whether all of the oil is removed this way Unfortunately I can t really speak to that because that would require me to open the drain plug and investigate However the consensus from stuff I ve read on the Internet is that the extractor does remove as much oil as the traditional method Because changing my oil is so easy with the extractor I always change my oil on time Previously I drove for thousands of miles past my due date because stopping for an oil change was too inconvenient The extractor should be used after the engine has been running The oil is less viscous and the contaminants are stirred up making the extractor more effective Also please remember that your old oil must be properly recycled Most mechanic shops will accept your old oil I put it in a plastic orange juice container just call ahead to make sure 
5 0 Pela Oil Extractor 6 liter Works great Used it to drain the oil in my 2005 VW Beetle TDI 
4 0 It does the job The plastic side mounts 4 appear to be solid and not flimsy I replaced the 12 supplied screws with actual stainless steel ones you know since this is going on a boat But at least the hooks to attach the cooler are stainless The package says includes all stainless mounting fasteners So I guess that means hooks only The supplied screws are not even galvanized So if you plan to affix these mounts permanently to a boat go get stainless screws that are also 1 2 longer than the ones provided All in all it s a nice kit but a little pricey for what you get 
5 0 NOT just for the fisherman First off I need to tell you that I ve carried a swiss knife since I was a kid I have most of the styles But this one stands out as the absolute most useful for a rather strange reason For me since I don t fish I found more uses for this in the most unexpected area The fish scaler tool is one that I would NEVER use to scale fish for no other reason than the problem of having to clean it thoroughly too much work But this tool I have used more than any other on all my knives I ve used it to open ceiling hatches to change office lights pick locks to measure things something you need more often than you think to reach into thin areas to clear debris or push a switch and most of all as a back scratcher Since there are no sharp edges on the scaler it s perfect to scratch those areas one can t reach That s not to ignore all the rest of the tools this knife offers which I use except for the absurd parcel hook This tool is useless and yet Victorinox continues to install it on many knives The only useful task I ve found for the hook is to tighten one s laces on my boots when I snow shoe Anyone else found something useful for the parcel hook Please post it if you have 
4 0 Looks Beautiful but a little thin I love the look of this mat Love the pattern and colors but it is a bit thin I just layer it on top of my old mat 
4 0 A Good Value This paddle is a bargain here at Amazon Sports stores would easily sell this for over 20 Having said that I found it to be slightly heavier and the thicker sponge made it difficult for me to adjust my game BUT I still eliminated many a younger player at our men s retreat There s nothing better than seeing the face of a 23 year old when a 53 year old kicks his rear Thanks Stiga 
4 0 good paint I recived the paint quickly and it as in great condition I only had 1 bad ball in the whole pack of 1000 
5 0 good tasting the taste is not bad u can drink 2 glasses and not get sick of it i gained 5 pounds in the first week of using it i went from 140 to 145 using n large 2 eating a lot and working out 
5 0 No complaints at all Even without the great looking box this product is well worth the money but with the box it is almost a work of art of course some stain in the bare wood would help This cleaning kit is a must for any collector of Japanese weapons 
5 0 Seems to be working These bands were recommended by our son s summer camp and we were quite skeptical about them But they seem to be working very well and are comfortable to wear Our son likes them much better than the sprays and smelly lotions that we used to use and never really worked Before using these bands his legs and arms were covered with bites We are very pleased with them and highly recommend them to others 
4 0 Automotive use After polishing alloy wheels I treated them with Boeshield It leaves a waxy film that attracts dust and dulls the finish however there is no sign of tarnish or oxidation Very easy to clean off when you want really bright wheels 
5 0 GREAT bike This is a great bike I gave one to my 2 and4 year old to share for Christmas It is winter here so they ride it through the house all the time My son has really struggled with 2 wheel bikes because the typical bike easily crashes when you turn the handle bars too hard This bike is made so the turning radius is very small The bike is light enough that he just picks it up a little to make a big turn No problem He goes sailing through the house now with NO crashing Once the weather is good enough to go outside he is going to have a ball He will definately graduate to a standard bike after this teaches him balance He should be able to skip the obnoxious training wheels altogether My short 2 year old loves it but she has to go slowly because she can barely reach the floor In a few months she should be fine and I m guessing by this summer she ll be sailing on it GREAT FUN Unfortunately the price is very hard to swallow I found one on sale through a design website so I could manage it If the money won t bankrupt your budget or you can save for it it s worth it 
4 0 Second one I ve purchased This is the second Vector I have purchased My first six year old one has gotten beat up and the compass no longer works The watch has a large dial and is a little bulky but you get used to it You trade that for a large easy to read dial The watch has more features than you can use and a large instruction manual to go with it It has the compass barometer temperature and altimeter The 6 hour barametric pressure history box is nice to warn you of incoming bad weather The watch is a nice instrument but I would warn against abusing it It is shock resistant not shock proof 
4 0 It s HUGE But pretty darn cool This may be the outdoorsy ubergeek watch It s big it s ugly but has functions to make the fattest Swiss Army Knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy Overall I like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are The timepiece Outstanding It has HH MM SS DD MMM of course with a year setting to avoid leap year issues This should go without saying in a modern digital watch Stopwatch with lap function not that I ever use the lap function but I m sure someone is interested Countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown very easy to set Three daily alarms Special kudos for the alarms this is one of the loudest watch alarms I ve heard and I ve missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this The Altimeter largely eye candy but kind of neat Over four days my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level by the maps about 40m ASL Not surprising because it is driven by the barometer and I never recalibrated it but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want need it The Barometer Yup it s a barometer The part I like is the little display that shows the rising falling trend especially as this is always active even in normal time mode The Thermometer Take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist The compass Easily the best special feature Accurate precise enough for orienteering not for surveying easy to use It can be programmed for a declination but knowing me I d forget to reset it so I do declination the hard way The sighting notches are small but servicable The spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to Suunto and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass An outstanding wrist compass The package Big Really really big But the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing a problem for me with other watches The battery has a shortish 12 18 month life but has a hatch so you don t need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance The display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground and the display light is just right readible even and glare free but not an emergency flashlight Personally I m going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap but the stock strap isn t bad just not great Overall not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch compass and barometer and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter Well designed thought out and manufactured but really big

5 0 Terrific Training Product I purchased the Kwik Kik for my 11 year old to use as a training aid for the recreational soccer program he is involved with It was fairly easy to put together and once the base is filled with sand it cannot be filled with water it s simple to move it from place to place The Kwik Kik is a great way to build up the strength and stamina in his feet and legs I love the fact that he can use it either in doors or out doors so he ll be able to use it to keep training throughout the year Great Product 
4 0 High quality Very high quality durability This glove works well as it should Only complaint splitting hairs here is that it gets pretty hot pretty fast and your hand will sweat If you are an extreme sweater you may want to sacrifice the quality construction of this glove for one that is more well ventilated 
4 0 So good I bought a second pair I ve owned my first pair of Big Grip gloves for over three years now and they re still in great shape for a time I was lifting four times a week I only bought a second pair to keep in reserve in case Harbinger discontinues them The only down side for me is the finger length The glove s fingers at least on my hands end right at the second joint and are mildly annoying when you bend you fingers until the gloves break in After that though they re great 
5 0 Harbinger Big Grip Non WristWrap Glove Charcoal Steel Blue XX Large If you are a power lifter and often tear your skin with regular lifting gloves then these are for you They offer the most support in the areas that I need it then any other glove I ve tried A++ 
4 0 U S Divers Icon Sonora Dry with Learn to Snorkel DVD Combo We purchased this item for our 15 year old daughter when we spent a week in the Keys The DVD gave her a good overview of how to use the mask snorkel The mask and snorkel were of good construction and kept water out This was a great product and a good price for what we needed and used it for 
4 0 Speedsafe I thought the speedsafe was a button that you press which flings the knife open I was dissapointed to find that it is just a spring that helps it open faster Other than that this knife is ultra high quality definately the best I have owned 
5 0 Blur might be the last thing they see I hate to feed into the mentality that causes knifemakers to hype their blades as tactical because the last thing we need to give lawmakers is another excuse to heroically protect us by banning the tools we carry But the first and last thing I have to say about the Ken Onion Tactical Blur is that it is one fearsome knife A curved blade would be suited to your usual cutting and slicing applications such as skinning mastodons and so on This knife on the other hand has a chisel like tanto point which is ideal for thrusting effortlessly through beef ribs or car hoods It would be equally at home cutting up cardboard boxes linoleum flooring or metal garbage cans Technically this isn t a switchblade Switchblades are bad We know this because our lawmakers have heroically protected us by effectively banning them at various levels This is only an ordinary liner lock knife with spring assisted opening But if I ever found a switchblade with the deployment speed and cutting power of the Blur I d say it was quite a knife The blade is shaving sharp from the factory and the handle is lightweight but sturdy aluminum with some kind of gritty sandpaper like stuff glued on to give a better grip should the knife become slippery with any sort of fluid Use your imagination I haven t tried shattering any cinderblocks with it yet but it s sturdy enough to use as a yawara stick in a pinch Folded the whole package can be palmed even in my small hands and feels much like a disposable lighter with a glandular problem I don t even notice it in my hip pocket which is where it rides whenever I happen to be wearing pants If walking around with something this fearsome seems too naughty for you remember a couple of things One is that you can buy it from The Wall for 55 and The Wall would not sell naughty things to naughty people Another is that crimes to my knowledge are not generally committed with knives like these but with such evil implements as kitchen knives screwdrivers and whatever happens to be lying around near the crime scene Lastly you will probably not need a knife this fast and ferocious but if you do you will really need it And you ll have it 
5 0 Awesome knife I had my knife for 10 years and would still have it if not for the 2nd instinct of putting it in my back pocket whenever I leave the house One night I was heading for a flight at the airport going thru security when I realized I had it on me I had no choice but to throw it out So had to get another one 
4 0 Excellent Racquet As an intermediate player I have been highly satisfied with this racquet 
4 0 Great bench price Quick shipping but poor packaging There was obvious chips of metal from the structure in the packaging and one of the main SCREW and BOLTS pagackages were already open lucky i found all Bad packaging BUT EXCELLENT bench It takes a decent bit of assembly but it fit perfect in my 2 car garage and still lets 1 car in Great multi function product You can do all core lifts and also do lats and curls to build the minor muscles for definition Pretty sturdy structure but seems a tad bit hallow no problems yet for a hundred fifty five bucks with free shipping another 155 value It was REALLY worth it I say to anyone who likes it its worth it Just get it Wether your a pro or beginnger its good for getting stronger and adding mass 
4 0 Great Casual Bike I bought this bike after not riding since I was 14 32 now The box arrived in excellent condition and the bike was nearly completely assembled I also had a little trouble with adjusting the front brake but got it figured out Overall this is a great bike for those casual trips around town I m not a trail seeker so have never tried it off road Very happy with the quality and ease of assembly 
4 0 Solid all purpose bike The bike was delivered 70 rough guesstimate put together It was relatively easy to complete myself only had to use manual a few of times and i m certainly no expert The only problem I encountered was getting the front brake pads to align properly on the tire With that being said I spent a few dollars at our local bike cycle shop to have it looked over basic tune up service to make sure it was safe to ride The bike now rides nicely and serves as my cruise around town bike Overall I think this is good value for the money but only if you re looking for a hybrid type bike for shorter more casual trips 
5 0 Very Durable and Endless Fun If you want classic jump ropes for your kids get these They re so durable The kids love them 
5 0 Great for Travel I take power or ashtanga based classes 3 times a week So when I travel on business taking a mat along isn t the best plan So I purchased these and when I traveled they were great on the hotel carpet I read some of the other reviews that they aren t durable and I don t think these were designed for everyday use Regardless I love them for travel or when I can t make it to the yoga studio 
5 0 excellent I am saving this until this summer I can t wait to use it 
5 0 Most fun I ve had in a long time The one I bought is green and black looks good in the water I first look this kayak dingy really out into the Gulf of Mexico The swells were two two three feet and the harder I paddled the behinder I got I thought I had made a bad purchase but then I took the dingy into Clearwater Bay with much calmer waters and I m having the time of my life Paddling is slow going 2 to 3 miles per hour at most but I ve gone a couple of miles and back all along the bay I bought a Coleman pump that runs on 4D batteries and I can inflate and deflate it five times before I need to change batteries This kayak is the best 70 I ve ever spent Great exercise too 
4 0 Too Sensitive The pedometer is just too sensitive It tends to over state the number of steps that I have taken I like the item but I cut the number of steps that I have taken by third So if I am tageting 10 000 steps a day I try to go 13 333 so that I can be sure that I really hit my target The item itself is well made light weight and easy to use and set 
5 0 Excellent Product that does what you buy it to do I ve purchased 3 tubes of this brand The product works as advertised I have bigger thighs and use it to prevent chafing while I m walking around at work This product is especially a lifesaver during the hot summer months There are other brands on the market but this is far the best value I have found Thank you Sportslick keep making your product and if it s not selling find different distribution channels 
5 0 Plano Tackel Box It is very well made Works very well for our use We are into model rockets We keep our motors in the box Fills our needs great Steven Rushin 
4 0 Blue Dragon Sword This is a nice sword for 35 plus tax When I removed the sheath there was some sort of goo on the blade probaby so it wouldn t rust This is a carbon blade so don t leave it in a moist closet for 1 or 5 376 years by then the rusted blade alone will be worth a fortune Just dont get the blade wet ok You can rub a moist towel across it to get rid of the rust protector if you re going to use it often but that is pretty much all you can do to clean it without a special kit Please dont brandish this sword around like a bad actor in a kung fu movie You could realy hurt someone with the point of the blade I think this is shipped over seas so dont challenge your friend to a violent battle the day after you buy this and you should be fine Blue Dragon is actualy a japanese video game that no one bought I think it was based on a part of final fantasy 2 I don t want to bore you with video games so i ll get to the point Put it on display dont cut your lawn with it dont play ninja with it and dont ever ever ever ever ever ever try to cut a solid object in half with it prefrebly a tin can because the cheap blade could fly off the tang and hurt you or prefrebly your neibor in the face Please don t throw the blade at your neibor either P S I am not neil meislin I am his son daniel meislin If you can t understand my numerous perenthesis I guess you re not smarter than a 5th grader 
5 0 Amazing shipping speed I Bought this sword on the 25 th of december Got it on the 27 th of December Paid for standard shipping Amazing delivery time the sword is amazing too Thanks for the great product X Bows i will be coming back to you soon 
5 0 Fantasmic I absolutely love this watch and amazons fast and reliable delivery of the product didnt hurt at all I mainly got this watch so that it would be easier to orient myself if I was lost or giving direction via the compass but now that I have it I wouldnt know what I would do without it A Great Purchase 
4 0 Almost very happy but mostly my fault The dials gages appear to be very good quality and look very nice They are very accurate as far as I can tell in comparing them to my LaCross Clock Weather gage and the local weather reports and web reports The Hygrometer may be off by 2 but am not convinced this is true as yet and I can adjust it I set the barometer to +1 1 for my 1050 above sea level I wish the clock was not a loud tick tick tick It is not that bad but I would rather not have that at all as my ears very easily pick up on things like that The one thing I do not like is that I should have checked the dimensions of it I am not sure if they were listed when I bought it So check the size of what you think you life before you purchase This one seems a little small Not the gages but the mounting board It could be a little wider and a little taller I also somehow messed up on buying one that had such a boring mounting board I would have liked a beveled arch on the top or such The wood is good quality and the varnish appears to be top notch I don t mark down for this I mark down for the size of the mounting overal as it could be taller and wider Not buy much but maybe an inch wider and 2 taller Overal I like it alot I just did not realize how plane jane it was in mounting and size 
5 0 Lovely feel The Ultrastar is a classic disc wonderful to throw and catch I personally feel that Ultrastars vary based on the color but I just may be imagining things These fly better than the average Whammo although I feel that I can throw 180g Innova Pulsars a little bit further Still the Ultrastar has more curvature and has a nice stable flight pattern I ve thrown the Adidas 175g as well and while that is not as bad as a beat up whammo it s still not quite the same 
5 0 It can t be that small You owe it to yourself to own a flashlight made using the Cree XR E LED It s roughly TWICE as bright as the currently comparable Luxeon LED Also the regulator circuitry keeps the light at a fairly constant level through the life of the battery not all LED flashlights have this feature It s small enough to be put on a keychain yet puts out a powerful beam 
4 0 Very bright but awkward I already owned a Fenix P1 which amazed me with the impressive light it threw from something so tiny It was easily small enough to fit on my key chain and so it is always with me Even a great light source is useless if it s not accessible when you need it I owned a Surefire Ultra which is a great flashlight but obscenely expensive But you could feel the quality and knew it would last a few decades I love the rear clicky button design and the 5 levels of light I expected some similar design elements in this new Fenix I was disappointed to see that to switch to the different settings you have to screw the collar left right then left right again and so on So if there is one setting you use most often you must go through the whole 5 turns just to get back to it next time Come on that s just stupid I will keep it only to avoid the exchange hassle and it still is a good value considering the size and light output especially compared to the uberpriced surefires But there is no comparison as far as construction or quality So 4 stars is all I could muster for the crude setting selection method design and the adequate but toylike feel of the casing construction 
4 0 Very bright camping lantern I bought one of these lanterns three years ago at the local discount store I have used it numerous times on camping expeditions It outputs very bright light at full blast The lantern is quick to light and the best part is it does not require matches The only three issues I have with this lantern are 1 Sucks the propane I also have the coleman fuel lantern and while it is not as bright it can go for a week of camping on one tank 5 cups of fuel 2 Loud This lantern is loud when burning The above mentioned lantern is much quieter 3 Construction the fiberglass base around the knob has disintegrated from my thumb rubbing it when trying to light the lantern Hopefully this will not affect the longevity of the lantern I d recommend it if you are looking for convenience and bright light but if you are looking for value go with the old dual mantle coleman fuel pump up lantern 
5 0 Awesome Hand Warmer If you are out in the cold and its important for your hands to be warmed then you need these hand pocket warmers They are even great for just being outside for a walk I have poor circulation and MUST keep my hands warm to avoid pain and these warmers do the trick 
5 0 This rowing machine ROCKS I was am a runner who constantly was sustaining leg injuries of one type or another I finally yielded to the fact that I needed to seriously cross train and reduce my running I decided to row however I abhore having to spend tons of cash on exercise equipment to work out indoors when running is virtually free outside I originally wanted to spend only a few hundred dollar so at least I could get my work outs in and see if I really liked rowing After reading every review I could find I decided that it may be in my best interest to spend more than a few hundred dollars When I chose the Body Craft VR100 rower I figured that I would still be compromising quality since it was a mid priced unit I didn t want to listen to things click and clack and have to tighten things that would loosen over time Much to my amazement this rower Rocks It was really easy to put together the parts are high quality and the important thing is when you row you don t even think about the fact that you are on a machine It s solid steady smooth and a great workout I use it 4 5 days a week for 45 mintues each time and have had it for about 1 month It feels just as good as the day I bought it If you are thinking about purchasing a rower I highly recommend this one 
5 0 A fun accessory for your bike I just love my little Parrot The kids on the bike trail love to hear it too 
4 0 Valeo Competition Lifting Gloves I ordered these for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES them he says that they are better than any that they have at his gym Very durable and only moderately padded great for the price 
5 0 The Harbinger you want the Glove you need This is the Harbinger you need unless you are going to be power lifting only then I suggest you look into the 12xx series but they are for very quick lifts and not for wearing more than ten minutes because they are like wearing boxing gloves If you want to spend time in the gym lifting say the big three like squats deadlifts and bench presses for a couple of sets then the Harbinger 140 Pro WristWrap Glove is exactly 100 what you need I would never and I mean never buy another glove again simply on the bases that every other type of glove I have used has split within two months of use while Harbinger just lasts through deadlift upon deadlift upon deadlift and looks as good as the day I bought them The wrist strap is a really nice touch very long and wraps around and around to keep those wrists nice and firm for the big lifts You go to the gym and you want a pair of gloves that will support you and last longer look no further Buy them 
5 0 WOW WOW WOW The Firm just keeps getting better and better They re products are WONDERFUL I ve been using The Firm videos for a looooong time and I LOVE them The cardio weight training does wonders for your body Now with the TransFirmer system this is definitely a challenging workout even for me and I ve been an advanced exerciser for over 20 years I love the incline step you can really feel the difference You can also increase the intensity or you can do it less intense as well It gives you great variety with the height of the step weights incline etc THIS IS AN AWESOME WORKOUT I LOVE EVERY DVD Very challenging and I m am very happy I bought this The step is wonderful and very sturdy This is the only step you ll ever need for all your Firm workouts 
4 0 Good table not great I would give this 3 5 stars if possible Its a decent table the chip holders with cup holders are easy to rearrange accoring to preference The Table itself seems to be a piece of plywood with some green felt tacked both sides of it and slots cut out for the chip trays It works but could have been a nicer better made product for the money Watch out for the shipping costs almost 1 3 the price of the table Pretty expensive 
4 0 Good little bike For some reason the electronic control panel doesn t work on my bike But I don t mind too much The bike is small and light but has enough mass so it doesn t slide around I use the bike while doing work watching TV or reading It s a great way to get exercise on rainy days 
5 0 Great night time FUN for kids The kids at our church campout had a great time with the Aerobie SkyLighter Lighted frisbee s we bought for them They took a pounding and one spent the night in the pond and still continues to work 
5 0 I like I am not an exercise person But I need to keep moving and others in my family have bone issues that mean they shouldn t exercise in a manner that stresses the joints This machine is perfect for all of us I put the machine together and found it to be quite sturdy and fairly heavy The electronics on it are working just fine It s the kind of exercise machine that I can get on watch TV and forget I m actually exercising 
4 0 Shag Pro Ball Shagger Dispenser The product works as anticipated I was disappointed that the packaging was missing golf tips that were advertised as being included This advertising was imprinted on the product s box so it was not just a stick on label afterthought I think someone tampered with the box before shipping 
5 0 Shall we shag now or shall we shag later Now if they could figure out how to tee the ball up for me I wouldn t have to bend over at all But seriously I find this product to be a vast improvement over the old shag stick that I was using I haven t used it on real grass though just on the practice mat and net I have set up in my garage Given the consistent way the Shag Pro serves em up I think it would also work fine out back 
4 0 Good versatile jogger This is a good jogger if you will be using it for more than just jogging I really like the fact that it has a front swivel wheel that you can lock for jogging and unlock if you need more manuverability It comes with cup holders which is nice because a lot of joggers you need to puchase them as an accessory Overall it is a good stroller the only thing that I would change in the design would be the wheel locking feature It has 2 individual locks one for each wheel The jogger I had previously had a bar across the back that would lock both wheels at the same time when pressed I am extremely satified with the stroller for the price at which I purchased it 
5 0 Awesome stroller I bought this stroller after much research and deliberation It is comfortable for my as well as my daughter It handles wonderfully It folds pretty well too The front swivel wheel makes a huge difference with manuverability and the adjustable handle bar is a great feature I am tall and it helps to have the handle where I need it I have used this for both walking shopping and jogging and think it is perfect From purchase to delivery it took maybe 5 days I am extremely happy with all aspects of this purchase I love this stroller 
5 0 Great tennis accessory This is a great tennis bag with good space Fits 3 racquets easily and several separate areas I love it 
5 0 Definitely a Football I m not an expert on footballs but I haven t seen anything wrong with the way this one is performing It s easy to grip and throw and it doesn t have that cheesy hey I m a recreational football look to it Good deal for the money 
5 0 Great product I bought this product to use during my camping trips I had a minor issue with my order but was corrected immediately great customer service This is a really neat hammock it packs really small but is very resistant My friends loved it when they saw it and it was really easy to set up You will enjoy it whether you go camping or on your backyard 
4 0 TOO LONG TOO LONG FOR 5 TALL PERSON I HAD TO MODIFY IT FOR MY WIFE ITS THE SAME IDENTICAL CHAIR AS AB LOUNGER ABLONGE CAIR ETC SAME MANUFACTURERE IT HAS A STICKER ON IT THAT SAYS WATCH FINGERS WHILE FOLDING YOUR AB LONGE 2 ON IT SAME COMPANY SAME CHAIR EASY TO MODIFY DRILL OR SAW EITHER WAY TO FIT SHORT PEOPLE GREAT PRODUCT WIFE LOVES IT OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS BUYING THEM NOW 4 STARS NOT 5 DUE TO ME NEEDING TO MIDIFYING IT BUY THIS ONE SAVE MONEY INSTEAD OF ABLOUNGE 
5 0 Great HRM Had this device for 3 months absolutely love it The chest strap you must wear in order to detect your heart rate takes a little time to adjust to but it is very accurate The most useful feature offered that is not included in many heart rate monitor devices on the market is being able to keep track of the distance you ran the speed max and average and calories expended This allows you to control your pace while running by speed or because some days your body may react differently to exercise and may fluctuate you can change your training accordingly with the heart rate monitor function You are also able to easily program the watch so that it will alert you once you ve reached a target heart rate or time or speed and even resting rates laps etc essentially letting you program your interval training Distance is very accurate once calibrated manually Never owned a gps based heart rate monitor before but I chose this the gps based hrm because I need reliability according to some reports on gps based hrm the gps signal is weak when running in places with trees or tall buildings Besides if I get lost I figure the extra running can t hurt me = 
4 0 Great running or walking watch I really like the heart rate monitor and it works great As has been said it takes some time learning all it does but it s worth it in my opinion The only thing I was not real excited about was the pace jumps around quite a bit but from what I have been told by others and their brands of running watches they all do this to an extent Everything else I m quite happy with and would highly recommend it to anyone The distance reading has been right on the money after calibration 
5 0 The best pick If you are looking for complete information about the training or fitness activity and want to analyze to improve your performance or avoid overtraining this is the unit Very nice software a lot of nice information very well presented Speed sensor is reliable and accurate does not suffer all kind of interfence such as GPS units error is really smaller than 5 even during long runs The information available during and after the exercise is great temperature altitude calorie count all HRM metrics such as average maximum Bike sensor provides speed distance etc Fitness test is a nice measure of improvemen 
5 0 Great Knife LOVE this knife Looks great sharp as can be out of the box Thin enough for the pocket of my khakis One disclaimer use the safety It opened up in my pocket once no clue how and could have been dangerous 
4 0 Great little knife not for big hands Great little knife I ve taken to carrying it with me on every occasion my Native is too big Super sharp and keeps its edge even after some pretty heavy use Only beef is that it s a little hard to open and close with one hand because of its size I m going to have to get the leek 
5 0 Kershaw Ken Onion A 1 Perhaps the best and most useful pocket knife you can have 
5 0 Excellent knife useful for personal safety I purchased this knife for about 4 cheaper than its usual Amazon listing price at Amazon s Friday Sale I had been looking at the Kershaw knives for awhile and following an incident in my building s parking garage woman accosted pocketbook stolen it seemed like the perfect time to buy The rainbow titanium coating color might bother some men but I m a woman so I don t mind the color of the knife I would have preferred the black on black but this was too good a deal to pass up The safety lock looks like it might slip out of safety easily but in two weeks time of regular wear use I haven t had a problem I flip the knife open often heck it s fun and I wear it regularly what s the point of having it if you re not prepared to use it The thin attached metal belt clip is very sturdy and multipurpose it looks similar to the metal clip on a writing pen Not only can I clip the kninfe just inside my slacks waistband but it clips easily to the inside leather pocket of my purse The single finger flip open mechanism is beyond belief very easy to use exceptionally fast and accurate The locking mechanism keeps the blade in place is extremely solid and has worked without flaw When I m walking anyplace suspicious by myself I hold the knife in the ready to flip open position in my hand held down at my side The knife is nearly invisible in that position so I don t stand out as oh my God she s carrying a knife However someone intent on a criminal act just might notice and avoid me altogether Great knife for personal safety Lastly like the other reviews point out these knives are SHARP I don t use mine to open letters boxes and typical pocket knife activities I believe that would gum it up and slow the opening speed of the knife so I anticipate the blade should have a good long life in my care 
5 0 A Classic What can I say If you re a Steelers fan then you must have these 
5 0 Lectra Battery Heated Gloves These were purchased for a client who has severe arthritis and works outdoors Our winters here are very cold and he found he had much less pain in his hands and fingers using these gloves 
5 0 Great entertainment fun for everyone We got this as a family gift for Christmas We love the red color and it s great to have out at most holidays The kids were so excited to roll it around and hear the ice inside They didn t believe it at first that it was really making ice cream The anticipation drove them crazy But it was fun for everyone I fully recommend this product We are a family of 4 with the mega ball At first I wasn t sure if it would be enough but we even had leftovers And I love the fact that it comes with recipes for different flavors I would give it 10 stars if I could 
4 0 Fun for all ages I bought one of these for friends that have children and one for a friend who is married without children They all seemed to love it 
4 0 Ice Cream Ball We purchased the Mega ball and have made ice cream twice in 2 weeks The kids think its great It takes a good half hour or more but worth it Make sure you have a really good stiff plastic spatula for scraping the sides of the container it can be hard to get off Really easy to clean 
5 0 Very Pleased With This Net I bought this net to accompany a Kettler basket I recently bought for my bicycle and it fits perfectly It was as if they were made for eachother I can either wrap it around my basket or hook it onto my rear rack 6 hooks and a directional bias make it immensely practical 
4 0 Great table Compact and lightweight yet durable Despite what the other reviewer has said this table is great I delpoyed to Iraq with this table folded up nicely in my duffle bag with no problems The table is lightweight and stirdy as long as you set it up correctly I use it for my laptop indoors but outdoors it works great as well provided a hurricane isn t trying to blow it around Overall it s a great table that s compact and easy to set up and break down My only complaint is that the plastic tabletop slats are thin plastic and if you have any heavy items sitting in the middle of the table it will bow a little unless you place the items directly on top of the support beams I d buy another if I had the need for one and everyone in Iraq has complimented me on it because they re stuck trying to find ironing boards or water boxes to set their laptops on 
5 0 Right on the money I work out at home using dumbells and a number of bodyweight exercises My dumbbell collection had grown cumbersome and messy so I looked around for a way to organize these dumbells in my room and this rack was perfect I did look at a number of racks both online and in RL but the majority were way over my budget had crippling shipping charges or were too limited in terms of their capacity to space ratio I was just about ready to fabricate my own when I found this on Amazon After reading the reviews and crunching the numbers I decided to give this a shot I m happy to report this has completely solved my dumbbell storage problems This rack arrived a couple of days before anticipated with the use of a single crescent wrench I put it together without assistance in the space of an hour or so Well within 2 hours of opening the box it was in place and holding weights It is solidly made of heavy gauge steel and quality welds covered in a tough tactile coating material The construction method is of simple carriage bolt and nylon insert locknut assembly It ships with rubber coverings for the feet and all orifices The actual dimensions of this rack are 36 75 x 24 x 32 W x D x H Add at least a foot to the height for the minimum workable usage space for lifting the weights in and out I have filled it s available space with sets of 10 50 dumbbells in 5 increments For the past month it has held 540 and remained absolutely rock solid From the feel of the thing it could hold easily twice this weight without issue Highly recommended for personal use or even tight boutique space 
5 0 Apex Deluxe 3 Tier Dumbbell Rack Does the job Does not take up a lot of space Holds all my weights and is located for easy access during workouts What more do you want 
4 0 A Car Camping Must My wife and I love this product Now it s not for backpacking but it does work great as a car camping or base camp stove It does require one of those disposable propane tanks which can be tough to dispose of and it might make sense to get the carrying case not seeing it attached here But besides that a great simple stove which can be used in all kinds of conditions 
5 0 Wonderful item We bought this for my daughter when she was around 2 months old and she has loved it ever since We just moved her to a big girl bed because we have another one on the way and she just wouldn t part with it My husband attached it to her bed and she still uses it to soothe herself back to sleep at night Almost 22 months old I was so disappointed to see that Fisher Price doesn t make this item anymore and had hope to find another new or used one for the new baby but the prices people are asking here are outrageous 
5 0 nice product my baby doesn t go gaga over it but she does like the moving picture on the ceiling occasionally it s a great product though so don t depend on my baby s tastes 
4 0 U S Divers Proflex II Diving Fins We purchased 4 sets of fins and masks for a trip to Jamaica We were very happy with the US Divers product The price was right and the fins worked just as expected They worked just as good as sets we have rented Rather than renting fins at the beach we now have sets to use the next time we travel to the ocean 
4 0 dare I say too bright I bought this for when I work on my car motorcycle in my apartment building s parking lot The lighting is poor and I ve found headlamps to be an absolute necessity I bought this one because it seemed to have the properties I was looking for a wide even swath of light for close in handy work After comparing to several other lights on a site that is easily findable by searching for flashlight reviews I decided on this one Having bought it I actually wish I had gone for the Princeton Tec Quad The thing is this headlamp is extremely bright It has two buttons to select the light output one chooses between using all 8 LED s 5 3 or just 1 The other chooses between full output dimmed output and a flashing mode Even with 5 LED s on the dimmed output there is plenty of light for me to see what I m doing The reason I say it s too bright is that with 3 AA batteries it s kind of heavy Basically I wish I had went for the Quad which has 4 LED s and traded off the excess light output for something lighter and more comfortable 
5 0 Great Value This item is such a great value Everything included is a basic necessity For anyone interested in getting into boxing I suggest this set as your first purchas 
4 0 Yes small but such a good bag I just read the other reviewer s comments Yes the bag isn t huge but it certainly gets the job done It s not the over sized bag where you can stuff 6 full sized textbooks but it s a bag that has style That s why I got it It s a bit more european in its design and is of good quality I dont expect zippers to break anytime soon Look to be good quality Also at this price it is such a good deal 
5 0 Great Service Great product has a nice spin _ _ =====D 
5 0 its cheap and it works just as goos as any other one i use this radar gun to see how fast my shot is in lacrosse it works perfectly there is no use in buying one over 200 dollers i mean its a radar gun it is worth your money 
5 0 Better then other sight I used this for paintball on my military simulation A 5 I see other sights and I was worry about this since its cheaper The red and green dot is MUCH more visible then my brother in law more expensive BSA also About the manufacture website it is a 40mm Dont know why they said 30mm But like some sight the lens both front and back are both 40mm but theres a inner tube that control the up down left right of the laser and it decrease the viewable area just slightly Overall it worked great I can tease tuant my teammates with pinpoint shots near them 
4 0 Buen producto Dura poco Estos son los guantes que mas me gustan para nadar Mucho mejores que los aqua sphere El asunto es que duran poco Despues de unas 50 idas a nadar ya estan muy rotos y hay que conseguirse otros Tambien hay que tener cuidado con el tama Yo tengo manos grandes y solo me sirven bien el tama medium Por el resto el producto es muy bueno y comodo 
4 0 Easy On Off I m serious about acqua aerobics and the upper body workout I can get by using these high resistance water gloves The unique velcro closure is a great improvement over other types which were a struggle to get on and off Wish they had a Medium choice of size They only make a S and a L These gloves were a great find and the price was right 
5 0 Speedo Aqua Fitness Gloves This is my 4th pair of aqua fitness gloves my 2nd pair of this exact Speedo Aqua Fitness Glove Allowing the fingers to protrude through the ends of the gloves is a great benefit With other gloves water builds up inside the glove and if lycra backed for example the glove becomes like a big balloon after a short while These Speedo gloves allow the water to pass through the glove and out the finger holes In addition the material the gloves are made of is much sturdier than other gloves I have had The palms hold up well as do the backs I recommend these gloves and will always use them in my water fitness exercises 
4 0 Great Pocket Knife Overall this is a great little knife It opens fast is very sharp and holds it s edge well and feels good in your hand The liner lock is great I have used some others and absolutely hated them because they were so hard to operate This one is smooth as silk and located in a great position Very nicely designed I did make a few changes which required going out and buying a torx screwdriver First I reversed the pocket clip because it came the facing the opposite direction I was used to on my Spyderco knives Second the safety had to go I found it slipped to the on position on its own so the knife did not open when you expected it to and was hard to disengage quickly Not because it was difficult to operate rather it is tiny and hard to find blind If you like the safety though it definitely does prevent the blade from opening accidentally Speaking of safety the knife arrives razor sharp I opened my package and promptly sliced a finger badly enough to leave a scar The tension that the blade is under requires some force to overcome and gives it a different feel when closing the knife from a regular lockback Be sure you fingers are nowhere near the blade I am now in the habit of disengaging the lock and closing by pressing the back of the blade against my thigh 
5 0 great gun First off this gun shoots a mile I hit my friend in the head It left a welt the size of a 2 quarters If I was you I would bey this gun 
4 0 Pretty Good This gun is pretty good but im not sure about the power being 300 fps and the battery takes too long to charge Although the clip only holds 30 rounds the gun is deadly accurate and very powerful when charged long enough But please do not buy this gun for use as a sniper because the scope is a piece of s I recommend blowing it up Anyway to answer that person s question the cocking handle is just for looks Now back to my review The scope does not have red crosshairs as i ve heard people say and the sights are much better although you should tighten the screws The foregrip on this gun is awesome as you can fold it up or down and is not too wobbly in the down position Overall this is a great gun and I would highly recommend it to any airsoft player and plus it s only 30 
4 0 Lightweight I purchased two chairs one for me and one for my husband For me the chair is perfect I weight about 110 but my husband who is about 270 it is not so good Chair is way to small for him I love it for myself because when I take my children to the beach it is very easy for me to carry along with all the other beach accessories I would recommend it for someone looking for a light weight chair that is easy to bring along places 
5 0 A Wonderful Space for Practice When I used lighter less dense mats they would sometimes bunch up or move around during flowing vinyasa practice If my toe caught the mat the edge would flip over and require adjustment Also they did not cushion very well In addition lesser mats wore out quickly and had to be replaced When doing poses like the side arm balance my foot would slip off the end of the regular length mat and I would fall out of the pose With the extra long manduka mat none of these issues is a problem The mat is solid and dense and stays put on the floor no matter what I do It cushions really well but because it is so dense it is no problem to balance or move on the mat not mushy I beat the daylights out of these mats and they still look great Durability is outstanding and they show no signs of wearing out Ever The extra length allows me to move with confidence knowing I won t run out of room or slip off the mat An additional benefit of the long mat is that it allows you to change your starting position on the mat somewhat so that the small area worn by your feet is not the same every practice In other words you can spread the wear over a larger area to make it last even longer The surface is plenty sticky for normal yoga and if you do a hot yoga class or sweat a lot you will likely want to have a towel anyway No complaints about stickiness As for weight it seems that if you are big enough to need an extra long mat you are probably plenty strong enough to carry it around It ain t heavy it s the best yoga mat I ve ever seen 
4 0 Best I ve found so far I ve had trouble over the years finding ear plugs that would make a consistent seal against sound I ve tried various types including the compressible foam but nothing seems to work all the time I use ear plugs when riding my motorcycle under my full face helmet These plugs work great and are very comfortable They re also very easy to remove not so the compressed foam if they re just a little too far in I ve had no problems with the ends touching the inside of the helmet and have since bought several more including some for my riding buddies to try My only complaint is that the included case doesn t hold up to repeated use the hinge just doesn t last but the plugs have held up nicely for a couple of months now 
5 0 good stuff i get frequent ear infections any time i get water in my ears i took these to a water park and they worked perfect They are very soft and wont make your ear sore 
5 0 Excellent bike rack The thule 450 foot pack is quick and easy to install fast delivery On a scale from 1 to 10 this whole transaction is a 10+++++ 
4 0 yoga chica i have to say that i LOVE this mat the combo jute and rubber make it nearly impossible to slip only thing is the jute and rubber are rubbing up against one another and kind of crumbling and flaking off where i often place my feet causing bald spots on my mat haha weird huh so now you know other than that the mat is visually very pleasing 
5 0 Good stuff Better than any club shop product Perfect for the new golfer and light enough my son did not get tired carrying them for 9 holes 
5 0 No Straps This watch heart rate monitor is everything I wanted I can get a heart rate in about 5 seconds by putting your index and middle finger on the two buttons on the top and bottom of the clock face I havent used the other features yet but appreciate not wearing a strap HRM anymore 
4 0 I was worried but I had concerns when I ordered this machine Like the fact that I am so short I didn t know if it would be designed for taller people It worked fine for my height as well as my husbands height I am 5 I also had concerns because I have arthritis but I was able to do this without causing flare ups all the time and I am able to set goals and get a decent workout I am able to adjust the machine to more difficult tensions so this is something that will last a very long time for me The only drawback that I have found with this machine is that it hurts the toes a bit Mine are starting to get use to it a bit This machine is worth the money I would highly recommend it to anyone especially those suffering with bone disease such as I am It is a wonderful way to get healthier without compromising on pain 
5 0 Great deal easy to assemble I got this trainer assembled in an hour with no problems It s a great deal for the price not flimsy at all Perfect for at home needs 
5 0 Pleased with item ordered and fast service I received the exact item I ordered and quicker than I thought I would get it The price was right too 
5 0 Walking Poles make working out a complete breeze I purchased my Leki Nordic Walking Poles because I read somewhere that these poles would reduce stress on my hips and knees while walking That is totally true I have a congenital malformation in my right hip which prevents me from ever being able to run or jog as a means for exercise I do love to walk but was hindered by the pain from my right hip By using the walking poles I am able to walk quickly without any pain at all even though I am actually using more muscle groups than I would if walking without the use of poles Walking alone a person only uses about 50 of the large muscle groups Walking with LEKI Nordic Walking poles one will use up to 90 of all the large muscle groups this turns a simple 30 minute walk into a full body workout without stress I would not walk any other way now that I own my LEKI poles 
5 0 This is a steal I own an older version of this net It is about 10 years old and has been used once week every summer It was used in a high level volleyball league but it would be great for recreational use as well I paid 200 for the net and it is still like new I can t believe this is selling for 69 GET IT NOW 
5 0 Excellent product Teeter delivered exactly what they promised I have been very happy with the hang ups and have used them for the last month I have not had any issues and they look to be built very well 
5 0 These boots are great I got a pair of these boots for Christmas and even though I m not sure what all they can be used for they are great The construction is top notch they re easy to use comfortable etc I seen cheaper boots on the market but when I m buying a product to let me hang upside down a few feet above the concrete tile floor in my house I want the best product for the job 
5 0 Great for multiple decks and many players Our card group of ten people play President which requires three decks and a large table This unit makes it easy to pass the decks around the table to whoever s turn it is I added a teflon furniture pad to the bottom and we can easily slide it from one end of the table to the other 
4 0 Good machine Good machine excellent price purchase shipping But remember You gotta get on the thing and do the work 
5 0 Pure shade Excellent product don t hesitate this big umbrella is the perfect one to protect you and your equipment when rains start 
5 0 Awesome This is a better stroller than the other three all for one child strollers we have Very maneuverable and adjustable It turns on a dime and seats adjust up and down independently Folds down very quickly It s great that the kids can sit next to each other 
4 0 Blake s review Bag is easy to carry and lightweight It is good for carrying gym clothes to school Bag is somewhat hard to open 
4 0 great buy and works well I bought it through the Target Amazon store which was cheaper than the same product through other vendors Its very easy to assemble although you may want to play with the chain a bit to set up the desired tension by shortening the chain to belt connection which can get chain grease on you a bit To me it was exactly as advertised a long rowing machine that is not too quite but far less loud than expected and works well I do not fold it away after use but its a nice feature if you want to move it to another part of the house and dont want to lug an 8 foot long device 
5 0 As advertised and no problems We have used more expensive professional grade ergometers that would have cost at least three times as much and we are very pleased with how the Integrity compares for a home version Assembly and operation are easy the equipment seems well built and the noisy breeze generated by the wind resistance wheel is very tolerable allowing conversation or TV viewing with only moderate volume increases 
5 0 Excellent pack especially for students Highly recommended My wife uses this pack for nursing school As you can imagine she carries A LOT OF STUFF This pack makes it a lot lighter on the shoulders than a normal pack would because of the padding in the straps I would recommend this to anyone who is a student and is looking for a durable pack for school 
4 0 Great compartmentalization a little stress Pros 1 great compartmentalization everything is easy to obtain if you know where to put it 2 Lots of room able to put just about everything in it gym clothes several text books laptop camping gear etc Cons 1 its bulky even when nothing is in it its bulky if your one who likes to show off your back or want a sense of style this is not the product for you Tip to make less bulky put more stuff in bigger compartments relative to smaller compartment 2 THe shoulder strap strain resistant doesn t quite work i m consider myself an average male strain works in about 25lbs if you want less strain i d go for the Targus or Wenger brands Conclusion if all you want is lots of space to put ur stuff w o the style involved this product is for you 
4 0 Awesome backpack I love my Jansport Odyssey backpack It has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack I have ever owned or tried I have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack can t be beaten for tranporting books A little more padding in the straps or smaller textbooks would make it perfect but it is still better than anything I have seen out there I would highly recommend it to any high school or college student 
4 0 Excellent Video for Technique and Proper Form I thought the DVD was excellent from the standpoint of a person not having much experience in lifting or exercising It shows great technique and form I used to be a wrestler in the highly competitive state of Iowa so over the years I learned many of these pushup and workout techniques Pushups and dumbbells used to be my main source of lifting and staying in shape I found myself to be too advanced for the Power 10 workout so the video seemed like common knowledge So for beginners and more advanced people looking for a great DVD focusing on developing proper form and technique this is an excellent DVD The DVD takes you through many different styles of pushups showing the proper form and setup It then does about a set of three of that style pushup to show you the routine in live workout motion With the DVD purchase I was hoping to find an exercise program approximately 30 45 minutes long that sets up a nice workout routine for people short on time I was hoping for a video that combines a variety of different pushups using the Perfect Pushup into a nice timed workout A workout that works my chest back arms abs and some cardio into a nice overall workout that is done in short time Something similar to a Tae Bo style video or other timed exercise videos The Power 10 Workout isn t that type of video It is more specifically a technique video that one can evntually combined into a workout of their own I recently wrote some emails to the Body Rev president suggesting the development of a video for more advanced people that provides a fast effective workout routine that one could get at the gym but can do at home in 30 45 minutes with their Perfect Pushup He seemed pretty impressed by the idea so hopefully BodyRev builds on this DVD like they have for their other products 
5 0 GREAT PRODUCT from a GREAT COMPANY As a man with nearly flat feet this product has saved my legs While the quality and durability of this orthotic are similar to others in its class what seperates it that SOF SOLE s CUSTOMER SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING and THE WARRANTY holds true When they wear out within a year simply send them back and you ll get a new pair You ll be purchasing several pair feel great and wonder why you didn do it sooner I ve owned Sof Sole insoles for 7 years and I ll have them for 7 more 
5 0 Great I love using this product It goes good with xylitol too Great I love using this product It goes good with xylitol too 
5 0 Liquid Stevia GREAT alternative to sugar The FDA clearly doesn t care if we become diabetic so we have to care for ourselves This is a good part of God s creation being used for its designed purpose Plus the company was quick to get it to me and it arrived as promised Great experience I will buy again 
5 0 Miracle Product I could not believe how well this product works It is hard to imagine that this is not a more known product in the market You don t need much to make things sweet which makes the dollar last longer 
5 0 would purchase again The fat Mouth clamp ons were easy to install and withheld a 15 hour trip from Texas to Colorado and back again They came off my luggage rack very quickly and when when we are ready to use it again will be quickly put back on I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an attachment for ski rack to thier factory installed luggage rack 
5 0 Jansport TX56831 Air Vital Street Tech Daypack It is the best backpack I have ever seen 
5 0 Sweat it Off This isn t a weight loss tool it just helps to sweat off excess water retention I have noticed a considerable difference using it with my daily workout 
5 0 Solar belt This works just like the ad says It is easy to use is comfortable and does concentrate your workout on the midsection I am very pleased 
4 0 not bad This product isn t a miracle product but it does do a few things it supports your back it is comfortable it does make you sweat mostly on your waistline and therefore does make you lose some inches and also detoxes you a little bit It s not a bad product overall but don t expect a miracle you have to do the work for this product to help you at all I do use it any time I m doing an aerobic workout to enhance overall affects 
5 0 Excellent racquet for new players My daughter just entered 9th grade and joined the tennis team I have played badminton for years and tennis is a fun sport and about the only sport I will do with her other than walking or biking I bought her this racquet because I wanted something easy for her not too heavy and reliable The salesperson at Dick s Sporting Goods recommeded this one and I am happy to say that it has been great She has been able to hit the ball and with some practice I can see her becoming more confident In fact the other girls on her team are always asking if they can play with her racquet I have been doing alot of reading and the racquet really does make a difference one piece is better and this is a titanium racquet This racquet has great shock absorption I have rheumatoid arthritis and will not play with a racquet that is going to leave me in pain I liked this racquet so much that I just bought a second one so my daughter and I can play with the same racquet P S it comes in a nice case and the Wilson US Open Tennis Balls are an excellent choice for a match 
5 0 Great Trike We have purchased 3 of these tricycles in the past 2 years for our grandsons 1 was a gift but the other 2 are kept at our home as I watch the boys daily The boys ages 20 months and 3 yrs love to ride them with the streamers flying and the bell ringing I love them because of the way they are built The center of gravity is set very low to the ground making spills and tip overs a thing of the past The rubber wheels have a better grip than the plastic wheels of other brands too I had purchased a small plastic trike and the way the wheels would just spin in place was very frustrating to the boys The old fashioned fenders on the wheels help keep little fingers from getting hurt and the wide step in the back seems to be useful when getting on or off All in all a great trike 
5 0 Excellent This item was perfect for my son who is advancing in skateboarding and tricks 
4 0 factor X quarter Pipe Kids love this quarter pipe However did not ship in a timely fashion due to amazon delay in ordering and had NO directions Luckily a friend had almost the same thing and we pretty much figured it out after a phone call to the company It did take a while to assemble 
5 0 We Love this stove Ok so I read a horrific review but that sounds like a lemon of a stove Our stove is great We took it out for a trial run with 12 or so friends and what do know it performed flawlessly The ignition was quick the cook temp was even and we had our coffee before many others using their Colemans In fact several friends couldn t believe the heat this little guy produced We love this little stove and will be using it for many years to come 
5 0 Terrific all around pocket knife I ve been carrying and using these Swiss Army Spartans or similar model for about 35 years Bought my first in Germany and couldn t get along without it now Great quality and has just about everything you could want for daily use It s small enough and light enough that it s comfortable to carry Doesn t have all the useless bell and whistles that you d probably only use if you were a 12 year old Boy Scout Only problem mine not the knife s is that I tend to lose one about every 6 7 years so I bought 2 this time so as to have a replacement for the next time it grows legs and walks away Another great feature is the optional eyeglass screwdriver than can be purchased and fits neatly via a threaded handle into the corkscrew 
5 0 Very pleased I was really impressed with this Nascar sleeping bag I purchased it for my nephew who recently turned 5 He s a big Nascar fan and he was super thrilled to have this 
5 0 Workin up a sweat with this Step Gotta say I LOVE this Step and even more so the DEAL Not only do you get The Step but you also get FOUR raising blocks AND a Step workout dvd All for under 50 I think that s a bargain compared to buying the pro equipment I think it was 70 80 for the pro Step and 40 50 for two raising blocks plus 15 for a DVD that s like 140 150 The Step is smaller than the Steps you re probably used to from the gym BUT it s not that much smaller I would say it s about 25 shorter length wise It s gotta be though I mean it s an at home Step so they re making it more storable I guess if you re a big person it might be a little frustrating at first but I don t see how you couldn t adjust to it Then again I m 5 2 petite so for me it s the perfect size haha P The DVD is pretty good It s pretty simple basic stepping though so if you re an advanced stepper you ll probably get bored real fast However it does get you to sweat a little so it s not a complete waste If not for the stepping though keep it for the abs workout OMG it s AMAZING For only 10 minutes it really makes you want to commit stomach suicide haha Which is a good thing because the next day your tummy is sore but FLAT But really it s a good DVD especially for those lazy days that you know you need to workout but don t want to at least not too hard LOL Buy this kit it s a great deal and it ll get you in shape 
5 0 Excellent Product I m a single mother with a full time job taking part time graduate classes are night I have very little time to myself let alone any time to go to the gym I needed something that was fun and energizing to do at home after my child went to sleep I found the PERFECT product I recommend this to anyone that wants to get a good workout in the comfort and privacy of their own home 
5 0 Speedy ropes These ropes are great for double dutch They re very fast and long so you can do two people at a time I love double dutch It is a lot easier with these ropes 
5 0 Super Fun Personal Accessory and Water Bottle This is an upscale designer water bottle top of the line and so much fun The designs Of Sigg s water bottles are gorgeous from the plain solid color bottles to the ones with intricate designs They are simply beautiful I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns thinking it would take more work to maintain These do necessitate regular cleaning I clean mine every day but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun Sort of like my rings glasses and watch I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory reminding me to drink more water making a statement about my values and expressing myself with a special design Yes all in a water bottle Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality made of light aluminum on the outside slightly insulated and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles They are light durable and perfect for any activity Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles just like from the tap Sigg bottles come with several different types of tops I bought the screw top because I don t like sports tops and I don t mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink It is totally leakproof which is important to me The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner I get comments on it all the time What s that I love it The sports top version is ok I just am not a fan as I don t feel like I can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top However for convenience you might prefer it For children there is a cap type top All are leak proof If you are ever unsatisfied with the top you can buy a screw top separately to fit your Sigg bottle Sigg makes their personal water bottle in 6L and 1L in this style I have both I use the 6L for sports activities because they are smaller When I won t have to carry the container I like the larger bottle Sigg also makes a smaller 3L bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people You can buy Siggs in alternative sizes too such as 75L 4L for kids 6L 5L You can occasionally find this bottle in the 1 5L size also Search Amazon for the perfect size Pick a style and pattern you like as this bottle is a personal accessory and should reflect your style The colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on Amazon They are expensive but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health so they are well worth it value wise for me Highly recommended 
5 0 My New Helmet Light LED headlights are getting better all the time This little guy is a one Watt Luxeon LED with very good power regulation Regulation means that the light gets the most from a set of batteries and keeps the light at a given brightness instead of dimming as the batteries weaken The Princeton Tec EOS has three brightness settings and a flash mode I actually find the flash mode to be too slow to be useful on the bike and it flashes at full power but these are minor nits I d also prefer if the light used AA instead of AAA cells So I guess there are two things I don t like about this light But the positives far outweigh the negatives The light is small and is supposed to be waterproof to one meter I don t ride under water so I haven t tested that feature It s easy to operate and the batteries are easy to change The light pattern seems to be just right for my riding I use this light on my helmet but it also comes with a handlebar mount I run the light at the lowest power setting most of the time and that s fine for reading my bike computer or cue sheets The middle setting is better for general riding spotting road signs and potholes and things like that At the highest setting you get the brightest beam but of course that eats through the batteries quicker I m pretty sure the circuit in this light was designed by Willie Hunt a real guru in bike lighting circles And yes I m enough of a nerd that I actually keep track of things like that Anyhow the Princeton Tec EOS is my latest favorite bike toy 
4 0 Loved it We bought this bicycle for our son s 3rd birthday He LOVED the bright colors and the fact that it has somewhere for his horses to ride It has taken a little while for him to get used to the training wheels but the bike stays steady while he is riding and doesn t threaten to tip We are very happy with this bicycle 
4 0 great for boys and girls ages 6 56 This along with a pogo stick and stilts was my effort to get my kids offf the video games at least some of the time I thought this might be too hard for the 6 year old but he persisted and is getting better at it The point is it s so fun he keeps trying The 13 yr old and my 17 year old daughter are enjoying it too There seems to be a trade off between the stilts and the hit a way Only the little guy can handle the pogo stick go figure 
4 0 adidas training suit The suit itself is great but the sizing is just way off I purchased a large and an extra large for my kids the large is actually too big for me and the extra large is enormous It is almost as though they are sized for men instead of youth Hopefully they ll grow into them 
4 0 Review Very useful stopwatch I like the mutiple functions My use is for swim workouts This watch allows me to have three intervals going at once The print is a little smaller than it appears on the picture Not a real problem I am glad I bought this stopwatch over my other choice which could only time two lanes 
4 0 Flexible Flyer Snow Twist It was a gift for my niece she loves it she s only 7 
4 0 Good Investment Very Useful Despite having some trepidation after reading the reviews of owners who had unpleasant experiences with the SG4 I bought it and am glad that I did My experiences using the SG4 during play have been very positive even though on occasion the weather conditions have been so bad that I could only get a signal for some of the holes The large screen allows the user to easily see each of the obstacles on a given hole and know the distance to them and the distance required to carry them The SG4 also provides a more detailed view of each obstacle as well as the distances to the front edge center and rear edge of each green For golfers who like to know the exact distance they hit each of their clubs the MARK feature is marvelous Being able to have all of this valuable information available for 10 professionally measured courses and 5 personally measured courses is of significant value for golfers who play a number of different courses not only on a regular basis but also for courses being played for the first time The SG4 also has a memory card slot for being able to download more courses when that service is offered in the future I think the the downloading procedures on the SKY GOLF web site are somewhat confusing but not very difficult to figure out and use with only a few minutes of effort I know several low and mid handicappers who LOVE this device and I share their enthusiasm and opinion I am a high handicapper I also own a Bushnell Pinseeker 1500 with slope and consider the SG4 to be a far superior tool to the Bushnell NOTE there is at least one additional cost that buyers will incur after they receive their Sky Caddie the subscriber fee for downloading courses for 1 year The fees range from 30 for courses measured in one state that you designate to 80 for worldwide use 
5 0 Warm even when not using the battery feature Probably the best cold weather gloves I ve purchased They are warm without being too bulky I have not yet been in low enough temps where I needed to use the battery feature 
5 0 Great watch Looks great functions great Manual is a little daunting and a couple of the words on the display are very small I have 20 20 vision and I can t always read everything that is being displayed It is mostly in the Alt and Barometer functions where there is lots of info being shown Highly recomended 
5 0 As always buying Suunto means buying Quality For those who may be new to Suunto they are wrist top computers designed and manufactured in Finland and are in use all over the world by Hikers Bikers and outdoor enthusiasts of all kinds What makes the X Lander stand out are at first glance obviously its sheer size Let there be NO illusions the X Lander is a mighty big watch Despite its size it doesn t FEEL as big as it looks though The aluminum case is VERY light and quite comfortable too The next thing you notice would be the HUGE amount of bells and whistles packed into such a small device 1 An accurate altimeter This is an invaluable tool for the avid hiker and biker One thing you MUST be ready to do is remember to adjust it DAILY Find out what the altitude is and set the watch before you begin your trip and then at the end of the day you need to make note of where you stopped which you can do with the internal recording function and properly adjust it before setting out the next day This is NOT a flaw every single altimeter watch I am aware of is exactly the same 2 Barometer I found it correct at least 75 of the time which is more than I can say for the local TV Weatherman This includes a thermometer as well which in order to be accurate must be removed from your wrist for at least 15 minutes in order not to get a false reading due to lingering body heat 3 Digital Compass This is truly one amazing feature by the way Once you calibrate it which you may need to do weekly you will NEVER be lost especially if you know how to use a map 4 It tells pretty accurate time too believe it or not It also comes with an alarm a countdown AND a stopwatch Suddenly its size now makes sense huh I happen to LIKE big watches I don t exactly know why but I just do IF I were to have ANY complaint whatsoever the one thing this watch is lacking is exactly what they have included in the much less expensive Vector A tiny little bubble which helps you to level out the watch in the compass mode for a more precise reading The reason why may have to do with the fact that the X Lander is mineral crystal and the Vector is plastic but either way it d be nice to have I am VERY impressed with just about everything associated with Suunto and their fantastic line of what they call Wristop Computers IF size really DOES matter to you well you may wish to go with the Observer or maybe the X6HR which does everything the X Lander and Observer can do PLUS it has a built in heart rate monitor both are smaller than the X Lander Vector Yachtsman and many other Suunto models yet still offers a LOT but keep in mind with the smaller size comes the bigger price Factor all that into your purchase plans and once again if at ALL possible do NOT buy until you have the chance to see some of these or any models IN PERSON That will make a HUGE difference in how happy your purchase will end up being and good luck 
4 0 100 quart cooler The item arrived in a timely manner and its a quality purchase Its keeps ice just like advertised I am very satisafied with it It has lots of room and is easy to carry with sturdy handles LC 
5 0 Looking for a real chick leotard I recently got into gymnastics so I started looking for a leotard for someone with real curves I m 5 6 and 180lbs and the XL fits me great It has long sleeves which is great for the wintertime and I don t have to feel self consciousness about my fat hanging out there because it covers it up It s cut low enough so that I m not getting wedgies and I can do handstands without worrying if my workout shirt got un tucked It s not flashy so I don t look like a 10 year old in a fat 26 year olds body It s nice and plain gets the job done and I m sure the others at they gym thank me for covering up for goodness sakes 
4 0 All Here This kit will not only help you get started it will help you stay with the program too 
5 0 Good bargin for the casual pilates type This mat is a good bargain and perfect for the casual pilates partaker like myself Rolls up nicely and the velcro should strap makes it easy to transport or store away Good thickness and provides just enough cushioning so you can t feel the floor beneathe you Easy to wipe down and keep clean 
4 0 I Had a lap band installed and this is really helping putting me in shape as I broke 2 bones in my back My pain management Dr said this was the best bike to pick with the least amount of pain I could choose 
5 0 Totally great recumbent bike I ordered this bike on Monday and it was delivered on Thursday The pictures of this bike don t begin to do it justice It has a solid metal tube construction and a big padded seat I am 5 9 and this beauty adjusted perfectly It is very stable and whisper quiet I was a bit skeptical when I ordered it but what a bargain 
4 0 Good bike for the price I bought this bike for my boyfriend for Christmas It arrived in about 3 days rather than the expected 5 7 We set it up on about half an hour It comes with a small wrench that is perfect for the set up I read an other review prehaps on a different bike that you need a cresent wrench however for this bike you don t He uses it every night and I use it a few times a week It s silent and nothing has broken on it as of yet granted I ve only had it for a month I would definitely recommend this product 
5 0 Pleased with my choice I knew I wanted a bowflex and couldn t decide between the models available This model offers the most range in exercises and still has the ability to fold up small enough to be able to set up a double air mattress in my spare exercise room for a weekend guest This product came in several large boxes and is best assembled by a two person team A husband wife team worked for us This is the first exercise equipment I have been consistent with It is fun to use and takes no effort to change between sets I also have the Ab attachment Love it 
4 0 I LIke it I have used the Leatherman Micra for years and thought it was time for a change The squirt is more money but very handy especially now because you don t have to open the scissors to get at the tools 
4 0 Good Sturdy but assembly instructions could be a lot better The product itself is good and feels safe when I use it The assembly instructions could use some help But I eventually figured out what the pictures meant 
5 0 My new gym D Working out used to be heh for me but after getting the door gym I made a rule Anytime I enter my bathroom which is where it is suspended either before or after I have to do 10 Pull ups and 10 Neutral pull ups also since I purchased the broad reach 10 of those as well It s working wonders within the first week of doing pull ups where i d use my legs just enough to complete the pull up I m now able to do 10 regular pull ups I m very happy with this product only downside which I personally don t really care about is that depending on what kind of door frame you have you could get some denting on the front side the backside works just fine and leaves no marks on your walls So anyway I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick and depending on how hard you want to work P easy workout 
4 0 not bad i got this gun for christmas and i just got the m14 sniper from pyramyd air this gun is a very good beginners gun and a great backup in an airsoft war im a sniper backup man and this is my backup i am very happy with the performance of this gun pros has a decent rate of fire electric so it doesnt have to be cocked for each shot comes with 8000 bbs great deal collapsible stock cons small but manegeable magazine accesories are sketchy laser broke t handle is very loose but helps stability accuracy on semi auto is ok not good not bad if ur looking for a decent beginners gun or backup like me than i highly recommend this gu 
4 0 RED XL REVIEW USE THE XL MOST EVERY DAY AND FIND THAT IT DOES A FAIRLY GOOD JOB FOR WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO ONLY USE IT ABOUT TEN MINENTS AT A TIME SINCE I AM 72 I DONT OVERDUE IT CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN MY ABDOMEN ALREADY 
4 0 Teva Hurricane Purple This item shipped very fast The sandal was true to size and color I am very satisfied with my purchase 
5 0 Has really helped my game The IZZO swing grip trainer has worked wonders for my swing and grip The grip form helps train your arm to keep the face of the club straight It also helps to build muscle where you need it for a more powerful golf swing 
5 0 The ultimate outdoor headgear I am so glad I finally found an online source for these visors I ve been picking them up one or two at a time from street fairs for probably 20 years now You can see me wearing them in all my adult travel photos because they are so light and comfortable and they keep the sun out of your eyes or the rain And these particular visors here on Amazon had good snaps too 
5 0 this gun is awesome first of all i am not a kid i am a professional airsofter i own a classic army maruis and lots of other expensive guns the best thing about this gun is that it is very powerful the sight is really good and its adjusts its also really accurate the only complaint is its kinda hard to cauk but its is also heavy which is a good thing most of it is metal my recomendation is whether you are a beginner or an expert this is a great gu 
5 0 Assembly was easy After reading the horror stories of the assembly process instructions I was a little worried Myself and my 12 yr old daughter put it together in about 3 hrs without issue All parts were included instructions were clear she did the step check off s The base took 400lbs of sand vs the 375lbs stated in the instruction 
5 0 Not bad at all After reading the previous reviews and noticed the bad comments about the instructions I took that into considerations and purchased it anyways Nobody was really talkin bad about the board Most of us have the urgency of putting it together w out reading the instructions and simply just looking at the drawings You have to approach this one differently I went ahead and borrowed a friend of mine and paid him with cold beverages because I defintely agree that you need at least 2 people to put this together The Instructions although not as detailed did mention that you MUST READ THE ENTIRE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY to assemble this item failure to do so can delay your assembly because you have to disassemble and re assemble again Finally it took us 4 1 2 hrs to complete the assembly and based on my experience it wasn t that bad at all I only wish they added spare washers nuts just in case you lose it Once its installed I added water to it and let me tell you Its supposed to be portable but w the base filled its pretty heavy The board has a better rebound than other cheap boards out there but its not like the ones at the indoor gym 50 is adequate for a home use but you better have the apace for this The base takes alot of room The ability to move the height up down is as advertised I can do it with one hand Very nice I measured it from the rim to the floor and its accurate based on the height you adjusted to One thing I found out just now This slam it rim you are not allowed to hang on it or it will cause you your warranty I know because Lifetime answered my question I emailed out They do not have weight limits on these rims so do not attempt to hang on it I defenitely recommend this if your shopping for one 
5 0 5 Star rating for CytoSport Cytomax 4 5lbs Go Grape Great value great taste for sports drink fare This is the only drink I use these days on the trails Very easy on the system No bad after taste The 4 5 lbs cans are an awesome value 
5 0 SteriPEN System Pack This will keep the big little things from floating in your water Only works in clear water 
4 0 Great Quality for the Price I really like this mat by Hugger Mugger The thickness is really nice especially if practicing on hardwood or tile floor I actually purchased mine at TJ Maxx for 10 buck less than the selling price here The color selection is very nice too My one complaint is that I had to wash it several times to rid the mat of a chemical odor I recommend using an organic soap or spray whenever washing a yoga mat This one in my experience needs to be washed completely dried several times for it to have a fresh scent All in all I say this is a fine product However the very best mat imho are Ecomats which are made from jute plant Much more expensive than this one but well worth the price 
5 0 loved this extra long mat great for taller yogis Loved this mat Great for taller yogis great tickness too A bit slippery but after a couple of sessions it wears off I totally recommend it 
5 0 This wave ROCKS i bought the wave about 1 week ago and I got the hang off it in 3 days now I master the wave drill and high speed turns its worth your money Im 10 years old 
5 0 My 6 year old loves it Although my wife disagreed I bought this for my son s 6 year old birthday It took him a day to figure it out well enough to jump on it from a stand still and get going a hundred yards or so Materials look reasonably good it s light enough that he can cary it and stout enough that I dad can also enjoy a fun ride I must say this is one of the coolest toys invented Easily 5 stars 
4 0 Great for adults I m 26 and I m having a blast on this board It s much more accessible than snowboarding and surfing because you can just grab your board and go I take mine to a local tennis court for the smooth surface They recommend using small hills and stuff but honestly stopping or slowing down is pretty much impossible on a decent incline so I prefer to stay on flat land Its amazing how long you can stay on the board without even setting a foot on the ground The board seems to be constructed fairly well I ve gotten to the point where I can some pretty advanced turns by shifting my weight effectively its really fun trying to master it I m curious if the Ripstik competitor board is better constructed since its made by Razor and they might have put more money into the design Anyways I ve had mine for about 2 months and the wheels are definately showing a lot of wear I ll most likely have to replace them soon I m kinda happy that you can use any rollerblade wheels instead of some proprietary wheels That enables you to look for good deals on some wheels I d also look around for the best deals on these boards I got mine at a Sports Authority on sale for 80 after having seen one at an FAO on my visit to Las Vegas for 130 So if you re a fun loving adult who likes cool new ways of moving along I d definately recommend this It s addicting 
4 0 hard to learn but worth the effort I bought this for my 10 year old grandson It is an unusual ride took him a while to catch on but he is really enjoying it now that he has mastered it 
4 0 Great backpack but zipper gets caught Love this backpack it s been with me to numerous cities and countries and survives the trips very well while protecting the contents well laptop included The outside large pocket is larger than you think when you realize just how much stuff you can fit in there and still fit under an airplane seat Love the two water holders on the outside Love the zippers are a loop so you can attach a carabiner compass or whatever The support is great you ll barely feel its there and if you do just use both straps and then strap the front for great support The pen storage area could be larger to accommodate larger pens but thats quite minor My only con is that the outside two pockets have gotten stuck twice already I am now on my third backpack gotta LOVE REI s return policy Hopefully this one will last as I have yet to find a better more complete backpack Update 1 30 2007 Third backpack third zipper to get caught time to return again I wish I could change the scale down to 2 stars 
5 0 WOW This is the best ab workout machines I have ever bought and it works I had no problem with the shipping or the actual product 
4 0 Bag s cover protection from rain has missing zipper stopper I m not really a golf player But what I saw of the golf set was that the bag s cover protection from rain has a missing zipper stopper 
5 0 necessary extra clips are neccessary the gun goes through ammo and the clip only holds about 45 rds 
4 0 Decent starter net For the price and relative ease of use this is a decent starter net The five foot height width makes it a little small for older youth It is easy to fold carry and store which is a huge plus especially compared to other so called portable nets It deploys fairly easily enough though the support pole set up is not completely intuitive The set I puchased had no instructions so it wasn t until after several uses that I completely figured it out All in all however I am pleased with it and would buy another should the need arise 
5 0 Top quality item I am very happy with my choice It is just the right size nicely finished with glossy black paint installs in a minute Usage is very convenient it has that perfect click into place property you push down on it with your forefoot and it snaps into the stand position To hide it when you are ready to go just hit back with your heel or simply start pedalling and it snaps back along the frame It does the job perfectly and it feels great 
5 0 What do you say about a squeaky snail horn It looks like a cartoon snail and it makes a racket when you squeeze it I d say it lives up to everything it aspires to be 
4 0 Misleading wording in the description I just got my poles and while they seem great in other ways they do not offer the Soft Antishock System as the description says they do 
4 0 This guy doesnt know what he is gabbing about This gaget does actually work if used correctly The last guy doesnt have any idea of what he is talkinga about Simple theory sweat more in the target area loss fat in the same area Wear this when you work out but all day along with a good diet and it will work Several of my client have had excellent results 
5 0 Big Capacity Compact Storage I ve never been a fan of propane stoves They always seemed flimsy made for those toy sized backpacking pots and pans and potentially dangerous until now After two weeks of RV ing the Fold N Go has become a welcome addition to our set up It is very sturdy and seems extremely well made The wide separation of the two burners and heavy duty pot supports allow for two large heavy fry pans and or stock pots at one time Few stoves of any kind can handle simultaneous large pots And it seems very stable when set on a table And because it folds in half and becomes its own carry case even though it handles such large tasks it s easy to carry and takes up very little storage space It also has an instant start feature you just turn the nob and then press a button and that s it You re ready to cook And after you re done clean up is a snap Unlike other stoves where you have to take them all apart to try and get at that nasty spattered grease this one is pretty much all sealed just take the pot supports off wipe off underneath flip the pot supports over to store inside and then Fold N Go It s great to get cooking moved outside the RV especially for things like frying bacon or cooking anything that gives off a lot of steam And because our meals seem to entail usually one or the other we plan on getting an extension hose off our main propane tank to run this frequently in the future 
4 0 Great Value This item arrived within a few days of purchase It is a great value for the price I did have to assemble it from pictures but got it together without any outside assistance I plan to use it along with the reformer I already own I do wish that there was a CD or chart with basic exercises for this product Their customer service was quick and helpful when I had a component arrive damaged by the shipper 
4 0 An amazing piece of equipment for the price from a former professional Pilates instructor I was spending the day at home with a cold The doorbell rang At my doorstep was a large box Already I just ordered it a few days ago I shrugged on a jumper and hauled the surprisingly light it s only 52 pounds box up the stairs A sharp knife a pair of nail clippers thirty minutes and several small drifts of white packing material snow later I had my Extreme Pilates put together On first impressions the mat graphic is cheesy and the frame looks flimsy However this isn t just a Pilates trap table the leg spring hooks are placed further back than they are on studio quality equipment and are less likely to get in the user s way The push through bar won t drop if you let go of it because the metal is engineered not to slide There are warning stickers to use the safety strap on the push through bar Overall this is a safer machine than the original When you try to use it though there are a few problems I m 5 4 and the mat is too short if you want to roll down to the floor The springs are light and I would suspect that replacing them with heavier ones might overload the strength of the frame It s not clear which springs are the leg springs The lack of clips is just silly That said I can do everything I can do on a trap table I did the cat swan and saw with the push through bar leg circles with the springs chest expansion and roll down with the bar and even the magician s series to finish That kink in my shoulder that only goes away with the push through bar started to work itself out I could hear the springs real springs not bungee cords All was briefly right with the world This is an amazing piece of equipment for the price Three caveats Not for taller men it s just too small Not for serious athletes not enough resistance Not for people with children if you can t lock it away springs are not safe for the little ones to play with 
5 0 Best Book Backpack I have had many backpacks for school and am always left wanting more space I like to have different places to put different materials This gives me the opportunity to do so I like the fact that I can put my Ipod in a section that is not likely to recieve the weight of the many books I use I would say that the area where you hold the smaller items such as pens and calculators is nice You have dividers where you can hold many different things Overall this is the best pack for school I have come across 
4 0 Awesome backpack I love my Jansport Odyssey backpack It has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack I have ever owned or tried I have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack can t be beaten for tranporting books A little more padding in the straps or smaller textbooks would make it perfect but it is still better than anything I have seen out there I would highly recommend it to any high school or college student 
5 0 Jansport Odyssey This is the best Jansport has always made an outstanding product This is the third one I have owned Plenty of room and just right size 
4 0 Lots of fun My kids got these from Grandpa They love them They re fun to bowl with in a dark room We ve clipped them onto headboards for a decent sized reading light The problems The clip is pretty hard to operate even for an adult Also the plastic base broke on each of our lights in different places so now they re clip less They re still well loved and well used by the little guys though I recommend these lights but be careful w the bases 
5 0 Wonderful portable little storage bucket With the birth of our first child there were tons of little toys lying around all the time from teethers to rattles stuffed lovies and blocks The traditional toy box was too bulky for our small living space so when someone gave us this adorable tote we were thrilled to see how much fit inside how sturdy it was and how much our baby loved looking at it With bold primary colors and cute scenes surrounding the entire bin there is even a fold out flap with a play space and a singing bird which attaches to the side basket The fun roof is all made of satin ribbons that resemble shingles This was easily stored in our closet or taken along on trips Best of all there seems to be no end to how much you can stuff inside It is soft and collapsible yet stands upright and will hold just about all your small baby toys It can be VERY GENTLY machine washed but we discovered it was best not to throw it in with anything heavy I gave one to a neighbor when her son was born and she still raves about how perfect it was for their baby s toys I give this 5 stars without hesitation affordable and totally functional 
5 0 Invest In Yourself We have had the 438 for over a year and it has been outstanding I started using an elliptical at the gym and still do but the convenience of having this at home is perfect Construction is top notch and the workout is oh so quiet The workout monitor keeps track of every workout by user and has such features as fitness test recovery and many workout profiles to keep you challenged What started out as a purchase for my use is now also used by my wife and daughter I guess they had to try it after I continued to rave about it Time flies while you are on the 438 Best of all this unit actually gets used If you are going to buy one piece of home exercise equipment look no further 
5 0 Great value We looked all over for a quality dartboard with a cabinet and this one was by far the best for its price 
4 0 nearly perfect once you get used to the padding I ve owned three pairs of these so far and they re easily the best gloves I ve ever used I had previously only used unpadded gloves and the padding in the palm seemed a little thick at first The padding does make it more difficult to get a solid grip in some exercise machines that also have large rubber grips on them lat pulldown bars for example but that s the trade off for excellent support and protection when using the gloves on machines with uncovered metal grips I found these gloves to be more durable than the other non padded Harbinger gloves I ve worn The gloves can be safely washed and air dryed as advertised My only complaint with regard to wear is that the unreinforced leather where my thumb meets the padding in the palm seems to wear out before the rest of the glove Every pair I have owned will eventually wear a hole in this particular area 
5 0 awsome scope GREAT SCOPE has good zoom and works good for 22 and super 9 air guns Note that its dovetail and not weaver though Great Scop 
4 0 Nice bike for beginners Quick shipping I received this bike in 4 days using free super saver shipping and it was even over a holiday The bike comes in one large box with MANY pieces My husband and father put the bike together in less than 1 hour It looked a little overwhelming at first but was quite easy to assemble The bike is very compact and easily placed in small areas It is also very quiet you have to listen closely to even hear the bike The resistance goes from 1 to 8 one being the easiest to eight being the hardest My husband is an avid road biker and 8 could be too easy for someone looking for a really hard ride like riding the equivalent of up hill The bike offers basic functions that are displayed very large The display is easily toggled through The heart rate monitor picks up okay but don t buy the bike based off of that function because it s not totally reliable All in all a great buy I injured my back and was looking for a workout that would be good on my back The seat is uncomfortable and I am petite I would imagine it would be very uncomfortable if someone was larger But for the price you can t beat it 
5 0 Good looks and does the job Perfect exactly what I expected and wanted I ride to work in rain or shine or storm and was sick of the water shooting up had it on in less then 5 min My bike is full suspension 26 inch wheels with that horse shoe U bar on the lower legs of the front fork and it still fit with no problem Don t know how it would handle a crash in trees though sits high like a dirt bike look People ask where I got it 
5 0 Exceeds expectations The science is sound but check it out yourself Police military etc are using it Fortune 100 other governmental agencies Schools should use it if they don t It puts the kids into their best possible learning state Seriously 5 stars is not justice 50 000 stars 50 000 is the number of neurons directing your brain when you are in the zone The power the brain when coherent or not is tangible and it s driven by the heart You can sense it in a person anger happiness whatever It s the healing state It s the creative state It s where hormones balance 
4 0 Solid No Frills Compass at Good Price Compass worked wonderfully for my trip around New England this summer Only reason I don t give it 5 stars is for want of a backlight for night driving Remember to moisten the suction cups before adhering to the window I forgot the first time and it popped off 10 minutes later Never came off again the whole trip after I moistened them Worth the money 
4 0 they c me rollen these roller blades are great they weren t to expensive and they are sooo comfortable they are fast and they are great to learn on and now i m doing 420 to krooked grind to 270 out I recomened to everybody that they should buy these and you will get total satisfaction the only bad thing about these blades are that they are a little ugly but they still work really well 
5 0 Awesome gun This gun is awesome It shoots hard and fast The battery pack was a little hard to get on at first but it works Don t fire them in the house They put dents in the doors and blinds they shoot really hard They bounce off the basement walls and really hurt so go outside I did a battle with my dad and brother and it lasted 2 hours It was great Now my dad wants one of his own 
4 0 Usually works Sometimes this unit works flawlessly other times it seems to have trouble picking up the signal I am not sure if that is a problem with this USB device the Polar HRM or the way that I am holding it In any event most of the time it works and the data transfers quickly 
5 0 Perfect in Every Way This is one of the BEST weightlifting gloves that I have found so far I like it so much that I ve bought a few pairs These have very supportive wrist wraps that are adjustable to secure your wrist during lifting to help prevent injury The rest of the glove is terrific It is thicker around the palm and fingers so it provides EXCELLENT cushioning for those heavy lifts I have not had one blister or redness since I ve started using these gloves and I ve been using them for over a year now They are extremely comfortable After a year of use my gloves are still in perfect condition too I ve tried other brands and the others tend to have thinner material around the palm and fingers and this causes redness and blisters so what s the use of using them On the other hand this Valeo Ocelot Wrist Wrap Weightlifting glove is perfect in every way Has support comfort and it looks great I have the orange pair GLOW and I get lots of compliments at the gym too about how great they look Well worth every penny Way to go Valeo 
4 0 Everlast 12 oz gloves these gloves are pretty good gloves if you re wanting to get started in boxing or working out with heavy bags this is the way to go they are very traditional yet slip on design 
4 0 It works There s not much I can say about this item It works and that s all I really care about No leaks it s never cracked and it s stood up to some serious abuse 
5 0 co2 tanks These are brand new and brand name I ordered late on Wed and received by Sat Can t buy them any cheaper nor get them faste 
5 0 best deal ever if you are looking for a tank that is cheap but not a piece of well look no further this is the best tank ever i own 3 of them myself andc wouldnt buy anything other than them 
5 0 Pleased I have used this product now as a self supported bicycle rider for two years I am pleased with the product It s not real soft and fluffy like a thick towel but does a great job in absorbing water after a shower or stream bath and dries fast It s as practical as can be for what I got it for It also is very compact and light in the pack The one piece of advice I have is to not get a smaller version but go with the larger size The additional weight and bulk in nothing and having the additional towel surface is worth it 
5 0 I love the cards I have been battling hard since my cards arrived Thank you for such a great deal 
5 0 Pretty Nice Machine My wife and I put this thing together in about an hour There was one cracked foot tread but after calling Schwinn we had a replacement within two days and no hassles If you are looking for a decent machine at a great price this is a nice one It is fairly sturdy and has some nice preprogrammed workouts 
5 0 great deal great product We had in mind the type of exercise bikes we wanted We investigated several brands models and vendors The Schwinn 212 appeared to be the best value And given the free shipping Amazon had the best price So we ordered We were not in any way dissappointed Assembly was reasonably easy And the bikes are working out well for us 
5 0 Built like a tank operates like a swiss watch The Schwinn Airdyne is built to last out of steel For upper and lower body workout it uses a fan flywheel to create resistance rather than a friction belt or magnetic motor hint fewer repairs and failures since there is no friction mechanism to fail The onboard computer allows your to select what information you wish to see such as mets calories distance speed rpm and even displays your pulse if you wear a chest strap You can select miles or kilometers for distance and club or home for setup hint built to withstand use in a fitness center health club It even allows you to imput your geological elevation to facilitate a more accurate calorie count Assembly is straight foward but does require a few basic tools such an adjustable wrench and phillips screwdriver This represents a good way to go if you want a well built durable piece of equipment intended for serious use to achieve your goal of cardio vascular conditioning weight loss or just plain old exercise 
4 0 Good knife could have been a little better I like this knife very much it s size shape fit in the hand and pocket clip are all just what I wanted It has a nice edge and the Speed Safe assisted opening feature is fantastic My only complaint is that the safety is placed in such a way that makes one handed opening difficult with the safety engaged I want the safety engaged because the assisted opening is so easy to activate and I don t want the knife springing open in my pocket This is only a minor quibble though I do enjoy the knife very much it is a good size to wear with jeans for light duty day to day use which is what most people need a pocket knife for anyway I use a different larger knife for heavier duty use 
5 0 A lot of flashlight in a small package I own several LED flashlights including 3 different ones from C Crane Company This little unit from Garrity outshines them all It is a bright far reaching light and the long battery life is impressive all in a light that fits in the palm of your hand If you need just one handy convinient flashlight to carry with you throw that old 3 cell mag light in the trash and welcome to the new age of flashlights 
4 0 This is a great product with 1 drawback I am very pleased with this rack the only thing I do not like is that to install the rack you have to hand tighten it to your roof rack I would have thought they would have a quick release latch or something I guess I m just lazy I reccoment this product 
4 0 Birthday Present I got my trampoline for my 12th birthday and I was really excited Though as soon as I jumped on it it wasn t bouncy at all I am not very happy with this trampoline and i don t reccomend that you buy it 
5 0 Best backyard toy ever We have a slightly sloped yard so I was hesitant about getting a trampoline We tried it and it works fine My kids love it Of course like any other toy they take it in spells but it still gets used alot after 6 months I was also concerned at first about them falling off of it I almost bought the enclosure to go with it but I decided to wait and see how high they jumped etc This trampoline is so small they really can t get a lot of air so they don t do flips and other dangerous tricks It s also very low to the ground I am glad now that I didn t get the enclosure We don t really need it I would recommend this trampoline for younger kids The weight limit is 120 lbs so it can t support larger kids Also since it is so small we only let our two preschoolers jump together When we have guests over it s one at a time I love it that my kids want to be outside so much This is better money spent than on video games in my opinion 
4 0 Sharp Looking for the NFL Fan MFG by Northpole LTD this roomy chair features padded seat and back for additional comfort Seating position is leaned back lacking adjustment for more upright seating Fabric appears to be a durable rip stop nylon The arms are padded with foam and I question foam durability over the long haul The chair could benefit from the addition of a cup holder Chair is rated at 225 pounds and is close to 4 feet in length when folded and in its carry bag NFL team logo is embroidered on front and back of seat back and looks sharp Team name and logo is also printed on carry bag Overall a comfortable well constructed chair with exceptions as noted with an eye catching logo of your favorite team 
5 0 Mean Looking and made by a reputable manufacturer I mainly get stuff like this because I like the looks not that I actually use the merchandise that much The knife seems sturdy and strong The nylon sheath is high quality 
4 0 Lifecore R900 Rowing Machine The display didn t work on the first rower we got and one of the wheels on the front of it was broken Amazon sent out a new one the day I reported the problem and helped me get UPS to pick up the damaged one The second rower arrived in good shape and works fine The different programs are nice it s extremely quiet and my wife likes it better than the air rower we use at the Y The slightly padded seat is also a bonus One of the most important features for us was the heart rate monitor It comes with the chest strap and displays heart rate on the LCD screen so you can vary your workout to stay in the target zone The heart rate monitor is not available on inexpensive rowers and with some of the more expensive ones you still have to buy the chest transducer separately Overall quite satisfied with the rower and because of their excellent customer service extrememly satisfied with Amazon 
4 0 Very Good Rower Overall this is a very good rowing machine quiet takes up a small amount of space and easy to use My only complaint would be the LCD the first order sent to me had a damaged computer but Amazon was quick to send out a replacement rower which took care of the problem Now every thing is great 
5 0 Very Pleased We were having trouble deciding between this rower and the Kettler Coach This one was available thru Amazon but the Kettler had to be purchased thru Merchantila which has a horrible reputation So we went with this model I couldn t be more pleased Where it was manufactured was not listed so I contacted Lifecore I had a response within 24 hrs Made in Taiwan but don t let that put you off This is NOT a China quality product It s VERY sturdy Smooth and silent The preset programs vary not only in intensity but time Some are 10 minutes Some half an hour Haven t tried them all Four programs are for you to set Ordered it on a Monday Here by Friday My husband had it set up before I got home from work He did complain that the instructions weren t well written But he never complained about actually putting it together Must not have been too difficult All tools were included You can also set your workout by time distance calories and strokes While checking Merchantila s BBB rating I also checked Lifecore s They have NO complaints That also helped us decide I love this machine I m sorry I didn t get a rower sooner 
5 0 Amazing workout machine The Bowflex is one of the most amazing machines I have ever used With its range of exercises and a little creativity on your part you can do just about any exercise you want to do I completely recommend this if you don t have the time to go to the gym or if you just really enjoy working out at home One disclaimer don t think you can get the same results you can get from free weights If you are an avid free weight lifter you can get your kicks out of maxing the leg press and perhaps even maxing the bench The PowerRods have a tension that is proportional to the amount of bend you give them Thus if you do an exercise with 100 pounds of resistance but only move the power rods through their first half of bend you aren t getting 100 pounds of resistance Also when you extend the arms of the pulleys to do the wide grip bench you decrease the amount of bend in the rods to the point where even if you bend them all the way you aren t getting full resistance Don t get me wrong I love this thing I ve had mine for the past 2 years and it is amazing I work out twice a day for about 45 minutes to an hour each session only because I don t have the time to make it to the gym Get this if you are very serious about workout out at home and don t have a lot of space to fit other equipment Make sure you have a positive attitude going into the lifting programs Experiment with ideas on different exercise movements More than anything this piece of equipment is a blast to use have fun with it 
5 0 Well Worth the Money I m a small person not a bodybuilder and hated free weights However I realized as I got older that I really needed to do some type of strength training I d been thinking about a Bowflex and after looking at the literature decided I wanted an Ultimate I purchased a used one and don t recommend that route since the seller lost some of the parts and delivered a damaged machine long story I was able to order the missing pieces from Bowflex but it took forever to get them Once I was able to use the machine I absolutely loved it It s especially good for me since I m usually alone when I work out and was concerned about injury with free weights or other types of exercise weight machines Additionally due to a neurological problem I had little extensor function in one hand Using the Bowflex I ve been able to rebuild some of the muscle tone and would highly recommend this for anyone who needs physical therapy requiring weights I use this faithfully every day alternating between arm exercises and shoulder exercises It s a pleasure to use and not at all tedious I think I probably could have done with one model under this since I never use the leg equipment Nevertheless I d recommend buying this item new from the manufacturer It s pricey but well worth the money 
5 0 Better then standard hand devices I had one of these years ago and just recently purchased a new one I can say without hesitation that the product really works Its great for martial artists particularly those whose arts rely on grabs chokes and need strength in the hands These are also good for anyone needing general purpose finger strength I havn t used one in ages but my friends still say I have some of the strongest hands they ve seen and I attribute this entirely to the use of the eagle catcher 
4 0 Great Hat Good quality well made hat with offical MLB sticker under brim Well worth 4 99 
5 0 Great Bottle It s more expensive than some but it s well made works perfectly and will last for years Not requiring removal of the top to pour is great Just buy it already 
5 0 Best Thermos Ever Invented I ve had my 1 quart Stanley Thermos for over 20 years now and this is by far no doubt about it the best thermos ever invented I have poured hot coffee in this thermos in the morning prior to doing field work in the dead of winter in upstate NY After leaving the thermos literally sitting in the snow in 20 degree temperatures all day at 5 pm the coffee was still piping hot If you need to keep liquids hot this is the best non electric product out there for doing it 
5 0 Gaiam The Firm Body Sculpting System This product is excellent Very sturdy durable and the videos are challenging but doable from beginner to advanced you will get the results you re after I highly recommend this product 
5 0 This keeps the band where you want it to be This very comfortable strap can be put around your wrist or ankle and when you do the exercise you can just concentrate on the muscle you re working and not have to worry about the theraband slipping It s terrific 
4 0 First Impressions I bought this on somewhat of a whim because I ve been wanting get a little more in shape got a little bit of pudge going on and I realized the hardest part of motivating myself to work out was actually getting ready and going out to the gym time was somewhat of a factor as well So I ordered this a few days ago because I read some reviews on here and it looked like the price was right Set it up earlier today The quality of the parts is basically no worse or better than I d expected think of it as a stripped down eliptical machine Setting it up was fairly easy but some of the instructions were a bit unclear Threw on some running sneakers and got on and I ve got to say the feel motion of this thing is REALLY strange at first Unless you are a ballet dancer or gymnist with really good balance be prepared to look like an idiot on this thing for a little while because like it s name it is completely freestyle It s range of motion and rhythm is ALL up to you Have you ever been on a ski lift at a mountain and had the urge to swing your skis forward and back in unison just because it gives you that tiny feeling of being thrown off balance You might start unintentionally doing that for a few minutes on this thing it s actually kind of fun but of course there s not much of a workout factor doing it After about 10 minutes I started to get the motion down It was pretty fun once i got the hang of it but I agree with other reviews it does make your feet sore might try putting some foam on the footplates 
5 0 The gazelle is everything you need Just 3 weeks ago I came here looking at reviews for the Tony Little s Gazelle Freestyle and read mixed reviews However most were encouraging and I thought it sounded like the thing for me I have now used the gazelle for less than 2 weeks and have already seen results This is no lie I lost 2 inches in the waist 2 in the hips 2 in the abdomin and 2 in the thighs I m just as freaked as you may be but I m telling you this is the honest truth I was discouraged that I had not been seeing any results on the scales lately and needed to change things up so I d see something move again This gazelle did it for me At this time I m only up to 30 minutes a day and 1 3 4 miles I m still a work in progress But these results are no lie Just think how much results I ll see when I can stay on longer They advertise it as a low impact overall machine and it truly is I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and Fibromyalgia so I was looking for something I could do that wouldn t hurt me I can honestly say I get a full workout on this machine oh I forgot to mention also 1 inch in the arms So that s a total of 9 inches in 2 weeks This is the best machine I ve ever used we also have an exercise bike and ab lounge which I ve not used in the last 2 weeks at all cause I was getting such a good workout on the gazelle and I m so happy I found it And I thank you people users of Amazon com for coming here and posting your reviews and making it easy on me to know which machine to buy Mine is the exact picture above and folds up I also love that feature It s not a problem to just fold it up and lean it against the wall beside my bed after each use Therefore I ve still got lots of walking space beside my bed 
4 0 Inexpensive and fun I was a little skeptical about the Gazelle at first because it didn t look like you could get a work out from using it but I was wrong But let s start at the beginning It s pretty easy to set up the directions on the dvd were great and I could do it all myself I was really excited to use it so I hopped right on I m already used to ellipticals and enjoyed a great workout I was sweating and after watching the training dvd I worked my upper body and lower body I look forward to using it tomorrow Now I don t have to drag myself to the gym I can work out at home Downsides It does squeak but some WD40 or petroleum jelly should fix that It folds up but it s not extremely portable I have it in my living room currently All in all I recommend this product I can feel the toning and with good diet and weight training you ll see results 
5 0 Nice Straps These straps work great They are nice and thick and seem to be made well They re easy to put on and they stay out of the way when you aren t using them Valeo made a nice strap 
4 0 Convenient This was bought for my boyfriend and I to sleep on when he comes to town It is very comfortable and there is a lot of room for us It loses a tiny bit of air during the night but not so much that it is on the floor or anything It is a little difficult to get up off of it in the morning because it is like a water bed If you get a good wave going you can jump right up The other problem I had with it is that it makes me sweat Even with the covering and a sheet I am still sleeping on vinyl and so I sweat Not a lot but it is noticeable in the morning I am happy with the fact that it holds a lot of weight too because I am a big woman and my boyfriend is a big man It holds us with no problem It was over all a very good purchase and I am happy with it 
5 0 Saris Cycle on Receiver hitch bike rack This is an easy rack to use It is quick to load bikes too Qualty seems very good I use it also on the floor of my garage to hold the bikes during storage I m very happy with this product Mik 
4 0 Made well May be Good for hikers When the product came I realized that it wasn t what I was looking for in a fanny pack but I was impressed with its rugged construction I needed a pack to walk around Disney World and thought the two water bottle holders would come in handy I like to freeze my store bought water bottles so that they stay cold all day The water bottles that come with this pack are double wide and have a wide top meaning you can t wrap your lips around it like a store bought bottle Plus you have to wash and refill them as opposed to just buying another Dasani Unfortunately you can t use the water bottle holder for anything much narrower than the included bottles because there is just a single strap across the bottom preventing their bottle from falling through but that wouldn t stop a regular 16 oz job from slipping passed So I m returning mine but if your looking for non breakable wide mouthed water bottles in a rugged waistpack then this is for you PS for some reason the blue one is cheaper at least when I bought it 
4 0 great bar The bar itself is exactly what I wanted The only reason I m not giving 5 stars is because of the troubles I had on the purchase The bar arrived literally hanging out of the box the box was really really torn up The collars that spin on the ends were not even with the bar needless to say the bar was useless untill I finally found some collars on ebay Amazon refunded all my as soon as they were aware of the problem Overall the bar is great 
5 0 Great Goggles Great Price I have been buying this brand of prescription goggles for at least 10 years The price has been gradually coming down each year I was surprised to find them so reasonably priced at Amazon of all places These fit well adjust easily and are extremely durable I swim 6 days each week and I can easily get over a year of use from each pair Typically the gaskets begin to deteriorate long before the lenses when used daily outdoors in chlorinated pools Keep them stored safely so the lenses don t scratch and rinse them in clear water after swimming and you ll be thoroughly satisfied with your purchase 
5 0 Best Optical Swimming Googles This is a great pair of swimming goggles I swim a couple of times a week and I can t see a thing without my glasses This pair is very comfortable and does a great job correcting my vision I can t imagine swimming without them They have a wide field of vision the adjustment is easy to use and stays adjusted I ve never had a problem with leaking For less then twenty dollars you can t go wrong They are the best goggles I have ever owned Much better then the other brands Also I recommend going slightly less then your current prescription as the water will magnify things 
4 0 Gadget Mom loves it And so does Gadget Dad and Gadget Kids Not only is it an affordable piece of equipment but it s great for the whole family Having twin boys age 13 and a husband and I who all added a few pounds of winter wool over the last few months we really needed something that was going to fit nicely into our busy lives This does just that I ll admit I was a bit upset when I found that Gadget Dad had ordered it because I was the normal skeptic but it s been well worth the investment and then some 
4 0 total gym junkie I purchase my total gym and though it did not give me the workout that I expected It did help me to get firmer and leaner in a short period of time I wish it offered more of a workout for the legs but overall I am very happy with my gym and I use it all the time Only a 20 minute workout 3 times a week made a huge difference in the way I look 
4 0 Just rests on the Door Gym not for kids I got this accessory with my Door Gym and I like it But when they say this is an efficient accessory they mean it It simply rests on the narrower neutral grip posts of the Door Gym The Door Gym has multiple grip areas but two of them are perpendicular to the rest of the bar for narrow neutral grip chin ups The Broad reach bar is wide with downward grips like lat pull down bar in a gym Anyway this works fine if you have the faith to try it the first time and prove to yourself it won t roll off because your body weight has it pinned on the posts It has foam covering that adheres to the foam on the Door Gym posts It will not roll easily but it does a little I think it is safe for adults who understand how to use it Do not give it to kids younger than about 15 in my estimation because some of them are too likely to play with or misuse it and get hurt Even though this thing works and does what you want a broad bar to let you do I deducted a point in the rating because I don t think they were up front in explaining exactly what it is and is not 
5 0 Great Bolster I m pregnant and this bolster has saved my life It s great for meditation and to place btw my knees while I sleep 
5 0 This pot rocks Mine is blackened scratched dented and I don t even carry the insides any more but I love it This is usually the only cooking pot I carry backpacking because so much of our cooking anymore involves boiling water The wide mouth is perfect for scooping up water or snow I think it s part bucket This is the one 
5 0 Perky We used it today for the first time and it works just fine Heats quickly and is easy to pour 
5 0 sturdy and keeps beverages HOT I purchased one and was so pleased that I bought another Keeps liquids hot for hours much better than the Thermos I had Wash by hand do NOT put it in the dishwasher or it will lose its thermal effectiveness voice of experience 
4 0 Very good high cap This is a must have if you own the compatable shotgun But a good tip if you get it would be to dump your bbs into another container and check through them for imperfections They will jam the magazine Pros Very high cap More than enough for a spring gun Cons A bit long and protrudes from the bottom of the gun quite a bit But still worth it 
5 0 Great clip for a great price This clip is great and it doesn t just work on UTG guns it works on smith and wesson shot guns Any one with a shot gun from UTG or smith and wesson should buy this Ps I m 1 
5 0 Speed safe broke but no big deal I ve had this knife and their rainbow leak model for few years All I wanted was a thin small and light knife and I got it The blade material is hard enough to stay sharp for a while soft enough to easily sharpen but not brittle like a ceramic or carbon steel knife for example I have had the vary tip break a couple times but it s because I was doing something foolish with it like using it as a throwing knife wink wink It s not the best it s not the worst but can compete with ether witch is the best in my opinion Shortly after I bought it the speed safe spring broke eehhh who cares it opens fine without It s vary well made it can take all of my fat butts weight easily when laying sideways on a hard surface It s vary thin profile is comfortable and I sometimes can t tell if I have it with me or not It has what looks like brass or copper washers bushings instead of cheap thin steel plastic ones means no binding up even when in need of oil The frame lock is far stronger than a line lock and best of all it deforms and wares much slower meaning my knife will stay ridged when opened for a long time My favorite thing about it is the fact you can position the clip henge up or down I chose henge down so it s ready to open the second it comes out of my pocket If you want nice quality and availability for the price kershaw is worth looking at 
5 0 A great Knife The knife is sleek and has a great profile I love the speedsafe function on it The blade lock is a bit stiff but I suppose that s just so it doesn t slide open on accident 
4 0 Excellent for the price I purchased this pedometer to replace one that kept resetting itself back to zero the case cover on this one protects the buttons so it doesn t reset I like the fact that I can open the lid and read the LED without taking it off My only problem is the little leash it came with both a plastic and a metal clip The plastic clip has lost it s springiness and I m sure will stop working soon but at least I have the metal clip to fall back on 
4 0 Easy to use and accurate This pedometer is easy to set up and use I tested its accuracy at the local highschool track by walking a 1 2 mile and sure enough my pedometer read 1 2 mile The clip is sturdy I haven t had any problem with the device falling off The leash is a good extra if it did fall off it wouldn t hit the ground My doctor gave me a goal of 10 000 steps per day so I wear this all day long It is light and I don t notice I am wearing it throughout the day The only downfall to this device as is probably true with others is that your stride is measured for walking so when you are running or doing other cardio activity elliptical it doesn t accurately measure your distance Since your stride is longer during a cardio activity running and the device is measuring your walking stride the distance measurement falls short However the actual number of steps taken is still accurately measured I suppose you could adjust the setting to a running stride when running to bridge this gap 
4 0 Happy with Century Gloves I take a Ringside Boxing class at my gym and everyone bought these gloves and really likes them I ordered them from online because it was the only place I could find a size small I am very happy with them They offer excellent wrist support and protection for your fingers I really like the bar in the palm to help you grip when making a fist They do tend to leave your hands a little black after sweating in them but it washes right off The only thing bad I have to say is that after only a couple of times of using them the threading started to come apart at the pinky finger It can be sewed up but you shouldn t have to do that so soon after the purchase No one else in my class seems to have had this problem I still gave them 4 stars because I have a hunch that the threading isn t a common problem and I love them otherwise 
4 0 good durable gloves I ve been using these gloves for 3 years now and I had to buy a new pair as they were starting to be ripped off between the fingers What I like easy to set good wrist support good grip with the middle bar What I don t like using wraps can be difficult if you don t take a size above and I recommend wraps otherwise the leather will burn your skin For the price and the time that I ve used them 2 3 times a week on heavy bags they performed very well 
5 0 Broncos bag I love my Broncos bag It is very comfortable to wear and has lots of roo 
5 0 Great little eye mask If you have sinus problems or are sensitive to light you will love this Even without freezing or refrigerating it offers a nice cooling effect when you put it on 
5 0 bumper fun These cars can be summed up in two words FUN and LOUD I have two and my four year old loves it and so do all his friends They work great throughout the house and hold their charge really well I am even thinking of getting a third They do leave little marks on the wood floors but it cleans easily Well worth it 
5 0 Hours of fun We bought these so the children could have something to play with during the winter We backed our vehicles out of the garage and zoom they were off having fun The box says Ages 3+ and up to 55 pounds The bumper buggie looks small but it is roomy enough for my 5 1 2 year old He weighs 45 pounds and is 45 inches tall He can stretch his legs out in the car but chooses to keep his knees bent while driving My two year old can also work the controls It is easy to use and the kids can do a complete 360 My only complaint is that it is a little bit noisy but no more than other battery operated vehicles I highly recommend this item It is so much fun Best part is that there is little assembly required The only thing we had to do was screw the seat into the car 
4 0 nice floor for the price very nice flooring for the price easy to put together I use it as weight room flooring in an exercise area I have set up in my garage If you are looking for aerobic room flooring I would recommend buying the 20mm version 
4 0 All in All worth the money It was suprisingly easy for me to put together considering I m a 110lb girl It only took about 3 hours but i did have trouble getting all the screws to get into their proper holes It is slightly rickitty however I can go as fast as i want to and it won t brake or anything It really is nice to be able to lose 200 calories while you watch your favorite T V shows Also I am very tall and I had plenty of space and it s nice to have the handle bars in the front and on either side If you are looking for a reasonably priced bike that won t brake on you Marcy is a good choice 
5 0 Worth the bucks This thing is great my wife put it together in half an hour and she s an idiot Nonetheless it is very solid As a long time alcoholic I have a hard time getting up and a harder time going up and down stairs or walking in the grocery store etc Because this thing is low I can have the tv on a drink on the floor on one side and my cigarettes on the floor on the other side and can reach them both while I pedal I did 1 mile the first day at medium drag despite what other reviewers have said there is a HUGE difference in drag between settings 2 miles the second and am up to 5 miles per day now now I can drive my car to the store because my legs work again this thing is really good Plus it s silent dropping two ice cubes in a glass makes more noise as does lighting a Bic lighter But it is made in China Note shipping was free and it came in just a couple of days 
4 0 Economical basic machine If you re looking for a basic model without all the bells and whistles this is an excellent choice It s also very quiet and it s compact size was definitely on of the selling points for me Only problem is that I wish the seat adjustment were easier to work It gets a little stuck sometimes Again if you are looking for a basic model this is a good choice 
4 0 Good Bike except few problems with the fixtures I got this bike and I instantly liked it The only problem was the seat could not fit properly to the base I tried many times to tighten it up but doesn t help Well other than that its a wonderful bike Zip noise and would burn a lot of calories 
5 0 Works well This chin up bar works well I m 160lbs and it holds me with ease Great addition to any other home gym equipment or if your on the road and need to work out in your hotel room or whatnot 
4 0 Poker Table The table appeared to be exactly expected regarding quality The shipment was also timely Unfortunately we had to return the table as the style was not quite right for the situation of our game room 
4 0 Ok for price if you re not too tall For the price this low end home gym is generally able to do the things I wanted a cheap home gym to do However there are a few issues you need to consider before buying it The biggest issue is ergonometric this unit is not designed to be used by anyone over perhaps 5 10 or 5 11 I m 6 1 and this creates problems for me I have to find work arounds to use a unit designed for people smaller than me The problem is that form is very important when doing the exercises when you don t pay attention to form you either reduce the effectiveness of the exercise or risk injury and finding work arounds sometimes compromises your form during the exercise There are also a few quality issues but these were not entirely unexpected considering the price of the unit It would have been nice if the bench padding were a little better but its adequate The two most annoying quality issues involve the plate bars the bars that hold the weights This first issue was with the plate bar on the lat tower cable unit It wasn t level This means the weights keep trying to fall off one side as you put them on The second issue is also with the plate bars The unit is designed to accommodate standard plates small holes in the middle or Olympic plates big holes in the middle A sleeve is included with the unit that slips over the standard size plate bar that enables one to use Olympic plates big holes However the outer diameter of the sleeve is slightly smaller than standard Olympic size so an Olympic size spring collar to hold the weights on the bar is too big and doesn t work I went down to Home Depot and bought wood clamps to hold the plates in place Kind of a pain but functional just another work around If you buy this unit you probably want to go with standard plates small hole rather than Olympic plates big hole So I put this at 4 stars because for this price you really can t expect too much and it generally delivers what I expected a cheap home gym unit to do with the one caveat persons over 5 10 should try to find a home gym designed for taller people Since only 5 of the US population is over 6 feet tall manufacturers tend to design for smaller people If you re tall good luck on that search 
4 0 Great device I bought the V2000 last year and it has worked great since then The compass has always given me accurate directions and has lasted through one winter and one summer so far I always left my V2000 in the vehicle although the manual did state that you should take the device with you when the temperature is hot The V2000 has visible at all situations I can see it clearly in the dark with the V2000 s automatic backlight and see it clearly on a sunny day Finding a good place to put the temperature probe however is a hassle if you want to get accurate results Calibration was also a hassle for me You have to be on leveled ground and make a fairly even circle in order to get accurate readings 
5 0 Super Fun Personal Accessory and Water Bottle This is an upscale designer water bottle top of the line and so much fun The designs Of Sigg s water bottles are gorgeous from the plain solid color bottles to the ones with intricate designs They are simply beautiful I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns thinking it would take more work to maintain These do necessitate regular cleaning I clean mine every day but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun Sort of like my rings glasses and watch I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory reminding me to drink more water making a statement about my values and expressing myself with a special design Yes all in a water bottle Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality made of light aluminum on the outside slightly insulated and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles They are light durable and perfect for any activity Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles just like from the tap Sigg bottles come with several different types of tops I bought the screw top because I don t like sports tops and I don t mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink It is totally leakproof which is important to me The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner I get comments on it all the time What s that I love it The sports top version is ok I just am not a fan as I don t feel like I can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top However for convenience you might prefer it For children there is a cap type top All are leak proof If you are ever unsatisfied with the top you can buy a screw top separately to fit your Sigg bottle Sigg makes their personal water bottle in 6L and 1L in this style I have both I use the 6L for sports activities because they are smaller When I won t have to carry the container I like the larger bottle Sigg also makes a smaller 3L bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people You can buy Siggs in alternative sizes too such as 75L 4L for kids 6L 5L You can occasionally find this bottle in the 1 5L size also Search Amazon for the perfect size Pick a style and pattern you like as this bottle is a personal accessory and should reflect your style The colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on Amazon They are expensive but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health so they are well worth it value wise for me Highly recommended 
5 0 Marine cooler This cooler is the perfect fit and size for our boat The compact size was the main reason for buying this cooler The lid is easy to open and close and it doubles as an extra seat It keeps everything nice and cold all day on the boat 
4 0 Pretty good for the money I was very hesitant to purchase this bike because of all the problems other people reported with parts coming damaged rusty The only problem I had was the bar on the rear bottom wouldn t fit all the way into the slot to put one of the screws in I tried really hard to get it in but it just wouldn t budge Luckily I could get the screw in on the other end so it is relatively secure The bike is a bit wobbly when your riding now I don t know if this is because of my problem with the bar or because that s just the way it is but I don t feel like it s going to fall apart or tip over or anything Over all this is a really nice bike The price is absolutely the best for what you re getting especially if you choose the free super saver shipping I got mine about a week from the day I ordered it I don t think you will find another bike comparable to this for the price Most recumbent bikes at this price don t offer any kind of resistance what to speak of programs or the pulse monitor It is really quiet I can do it at 5 in the morning while my daughter is sleeping in the next room and not have to turn the TV up too loud The seat is a bit uncomfortable but it s not that big of a deal considering the price 
4 0 Great Deal Found the Edge 284 easy to asemble and use It was less expensive than comparable models I checked out at 2 large fitness stores in my area and I didn t have to figure out how to get it home it was delivered for FREE 
4 0 Not perfect but good for the price The bike arrived in fine condition no problems with bent or rusty parts like other people have reported It was really easy to assemble Once I had assembled it I tried it out and found that it made a really annoying noise as the wheel went around as if the gears were scraping against something So I undid all the screws a pain and opened the plastic enclosed base There was a bracket that was meant to hold the pulse wires out of the way but the adhesive on it had worn off or something and it was just kind of hanging and would interfere with the gears So I taped it to the side closed the plastic up and that was that Since then the bike has worked really well I wish there was more ability to move it back it is a good length for me but I can see how someone taller could have trouble with it The seat is not terribly comfortable which gets to be a problem on longer rides but it s fixable with a pillow or cushion The console is great has all the information displayed all the time Plenty of resistance Overall there are some problems with it but for under two hundred dollars I suppose I can t complain too much Definitely worth the money 
5 0 Movin Sit Jr ADHD This is an excellent product My 7 year old son had ADHD and he is constantly moving He has to take medicine to focus at school during the day and moves non stop from waking up to going to bed at night His teacher was happy with his attention at school but he was still fidgeting a lot She gave him this Wiggle Seat for his desk and has seen an amazing improvement in his ability to focus and and participate in class My son has noticed as well He has a hard time sitting at the table when doing his homework at night He told me I needed to get him a Wiggle Seat for home because it helps him concentrate If you have a child with ADHD and you re looking for alternatives to medication this is a great product to try And they ll get great posture as a bonus 
5 0 Perfect for Weightlifting Home Gym Great flooring system for a home weightlifting gym It s heavy and very dense very similar if not the same type of stuff you see in most commercial gym s Heavy duty takes dropped dumbbell punishment and resists damage cuts Use a drywall T Square as a guide and put a new blade in a box cutter Take several passes to cut it and take your time It cuts straight and square for a professional look I will definitely buy these again when I get a bigger room for the gym 
5 0 Excellent choice We tried out the cheap Barbie skates first just to make sure that our girl will enjoy skating After she puts on the K2 she was able to skate so much faster and smoother 
5 0 Great Product This product was constructed better than the one I use at the gym It is very heavy duty and has lots of padding It is comfortable for both myself and my husband to use 
5 0 Sexy Sleek and Stylish Dear Amazon My new royal blue Armour duffle bag is the best travel bag I have ever owned It is durable beyond anything I have ever had and its design is beautiful with the honey combed stiching and perfectly balanced color design of blue and black I actually ordered a small royal blue carry on duffle directly from Under Armour so the two match and I am utterly pleased Under Armour is definitely a KEEPER Andrew Gonzale 
5 0 Great quick delivery I was happy with my purchase I recieved my bearings within 6 business days The bearings were in great condition 
5 0 Best bearings ever and the best price here at Amazon I already have a set of standard Bones Swiss but since I was putting together a longboard with smaller wheels I decided to get slightly faster bearings to make up for it These definately firt the bill and the with the cheap 35 00 price and free shipping that Amazon offers you can t go wrong These may seem dissappointing at first but after about 3 5 hours of riding they ll break in and go very fast Overall very reccomendable to anyone in the skateboard world 
5 0 Great Bearings These are really great bearings Much faster than the conventional abec 7 s I was using 
5 0 Flowboard rocks Just a really great sports toy for kids My son is 9 and he is already pretty good at it but it is hard to keep my 15 year old from stealing it and riding it himself I would highly recommend the flowboard for lots of outdoor fun 
5 0 FUN and works just like it says My 13 yr old wanted this and a waveboard for Christmas Since his dad and I are divorced he ended up with both I got him the flowboard and he LOVES it Of course I tried it too and was shocked to find it was actually easier for me to play with than his regular skateboard There is no chance I m even going to try the waveboard as I do value my intact bones I ve been wanting to learn how to snowboard and this definitely gives the feeling of snowboarding but without the snow It s well made fun and definitely a hit 
5 0 BETTER than a real sk8board Flowboards r way better than real sk8boards They look cooler probabally ride better than normal sk8boards I seen it advertised on a commercial decided right then thats what I wanted for Christmas 
5 0 better than expected my husband looooved it from the moment he opened the box excellent quality looks very expensive 
5 0 Just perfect I got this belt because it s the one my son s physical therapist uses in his pool therapy It s great because it gives them some support but not too much You can also remove floats as they get more comfortable in the water 
5 0 swim belt THe swim belt I ordered was awesome Perfect for my 3 year old to learn how to swim The great thing about it is that you can adjust their bouyancy Take one or two of the floaty squares off and they have to try to swim a little harder It also helps them keep the correct body position for learning how to swim 
5 0 I love it These are fantastic belts for teaching children how to swim They offer mobility and support and have the ability to lessen the support as time goes on I taught swimming for years and this is the product I d recommend 
5 0 Tow mater trike Purchased this tricycle for my grandson 3rd birthday a huge success Not only was it reasonably priced it came w free shipping great deal 
5 0 They are very well made for the price I am very pleased with Knife s The vender was great I ordered them and in 3 days I had them Thank You all TS 
5 0 Victorinox Voyager The scales handles seem decidedly gray rather than black Pen has nice length Battery hidden under plastic liner Even found a nice thin layer of oil of some tools At the outer limit re carrying in front pants pocket unless work jeans 
5 0 Electronic Compass This compass is better than I thought it would be especially for the price It s a great deal I purchased it for a car and it work well for it 
5 0 Uhhhh know what you re buying before you review I would just like to tell everyone who didn t understand the use of this item They aren t actually anti gravity boots They are used for a type of exercise called inversion where you put the boots on and attatch them to a bar hanging either from a wall or cieling so in other words you hang upside down with these boots while attatched to a bar They are in no way meant to make you float or fly or anything else that can only be found in sci fi magazines 
5 0 Great Snorkel This is a great snorkel Seals well against your face and the water really does stay out if a wave comes by The purge valve on bottom works well 
4 0 It s ok I bought this gun and 2 days after the dang stock broke other than that it was ok good acuricy the clip holds 545 in the amunition holder and 15 17 shots in the magazine also the lazers sight does not work 
5 0 home gym This is a wonderful gym It is similar to the boflex but without the HIGH pricetag Delivery was very fast I am very satisfied 
5 0 Good flavors These are good to keep on hand for hiking for that quick energy and I also try to keep some of these or a smiliar product in my purse if my blood sugar drops I am not a diabetic but I have gotten low blood sugar my whole life and when I get it I use this or something else to get it back up fast so I can be comfortable This really works and tastes great too They really did well with this product I like to go geocaching and I get out for a long while on hikes this is great to have in the backpack when I need quick fuel 
5 0 Best Buy Ever The Indo board is an essential product for off season and even on season snowboarders skateboarders wakeboarders etc It allows you to practice your moves and learn some new moves 
5 0 Can t go wrong with a Pelican I own several Pelican cases When I saw the options for cases for my MacBook I knew that this case would be just what I needed The MacBook 13 3 fits snugly inside the case The case says 13 notebooks but the extra width of the MacBook is accepted The case is shipped with small foam large and small spacers I used the large spacers but placed them inside the top lid of the case so that the notebook screen wouldn t be opened when I opened the Pelican I don t have any worries now when I toss my notebook into a backpack and travel I felt uneasy about having to take my notebook out of my Pelican 1510 carry on case when gate checking my carry on luggage for small regional jets 
4 0 Fun Exercise I bought this for my son recommended by his special ed teacher and the whole family has been using it ever since It s a nice sturdy trampoline and it s not too expensive The folding part is a little disappointing which I why it s not getting full stars However we haven t needed to use that feature so it wasn t that important to us Overall this is a good quality trampoline for those who are looking for something less expensive 
5 0 Great rack Outstanding design Secure heavy duty super easy to load very protective of the bikes Best possible design for older or limited users 
4 0 Nice portable hoop but assembly was not easy I purchased this for Christmas for my 8 year old son to play with It was 329 with free shipping compared to 450 at the local sports store The finished product looks great appears to be rugged and stable and is quite easy to adjust I only gave it 4 stars because assembly was not easy and I am mechanically inclined Practically all the holes needed to be drilled or reamed out in order to accept the bolts and the directions were ambiguous It was a 4 hour assembly with filling the base with screened sand really taxing my patience But the smile on the 8 year old s face was well worth the aggravation On a side note I ordered 70 of my Christmas shopping from Amazon with everything except this arriving before the estimated delivery date everything else shipped UPS They shipped this via DHL which never delivered the package I had to drive 120 mile round trip to pick it up at the DHL facility and take time off of work the Friday before Christmas to retrieve my son s primary gift I emailed Amazon requesting 70 credit to reimburse me for my time and gas which they did in a few days This was an oversized package that I assume UPS would not accept Nonetheless their choice of shippers reflects on Amazon as a company 
5 0 Good workout This product does what it claims it will do Put in the time and effort you ll feel great Of course I don t ever expect to look like the model on the box However I feel good and I think I look a little better than when I started Only doing it a few weeks but enjoying it 
5 0 This is a GREAT full body workout I ve worked out with Cathe for about 6 months now and I have to say this is one of my favorite workouts It combines cardio with upper and lower body in a 60 minute circuit workout The cardio bursts are short but intense expect to jump do Power 15 s fast feet shuffles spike lunges etc Lower body work well let s just say I hope you like to do leg press since you ll be doing it A LOT There are a total of 6 sets of leg press on each leg Also Cathe inserts some static lunges and squats among other moves She does hover squats with pulses of 16 over the high step your quads will be feeling the burn there Arm work includes typical weighted and non weight work such as tricep dips off the high step push ups bicep curls overhead extension etc Overall if you re looking for a challenge and a new circuit workout to shock your muscles this is the workout for you Beginners beware you can modify certain exercises I use dumbbells instead of a barbell but this is more for the intermediate or advanced exerciser 
5 0 Nice Board good Price Skim boards keep the kids busy for hours this a great way to get the kids away from the TV This board is nice especially with Free shipping 
5 0 nice barbell bar The bar is very solid and has a good looking chrome finish It takes olympic weight plates 2 inch diameter The shipping and packaging are good too Overall i have no complaint with this purchase I would recommend this bar 
5 0 The Perfect Watch I recently recieved this watch as a Christmas gift I am amazed at the amount of information this watch can gather I can check my altitude see if a storm is brewing and time each lap of my mile jog Everthing works great and is very accurate After a glance through the instruction manuel I was able to use and set all the functions with ease I love the feel of the band it is a perfect fit for my wrist I would reccomend the stainless steel for best look and price This watch is truly fun to use and show off It is the perfect watch 
5 0 Nice Emergency Flashlight You ll never mistake the Shake flashlight for a powerful spotlight but that s not it s purpose It s a niche item the perfect flashlight to stick in your car trunk or emergency bag and then forget about it With no batteries or bulbs you know it ll always be ready for use whenever you need it When it first arrives you ll need to shake it hard for a couple minutes to charge it up but just think of it as aerobic exercise Once it s charged it provides sufficient light to read instructions or maps determine colors of wires or diagrams and keep you from stumbling around in the dark I was surprised by just how bright the Shake flashlight was after about 3 minutes of hard shaking The only improvement I can think of would be to have a small diode glow when the flashlight is turned off When the light begins to dim a few shakes will keep the light strong enough to use Unlike the previous reviewer I had absolutely no problems with delivery I ordered it on 12 26 non expedited mail and it arrived on 12 30 exactly as described 
4 0 Not Too Shabby I go to Anime expos alot And to to be honest this sword aint half bad Unlike its 67 brother its only 37 but its a whole lot better to wield Combat Ready Very Sturdy and made in CHINA I notice some swords made in PAKISTAN and they usually end up breaking so this swords worth the buy if your a bleach fan and if you wanna save some cash 
5 0 F4 is the perfect size and the perfect monitor I am very impressed with the F4 It is very easy to use and a good basic heart rate monitor It is easier to program than my F6 and it fits better Polar makes the best HR monitors and it works with all their chest straps coded and uncoded and even with ones that are not from them I have Vision Fitness exercise equipment and the strap works with their HR function Sometimes I strap the watch to the equipment so I can read while I exercise and I m able to continually see the HR without constantly changing the view on the equipment The color is more of a gray color than an ice blue so it goes with just about anything you wear I m really looking forward to using this unit while I go out and do my walks this spring I can t imagine buying anything else but Polar This is my third watch and all three of them are still working well 
5 0 Looks nice and does the job I love this watch It s easy to use It s also a very basic watch It gives your heart rate zone and calories burned It s very nice for what it is supposed to do If you re looking for a watch with a lot of bells and whistles this is not the one for you It looks nice and it s not too bulky The only reason I would have gotten the F6 is because it says it has something that prevents cross talk interference with others wearing a heart monitor watch There are three of us where this same exact watch in my cycling class and we ve never had a problem with cross talk As the other reviews said there is no backlight Would recommend 
5 0 Go Figure I bought this for myself to play with I m 35 and after all the presents were opened and toys video games and everything were forgotten about 4 hours after Christmas this was the ongoing favorite of the season Everybody younger down to 8 and older to 45 had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching It s already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such This is a GREAT present for 11 18 boy Fair warning though there will be some good spills on the fairly short steep learning curve helmets knee pads blah blah are a must and a video camera 
5 0 Great Home or Road Workout I bought this from lifeline recently and it has been an EXCELLENT addition to my home gym equipment I m not a person who travels back and forth to a gym each day I also do not like paying an arm and a leg for expensive pieces of workout equipment that eventually become expensive coat racks This workout solution is about as low tech as it can get I agree with the previous reviews below you could almost make this one yourself It consists of a strip of mesh webbing like seatbelt material two adjustable quick locking clips handles made of webbing and plastic tubes and another piece of plastic tubing that locks the Jungle Gym into place when the door is shut The equipment is simple but sets up in seconds The clips adjust quickly and are incredibly secure It s so simple but it really works The emphasis of the instruction sheet and the DVD that came along with it is in upper body strength You can do chin ups by regulating height you can work up from lifting part of your body weight to full body weight For me this was the best part of the Jungle Gym My chin ups pull ups have improved remarkably by using the device Body rows push ups and fly push ups are also possible Using the Jungle gym pushups take on a new dimension with a fuller range of motion like an Atlas pushup and given the instability of the webbing you also get more of a core workout You can use the webbing for balance as well as to maintain better technique when doing squats You can also make the exercises more challenging by using a fitness ball You can do abdominal crunches by holding the handles and lifting your feet from the floor Some exercises full body rows and dips are difficult when attached to a door and Lifeline suggests draping the Jungle Gym over a tree limb so you can achieve a truly vertical workout I have not yet tried using this over a tree limb However I was able to perform the dips with some creativity while attached to a door but it was not easy This is not a full fitness solution But when used in conjunction with weights and exercise bands it really makes the home gym complete I have searched for a pull up bar for a long time that is removable but none of the current offerings fit the odd sized door frames and moldings of my 99 year old house The Jungle Gym has worked Given the ability to do pull ups of varying difficulty it has also improved my ability to do pull ups Chin ups over a short period of time The downside of the device is that it requires a STURDY DOOR and DOOR FRAME I would be leery of using the device is the door does not close securely AND LOCK or if you are worried about the integrity of your house s construction Remember the Jungle Gym is strong enough to hold your body weight but the door it is connected to has to be able to do the same If not you will find yourself flat on your back with a new home improvement project to do Remember too that when your feet are touching the ground and you do pull towards the door the weight decreases as you pull This is not a defect of the device it s just the physics of the situation With free weights the weight is stable throughout your range of motion With exercise bands the weight increases as the band lengthens Also this is a great device for weight circuit training but is not really an aerobic solution The Jungle Gym along with a few exercise bands are IDEAL for travel I used mine with three lifeline exercise bands 2 R6s and 1 R8 exercise band door attachment and the lifeline triple grip handles This yielded a gym that weighed less than two pounds fit in my suitcase easily and allowed for a variety of body weight and resistance exercises 
4 0 You could ALMOST build one except for the nifty little metal clips that keep the strap at the length you set until you press on it to lengthen shorten the strap again Does exactly what it is supposed to do and makes for challenging exercises due to the inherent instability Great for spotting oneself too I would buy it again tho I don t think it is as indispensible as some might have you believe So if you can burn the 35 or so get it with no fear Otherwise use your frustration to fuel your desire to workout 
5 0 Great Elliptical I bought this item after much research and this particular model was suggested to me by a friend No problems at all with shipping package was in perfect shape though only delivered to my back steps I opened up the box and brought in pieces individually with the flywheel being the heaviest though I was able to bring in myself It took me about 2 hours to put together Instruction book was better than most I have seen and only problem was the misprint in bolt sizes but you can figure that out easily as everyone has noted on their reviews The elliptical s size is on the smaller size and fits well in my sitting room Easily moved if need be In regards to the workout I cross train on my treadmill and found this workout to be as effective There are a variety of programs so you can vary your workout The backward motion is a little awkward for me I am 5 3 but found that holding onto the lower handlebars works well versus the movable upper ones The machine is very quiet only slight squeeking coming from the upper handlebars that disappeared with a little WD40 It has very smooth movement and you can definitely tell a difference with increasing the level which I was worried about as it doesn t have an incline as some gym machines do The heel rise can occur when you do not sit back on your heels when working out so you just need to be aware of your foot placement The foot pads are comfortable and a good size Most of all for those who do monitor their heart rate I have a Polar F11 heart monitor with chest strap and this monitor is within a 3 beat difference at the most I recommend to let the monitor read for a minumum of 45 seconds before you follow the rate This held true for me even if pacing at 70 RPM s or above I listen to my IPOD when I work out so I have not used the book holder The water holder holds 24 oz Polar Spring bottles without any difficulty taking out and replacing the bottle I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking at increasing their fitness level in the comfort of their own home It s very well built solid quiet effective and affordable 599 free pad free shipping 
5 0 Fantastic piece of equipment for the price My husband and I finished off a bottle of wine before assembling the unit It only took us an hour and a half to assemble and our kids were running around like a couple of nuts during the process After we finished the assembly we both took a turn on a preset program The machine is extremely sturdy quiet and worked like a charm just like a unit found at a gym We re extremely pleased with our purchase and would recommend it to anyone 
5 0 Not much to review A standard 5 bar Not sure how accurate the weight is It feels more than 13 pounds but that could just be me Not a big deal either way 
4 0 Ab Sonic Works I ve had Ab Sonic for three years I bought it at Target It s great It allows me to have a productive workout while I m working overtime to be productive 
4 0 Love it so far Just purchased this chair 3 wks ago and so far so good I use it almost every morning for 15 minutes while I watch the news Needed a chair like this because I m starting to get a gut and my pants are getting too tight I hate exercizing and definitely don t have the will motivation to go to the gym consistently I bought the ultra version because I needed to be able to hide it away when it isn t being used Once folded up 4 1 2 inches tall 29 inches wide 39 inches long it fits very nicely under my couch It is fairly easy to fold up unfold but it could be easier which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars There are 2 bungee type straps that need to be unhooked 2 curved handle bars need to be removed simple twist knobs and one stabilizer bar undone simple twist knob to fold this unit down Removing the parts and folding the unit takes less than 2 minutes Not difficult just wish it was easier Overall I would definitely make this purchase again knowing what I now know 
5 0 Great Product This thing is great Built tough as nails There are myriad exercises for you to do from beginner to advanced as your core strength and stability improve You won t be disappointed in the results if you stick with it Get it USE it 
5 0 Clearly biased I worked with Eureka to design this exclusive tent for Amazon Note I work at Amazon and am biased but want to share why we built this tent for Amazon customers Eureka is one of the best names in the Outdoors industry Their Timberline tent design has been one of the most popular tents for decades They have built on that innovation and I believe build the best family camping tents in the business This tent was designed to offer customers an incredible value for a large family tent that has all the special features for a good sized family Spacious and big It has a center height of 7 feet and feels huge It s a 11x11 and gives you 121 square feet You can fit 2 queen sized airbeds quite comfortably Easy assembly Shock corded fiberglass poles and ring and pin systems make for an easy set up with 2 folks Quality From seams that are sealed to high quality mesh This tent is designed for rugged use through 3 seasons As I re read this review I realize I haven t done a sufficient job in highlighting the spacious feel of this tent 7 foot center height is tremendous 
5 0 Excellent Value It works as advertised Not a lot to say about a bike rack I have hardly any wobble from mine and I suspect those that do didn t assemble theirs correctly or aren t tightening the hitch pin bolt down far enough My only complaint is the weight it uses a really heavy steel tube for the vertical portion of the rack which I don t quite understand The vertical tube has the lowest load with the highest load being on the hitch draw tube But it s not that big a deal It just increases the weight on the rear of the car needlessly 
4 0 Good buy for the Money We also bought this bike rack because of the price and it will hold 4 bikes It could be improved on the Hitch end but it was not bad It does tend to loosen at highway speeds but we use it with the larger attachment for class 3 hitches It kept our bikes from damaging our Suburban We use it for adult bikes and also several smaller BMX bikes It is more challenging to get the BMXs on One trick is to make sure you swing the arm down to mount the one inside bike then tilt it back up for the other three Also use a wrench and tighten the hitch bolt very tight with the lock washer or it will loosen on the highway We also bought a big Schwin cable lock to run through the bike frames for security while parked 
4 0 Neoprene insulated pouch review Neoprene pouch keeps water cool but it has a very strong displeasing smell kind of like used motoroil which overpowers the taste of what your drinking from the bottle So you might want to pour your drink into a cup to enjoy it 
5 0 Nice Trike We got this for our son He loves it Can t hardly reach the pedals but that dont stop him Stylish and well built I think it should last a long time Great product would recomend to anyone 
4 0 It floats is streamlined but nicks easily This item garners the same complaint that I have with the Aqua Sphere pull buoy it floats is functional but nicks gouges very easily I try to keep this away from the sharper objects in my swim gear bag snorkel fins but it still gets dented nicked scratched and gouged Regardless it works quite well and I really like the smooth underside the ribbed handholds and the ample crescent at the base perfect for kicking with my head down into the water One of the best parts is that it isn t as small as a kid s kickboard but it s not huge either Really good product overall 
4 0 weight tree I just recently baught this weight tree since i had a weight bench and I needed a place to put the 400 lbs besides the floor The the weight tree does hold that much weight and could hold more the only thing I do not like is that it does bend in a little when you put the max weight on a slot But it does its job 
4 0 Simple yet great Treadmill sets up fairly quickly unless you are a moron then it might take you some time The pistons are stiffer than I thought they would be allowing for a very challenging upper body workout I usually row while I am watching TV or a game and have never had to turn up the volume because of the noise it really is very quiet Unless you are looking for a health club quality rower this rower would be a very good pick for nearly anyone 
4 0 Stamina Rowing Machine I had one of these similar many years ago and let it go at a garage sale Dumb idea As I get older this Stamina machine has replaced it and is giving me all the exercise I need Good to set in front of the tv and row for 30 minutes I ve gone from a size 40 to a size 36 waist I like the hydraulic part of it and the adjustability 
4 0 Good product that can be improved I used to have a similar product this one works the same except for one little handy detail it doesn t stand on itself like the old one I had 
5 0 Great Product I bought this for my medium sized 9mm Luger with the laser sight attached to it My cousine who has been in the Military for several years recommended it to me I m only 3 feet 6 inches tall and it fits me well He is over six feet tall and it fits him just as well It takes a little time to adjust it to your liking but well worth the money It is comprable to holster costing 5 times as much 
4 0 Excellent Machine With some easy modifications When I got the machine and started putting it together I noticed I was missing a few small pieces Understandable I think as this machine was shipped from Germany 3 and a trip to my local hardware store later the Kettler Kadett was all assembled I had some problems with the foot straps loosening while I exercised but I found that a velcro strap fastened around the toe area to provide an additional foot strap and some velcro adhesive slapped on the existing foot strap fixed that problem With the exception of those minor nuisances the Kettler Kadett is an amazing piece of machinery When I use it I can tell it s not going to break or fall apart at the nuts and bolts It went together easily and it s solid as a rock when I use it I ve never rowed on a real boat in my life but this feels just as I d imagine it would And of course the most important part when I get off I feel like I ve gotten a gym quality work out 4 out of 5 stars for this rowing machine the packaging could have been better and slightly re designed foot wraps but all in all an excellent buy 
5 0 Just Right I had a cheaper version of this product and the strap was flimsy and cut into me in certain poses not to mention that it was too short for many poses The hugger mugger strap is not only long enough but thicker and smoother so it doesn t cut in to my skin and it is comfortable to grip 
5 0 EXCELLENT My kids and I have several backpacking stoves and we are currently ONLY using the Brunton CRUX all the others have been mothballed The Brunton is well made and very reliable It s lightweight and very efficient We are able to cook for 3 people for one week using one large fuel canister 
5 0 Pointed Aluminum Kubaton Many years ago an acquaintance of mine was the property manager of a low rent motel One morning while he was in the back office behind the front desk two men jumped over the counter and started beating on the door He could see them but they could not see him through the privacy security glass The men continued to beat on the door trying to get in He waited inside patiently with his Glock pistol As soon as the door fell and the men ran inside he shot them both They turned out to be high school teenagers who were trying to break in to obtain crack money I recalled that many in the community dissaproved of his actions It turned out that he had plenty of time to leave through the back door and call for help When asked why he had to kill them he simply said I own the life of anyone who threatens my personal safety I did it because it was my right and I could Fortunately it was considered self defense I remembered that he always carried a short stick attached to his keys It was not until many years later that I finally figured out what that little wooden stick was I became interested in self defense and decided to buy a baton for myself This was my first Kubaton I was concerned because this one has a pointed end The pointed end although not sharp compared to a blade weapon will easily punch a hole through four layers of very heavy cordura cloth with little effort on my part I was afraid that if ever I had to use it the amount of damage it will cause and its design would make it hard for me to claim that I was acting in self defense I bought another Kubaton from the same manufacturer with a flat end The replacement baton is exactly like this one except the end is flat I tested the replacement and it will also punch a hole through heavy canvas But it takes a lot more force to do so More importantly to the average person it looks less aggressive than this one If I had to use it in self defense a presiding judge or jury might be less likely to think of it as a weapon If you are not concerned about perception then get this pointed baton If it can easily punch a hole through layers of cordura cloth the same material used in heavy duty outdoor bags outerwear and hiking shoes it can easily injure an attacker who might be wearing several layers of clothes But please understand that some might put this in the same category as they would a knife That might make it difficult to claim self defense in the event that you have to use it to protect yourself My old acquaintance was well versed and knowledgeable He not only knew how to use his weapons but he also understood where the line is between self defense and assault He knew just the limits of what he could get away it in the use of deadly force to defend himself This pointed baton made out of hardened aluminum alloy is probably for such a person MY FRIEND S TIP Here s a tip from that old acquaintance of mine The keys themselves are a part of the weapon And you can make them more effective which will increase the damage from the baton Take some keys that you no longer use Any metal key would do but try to find different sizes About four of them would do Take the keys to a grinder even a rasp will do and sharpen the teeth of each key Now put the four keys in the keyring along with your regular keys Face the sharp keys in opposite directions Meaning two should face one way but the other two should face in the opposite direction The idea is that when you swing the baton like a flail the sharpened keys would cut into the attacker s flesh The keys are faced in opposite directions so that you can do major damage regardless of which direction that you are swinging CITAN S EXPERIMENT Please keep in mind that you can also cut your hand I tried this technique I wore a pair of leather work gloves and swung against a wooden post The sharpened keys bounced back and hit the back of my hand Without the gloves my hand would have gotten badly cut For what it s worth I swung against a large watermelon and the keys didn t bounce back though I don t have anything else to add here except maybe it might be good to swing against an attacker s fleshy parts to prevent the keys from rebounding I m not an expert though But it was fun trying it on a watermelon 
5 0 BEARS PLATE THIS PUPPY GOT TO ME SO FAST IT MADE ALL MY OTHER ORDERS SEEM LIKE THEY GOT CAUGHT UP IN CHRISTMAS RUSH S H WAS WELL WORTH THE SPEED OF DELIVERY 
5 0 LOVE IT Let me start by saying that I ordered this rowing machine on April 2 and it arrived on April 5 I was so excited Even though it has poor instructions on putting this machine together it isn t impossible The tension strap is twisted around part of the machine that needs to be unwrapped first and that is not mentioned in the instructions Also two of the steps seem to be out of order but I still give this product a 5 star rating When I was in college I used a machine like this in their exercise room and loved it This is just like it but I think it s even better I don t have a problem with the foot holders on this machine like I did with the one at college The quality is great for the value I feel that I have enough resistance and that I m getting the workout that I m looking for I use an elliptical rider first then I get on my rower This is now rounding out my workout and I love it My elliptical rider is a gym quality machine and was very expensive but worth the cost This rower is inexpensive but doesn t feel like a cheap machine Again I am thrilled with it By the way I don t think that you can tell it in the picture but the fan cover has holes all the way around it When I m working out I can feel the breeze that it is generating It doesn t blow me away but it s enough to cool me off some I hope you find the machine you re looking for If you re looking to save some money and get a great workout this may be the rower for you 
5 0 Great Value for your money Let me start out by saying that this rower is not perfect It is in fact flawed As you may have noticed I still gave it a five star rating and I will try to explain the reasons for doing so Reading the reviews here I noticed two complaints One pointing out that this machine doesn t perform to the same standards that professional gym rowers do and the other regarding assembly of this machine I researched the various rowers available in the market for quite a while I spent a lot of time and effort driving around and trying various models before purchasing this one simply because I tend to be an informed shopper who wants to get value for his money During my research it became very evident that my favorite rower is a Water Rower followed by Schwinn s WindRigger both were extremely smooth in their operation Both were also about 1000 At any rate these sophisticated rowers gave me a benchmark against which to compare the Integrity and it should surprise nobody that the Integrity doesn t really come close to the performance of either of the other two rowers And it shouldn t given it substantially lower price And this is exactly what it important in considering this rower You cannot expect to get a professional grade rower for such a low price just like you cannot expect to get the comfort and performance of a Rolls Royce if you are buying a Honda Nonetheless what you DO get from Integrity is well within the parameters of what I would expect for about 200 The machine is reasonably stable it is reasonably smooth and it does provide a great workout The noise level is also not too bad and actually seems less than that of the WindRigger The electric monitor is basic and provides speed time calories burned and distance It also provides an option that continuously cycles through all these functions so you cant track all of them during your workout The seat is comfortable and slides smoothly along the track and the whole thing actually has a pretty professional look to it and doesn t appear flimsy I was also quite surprised by the level of resistance this rower provides it is much more than that of the Schwinn WindRigger In addition resistance can be adjusted pretty easily I think my only disappointment is that the air flow created during operation is not channeled toward the person using the machine to aid in cooling him her down but this is certainly a flaw I can live with As a potential buyer you should also be aware that the rower tends to slide across smooth surfaces such as tile which means you need to have a non slip mat under it if you intend to use it on such a surface As I said before I also read that at least one person had a problem assembling this rower I cannot confirm this problem Assembly was extremely easy and quick even though the instructions are not the greatest However it should be quite clear to most people where parts go and what needs to be hooked up where Winding up the chain onto the gear wheel is a breeze too All you need to do is unhook it from the retracting cord that you hooked it up to one or two steps before I suppose the person who wrote the instructions could have switched these steps to make it more logical but as I said the instructions are not great Taking all these factors into account I think Integrity provides a fantastic product for a very low price It does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does so in a surprisingly good manner However as with any product your expectations should be realistic and if they are you will not be disappointed If you expect a gym quality machine you will not get what you are looking for If however you are looking for a basic functional rower without all the bells and whistles of high end products then this is probably the best deal you can get 
5 0 pussy MAGNET Yesterday I overtook a threesome at the second hole with this baby if ya know what I mean those gals dropped their walkers and flocked around me Thing s got hella acceleration too Damn 
5 0 Built like a tank Keeps food warm for hours I wonder why the other reviewer had leaking problems perhaps a bad silicon seal I compared this in store to other products by thermos no names etc and it is one of the most solidly built food carry products I ve ever seen or used I should have bought it years ago and it would have saved hundreds of dollars via home made lunches And jeez the worry that every time you put tupperware ziplock lunches in your bag something is going to leak how much is that worth to put to rest forever I used to wrap my food carrying plastic wear in TWO plastic bags in case of inevitable leakage Never again This thing is solid I must admit it appeals to my guy side see my bachelor style typical lunch and dinner below with the hammered green siding and shiny metal parts I think I sprouted a few extra hairs on my chest after I bought it It looks like something you might dig out of the basement in your parents house to which they would say Oh that used to be your grandfather s and I used it too It still works They could call it the Man Jar Ladies don t be afraid the thermal properties are gender blind and green will be in this fall If you got dumped recently by your girlfriend or wife or mom or whatever this jar can help you in your process of manly rediscovery Despite the fact that spending money is something I generally discourage this jar will actually help you save money in the long run You could carry it home late at night on the subway as a weapon Heck my cooking is a pretty dangerous payload Technical stuff I put a heated hamburger patty and microwaved prev frozen vegetables into the container with a thermometer Started at 180 deg F and arrived at 140 deg F four hours later I bought it before a 7 day road trip living out of a cooler in the back of my car I didn t eat a SINGLE crappy fast food meal and I didn t spend a dollar on anything but gas All healthy pre cooked home style k dog style stuff Get yourself a Corning wear microwave bowl with a heavy duty fridge plastic cover and you have a home cooked meal at every rest stop I ve put boiling water in it let it sit overnight with the top off and it was still warm in the morning And a hotel And a speeding ticket I musta been so excited to have this food bottle Damn ohio pigs 
5 0 Best value This is one of the only things I have every bought sight unseen on Amazon This canopy is very well made and a breeze to set up and put away The carrying case on wheels is an extra bonus 
4 0 Swim cap It does the job I haven t had it long enough to attest to its durability Too bad the shipping cost more than the product 
5 0 Bright light many options for price I have been using a headlight for years when I work night shift at the hospital When that light gave out I bought this one I like having the three settings of brightness Though I had a light on my bike handlebars I wanted to get a light that would go on my helmet It came down to two choices and I went with the Aurora since I had been impressed with it at work It turns out that it is brighter than the light I had on my handlebars that I paid more for just last summer Now I wish I had gotten an Aurora for my handlebars also 
4 0 Really Works I was surprised at how good this worked with very little uncomfortableness while sleeping It didnt take much pressure on the toes to be able to get up in the morning with very little pain on my heal Had problems for the last 4 months before the Thermoskin Have been using it 2 weeks now and am already trying to slowly get back to running Great product 
4 0 The Little Knife with the BIG width The Cold Steel Spike Tanto is a lot of knife for a reasonable price It is viciously sharp and will remove arm hair quite easily It has a width across the spine of the blade that is unmatched by any knife its size I have ever seen Virtually indestructible The case is excellent if plain This knife leaves very wide wounds in steak I think stitches would be the only way to close the wounds On the down side it doesn t hold an edge very long and its handle is very short and I wear a medium glove Overall this is a knife built for the sole purpose of self defense It is small to make it easily concealable and comes with its own neck chain It is a knife that won t let you down when the going gets tough used in its intended purpose it should be virtually indestructible and wickedly efficient 
5 0 Great for the average person This is the perfect monitor for the average person The chest strap communicates with the machines at my gym so I don t have to look at the watch while using the machines While walking or jogging the watch provides a quick way to know your heart rate I haven t used the other features that are offered so I can t rate them but it does everything that I wanted out of it when I purchased it 
5 0 Acurate comfortable My treadmill came with a heart monitor of the same chest strap type that only worked about half the time I never had a problem like that with this one once it s on it keeps reading until I take it off It s also compatible with all the treadmills ellipticals bikes at the gym so I don t have to hold the handles any more 
4 0 Great for the average runner like me I am very happy with this watch I really enjoy running and I wanted to learn how to get the best benefit from running without over exertion and injury The polar website said heart rate monitoring helps with pace getting the desired benefits from my run and helped to reduce injury Pros Works perfectly immediately picked up by the gym equipment no holding on required setting 3 zones for warm up running and cool down was a snap the audible beeps help me to know when I m slacking off or working too hard the constant feedback is very motivating Cons Not many here however the screen seems difficult to see in the sunshine Will have to see the effect of that when spring comes I did a lot of shopping online and I liked the Polar M 61 130 best but I got this one because of the lower price 80 The M 61 has more features and is more fashionable so you may want to look at that one too 
4 0 Great beginner stand I m no professional bike mechanic but this stand has been great for my little at home workshop If you re looking for a more precise truing stand spend a little more money It does the job if you re like me and just want you wheels true enough not necessarily perfectly true 
5 0 Exceeds expectations fillets fish in a pinch I ve always loved Victorinox Swiss Army Knives but I must admit that I when I purchased this one I was not sure if I made the right choice but my expectations were soon exceeded It was right before a trip to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota I had lost my other Swiss Army Knife a Tinker and I was looking for a versatile knife with a locking blade I did not need dozens of other tools for my pending stay in the wilderness I settled on this one because it was on sale and I have not been disappointed The handle has a mild contour that made it very comfortable to handle For its size it had just the right heft but it was not too heavy to weigh down my shirt where I kept it in my buttoned breast pocket The 4 locking blade worked wonderfully I could close it with either one or two hands When closing it the blade pauses at the halfway point reducing the risk of closing it on your fingers when closing it one handed that said it does not eliminate all risk so close the knife with one hand at your own risk During my recent canoe trip I lost my fillet knife on a portage trail and was surprised that cleaning a 24 northern pike with this blade was quite painless though it did take some skill Beyond the blade I ve always found the leather awl and the screwdriver handy but the can opener blade is a primary reason why I prefer Victorinox Swiss Army knives over those produced by Wegner The knife shipped in a simple cardboard box A sheath or pouch would have been nice but I was able to fabricate one with duct tape before my trip Since I kept it in my shirt pocket for most of my trip the sheath wasn t necessary but it is one accessory you should consider purchasing if you choose this knife I recommend getting one You will not be disappointed 
5 0 Solid accurate and not just for fish Here s a secret for the uninformed This is a very popular scale with people who never weigh a single fish This is perhaps the best inexpensive package scale you can get and if you re a regular eBay seller it s one of the best tools you cna buy for making accurate weighings for estimating shipping charges With this scale and a plastic bag you can weigh any package no matter how irregularly shaped and get a weight accurate within an ounce or two But remember it s a secret 
4 0 Effective and convenient These flashlights are made in China That is not too surprising nowadays and is in no way an adverse comment on their quality and construction which seem to live up to what we might hope from a traditional American brand such as Smith Wesson I have two of these and I expect them to last me the rest of my life I am 60 A tad expensive which is why only four stars but small enough to be convenient bright enough to be useful and efficient enough to be inexpensive to operate I bought these flashlights for use during blackouts but their convenience has me using them for illumination whenever I am fiddling around with cables behind the TV or under the office desk or inside the computer The small size means they are easy to hold in an armpit or in the same hand as another tool I also bought the red LED version for use in the car so as not to affect night vision 
5 0 Solid construction Smith Wesson is an American arms maker The flashlight also got solid construction and reasonable weight The more important aspect is that it uses two AA batteries which are easy to find and economical It came with two Energizer AA batteries Three white LEDs are bright enough for general purposes I keep it in my car s glove box 
5 0 Cabana Shelter I purchased this item as a gift for my mother She has a huge outdoor swimming pool and will use it as a changing room for all of her grandkids She s very happy that her new floors won t be ruined by everyone coming inside dripping wet to change after swimming 
4 0 Decent knife Good knife to throw in your survival kit Compass is worthless but other than that it seemed well made 
5 0 They are sick and amazing PowerBars were created out of necesity to be efficient not to taste like a 2 50 gourmet treat similar alot of other bars that have since come out If you want something that has a food like texture and tastes like food eat food like a steak a piece of cake or a banana Power bars were made for energy in the 1980 s people who eat them now got used to them and now actually like them Power Bars are practically synonymous with the term energy bar because they are the time honored benchmark Try a Cliff Bar or a Snickers if you are looking for something tasty when you get tired of those and long for something more in life try a powerbar 
5 0 Great quality and a lifetime warranty Hey I decided to review some things I didn t buy off Amazon but I have owned for sometime that are really great items the kind I would buy again for sure if they were lost I would say lost or broken but Jansport has lifetime warranties If anything happens to your backpack all you have to do is mail it to Jansport with a note of the problem they will fix it for FREE and send it back to you They will even send you a card while they have it telling you it misses you and will be back soon Overall these are such great products you just have to get a Jansport if you re thinking of a backpack Also I am in a review writing competition with a friend of mine and if this review is helpful which I hope it really is I would love to have your yes vote With Care Sa 
5 0 The backpack that last and last This is the second time that I purchased this backpack The first time was over 5 years ago when my son was starting highschool Now he is a 2nd year student in college and it is time to replace the original one Why not get the bag that has lasted so long 
5 0 Knife with a Pen If you have ever been caught at a check out desk or some place in need of a pen and no one has one then this knife is for you The other day I was at the check out line of the supermarket and when I went to sign the credit slip I couldn t as the casher has lost her pen I then whipped out my keychain with this on it and quickly signed the form and was on my way I highly recommend it for situations like this 
5 0 Must have on me at all times I have bought over 20 of these knives I trim my nails open packages write notes tighten screws and strip wire great for stripping wire You can buy replacement toothpicks and pens I put toothpicks in place of the twizzers I have never used the twizzers in 30 years I can use the toothpick a couple times a day I would love to see a thinner version with an LED toothpick and pen Airport security keeps taking my knives Remember to remove the pen and toothpick if they do take it The pen just pulls out This is the best most used tool I have ever owned 
5 0 Massage Table Excellent product Great for home use as it folds up and slides right under the bed The height is adjustable and it breaks down and stores quickly Very good quality materials for the price I have had my eye on one in the in flight magazine when I travel but I saved a lot of money buying it here especially since they included free shipping 
5 0 Affordable and Easy to Transport I am a Reiki practitioner and purchased this table because it is easy to transport and very affordable The table is nice and sturdy sets up and breaks down easily and is lighter than some other models out on the market A good value for the money 
5 0 Works Great This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have use it along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips I live a Florida skiing is far away The rack hasn t shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install Yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car 
5 0 The fins are fantastic I purchased this snorkel equipment for a vacation in Aruba and I used it for 4 days of snorkeling I had always rented snorkel gear before and this was the first time I decided to purchase a set I am very pleased with this purchase The fins are fantastic The design of this fin from US Divers with the split in the middle makes it extremely easy to move through the water it s a great design feature The snorkel mask was comfortable and it never leaked The set also comes with a great blue and gray backpack that you can store all of your gear in 
5 0 super day pack I bought one of these a while back to use as a day pack for hiking I find it an absolutely great backpack It has enough compartments for everything I need to carry as well as a ton of smaller pockets for nick knacks and smaller items I found I didn t need the waist belt and never used it as it doesn t do much It s not like your trying to get weight to your hips with a small pack like this anyways I ended up cutting it off It has a nice carry handle at the top built into the harness that makes it real easy to carry this pack or move it around with one hand when not wearing it The padding on the back is very comfortable I haven t overloaded this pack yet but with about 15 20 pounds it s very easy to wear It has straps for a skateboard snowboard and while I ve never used it for those They make nice straps to lash things on if you wanted to I also like the cell phone pocket which I actually do use for a cell phone I liked that so much that I zip tied my folding knife pocket exactly opposite it One downfall for me was the 2 side pockets Usually used for water bottles They are quite small my nagaline 32 oz bottles won t fit in there though no problem with smaller sizes The pack is able to be used as a camel back though I didn t see a bladder specifically made for it So in the end I just bought another one of these for a friends birthday and I m really impressed with it I would definatly recomend this pack 
5 0 Fabulous toy for infants My daughter received this toy for Christmas and at seven weeks old immediately loved it My five month old nephew also received one and loves it as well It is easy for infants to grab and soft so they don t hurt themselves when they pull it towards their face and mouth The colors are visually engaging and it has a nice rattle sound to it loud enough to get the child s attention not too loud to be an annoying toy I recommend this toy for anyone shopping for a shower or birthday gift 
5 0 Can find simliar cheaper This is the same toy I was given as a shower gift except mine has a rubber duck in the middle The women who gave it to me said she got it a a dollar store Awesome toy for infants since it s light easy to grip and easy to bit My son loved this toy for 2 3 months until he was old enough to move on to bigger heavier toys 
5 0 Fantastic first toy This was the first toy my son picked up and put in his mouth at 3 months I think he liked it because it is very light and easy to grab on to He has found it so entertaining and I especially appreciated that in his first months when there wasn t a lot I could do with him Now I try to include it with all of my baby shower gifts 
5 0 deep gouges literally disappeared deep gouges caused by feet of sofa where all finish was off in 2 6 x9 areas were discovered during move out this product saved us from complete refinishing of otherwise gorgeous oak floors simply rubbed the felt like stick over the area and the gouges seemed to fill in applied 2 more layers and were amazed couldn t tell where they were 
4 0 swivel rod rack Extra heavy somewhat difficult to assemble Good quality Will hold 24 rods but not with reels attached more like 12 rods reel combos 
4 0 Treadmill safety key Safety key was fine except I purchased treadmill without book and it was not the size I was looking for I took a chance at the size so my own fault 
5 0 Treadmill key review Product was exactly as advertised and was shipped in timely manner I m very satisfied 
5 0 Good workout The heavy tension Gripmaster provides a great workout for the fingers and wrists The average person may want to start with the medium Gripmaster to get up to speed about a month of daily use But for people involved in daily wrist finger activities Martial Arts guitarists etc you probably could plunge right in with the heavy tension with no problem 
5 0 Good Product I purchased both the 7 lbs and 9 lbs tension units and I m extremely satisfied with both models Both models allow for independent work on particular fingers or your grip as a whole My hand strength which had been decreasing a bit as I age has returned very quickly as has increased freedom of movement through fingers Whichever level of tension you choose I m sure you will be satisfied with the Gripmaster 
5 0 Great exercise Comfortable in my hand and with a variety of exercises I find it a great thing to have at my desk to use periodically during the day 
5 0 If you Need Finger Strength Control Endurance and Coordination you are in the Right Place Let me start saying that this is a wonderful product Small light and well constructed they feel like they will last forever You can carry them with you allowing to workout your fingers at the office at home or wherever you find suitable I bought the four different color coded gripmasters Black heavy Red medium Blue light and Yellow extra light I only found the resistance of the red and black ones useful for me but my wife loves the blue and yellow ones It was a great buy because of their high quality and affordable price The product comes with a foldable instruction booklet where you find details for six different exercises Trigger pinch This one simulates the movement of squeezing a trigger and it isolates the index finger for enhanced strength and coordination Gross grasp This one strengthens fingers thumb wrist and forearm for a firm grip Hook position This one strengthens longer muscles in forearm and wrist while stretching smaller muscles in hand for greater motion and endurance Tip to tip pinch This exercise strengthens specific fingers thumb smaller hand muscles and forearm for greater control and endurance Wrist flexion It strengthens wrist and forearm muscles Key pinch Strengthens thumb and index finger for greater stability and coordination At the gripmaster website you can find more exercises for different activities and sports If you are looking to crush hands when handshaking this is not the product for you but if you need finger strength control endurance and coordination you are in the right place 
5 0 Love It I bought the red medium tension and it s a good beginner challenge for most It looks like a little instrument of torture but I love it I am a 50 something woman who is an advanced beginner guitar player and it s helping tremendously plus there is something about having hand and finger strength that makes all your everyday chores easier such as typing this recommendation Also great for stress 
5 0 Doctor Ogre I love this product In Fact I own two and not because I use two at the time I don t I just like to have a spare First off this is the only gripper that allows you to exercise each finger individually Second it is one of the very few that exercise the thumb individually Third despite all of this it is very compact I put it in my pocket and get most or all of the exercises on it done at work Fourth it offers a variety of exercises Definitely a good value for your money 
5 0 Good challenge for fingers and hands I originally bought the Blue 5 lb Red 7 lb and the Black 9 lb Gripmasters for my 14 year old boys The Blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger The Blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so I ended inherited it It is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light this makes it good for use anytime anywhere I have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever If I had to do it again I would have probably not bought the Blue unless you have a very light grip probably have started with the Red I started to use the Red and the Black The Red is just right for me challenging for the fingers and I am working my way to use the Black consistently Although it doesn t seem like it at first the Black is challenging for the hand and fingers and will give a good workout Just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping the challenge is working out the fingers It is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers It has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts Great product excellent for finger or hand exercise good quality Also bought from DMM Products great price fast shipping 
5 0 Start lighter The gripmaster is very well made I was impressed by the high quality I have played guitar for many years but I found the heavy tension to much for me to start I ordered the medium tension and am working my way into the heavy It s doing many reps that is the key to hand strengh not moving heavy tension I really like the gripmaster 
5 0 Heavy Tension Black is better for men I bought both the Medium and Heavy tension Gripmasters The Medium red one is not much of a challenge for me I m a man of average build and I actually bought these because I was starting weight training at the gym and I wanted more grip strength for my hands and stronger forearms I d say if you are looking for individual finger strength such as for playing an instrument then the red Gripmaster might be enough resistance But I use the black one much more for whole hand strength The product comes with a guide containing instructions on a variety of exercises I would also recommend visiting Gripmaster s website as they have a more complete list of exercises and recommendations for different sports 
5 0 Sturdy and steady mat High quality exercise equipment mat Wipes off well and helps keep bike steady 
5 0 Very cute item for practical joke It had special meaning for me because when my two daughters were little they are now in their late 30s I taught them to flush finally by telling them there was a toilet monster that would come out and get them if they didn t flush I caught them both with the Toilet Monster joke and it was quite funny and led to some fond reminiscences It is more funny than scary though it does give you a start when you first open the lid 
4 0 Pretty Funny ^ I got a few great chuckles out of this thing Just get s kinda grossweird using it over nad over again But a great one no matter 
4 0 scared me it does what it promises i nearly fell over when my boyfriend let this surprise for me he needed a little bit of tape in addition to the suction cups but worth getting can work well for keeping pets out of the toilet as well 
5 0 I Bought It And Think It s Great Most posters here haven t actually bought used a Toilet Monster It s a really great joke prank We bought one and used it for my mother in law She was stunned and a bit disoriented then wait for it she laughed really really hard It s not scary just startling The way we installed it if someone opens the lid and seat they won t see it so it s best to try on women Great for the price 
5 0 A holiday saviour This is quite possibly the greatest thing since sliced bread other than sliced bread with the crusts removed of course I was in an difficult situation last year let me explain I for a long time have had a love for open spaces and the whole hiking and campology scene I am a regular purchaser of Hikers Monthly and own a mint condition copy of The Art Of Camp I ve been hiking in several places around Canada and the Rockies but for a long time I ve truly wished I could scale the heights of Everest or wander the mountain passes of the Pyrenees Well one day my opportunity came My friend who is part of the WCO World Camp Organisation called me up and asked me if I d be interested in a fortnight up the Pyrenees As you can imagine I nearly passed out in my two berth with excitement I was camping at the time I hurried home to pack as he said we needed to leave that weekend the problem came when I opened the door of my house I was met by Tchaikovsky my alsation NO I thought What am I supposed to do with Tchaikovsky There had been an unfortunate incident at the kennels earlier that year although the courts could prove nothing and Harold my neighbours Iguana had been harassed a little too much so I didn t like to ask I was feeling decidedly down when my friend rang me back When I had finished updating him on the situation he suggested I look for at the Mountainsmith Dog Backpack A little confused I looked on Amazon as he had suggested and as soon as I saw it I knew what he meant I ordered it straight away and it came within two days Thanks Amazon When I slipped it onto Tchaikovsky s back he went mad with delight and shot off round the garden barking at the trees and anything else he could find Friday soon came around and after Harold s funeral sadly he died of a heart attack but again nothing could be proven we were off We had an amazing time seeing the sites and climbing ridge after ridge Tchaikovsky carried the instant mash powder and my collection of David Bowie CDs + CD player in his saddle bags Not once did he wimper due to chafing and we took some great pictures of him in his little red bobble hat Thanks for making my holiday 
5 0 Very nice machine After much deliberation and self debate I bought this bike from someone other than Amazon I spend about 2 months doing research then needed the immediate satisfaction that comes from purchasing from a walk in store I ve had it since right after thanksgiving and think it s one of the better purchases I ve made It seems that with the fan type exercise bike you get fewer bells and whistles but more strength and reliability I ve had one treadmill and one fancy exercise bike die after just a few months While this machine doesn t play music or show me videos that try to make me believe I m riding through the French country side it does feel like it might just last forever 
5 0 Best and Easiest Treadmill Lube I use my treadmill 4 times a week and noticed that their was friction building up I tried silicone from an auto parts store but the odor was unbearable and later learned that their are propellants in the aerosol cans that actually cause more harm than good I came across the LifeSpan treadmill lube as I was looking for a product that was 100 silicone It is easy to apply and I felt immediate results I also like the fact that it provides me with a 1 year supply 
5 0 Love It The backpack is great It is a wonderful tool for dogs with lots of energy You can fill it with lots of weight and they love carrying it It secures well and dogs love it If you give a dog a job they really feel useful and I think they appreciate it a lot 
5 0 Very Happy Good product Great deal for the price Based on prior reviews I ordered the Medium size for my 100 lb German Shepherd and it fits great I put 2 water bottles in each pocket to help burn fat she needs to lose some weight I m going to order the Small size for my 70 lb German Shepherd to help her burn some of her energy She wore the Medium size on our walk today and it help focus her she tends to be all over the place The medium size works but I think the small would be ideal 
4 0 its pretty big I bought the large for my 90lb 11 month old lab great dane mix and it is pretty big on him Admittedly he s still pretty skinny despite his weight but I had to tighten the straps all the way in order to fit him Probably better for broader dogs but I m sure mine will grow into it o The quality is excellent and there s plenty of packing space overall I m pleased with it especially for the price If your dog is skinny narrow I d order the next smaller siz 
5 0 Dog Back Pack Arrived quickly and was EXACTLY what we wanted we are very satisfied with the product and the process 
5 0 Good place to start I purchased both the medium and high tension Gripmasters For the average person the medium does not present too great a challenge however it is a good place to start Every day activity does not provide the mobility or range of motion that the medium will give you After a month of daily use you will be more than ready to move up to the high tension Gripmaster and not experience frustration that may lead you to quit

5 0 Great Product + Great Price = Great Way to Work Your Hands Forearms I recently purchased a pair of the Gripmaster Hand Finger Exercisers in order to help build forearm strength As I was unsure which tension would be appropriate I bought one each of the Light Blue 5 lbs tension and Medium Red 7 lbs tension grips I ve had them for a little more than a week now and I just love love love them Perhaps that s a little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up for exercise accessories but I really do enjoy the grips I leave one out on my desk at all times and get in a little work here and there when I stop to read a document or whatnot The Gripmaster Exercisers are different from conventional grips in that you can either work your entire hand at once or each finger individually great for guitar players I ve heard One side features four small levers each with its own spring that can be squeezed together or one at a time The plastic on the flip side is molded together so that you can work your whole hand as one unit The black rubber cushion is removable and you can place it on either side of the grip It s an awesome idea and allows for maximum versatility Just for reference I m a female in relatively good shape but with painfully little forearm strength my biceps are huge from years of Tae Bo though The 7 lb Medium Red grip is do able but challenging The 5 lb Light Blue grip on the other hand makes for a much easier workout I oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things and I only feel it after a number of reps If you re a female and not in great shape you ll want to start out with the Light Blue grips or even the Extra Light Yellow ones and work your way up Out of shape guys can probably get away with the Medium Red ones to start If you ve got good hand wrist forearm strength don t even both with the lighter tensions skip ahead to the Medium Red or Heavy Black Although I ve only owned my Gripmasters for a week or two and can t personally vouch for their durability they do seem sturdy and well crafted My fianc s brother an amateur boxer and guitar player used his for years without a problem so I have faith that I ll be squeezing these babies well into 2015 Kelly Garbato Couch Potato Turned Fitness Fanati 
5 0 Great tool This tools is really really great It helped me to overcome the problem I faced while playing guitar specially the barre chords 
4 0 Great product We bought this for our 4 year old son He loves playing with it and it has really helped him with coordination It is well built and I am sure will last a long time It did take two of us to put it together though 
5 0 THE BEST My boys LOVE all types of construction and farm toys This one is the best They can sit on it and dig dig dig It is a little pricey but well constructed and extremely worth the price A MUST We have had this toy for 8 months and if my 3 boys can t break it that in itself says quite a lot 
5 0 Great little scooter My kids just love this inexpensive little scooter We have another one at home which has been used for years We ve had other scooters but have found the Razor brand to be the most stable and reliable 
5 0 o man i wish this is a good scooter you have to admit but i used to have a viper brand scooter and it was fast but it got stolein i hate people who do that i wish i had my viper brand scooter back from 2000 i tryed to find it online but they dont sell any i wish i knew where my dad got it he died in 2001 ok i just wonder if they had it here but they dont o man 
5 0 Great product The ablounge 2 is great Easy to use and does not hurt my neck like regular sit ups Works great after 2 weeks of use already saw results THanks 
5 0 Ab review The item was very easy to assemble and it works well and certainly seems to do what it says It is great 
5 0 It s so much fun I don t actually own one yet but my boyfriend does so I ve been sneaking over to his house to use it until I make room in my own home for one When I first used it I was like some of the other reveiwers disappointed that it didn t work my abs the way I expected but then I realized I wasn t doing it correctly It makes it pretty easy to use your legs and arms instead of just your abs so it helps to focus at the beginning on just using your abs and nothing else and then you can really feel it The strap is way too small though I usually just put my fingers under it but there s no way to do somme things that the lady on the video does like sticking your arms through the strap and holding them straight and I have pretty small arms The range of motion thing is great and feels so good on the back which is the complete opposite of doing crunches on the ground I used to do about 1 000 crunches a day but then I started getting bruises on my back from them and I pretty much hit a plateau where I wasn t seeing any changes in my abs I have so much fun using the ab lounge while I watch TV too it s a great way to make the commercial time go by I would recommend that the people having problems with this try to go slowly and really focus on working just your abs it makes it so much more worth it 
5 0 A great place to run I have owned this device since June 2006 The device linclines from 0 12 degrees and provides speeds of up to 12 mph This tread mill gets up to speed and stop quickly but should not trip up most people There is no cool down cycle like on the systems at the club Also the pluse sensors in the hand grips take a while and some adjustment to get an accurate reading I plan on ordering the chest band monitor from the manufacture in hopes that will provide better feedback during my exercise routine 
5 0 Mat is fine for my Boflex Ultimate 2 Bought 2 of these mats on Amazon s Friday sale about 5 months ago I paid 25 dollars a piece For 25 dollars they are well worth the price At their regular retail price 100 I think they are a bit over priced I am very pleased with the mats anyway 
5 0 Must have I am so glad amazon offered the Bowflex mat as a bonus item I have the bowflex set up in my familyroom which is newly carpeted and I was concerned about divets in the rug I have to say the mat is a big help 
4 0 Good Mat Just got my mat which was free with the Bowflex I bought and it is pretty nice Nothing special it is what it is a nice looking mat I don t see this thing ripping anytime soon And mine doesn t make the whole room smell like rubber like someone else commented But like I said mine was free I would never pay 90 for one of these 
5 0 Really functional mat Bought this to put under my exercise bike and protect the floor I ve found it to be sturdy yet it s really dense and thinner than you would think It doesn t have the cushion like feel of an exercise mat but rather is much firmer So far it has proveb to be a great surface for the bike and is also keeping my floor in good shape 
4 0 Great mat for the price I bought this mat for my exercise bike It was large and gave my floor great protection I would recommend this mat to anyone that has exercise equipment 
1 0 Not so good Got the mat for free for ordering the Series 7 treadmill and while putting the mat under my treadmill it ripped It is made by this rubbery plastic and it s just okay I wouldn t pay 100 for it it s true but I was very disappointed that it ripped so easily Not very durable but I got mine for free so I guess I wasn t too surprised it was given away 
5 0 If you Need Finger Strength Control Endurance and Coordination you are in the Right Place Let me start saying that this is a wonderful product Small light and well constructed they feel like they will last forever You can carry them with you allowing to workout your fingers at the office at home or wherever you find suitable I bought the four different color coded gripmasters Black heavy Red medium Blue light and Yellow extra light I only found the resistance of the red and black ones useful for me but my wife loves the blue and yellow ones It was a great buy because of their high quality and affordable price The product comes with a foldable instruction booklet where you find details for six different exercises Trigger pinch This one simulates the movement of squeezing a trigger and it isolates the index finger for enhanced strength and coordination Gross grasp This one strengthens fingers thumb wrist and forearm for a firm grip Hook position This one strengthens longer muscles in forearm and wrist while stretching smaller muscles in hand for greater motion and endurance Tip to tip pinch This exercise strengthens specific fingers thumb smaller hand muscles and forearm for greater control and endurance Wrist flexion It strengthens wrist and forearm muscles Key pinch Strengthens thumb and index finger for greater stability and coordination At the gripmaster website you can find more exercises for different activities and sports If you are looking to crush hands when handshaking this is not the product for you but if you need finger strength control endurance and coordination you are in the right place 
5 0 Miniature Finger Gym Play Guitar Better Our daughter took up guitar about 6 months ago It took her about forever to master the pesky F chord Her teacher noticed she was developing the bad habit of holding her third finger on top of the pinky finger to get it to hold down the strings Just not enough strength in that pinky finger says the teacher Enter Gripmaster Finger Exerciser Works like a charm And hey her basketball dribble is stronger now too The kids at school are jealous they think it s cool her bright yellow contraption Rock on Gripmaster 
5 0 Sturdy Indestructible So many children and even adults bounce on my ball whenever they come over and happen to see it That s not what it s supposed to be used for but it just shows how sturdy it is My friend who is probably about 250 lbs didn t even pop it 
5 0 Great Product for a Great Price I train people for a living and have sent all of my clients to this seller for their exercise balls Being one that works with different sized people on a daily basis on the Max Fitness balls I can tell you that they provide a great product and they are very fast to get it to my clients I own one myself Thanks for the great product and service Jason 
5 0 very useful and durable for what it is I ve had one of these for 13 years ONE For THIRTEEN years It still works great PLEASE use it carefully if you re going to use it You can very easily give yourself a very nasty case of some obscure or not repetitive stress syndrome To completely avoid that and any similar problems you ll need Dr Sonnon but in the meantime just be careful 
4 0 Good for recovering lost strength due to injuries Two years ago I tore one of the transverse ligaments in my wrist playing racquetball which was the unfortunate combination of a dusty court 200 pounds of player moving about 15 miles an hour a poorly timed forehand and very hard wall I had two surgeries to repair the injury and it was mostly successful The biggest side effect has been weakness in my injured wrist and hand I have moved beyond squeezing toys and putty but I lacked the strength to do weight training This device has been a tremendous breakthrough for me I have been able to make some rapid gains in my strength without risking injury with weights I am already seeing the difference in just two weeks If you are recovering from surgery such as carpal tunnel or other wrist related injuries I strongly recommend making this device part of your recovery plan Of course check with your doctor and or physical therapist before starting up a new exercise 
4 0 Not too bad This is the first product I ve ever bought to work out my forearm so I can t compare it to anything else but I will say it does work I ve noticed a strength increase in my forearm in just a month of using it It s comfortable and easy to use I would like the highest resistance to be a little harder though 
5 0 awesome golf exercise second best exercise for lengthing your golf drives improves club head speed very nicely If you are wondering 1 is pulldowns for the lats 
4 0 Incline This is a very good product for the cost but if it has the ability to be flat I can t figure it out It is always on a constant incline when there are times I d like it to be flat 
4 0 good deal I bought this to replace an electric treadmill that was too big for my space I am happy with the treadmill because it is portable and stores easily It is necessary to keep the belt oiled underneath in order to walk without much friction That has not been a problem though The only drawback is that I am not comfortable walking without holding onto the siderails It is more difficult to control the speed by simply walking with arms swinging or holding a book to read as I did with my electric treadmill All in all however it has been worth the time and money spent for the treadmill I can easily move it from room to room and put it away when done 
4 0 Yes I would buy it again This machine is a great buy for the price It was simple to put together doesn t take up much room and is easy to use There is just a little noise when you are walking but nothing the TV can t drown out 
5 0 Just awesome I used to try to strengthen my fingers using the Gripp balls and later the Gravity Gripp which were grip balls that were also 1 pound weights However they were bulky hard to get a grip on and heavy and pretty silly looking So when I saw the picture of these awesome little gizmos in a catalog I ordered one right away They are about the same price of the Grip balls but they are SO much cooler Not only is this good for fitness training they re even better for musicians my instrument is piano These are light and flat and they fit right into a purse I don t feel silly using this out in public if anyone asks I just let them try it and they are immediately hooked I carried my blue one around everywhere until this weekend when I gave it away to a friend It is difficult to know which tension to use I m a woman with small hands and found that I am right between the blue and the red I use the blue one for 4th and 5th finger left hand I can usually handle the red one for everything else but the booklet says that repititions are more effective than heavier tension I use mainly the blue one now I hope to work up to the red but that will be a while I m also going to buy a couple more so I can work both hands simultaneously I do have one caveat make sure you use these correctly Don t overdo it or try to use a heavier tension to just to feel all macho Like any weight training you have to press the buttons precisely to isolate the muscles Don t use your whole arm just to get the button pressed I found that if I started to cheat I got a little wrist pain and felt the beginnings of tendonitis another reason I m staying on the blue tension for now Oh and buy your Gripmaster here at Amazon They are 15 each everywhere else 
4 0 Fingers are Thunders Yes I like it after using for 2 weeks my fingers were strong Good thing is that this exercise helps in smooth blood flowing in your body

5 0 pedometer these are the third and fourth ones I have ordered for family and friends I love it It is not fancy but that s not what I wanted They got here in record time and work perfectly 
4 0 Little Cheap and Easy I often walk to the store or post office and was curious about how far I was walking so when I saw how inexpensive this pedometer was I decided that it would be fun to try and that I wouldn t really be out anything if it didn t work or if I didn t use it It counts steps very accurately The first day I used it I counted my steps myself and would check every one hundred steps it was right on It s not as accurate as far as measuring distance but I know that s my own error in setting the stride length My pace and stride length vary as I go so I m still working on finding an average If you re looking for a simple pedometer for a good price I recommend this product 
4 0 Sportline 340 Strider Pedometer I received my Sportline 340 Strider Pedometer and have been utilizing it at every advantage it keeps wonderful count of your steps and does not give you false reading as many others have The numbers are quite viewable 
5 0 Everything I wanted I went to a lot of stores trying out many differnt treads and researching what I should get I need a good unit that s going to last This one was one of the models I kept seeing and hearing good things about I loved it in the stores but Amazon had a better price and I didn t mind waiting a week to get it I ve been using it now for about 3 weeks and I can see why I kept hearing good things about it It s really sturdy and there was a lot of attention put on the little details Everythings right where it should be it s very quiet and very sturdy I d reccomend it if you want something your going to use every day 
4 0 review This was replacement for original that was damaged when we received it Replacement was handled very well and in timely manner Thank 
4 0 Great machine for the money I wanted a full featured treadmill for a reasonable price I got it and more with the Ironman 220t It is easy to use and the controls are accessible Smooth running and quiet I have used it for over 4 months and find it to be a great asset to my daily workout routine 
5 0 Info about scopes 4x20 = 4X magnification x 20mm diameter objective lens the end closest to the target Included rings mount to 3 8 Dovetail grooves on 22 caliber rifles Owners manual should list what kind of ring mount base is on the rifle or air gun you want to put a scope on There are bases and rings made for just about every combination possible And conversion bases to change from one type to another At the ranges possible with an air gun 4X is sufficient The higher the magnification the smaller the area field of view that you can see thru the scope For comparison 4X is used extensively by deer hunters in wooded situations and some consider that too high For moving targets and less than 100 yard ranges 4X will work great Also Nitrogen filled prevents internal fogging and is a feature usually used on much more expensive scopes 
5 0 Radical Rifle I cannot say that I have had many Crosman products that I liked Granted they were purchased at Walmart for under 50 and not the best Crosman had to offer I had always been curious about their higher end products but was nervous about spending more money on something that might not be any better than the cheap stuff at wally world I found this rifle at Pyramid Arms online for 99 00 I read the description and my interest was perked The cool design semi automatic and airsource fuel intrigued me I decided what the hell and ordered it The rifle came with 4 clips and 1 Airsource tank I had ordered Crosman wad cutter pellets for it and 4 additional clips from Pyramid My son and I loaded the clips and went out in the back yard to see what she would do Our target was a GIANT Tide laundry detergent bottle We sat about 70 feet from the target and opened fire I was truly impressed The wad cutters went clean through the Tide bottle and were stuck in the concrete block behind it The accuracy was extremely good No recoil Very Very Very slight pressure drop when going nuts on the trigger We shot a total of 16 12 shot clips on one Airsource tank at 50 degrees This was less than what the box said it would shot on one tank but the performance of the rifle was so impressive that I won t hold it against Crosman Points that I liked Very good weight and balance Not plagued by massive pressured drop from tank freezing Anyone who has shot a CO2 pistol that uses the old small cartridges will know exactly what I m talking about here Semi Automatic New Mowhawk sights Dove tail for scope mounting Will need high mount scope rings to clear open sights Rugged construction Evil styling At night this thing would make most men drop the chilupa Points that would improve this rifle A way to shut off and remove the Airsource tank without wasting unused CO2 A last shot bolt open feature When it s out of ammo the bolt should stay open like a SKS or AK47 A little more room to insert and remove the clips Inserting a clip can be trying I have to say that this is the most impressive Crosman I have ever owned It is EXTREMELY fun to shoot Crosman hit a home run with this one Kids will need the supervision of an adult while operating this Unless you want to be paying for broken windshields dented fenders dead animals or like wise events of mayhem 
4 0 Crosman Nightstalker Review Good Points Great sight design No pumping Built To last Bad Points Picky about the pellets you feed it No airsouce CO2 shutoff valve included and the manual states that you shouldn t store the rifle with an airsource cartridge attached to it if you follow the manual you could end up wasting a lot of CO2 if you have to remove a partially used cartridge when you re finished shooting It only gets about 200 shots per cartridge unlike the advertised 350 shots General Comments I purchased a Crosman Nightstalker air rifle several weeks ago for about 110 The Nightstalker is solid and shoots well The sight on the gun are very well made and allow for extreem acuracy I ve shot approximately 1 000 shots through the Nightstalker thus far experimenting with several types of pellets in an attempt to wring out as much accuracy as I can With the rifle supported the best 5 shot group I ve shot so far at 30 feet could be completely covered by a dime and at 60 feet a quarter It seems to be somewhat finicky about the pellets I feed it here is my summary on pellets I ve tried in order of increasing accuracy Beeman Crow Magnum very poor accuracy pellets tumbled and groups were by far the worst of all pellets tried Daisy Flat Nosed Pellets wadcutters below average accuracy Daisy Pointed Field Pellets below average accuracy RWS Superpoints Extra average accuracy Benjamin Domed Pellets above average accuracy I expected this pellet to do better considering it is what the 392 s manual recommends Crosman Copperhead Pointed above average accuracy Crosman Copperhead Wadcutters very good accuracy Gamo Hunter very good accuracy I have encountered a few jams but they were easily fixed Although I ve only owned the rifle several for serveral weeks so far I am extremely satisfied with the Nightstalker 
4 0 Nice Home Bike Bought this bike for my wife It arrived a day late for the next day delivery The packaging was a little crumpled but the contents were ok The directions for assembly couldn t have been more clear and easy to understand It took me about an hour taking my time to put it together The bike seems solid and sturdy enough to last a long time Also very comfortable 
4 0 Great but a couple snags and advice My box arrived somewhat banged up but apart from a cosmetic scuff on one handlebar it was OK BUT after 2 days I started hearing a noise seemed to come from the interior of the pedals gearbox sounded like a loose object bouncing around I was afraid I would have to ship it back I called Schwinn and the woman asked me to take the pedals off and see if I could reproduce the sound I assured her it was not the pedals She said yes sir now please take the pedals off I did and it was the left pedal Sounded just like the interior Anyway they will send me new pedals so problem solved Sounds like they have encountered this problem before Also I was frustrated by the inability to see the blue display screen so I bought 2 doorstops removed the standard mounting screws and used GOOP adhesive to make the screen lean forward Now I can read it Someone at Scwinn did not do the Q C on that screen issue Anyway great bike now I m happy 
5 0 Great Bike The bike arrived in 6 days Our shipment was from UPS Great service No damage during shipment 
4 0 Exercycle This is a good recumbent exercise bike The heart rate monitor is a little inconsistent and you have to hold the sensors firmly But it is solid and works well 
5 0 Awsome I was a little standoffish about it at first because I did not know what I needed This bike is great I have no idea why anyone would buy anything else I have seen bikes like this go for 3k and I have no idea why as this bike does it all It is awsome Feels great and is almost silent Great purchase I am going to try out a schwin eliptical machine next probably 
4 0 More poor packaging Just as others have reported the bike ordered arrived in a box that was beaten up and full of very large holes Looking into the holes there was no sign of packing material but there was sign of damage to the bike The driver making the delivery handed over the paperwork to sign at the same time saying I wouldn t accept delivery of this Needless to say delivery was refused A replacement bike will be coming I m told by Amazon I wonder what the odds are that this bike will arrive in the same condition 
5 0 Baby Einstein does it again Baby Einstein has done it again They have created an engaging learning toy that both babies and parents love The best part of it is they call it the activity star It s what many of those cute babies in the customer images are smiling up at The activity star has different settings for playing music on short play and motion activated It s also got a smiling face in the center and lights on each star tip that flash along with the music My 3 month old daughter loves the smiling face and flashing lights Compared to other play mats in the same price range this one is the best in my opinion 
4 0 Keeps baby s attention We bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old He would just lay in it and would be entertained for a long time which bought me time to do housework around him etc You can take the hanging pieces down and hang up other objects so that there s always variety I d say he lost interest in it though at about 7 months when he learned to crawl I bought mine used on ebay and it was worth the 35 I spent I wouldn t spend much more than that 
5 0 This gym is perfect We originally set this gym up for our son when we moved into our new house and had nowhere to put him he was 3 weeks old As time went on it just became convient to put him on the mat close to us It was really fun to watch him grow into all the toys He started by just swinging his arms and finally has learned to grab and interact with the toys He loves the star in the middle He could spend all day talking to that thing alone He loves this gym so much that we take it everywhere we go I highly suggest this gym for any baby It is something that us or the baby couldn t live without 
4 0 He loves the star My 3 month old was bored with his current play gym While at a friends house he fell in love with the activity star that this gym included I went home and ordered it right away We now carry the star wherever we go I give it 4 instead of 5 because the other stuff is just as good as his old gym 
5 0 Best Playmat a MUST for newborns I registered for this playmat not sure if our baby was going to like it but when I received it I thought it was bright and cheerful and the right size for our already cluttered living room When our son was 4 weeks old he started showing signs of interest in bright objects so we put him on the mat and were really surprised with the results he absolutely LOVES the mat He especially loves the musical star that can be moved around with the velcro straps and watches as it lights up in different areas Now he is almost 6 weeks and it has become a calming and interesting place to be when he gets fussy he will lay on his back and gaze at the mirror lights on the star and kick the birds and watch them move This mat is a must for baby registries and great for newborns to gain alertness Another reviewer did not like the rabbit card but it comes in a sleeve that will hold a 4x6 photo so we printed out a photo of my husband s college mascot because it is bright colored and put it in the sleeve You could also put a photo of mommy or daddy grandparents or a pet too Also you can add other toys to the rings when the baby gets bored with the birds bug rattle 
4 0 Bright and fun but no back padding The activity gym is nice and bright and happy Its only shortcoming is that the mat is a bit thin making it necessary to use a heavy blanket underneath if you re using it on hard floors surfaces 
5 0 very nice playmat We enjoy all of the Baby Einstein products This playmat has many toys I even added extra links to make them easier for my daughter to see and reach It is so colorful too It really seems to capture her attention Our 2 year old loves to hear the music while her sister is playing on the mat I think having this mat early on will help our baby make connections when she watches the Baby Einstein videos 
5 0 Best Mat EVER My 3 1 2 month old LOVES LOVES LOVES this playmat He s been rolling over since 11 weeks and I swear it s because of this mat and all there is to look at He loves the star and the red bird the most I highly recommend this to anyone looking for something to keep your baby happy and occupied 
5 0 Baby Einstein Excellent product Keeps baby amused from newborn to six months when there is not much for the baby to do It fascinates the baby but it does not overstimulate 
5 0 GREAT AFTER PREGNANCY This BILLY Blanks set is amazing Did I say it was amazing After giving birth in Feburary 13 2006 I am in great shape I am actually developing a six pack I am advanced and this workout is challenging Don t be deceived this is not for the faint of heart If you are one that whines this not your dvd Billy Blanks has really taken taebo to the next level I must warn you to count yourself Billy sometimes is off however this dvd is like Isaid amazing 
4 0 Addicted to it With the first workout I was INSTANTLY toned more muscular more defined and I LOVED it I have done all three of the DVDs included in this set a couple of times now and I am ALWAYS looking forward to doing them again I can t wait for the workout and the feeling my body gets after I ve done them I do wonder though will it really melt off the stubborn pudge from my hips stomach The answer is hidden somewhere I think in how doable the workouts are you re neither exhausted hurt nor left wanting do do more so I suppose it s just enough to eventually get those results with regular use Other people have written that muscle builds and fat melts so I will keep this up The cardio DVD is not included but I found it awesome to use an elliptical machine or speed walking to substitute for cardio work either before after or both when I do a Tae Bo DVD My body literally turned into a furnace and I could feel my metabolism was sky high Just be patient give your body rest days and do as much as you can from each DVD You ll be addicted too 
5 0 motivating workout I bought this DVD set at a warehouse store yesterday and I ve just finished the first workout There are some familiar moves from the original TAE BO tapes but these exercises are much more challenging The Billy Bands add resistance to the basic moves This allows you to get a strength cardio and flexibility workout in one The choreography is really simple so that even the least co ordinated people should be able to stay in step This is a very challenging workout and might be a little difficult for people who are not in shape If you are moderately fit you ll find this workout to be fun and very motivating According to my heart rate monitor this workout burned a little less than 700 calories so it will be a great substitute for a jog when the Seattle rain hampers my enthusiasm to exercise outdoors 
5 0 Still Purchased Despite Mixed Reviews Prior to getting this item I read the reviews and they were love it or hate it Thankfully I am one that loved it The workouts are HARD but you can tell that you are doing wonderful things to your body 
5 0 The Classic Cooler I own this cooler circa 1968 It is bombproof and looks like it survived a tour in Vietnam but we haul this bad boy out each summer because it does the job The cam lock on the lid keeps it from flying free if jarred or jostled this is a very good thing if you take it fishing and have your catch inside Construction is good enough to last near 40 years of use before considering a replacement It really will survive that many seasons of use which is more than you can say for many fragile thermoplastic knockoffs There are few camping or summertime essentials that can be universally adopted but the Coleman steel cooler has to be one Bring it on your next outing and even if you have boring cans of Diet Coke inside people will stop to check it out Fred 
5 0 It works as advertised As for the bad reviews This is not a million candlepower spotlight It s not even as bright as your standard quality 2D cell flashlight Yes you do have to expend some energy charging it IT S AN EMERGENCY FLASHLIGHT As advertised 1 1 2 minutes of shaking provides light that begins to fade out at 20 minutes but lasts up to 2 hours I ve found it useful for up to an hour between charges Initial light output is similar to battery powered LED keychain lights Just enough to safely make your way from the house to the shed to haul out the generator to change a tire or to read a book on those nights the power fails Living on the side of a mountain where we frequently lose power for days this is a cheap insurance policy I will never find I have no batteries or a dead bulb The only problem i have with this flashlight is the front lens is plastic and easily scratched but that s minor just use lens paper for cleaning if it needs it 
5 0 EASY TO SHAKE USE NICE EMERGENCY FLASHLIGHT This flashlight is simply awesome if you just have a little common sense This is meant to be an EMERGENCY flashlight and if you use it as such it is great This is definately not a spotlight type of light and it isn t meant to be But when you need some light in an emergency a little shaking and you have some light It s starting to dim Just shake it some more and voila more light You could be lost miles from anywhere and you know your batteries are not going to go dead on the walk for help I don t know why people are giving this bad reviews This is so easy my 6 year old niece can shake it and get it working And if you are smart enough to shake it like the instructions say the light will last longer then people on here are saying If my 6 year old niece can figure it out I would think that adults could too But there are always going to be people out there who complain about everything This is an emergency no battery SHAKE flashlight I think some people were expecting a flashlight that would shake itself You should keep one of these flashlights in your vehicles campers boats kids rooms etc How many times have you went to get a flashlight and the batteries were dead and you couldn t find new ones This one has worked everytime I have uesd it But then again I do have common sense This flashlight is Great 
4 0 Tastes great mixes easily I like this product for the great taste and I don t need a blender to mix it a shaker cup is all you need so it is very easy to get ready quickly I ve been using it for 2 weeks and have actually lost body fat so no complaints here started at 14 at 12 now Give it a try that is really the only way to tell for your yourself It s easy enough to adjust how thick you want your shake to be just add more water for a thinner drink 2 scoops in 10oz of water is thin and fluid my personal preference 
4 0 good product This is a really good product Being a gym owner and trainer in Southern Calif for over 20 years I ve seen and used a few products and this one ranks near the top Most of the fats are M C T s and are used for energy not to make it taste better Protein NEEDS fat to be properly utilized by the body The carbs and sugars are low which make this a true LEAN GAINER Keep your protein high your carbs moderate and get some good healthy fats like flax or fish oil and you ve got the diet to grow some muscle with 
5 0 Treadmill key review Product was exactly as advertised and was shipped in timely manner I m very satisfied 
4 0 Great product We bought this for our 4 year old son He loves playing with it and it has really helped him with coordination It is well built and I am sure will last a long time It did take two of us to put it together though 
5 0 THE BEST My boys LOVE all types of construction and farm toys This one is the best They can sit on it and dig dig dig It is a little pricey but well constructed and extremely worth the price A MUST We have had this toy for 8 months and if my 3 boys can t break it that in itself says quite a lot 
5 0 CAT fan My son is 5 years old and absolutly loves this digger It was easy to put togther and is very durable I would highly recommend it He also likes that it has tracks so he can sit on it and move it where he wants 
5 0 good for office work I bought this ball as an alternative to a regular office chair I am able to work on my abdominal muscles while surfing the web or other computer work It helps me to stay focused on the work and not get frustrated with not being able to move around It is exactly what I was looking for 
5 0 Great little scooter My kids just love this inexpensive little scooter We have another one at home which has been used for years We ve had other scooters but have found the Razor brand to be the most stable and reliable 
5 0 o man i wish this is a good scooter you have to admit but i used to have a viper brand scooter and it was fast but it got stolein i hate people who do that i wish i had my viper brand scooter back from 2000 i tryed to find it online but they dont sell any i wish i knew where my dad got it he died in 2001 ok i just wonder if they had it here but they dont o man 
5 0 Great product The ablounge 2 is great Easy to use and does not hurt my neck like regular sit ups Works great after 2 weeks of use already saw results THanks 
5 0 You definitely feel it This machine really makes you feel it I like the fact that it also stretches your back which feels great The only thing I can say is I wish it folded up for better storage but other than that I like it 
5 0 Good Workout Make sure you do other forms of exercise and good diet habits to compliment this I like using it when I m at home and don t feel like going to the gym I cardio running or something afterwards It s really effective if your form is correct 
5 0 A great place to run I have owned this device since June 2006 The device linclines from 0 12 degrees and provides speeds of up to 12 mph This tread mill gets up to speed and stop quickly but should not trip up most people There is no cool down cycle like on the systems at the club Also the pluse sensors in the hand grips take a while and some adjustment to get an accurate reading I plan on ordering the chest band monitor from the manufacture in hopes that will provide better feedback during my exercise routine 
5 0 A holiday saviour This is quite possibly the greatest thing since sliced bread other than sliced bread with the crusts removed of course I was in an difficult situation last year let me explain I for a long time have had a love for open spaces and the whole hiking and campology scene I am a regular purchaser of Hikers Monthly and own a mint condition copy of The Art Of Camp I ve been hiking in several places around Canada and the Rockies but for a long time I ve truly wished I could scale the heights of Everest or wander the mountain passes of the Pyrenees Well one day my opportunity came My friend who is part of the WCO World Camp Organisation called me up and asked me if I d be interested in a fortnight up the Pyrenees As you can imagine I nearly passed out in my two berth with excitement I was camping at the time I hurried home to pack as he said we needed to leave that weekend the problem came when I opened the door of my house I was met by Tchaikovsky my alsation NO I thought What am I supposed to do with Tchaikovsky There had been an unfortunate incident at the kennels earlier that year although the courts could prove nothing and Harold my neighbours Iguana had been harassed a little too much so I didn t like to ask I was feeling decidedly down when my friend rang me back When I had finished updating him on the situation he suggested I look for at the Mountainsmith Dog Backpack A little confused I looked on Amazon as he had suggested and as soon as I saw it I knew what he meant I ordered it straight away and it came within two days Thanks Amazon When I slipped it onto Tchaikovsky s back he went mad with delight and shot off round the garden barking at the trees and anything else he could find Friday soon came around and after Harold s funeral sadly he died of a heart attack but again nothing could be proven we were off We had an amazing time seeing the sites and climbing ridge after ridge Tchaikovsky carried the instant mash powder and my collection of David Bowie CDs + CD player in his saddle bags Not once did he wimper due to chafing and we took some great pictures of him in his little red bobble hat Thanks for making my holiday 
5 0 Mat is fine for my Boflex Ultimate 2 Bought 2 of these mats on Amazon s Friday sale about 5 months ago I paid 25 dollars a piece For 25 dollars they are well worth the price At their regular retail price 100 I think they are a bit over priced I am very pleased with the mats anyway 
5 0 Must have I am so glad amazon offered the Bowflex mat as a bonus item I have the bowflex set up in my familyroom which is newly carpeted and I was concerned about divets in the rug I have to say the mat is a big help 
4 0 Good Mat Just got my mat which was free with the Bowflex I bought and it is pretty nice Nothing special it is what it is a nice looking mat I don t see this thing ripping anytime soon And mine doesn t make the whole room smell like rubber like someone else commented But like I said mine was free I would never pay 90 for one of these 
5 0 Really functional mat Bought this to put under my exercise bike and protect the floor I ve found it to be sturdy yet it s really dense and thinner than you would think It doesn t have the cushion like feel of an exercise mat but rather is much firmer So far it has proveb to be a great surface for the bike and is also keeping my floor in good shape 
5 0 If you Need Finger Strength Control Endurance and Coordination you are in the Right Place Let me start saying that this is a wonderful product Small light and well constructed they feel like they will last forever You can carry them with you allowing to workout your fingers at the office at home or wherever you find suitable I bought the four different color coded gripmasters Black heavy Red medium Blue light and Yellow extra light I only found the resistance of the red and black ones useful for me but my wife loves the blue and yellow ones It was a great buy because of their high quality and affordable price The product comes with a foldable instruction booklet where you find details for six different exercises Trigger pinch This one simulates the movement of squeezing a trigger and it isolates the index finger for enhanced strength and coordination Gross grasp This one strengthens fingers thumb wrist and forearm for a firm grip Hook position This one strengthens longer muscles in forearm and wrist while stretching smaller muscles in hand for greater motion and endurance Tip to tip pinch This exercise strengthens specific fingers thumb smaller hand muscles and forearm for greater control and endurance Wrist flexion It strengthens wrist and forearm muscles Key pinch Strengthens thumb and index finger for greater stability and coordination At the gripmaster website you can find more exercises for different activities and sports If you are looking to crush hands when handshaking this is not the product for you but if you need finger strength control endurance and coordination you are in the right place 
5 0 Miniature Finger Gym Play Guitar Better Our daughter took up guitar about 6 months ago It took her about forever to master the pesky F chord Her teacher noticed she was developing the bad habit of holding her third finger on top of the pinky finger to get it to hold down the strings Just not enough strength in that pinky finger says the teacher Enter Gripmaster Finger Exerciser Works like a charm And hey her basketball dribble is stronger now too The kids at school are jealous they think it s cool her bright yellow contraption Rock on Gripmaster 
5 0 exercise ball This is a great exercise ball It is great in helping your body tone up by balancing yourself using the ball with various floor routines Let me tell you It is very hard to balance yourself on this ball and I can really feel my muscles working out It helps strengthen your muscles and gives you better balance and flexibility this is a great product 
5 0 Nice package ball and pump The last ball I had requirted the bicycle pump to fill it I m just too lazy to run out and find the bike pump every time I need a little more air The pump that comes with this ball doubles for filling other things too At my kids birthday party I used it to fill some inflatable decorations and I ve used it to fill an air mattress So two things the ball is easily inflated and the pump is handy 
5 0 Great Product Great product I just received my ball today I couldn t wait to work out If I learn how to stay on it that would be saying something I will always recommend Max Fitness 
5 0 Great Product for a Great Price I train people for a living and have sent all of my clients to this seller for their exercise balls Being one that works with different sized people on a daily basis on the Max Fitness balls I can tell you that they provide a great product and they are very fast to get it to my clients I own one myself Thanks for the great product and service Jason 
5 0 Best and Easiest Treadmill Lube I use my treadmill 4 times a week and noticed that their was friction building up I tried silicone from an auto parts store but the odor was unbearable and later learned that their are propellants in the aerosol cans that actually cause more harm than good I came across the LifeSpan treadmill lube as I was looking for a product that was 100 silicone It is easy to apply and I felt immediate results I also like the fact that it provides me with a 1 year supply 
5 0 awesome golf exercise second best exercise for lengthing your golf drives improves club head speed very nicely If you are wondering 1 is pulldowns for the lats 
5 0 excellent product it was better than i expected it to be very easy to us 
4 0 Incline This is a very good product for the cost but if it has the ability to be flat I can t figure it out It is always on a constant incline when there are times I d like it to be flat 
4 0 good deal I bought this to replace an electric treadmill that was too big for my space I am happy with the treadmill because it is portable and stores easily It is necessary to keep the belt oiled underneath in order to walk without much friction That has not been a problem though The only drawback is that I am not comfortable walking without holding onto the siderails It is more difficult to control the speed by simply walking with arms swinging or holding a book to read as I did with my electric treadmill All in all however it has been worth the time and money spent for the treadmill I can easily move it from room to room and put it away when done 
4 0 Yes I would buy it again This machine is a great buy for the price It was simple to put together doesn t take up much room and is easy to use There is just a little noise when you are walking but nothing the TV can t drown out 
5 0 For More than Just Playing the Guitar I recently decided to try and teach myself guitar after having stopped for a while One of the suggestions i got was to get a Gripmaster and when i checked it out I found this gizmo could actually help in more ways than just strengthening my fingers I ordered one and I can definitely say it was a good investment There s a big difference in my grip now I can even crack a nut with one hand easily using a nutcracker of course I can t wait to try the 7 lb one

5 0 Great Product + Great Price = Great Way to Work Your Hands Forearms I recently purchased a pair of the Gripmaster Hand Finger Exercisers in order to help build forearm strength As I was unsure which tension would be appropriate I bought one each of the Light Blue 5 lbs tension and Medium Red 7 lbs tension grips I ve had them for a little more than a week now and I just love love love them Perhaps that s a little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up for exercise accessories but I really do enjoy the grips I leave one out on my desk at all times and get in a little work here and there when I stop to read a document or whatnot The Gripmaster Exercisers are different from conventional grips in that you can either work your entire hand at once or each finger individually great for guitar players I ve heard One side features four small levers each with its own spring that can be squeezed together or one at a time The plastic on the flip side is molded together so that you can work your whole hand as one unit The black rubber cushion is removable and you can place it on either side of the grip It s an awesome idea and allows for maximum versatility Just for reference I m a female in relatively good shape but with painfully little forearm strength my biceps are huge from years of Tae Bo though The 7 lb Medium Red grip is do able but challenging The 5 lb Light Blue grip on the other hand makes for a much easier workout I oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things and I only feel it after a number of reps If you re a female and not in great shape you ll want to start out with the Light Blue grips or even the Extra Light Yellow ones and work your way up Out of shape guys can probably get away with the Medium Red ones to start If you ve got good hand wrist forearm strength don t even both with the lighter tensions skip ahead to the Medium Red or Heavy Black Although I ve only owned my Gripmasters for a week or two and can t personally vouch for their durability they do seem sturdy and well crafted My fianc s brother an amateur boxer and guitar player used his for years without a problem so I have faith that I ll be squeezing these babies well into 2015 Kelly Garbato Couch Potato Turned Fitness Fanati 
5 0 pedometer these are the third and fourth ones I have ordered for family and friends I love it It is not fancy but that s not what I wanted They got here in record time and work perfectly 
4 0 Little Cheap and Easy I often walk to the store or post office and was curious about how far I was walking so when I saw how inexpensive this pedometer was I decided that it would be fun to try and that I wouldn t really be out anything if it didn t work or if I didn t use it It counts steps very accurately The first day I used it I counted my steps myself and would check every one hundred steps it was right on It s not as accurate as far as measuring distance but I know that s my own error in setting the stride length My pace and stride length vary as I go so I m still working on finding an average If you re looking for a simple pedometer for a good price I recommend this product 
4 0 Sportline 340 Strider Pedometer I received my Sportline 340 Strider Pedometer and have been utilizing it at every advantage it keeps wonderful count of your steps and does not give you false reading as many others have The numbers are quite viewable 
5 0 I m so pleased I love my treadmill My son put it together for me and he had no trouble I love all the options on this treadmill I use only the basic so far but I can see the benefit in having the pre programmed workouts I can t wait to get there to try it It s hard to say enough about this machine It s a great MACHINE 
4 0 Good choice I received this from my husband as a birthday present It figures he was going to get something with the name IronMan =P I ve only used it for a week but I think we re going to have a long and happy relationship Tho I ve found my husband using it more then I am Its easy to fold up which is important as I m not the strongest woman in the world But I leave it out as I know that if it s folded and put away I probably won t use it However this sucker looks so cool that I really have no desire to put it in the closet Everything on it is convinent with one exception They made the display easy to see but it blocks the TV LOL One star off for that =

4 0 Great machine for the money I wanted a full featured treadmill for a reasonable price I got it and more with the Ironman 220t It is easy to use and the controls are accessible Smooth running and quiet I have used it for over 4 months and find it to be a great asset to my daily workout routine 
5 0 Info about scopes 4x20 = 4X magnification x 20mm diameter objective lens the end closest to the target Included rings mount to 3 8 Dovetail grooves on 22 caliber rifles Owners manual should list what kind of ring mount base is on the rifle or air gun you want to put a scope on There are bases and rings made for just about every combination possible And conversion bases to change from one type to another At the ranges possible with an air gun 4X is sufficient The higher the magnification the smaller the area field of view that you can see thru the scope For comparison 4X is used extensively by deer hunters in wooded situations and some consider that too high For moving targets and less than 100 yard ranges 4X will work great Also Nitrogen filled prevents internal fogging and is a feature usually used on much more expensive scopes 
5 0 Good workout The heavy tension Gripmaster provides a great workout for the fingers and wrists The average person may want to start with the medium Gripmaster to get up to speed about a month of daily use But for people involved in daily wrist finger activities Martial Arts guitarists etc you probably could plunge right in with the heavy tension with no problem 
5 0 Good Product I purchased both the 7 lbs and 9 lbs tension units and I m extremely satisfied with both models Both models allow for independent work on particular fingers or your grip as a whole My hand strength which had been decreasing a bit as I age has returned very quickly as has increased freedom of movement through fingers Whichever level of tension you choose I m sure you will be satisfied with the Gripmaster 
5 0 Great exercise Comfortable in my hand and with a variety of exercises I find it a great thing to have at my desk to use periodically during the day 
5 0 If you Need Finger Strength Control Endurance and Coordination you are in the Right Place Let me start saying that this is a wonderful product Small light and well constructed they feel like they will last forever You can carry them with you allowing to workout your fingers at the office at home or wherever you find suitable I bought the four different color coded gripmasters Black heavy Red medium Blue light and Yellow extra light I only found the resistance of the red and black ones useful for me but my wife loves the blue and yellow ones It was a great buy because of their high quality and affordable price The product comes with a foldable instruction booklet where you find details for six different exercises Trigger pinch This one simulates the movement of squeezing a trigger and it isolates the index finger for enhanced strength and coordination Gross grasp This one strengthens fingers thumb wrist and forearm for a firm grip Hook position This one strengthens longer muscles in forearm and wrist while stretching smaller muscles in hand for greater motion and endurance Tip to tip pinch This exercise strengthens specific fingers thumb smaller hand muscles and forearm for greater control and endurance Wrist flexion It strengthens wrist and forearm muscles Key pinch Strengthens thumb and index finger for greater stability and coordination At the gripmaster website you can find more exercises for different activities and sports If you are looking to crush hands when handshaking this is not the product for you but if you need finger strength control endurance and coordination you are in the right place 
5 0 Love It I bought the red medium tension and it s a good beginner challenge for most It looks like a little instrument of torture but I love it I am a 50 something woman who is an advanced beginner guitar player and it s helping tremendously plus there is something about having hand and finger strength that makes all your everyday chores easier such as typing this recommendation Also great for stress 
5 0 Doctor Ogre I love this product In Fact I own two and not because I use two at the time I don t I just like to have a spare First off this is the only gripper that allows you to exercise each finger individually Second it is one of the very few that exercise the thumb individually Third despite all of this it is very compact I put it in my pocket and get most or all of the exercises on it done at work Fourth it offers a variety of exercises Definitely a good value for your money 
5 0 Good challenge for fingers and hands I originally bought the Blue 5 lb Red 7 lb and the Black 9 lb Gripmasters for my 14 year old boys The Blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger The Blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so I ended inherited it It is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light this makes it good for use anytime anywhere I have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever If I had to do it again I would have probably not bought the Blue unless you have a very light grip probably have started with the Red I started to use the Red and the Black The Red is just right for me challenging for the fingers and I am working my way to use the Black consistently Although it doesn t seem like it at first the Black is challenging for the hand and fingers and will give a good workout Just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping the challenge is working out the fingers It is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers It has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts Great product excellent for finger or hand exercise good quality Also bought from DMM Products great price fast shipping 
5 0 Start lighter The gripmaster is very well made I was impressed by the high quality I have played guitar for many years but I found the heavy tension to much for me to start I ordered the medium tension and am working my way into the heavy It s doing many reps that is the key to hand strengh not moving heavy tension I really like the gripmaster 
5 0 Heavy Tension Black is better for men I bought both the Medium and Heavy tension Gripmasters The Medium red one is not much of a challenge for me I m a man of average build and I actually bought these because I was starting weight training at the gym and I wanted more grip strength for my hands and stronger forearms I d say if you are looking for individual finger strength such as for playing an instrument then the red Gripmaster might be enough resistance But I use the black one much more for whole hand strength The product comes with a guide containing instructions on a variety of exercises I would also recommend visiting Gripmaster s website as they have a more complete list of exercises and recommendations for different sports 
5 0 Radical Rifle I cannot say that I have had many Crosman products that I liked Granted they were purchased at Walmart for under 50 and not the best Crosman had to offer I had always been curious about their higher end products but was nervous about spending more money on something that might not be any better than the cheap stuff at wally world I found this rifle at Pyramid Arms online for 99 00 I read the description and my interest was perked The cool design semi automatic and airsource fuel intrigued me I decided what the hell and ordered it The rifle came with 4 clips and 1 Airsource tank I had ordered Crosman wad cutter pellets for it and 4 additional clips from Pyramid My son and I loaded the clips and went out in the back yard to see what she would do Our target was a GIANT Tide laundry detergent bottle We sat about 70 feet from the target and opened fire I was truly impressed The wad cutters went clean through the Tide bottle and were stuck in the concrete block behind it The accuracy was extremely good No recoil Very Very Very slight pressure drop when going nuts on the trigger We shot a total of 16 12 shot clips on one Airsource tank at 50 degrees This was less than what the box said it would shot on one tank but the performance of the rifle was so impressive that I won t hold it against Crosman Points that I liked Very good weight and balance Not plagued by massive pressured drop from tank freezing Anyone who has shot a CO2 pistol that uses the old small cartridges will know exactly what I m talking about here Semi Automatic New Mowhawk sights Dove tail for scope mounting Will need high mount scope rings to clear open sights Rugged construction Evil styling At night this thing would make most men drop the chilupa Points that would improve this rifle A way to shut off and remove the Airsource tank without wasting unused CO2 A last shot bolt open feature When it s out of ammo the bolt should stay open like a SKS or AK47 A little more room to insert and remove the clips Inserting a clip can be trying I have to say that this is the most impressive Crosman I have ever owned It is EXTREMELY fun to shoot Crosman hit a home run with this one Kids will need the supervision of an adult while operating this Unless you want to be paying for broken windshields dented fenders dead animals or like wise events of mayhem 
4 0 Crosman Nightstalker Review Good Points Great sight design No pumping Built To last Bad Points Picky about the pellets you feed it No airsouce CO2 shutoff valve included and the manual states that you shouldn t store the rifle with an airsource cartridge attached to it if you follow the manual you could end up wasting a lot of CO2 if you have to remove a partially used cartridge when you re finished shooting It only gets about 200 shots per cartridge unlike the advertised 350 shots General Comments I purchased a Crosman Nightstalker air rifle several weeks ago for about 110 The Nightstalker is solid and shoots well The sight on the gun are very well made and allow for extreem acuracy I ve shot approximately 1 000 shots through the Nightstalker thus far experimenting with several types of pellets in an attempt to wring out as much accuracy as I can With the rifle supported the best 5 shot group I ve shot so far at 30 feet could be completely covered by a dime and at 60 feet a quarter It seems to be somewhat finicky about the pellets I feed it here is my summary on pellets I ve tried in order of increasing accuracy Beeman Crow Magnum very poor accuracy pellets tumbled and groups were by far the worst of all pellets tried Daisy Flat Nosed Pellets wadcutters below average accuracy Daisy Pointed Field Pellets below average accuracy RWS Superpoints Extra average accuracy Benjamin Domed Pellets above average accuracy I expected this pellet to do better considering it is what the 392 s manual recommends Crosman Copperhead Pointed above average accuracy Crosman Copperhead Wadcutters very good accuracy Gamo Hunter very good accuracy I have encountered a few jams but they were easily fixed Although I ve only owned the rifle several for serveral weeks so far I am extremely satisfied with the Nightstalker 
5 0 Very nice machine After much deliberation and self debate I bought this bike from someone other than Amazon I spend about 2 months doing research then needed the immediate satisfaction that comes from purchasing from a walk in store I ve had it since right after thanksgiving and think it s one of the better purchases I ve made It seems that with the fan type exercise bike you get fewer bells and whistles but more strength and reliability I ve had one treadmill and one fancy exercise bike die after just a few months While this machine doesn t play music or show me videos that try to make me believe I m riding through the French country side it does feel like it might just last forever 
5 0 Good place to start I purchased both the medium and high tension Gripmasters For the average person the medium does not present too great a challenge however it is a good place to start Every day activity does not provide the mobility or range of motion that the medium will give you After a month of daily use you will be more than ready to move up to the high tension Gripmaster and not experience frustration that may lead you to quit 
5 0 Very Good Products I purchased both the 7 lbs and 9 lbs tension units and I m extremely satisfied with both models Both models allow for independent work on particular fingers or your grip as a whole My hand strength which had been decreasing a bit as I age has returned very quickly as has increased freedom of movement through fingers Whichever level of tension you choose I m sure you will be satisfied with the Gripmaster

4 0 Simple but good I like a lot is easy to use exercise your fingers individualy 
4 0 Heavy Tension Black is better for men I bought both the Medium and Heavy tension Gripmasters The Medium red one is not much of a challenge for me I m a man of average build and I actually bought these because I was starting weight training at the gym and I wanted more grip strength for my hands and stronger forearms I d say if you are looking for individual finger strength such as for playing an instrument then the red Gripmaster might be enough resistance But I use the black one much more for whole hand strength The product comes with a guide containing instructions on a variety of exercises I would also recommend visiting Gripmaster s website as they have a more complete list of exercises and recommendations for different sports 
5 0 Great tool for horseback riders The gripmaster has helped me strengthen my left fingers which is so important in the use of my reins when riding I took it with me on vacation to Florida and two of my friends one older who wanted to use it for arthritic hands and the other just for stiff joints saw it started using it and loved it So I ordered two more 
4 0 does the job Initially I had some trouble figuring out the right port to use But now it works and I ve used it constantly for at least 2 years 
5 0 Great Bike The bike arrived in 6 days Our shipment was from UPS Great service No damage during shipment 
4 0 Exercycle This is a good recumbent exercise bike The heart rate monitor is a little inconsistent and you have to hold the sensors firmly But it is solid and works well 
4 0 Purchase assembly and performance First off you can find this price lots of places It is probably the minimum sale price allowed by schwinn I choose to buy mine through AMAZON becasue I got 3 back with my visa free delivery and didn t pay sales tax That made up for most of the cost difference between the 212 and the 213 I wanted the extra programs Delivery was smooth except they had to come back once for me to sign for the delivery No problems with the packaging in our case Assembly took about an hour and a half It was pretty simple and the tools you need were included which was nice Overall this assembly was much easier than most things I have put together The bike is stable quiet and smooth Easy to ride and easy to adjust between the big guy and the little woman Overall we are very pleased and look forward to years of use I didn t rate this a 5 cause we ve only had ours a week 
5 0 Awsome I was a little standoffish about it at first because I did not know what I needed This bike is great I have no idea why anyone would buy anything else I have seen bikes like this go for 3k and I have no idea why as this bike does it all It is awsome Feels great and is almost silent Great purchase I am going to try out a schwin eliptical machine next probably 
5 0 Great Bike and good delivery I did read all the reviews and was afraid something bad could happen during delivery My fears proved wrong I received a heavy package not damage with all contents inside The bike is working well and it is really a great exercise bike 
5 0 exercise bike My physician told me to exercise or else so I looked at Comsumer Reports and listened to friends who spoke of a recumbent bike Amazon s price was great and I have been delighted If you like to read and exercise this one s for you 
4 0 More poor packaging Just as others have reported the bike ordered arrived in a box that was beaten up and full of very large holes Looking into the holes there was no sign of packing material but there was sign of damage to the bike The driver making the delivery handed over the paperwork to sign at the same time saying I wouldn t accept delivery of this Needless to say delivery was refused A replacement bike will be coming I m told by Amazon I wonder what the odds are that this bike will arrive in the same condition 
4 0 I love it Wow it s not often a person gets excited about exercise equipment but my Schwinn 213 Recumbent bike arrived today I have read several reviews about the condition of the box when it arrives My bike arrived in a timely manner The box had taken a minimal amount of abuse and was mostly intact Nothing inside was broken scratched or bent The instructions were crystal clear It only took me about 30 minutes to have it up and running The hardware comes vacuum sealed onto a piece of cardboard and clearly labeled The hardware for step 1 is labeled step 1 etc I have never assembled anything with the ease in which this went together It is a solidly built piece of equipment I only tried it out for a few minutes but it is quiet pedals smoothly and has a ton of features Ok now for the things I don t like the list is small but worth noting The fan and digital display is not angled enough for you to get any benefit from the fan nor can you read the display Only if you are very short and have to sit close to the screen can you read it with ease I am 5 10 and the fan does not adjust to blow on me I can just barely read the display from where I have to sit A book holder would have been nice That is it The things I like far outweigh the things I don t It comes with 10 pre programmed routines manual mode timed trials etc You can even input how many calories you want to burn and it will count down the calories instead of minutes I haven t used all the features but so far I am thrilled to death with my purchase and despite some of the negative things about it I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable way to exercise 10 15 06 Ok I ve had this for a week now and I want to shout from the rooftops how comfortable and great it is I solved my problem of not being able to read the screen very well but taking a crow bar and GENTLY prying up on the top edge of the metal plate that the read out screen is attached to Take the electronic screen off before doing this The plate bent up just enough that now I can read the screen just fine I still don t get much benefit from the fan but the fan doesn t really blow hard enough anyway I have tried out the easiest program and it is amazing I can t begin to say enough about this bike If you truly hate exercising this is the bike for you Schwinn has taken an activity some of us dread and has transformed it into something I don t mind doing I am using this bike along with the Weider Crossbow another piece of equipment I can t rave enough about as my total body workout I hope to be slimmer trimmer and stronger 6 8 weeks from now Also I want to mention again how quiet this bike is while operating When I used a treadmill I had to either blast the television if I wanted to hear it or use headphones which were uncomfortable once I started sweating This bike is so quiet you can have the television or stereo at a normal volume If you are interested in an exercise bike that is comfortable and versatile this is the bike for you 
4 0 He loves the star My 3 month old was bored with his current play gym While at a friends house he fell in love with the activity star that this gym included I went home and ordered it right away We now carry the star wherever we go I give it 4 instead of 5 because the other stuff is just as good as his old gym 
5 0 Best Playmat a MUST for newborns I registered for this playmat not sure if our baby was going to like it but when I received it I thought it was bright and cheerful and the right size for our already cluttered living room When our son was 4 weeks old he started showing signs of interest in bright objects so we put him on the mat and were really surprised with the results he absolutely LOVES the mat He especially loves the musical star that can be moved around with the velcro straps and watches as it lights up in different areas Now he is almost 6 weeks and it has become a calming and interesting place to be when he gets fussy he will lay on his back and gaze at the mirror lights on the star and kick the birds and watch them move This mat is a must for baby registries and great for newborns to gain alertness Another reviewer did not like the rabbit card but it comes in a sleeve that will hold a 4x6 photo so we printed out a photo of my husband s college mascot because it is bright colored and put it in the sleeve You could also put a photo of mommy or daddy grandparents or a pet too Also you can add other toys to the rings when the baby gets bored with the birds bug rattle 
4 0 Bright and fun but no back padding The activity gym is nice and bright and happy Its only shortcoming is that the mat is a bit thin making it necessary to use a heavy blanket underneath if you re using it on hard floors surfaces 
5 0 very nice playmat We enjoy all of the Baby Einstein products This playmat has many toys I even added extra links to make them easier for my daughter to see and reach It is so colorful too It really seems to capture her attention Our 2 year old loves to hear the music while her sister is playing on the mat I think having this mat early on will help our baby make connections when she watches the Baby Einstein videos 
5 0 Best Mat EVER My 3 1 2 month old LOVES LOVES LOVES this playmat He s been rolling over since 11 weeks and I swear it s because of this mat and all there is to look at He loves the star and the red bird the most I highly recommend this to anyone looking for something to keep your baby happy and occupied 
5 0 Baby Einstein Excellent product Keeps baby amused from newborn to six months when there is not much for the baby to do It fascinates the baby but it does not overstimulate 
5 0 GREAT AFTER PREGNANCY This BILLY Blanks set is amazing Did I say it was amazing After giving birth in Feburary 13 2006 I am in great shape I am actually developing a six pack I am advanced and this workout is challenging Don t be deceived this is not for the faint of heart If you are one that whines this not your dvd Billy Blanks has really taken taebo to the next level I must warn you to count yourself Billy sometimes is off however this dvd is like Isaid amazing 
4 0 Addicted to it With the first workout I was INSTANTLY toned more muscular more defined and I LOVED it I have done all three of the DVDs included in this set a couple of times now and I am ALWAYS looking forward to doing them again I can t wait for the workout and the feeling my body gets after I ve done them I do wonder though will it really melt off the stubborn pudge from my hips stomach The answer is hidden somewhere I think in how doable the workouts are you re neither exhausted hurt nor left wanting do do more so I suppose it s just enough to eventually get those results with regular use Other people have written that muscle builds and fat melts so I will keep this up The cardio DVD is not included but I found it awesome to use an elliptical machine or speed walking to substitute for cardio work either before after or both when I do a Tae Bo DVD My body literally turned into a furnace and I could feel my metabolism was sky high Just be patient give your body rest days and do as much as you can from each DVD You ll be addicted too 
4 0 Very intense workout I love these workouts They are very intense and the results are almost immediate however this series is not for beginners The best part of these workouts is your left feeling it for at least a day My only complaints with this series were the lack of attention Billy paid to the lower half of the body and the bands are sometimes cumbersome to use with certain moves All in all this was a great purchase for me I will probably purchase the new Bootcamp elite series 
1 0 Warning Order from Amazon Don t order from the official website Billy is great full of energy and enthusiam I get great results from his workout much better than any other instructor My family get great results from his workout His customer service rep were helpful HOWEVER I strongly strongly recommend ordering your Taebo products through Amazon I ve been doing business with Amazon many years and have placed over 150 orders I never never once had any problems with my orders at Amazon When I had questions it s amazing at not only how quick Amazon will reply but will give a long thorough and kind explanation Because they reply within a day and take so much time with the response it shows they truly care for you and want to give you the best service possible I ve never found customer service of this very high and rare quality In November of 2005 after ordering the Billy Bands from the official Billy Bank s website I was sent a package without my permission from the company that contained Billy s energy formula supplements It was a 14 day delayed bill for 31 85 I was upset this was sent without me knowing but here s the worse part I contacted customer service a gentleman told me don t worry you haven t been billed just send us back the package and we ll credit you 5 into your account for the shipping packaging and mailing cost you pay out of your own pocket to have the items sent back Within a few days I send the product I never requested back Twice by phone and once by email from 3 different cust rep I was told I would receive a 5 credit to my bank account within 7 to 10 days I was already upset about this matter but it wasn t that big of a concern However about 2 weeks well over 10 days I never received the 5 credit to my account But there was a charge taken from their company without my permisson or authorization from my own personal bank account for 8 97 A few days later the 8 97 was put back into my account When I contacted the company this is their reply Thank you for your recent e mail We apologize for the inconvenience Our records show that your vitamin shipment was on a 14 day delay billing cycle I sent the item I never wanted back in 7 days not over the 14 day limit This means that when the charges actually went through you were only charged for a small portion of the amount that showed on the invoice I kept the copy and nowhere on the invoice is this stated You received a credit for the shipping and handling plus 5 00 dollars to ship it back too This means when the charge for the vitamins actually went through you were only charged for 8 97 This is also the refund that you have received the amount paid again since the item was sent back within 14 days I shouldn t have been charged and nowhere on the invoice is this stated that I would only be charged a small portion So basically they sent me a product I never requested Told me they would give me some money to have the product sent back Took money from my bank account without me knowing and paid me back with my own money they stolen To sum it up do business with Amazon 
5 0 Still Purchased Despite Mixed Reviews Prior to getting this item I read the reviews and they were love it or hate it Thankfully I am one that loved it The workouts are HARD but you can tell that you are doing wonderful things to your body 
5 0 Sturdy and steady mat High quality exercise equipment mat Wipes off well and helps keep bike steady 
4 0 Pretty Funny ^ I got a few great chuckles out of this thing Just get s kinda grossweird using it over nad over again But a great one no matter 
4 0 scared me it does what it promises i nearly fell over when my boyfriend let this surprise for me he needed a little bit of tape in addition to the suction cups but worth getting can work well for keeping pets out of the toilet as well 
2 0 NOT REAL I thought this would be an actual toilet monster and was happy to see such a low price It is however made out of rubber and can not actually eat people 
5 0 The Classic Cooler I own this cooler circa 1968 It is bombproof and looks like it survived a tour in Vietnam but we haul this bad boy out each summer because it does the job The cam lock on the lid keeps it from flying free if jarred or jostled this is a very good thing if you take it fishing and have your catch inside Construction is good enough to last near 40 years of use before considering a replacement It really will survive that many seasons of use which is more than you can say for many fragile thermoplastic knockoffs There are few camping or summertime essentials that can be universally adopted but the Coleman steel cooler has to be one Bring it on your next outing and even if you have boring cans of Diet Coke inside people will stop to check it out Fred 
5 0 Very Happy Good product Great deal for the price Based on prior reviews I ordered the Medium size for my 100 lb German Shepherd and it fits great I put 2 water bottles in each pocket to help burn fat she needs to lose some weight I m going to order the Small size for my 70 lb German Shepherd to help her burn some of her energy She wore the Medium size on our walk today and it help focus her she tends to be all over the place The medium size works but I think the small would be ideal 
5 0 Dog Back Pack Arrived quickly and was EXACTLY what we wanted we are very satisfied with the product and the process 
5 0 It s better to light a candle than to curse the darkness I write a lot of reviews on books but seldom write one on a product However I feel like breaking my trend by reviewing this lite I like I suppose just about everyone else keep looking for the lite that is right for all people for all purposes If It exists I haven t seen it yet The plain ordinary battery flashlight has remained essentially the same since I got my first as a kid 60 years ago They often fail you when they are needed batteries are expensive but overall they serve a purpose About 50 years ago a hand held magneto lite appeared As long as you kept squeezing it it gave a light comparable to a normal flashlght It was similar to a lite sold for use on a bicycle where it was powered by the turning of the wheel However as soon as the bicycle stopped the light went out For some reason they disappeared off the market A few years ago a new almost similar magneto lite appeared The biggest difference is it made a lot of noise when squeezed They don t appear to have been very popular This Faraday principle Lite has been made very popular due to TV ads More because what they don t say than what they do say many people are disappointed upon getting one The ad flouts the idea that it can be seen for up to a mile So what we learned in the military that a lit cigarette can be seen hundreds of yards away at night So if that s not you were looking for it is meaningless to you In fact it is very poor at casting light on a suface more than a few feet away For this purpose it can t begin to compete with a normal flashlight and if that s what you want forget it As a matter of fact those little LED keychain lites can do just as much and can be picked up for a buck at the Dollar Stores They last for a couple of years weigh next to nothing and you ll always have one with you I Leave them around the house and they are handy to look for something in a dark spot or for the occasional time you need to find a circuit breaker panel or find your way in a power failure These lites are so weak you can t assume they will meet your expectations in a store or from watching a TV ad My advice is try and compare with a Key Chain lite one might serve you as well as the other at a huge difference in cost 
5 0 It works as advertised As for the bad reviews This is not a million candlepower spotlight It s not even as bright as your standard quality 2D cell flashlight Yes you do have to expend some energy charging it IT S AN EMERGENCY FLASHLIGHT As advertised 1 1 2 minutes of shaking provides light that begins to fade out at 20 minutes but lasts up to 2 hours I ve found it useful for up to an hour between charges Initial light output is similar to battery powered LED keychain lights Just enough to safely make your way from the house to the shed to haul out the generator to change a tire or to read a book on those nights the power fails Living on the side of a mountain where we frequently lose power for days this is a cheap insurance policy I will never find I have no batteries or a dead bulb The only problem i have with this flashlight is the front lens is plastic and easily scratched but that s minor just use lens paper for cleaning if it needs it 
5 0 Cytosport Vanilla Muscle Milk Fantastic product I am a group fitness instructor and I use this product everyday I add a banana peanut or cashew butter plain yogurt ice and water this is in lieu of dinner I don t get hungry and it really keeps my energy levels up 
4 0 Tastes great mixes easily I like this product for the great taste and I don t need a blender to mix it a shaker cup is all you need so it is very easy to get ready quickly I ve been using it for 2 weeks and have actually lost body fat so no complaints here started at 14 at 12 now Give it a try that is really the only way to tell for your yourself It s easy enough to adjust how thick you want your shake to be just add more water for a thinner drink 2 scoops in 10oz of water is thin and fluid my personal preference 
4 0 good product This is a really good product Being a gym owner and trainer in Southern Calif for over 20 years I ve seen and used a few products and this one ranks near the top Most of the fats are M C T s and are used for energy not to make it taste better Protein NEEDS fat to be properly utilized by the body The carbs and sugars are low which make this a true LEAN GAINER Keep your protein high your carbs moderate and get some good healthy fats like flax or fish oil and you ve got the diet to grow some muscle with 
4 0 Pretty good rack I didn t find any of the fabrication problems seen with other reviewers The rack seems well built and sturdy and I don t see any real issues with it My only complaints would be the assembly instructions which are pretty vague and require an inordinate amount of interpretation and the fact that the hardware dimensions with the product don t really facilitate setting it up as they ve illustrated Specifically the bikes shown in the photos must be VERY small in order to be both mounted on the bottom length of the rack Using the mounting holes on the top section required if you ve got two adult bikes require staggering the brackets as opposed to setting them on a straight horizontal line It s just a bit confusing and given the cost of the things I m mounting on it I don t want to have any confusion 
5 0 Perfect Travel Size This pillow is small and compact It is just the right size for traveling and camping and it stays fluffed through the night 
4 0 Great small pillow I have the small size pillow mainly because I didn t realize it was a small when I bought it We recently went on a road trip camping trip last week and this came in very handy While it is too small for me to use as a sleeping pillow at night it is great for in the car or on a plane I kept falling asleep in the car and it was very comfy You just have to give it a good 10 20 minutes to fluff up after you unwrap it then it s nice and fluffy comfy If you were going to get a camping pillow to use at night I d recommend that you spring for the larger one A bit pricy but worth it 
5 0 Best Tasting Protein Around by Far I had Gastric Bypass surgery on Oct 06 so I ve been through many protein drinks This one is by far the best tasting I ve had Very smooth mixes very easy and no after taste You can t beat it 
5 0 Great Bike Trunk This trunk bag works SO well I commute by bike and this bag is so easy on and off It holds all of my stuff and lunch besides Great design roomier than it looks and good looking besides it s perfect 
5 0 Excellent value Go Diego Go 16 Inch Bike The Go Diego Go 16 Inch Bike is a very well engineered and finished product that is made with high quality materials The only problem that I had during DIY assembly was to obtain the allen hex driver key that is required to fix the steering handle bar Manufacturer could include an allen hex driver key in the kit of accessory parts 
5 0 REVIEW OF GO DIEGO GO 16INCH BIKE I RECIEVED MY PRODUCT IN RECORD TIME AND I WAS VERY PLEASED THAT THE ASSEMBLY WAS QUICK AND SIMPLE JUST LIKE THE BOX SAID I WAS SO PLEASED THAT I PURCHASED ANOTHER DIEGO BIKE AND A DORA BIKE 
5 0 Nice It was so easy to assemble it Perfect for my son very nice 
4 0 Go Diego Go Fans Look Here This was a wonderful buy that my son just loves It s well built since he s a big boy and a little tough on things so he needs sturdy toys I would recommend this to other Diego fans The only thing missing is reflectors but those were easy to purchase 
4 0 Diego s Kids Bike Very nice bike especially at the sale price It has a warning inside the box This product contains products known in the state of california to cause cancer Not sure what they are referring to This is the second toy I see it on Perhaps someone can shed some light 
4 0 ramp The ramp was a litte smaller than anticipated however it is great starter ramp Just the right size for my little man to practice his jumps with his bike scooter and skateboard 
4 0 good beginner ramp my son loves this ramp its small enough to learn the tricks he wants to learn but not so small as to be easy to break 
4 0 Works well so far I m using this with a mountain bike that has a standard bolt and nut non quick release skewer rear axle and a slick tire on the rear wheel It works quite well with this setup It was easy to get the bike on the trainer and locked in place and was fairly easy to adjust the resistance roller a little to the left to line it up with the bike s tire The trainer is very quiet compared to my old squirrel cage fan based trainer It gives a fairly realistic road resistance feel It is very solid and stable and I can get on and off the bike with confidence that everything won t go crashing over I ve only been using it for a few days but so far no leaks at all My only complaint is that the clamp used to hook the resistance control level to the handlebars won t tighten down hard enough to keep the lever from slipping as soon as I get the clamp almost tight enough it gives a bit and unhooks completely This might be partially due to my handlbar tube being a bit on the small size The two included sizing shims help but don t solve the problem So I have the clamp almost tight enough and the lever slips a bit when I push on it This isn t a huge problem as I can just grab the lever mechanism with one hand and the lever with the other and change the resistance Other than that it seems to be a very nice trainer for the price quiet adjustable and stable 
5 0 Can t really tell yet I bought this for my son at two and a half years age and even with the seat all the way down his feet barely make the ground and he looks intimidated He s too young His big brother age seven thought it was a hoot and wheeled around confidently but he s too big Quality and construction are excellent assembly was easy The orange wheelcovers come off so you can get at the valve stems to put air in the tires We also have a Kettler trike and they re terrific too Get the trike at age 2 3 Get this at age 3 4 Spoil them rotten 
4 0 Worth getting I bought this for my almost two year old He s not quite tall enough for it but will be soon I read that it was supposed to make you ride a two wheeler without training wheels sooner What happened is that my 5 year old wanted to try it He still was riding his bike with training wheels He and our neighbor s kids 4 year old twins tried it for one whole day and then they ALL decided that they wanted their training wheels off the next day We took them off and they have never looked back It seemed to put the idea in their head that they no longer needed the training wheels Now they still play with it sometimes but it usually sits in our garage waiting for my younger son I am very glad I bought it but I only gave it 4 stars as the seat is tricky to tighten and loosen which is what you must do to raise and lower it It would be great to have a quick release instead For the money though it is worth it

5 0 ACE Matches You have to be bloody stupid to need a manual on how to light these they are no different to normal matches except they are windproof These matches do really work the only other thing they compare to are turbo lighters 
5 0 Perfect This boken is perfect for learning how to handle a live blade The size and weight as well as the wrapping and guard offer a feel for an actual katana I was so excited when it showed up days ahead of schedule I started practicing with it immediately The color is darker than the pictures show but it is a beautiful boken nonetheless 
4 0 awsome this woked great for me i ordered it and it even came ahead of sced i go this and the black one and this was the beter of the two i use it to spar with a friend and it holds up well my only complaint is thet the finish comes off rather quickly but all in all it is a good practice weapon and i would sugest this to anyon 
5 0 Truely No Numbness Glove I finally had a chance to wear this glove and it is truely a no numbness glove My hand felt fine after 15 miles of riding With my old gloves my hands would start bothering me after 1 mile of riding You can t beat the price for these gloves either I highly recommend these gloves 
4 0 They do reduce numbness while riding They are not a magic bullet but the gloves do largely deliver on their promise to reduce numbness in the hands due to pressure on the ulnar nerve while bike riding I am an adventure racer and ride a mountain bike on varied terrain for hours at a time I still get some numbness but it is definitely reduced when wearing these gloves The gloves are otherwise similar to other bike gloves They are lightweight and cool I live train and race in Florida 
5 0 Everlast Heavy Bag Great Deal Very pleased with the product and the quickness of delivery Recommend to anyone 
5 0 Every thing I wanted I found this product Hydration pack to be every thing I read about it and I am very satisfied with it 
4 0 Very Nice Hydration pack One thing I really like is that there was no plastic or rubber taste on the first use It holds enough for long bike ride and was cold all the way to the end of the ride It feels good on your back too It helps in this Florida heat Cons The mouth piece is hard to hold onto because of the 180 degree angle It would be easier to have a T mouth piece I will be looking for a replacement 
5 0 Love my Mat Perfect to place on top of your sticky mat Soaks up the sweat and keeps from sliding Wash often or it will get really smelly 
5 0 Everyone should own one of these This is a great product I got it for a little extra traction during power yoga and it was great for that It provides a little extra cushioning and completely covers the mat I also use it during Bikram hot yoga instead of a towel and it s great It stay nice and smooth because of the little nubbly things and of course the very best thing it s machine washable I washed it seperately for awhile because the directions said that the colors could run but after a few weeks I started washing it with regular clothes and it s fine It s a pleasure to use 
5 0 Best purchase for sweaty yogis After sweating and slipping in many a vinyasa class even on a non slip mat a friend recommended this yoga towel This product has saved my yoga practice It does take one or two classes to get used to but once you do you are off to non slip yoga bliss Plus the well placed circle at the top of the mat gives you a visual to focus on to stay centered Thank you Yogitoes 
5 0 Wonderful I bought this at the same time as a new mat and love it Even with the best skidless mat I tend to skid once I get sweaty palms So it solves that problem when I take class I also teach and like to have two mats in a t shape when leading yoga This way I can use my mat on its own and cross the gym mat with the towel on top of it Voila no mat with someone else s germs on it for me If you want to be sanitary but not haul around your own mat this is a perfect solution 
5 0 No More Slipping Finally found the answer to my slippage problem What a difference it makes in my routine My only regret is that I didn t purchase it months ago 
5 0 skidless yoga towel I love it The skidless yoga towel really works and I don t have to worry about keeping my yoga mat clean 
4 0 For indoor workouts When it is too cold to ride the trainer is perfect for your fix I love my cycle ops wind trainer because it allows me to get a good workout whenever it rains etc It is relatively quite as well as being easy to fold up and put away The bike fits easy with the built in skewers that lock perfectly without coming loose no matter how hard you hammer the pedals You will feel confident locked in because it is very stable The video is a little cheesy and I only looked at mine once or twice when I bought it The girl and guy are just too darned happy meanwhile I m going through pain and grimacing trying to keep up with them If you are into spinning you can spin away and never leave the comfort of your home All in all it is a good accessory to have if you are a dedicated cyclist 
5 0 Great product for the money I purchased this for my husband and he loves it I had been searching for one for some time This one was so reasonably priced It appears to be well made and exactly what he was wanting 
5 0 Punchingly great Bought this for the girlfriend so she can practice her Karate at home She loves it Great quality great deal 
5 0 Couldn t live without it We ve had this for about 2 years now and it s still working just great I am truly amazed at how much better I feel after having a good stretch and it s been very helpful for chronic backpain 
4 0 Life Gear Inversoin Table Like it love it and hate it I have had some of the best work outs on this table and then again some of the worst Be careful if you have ankle knee or hip problems this will not help you but it does help your back and doing inverted sit ups it certainly will give you one heck of a good work out 
4 0 just what i ordered and more top notch quality well made smooth movement actually helps with tight back muscles back pain plus i use it as a part of my meditation since it s so relaxing 
5 0 good product This is strong stable and has all the features of tables three times its price It helps relieve my back pain I think it will help even more as I use it more 
5 0 Superb I ve had this inversion table now for about a month Weird getting used to but immediately soothing rocking back and forth I am now addicted and love it It was a subtle change but definitely a positive one My neck and shoulders feel great and I am sleeping better I would recommend inversion to anyone The shipping was fast There was some assembly but if you read the instructions and not be rushed to put it together if I could do it anyone can do it Happy inverting 
5 0 LifeGear Inversion Table Very low price well below retail for this table and far below competitors prices Free shipping Surprisingly high quality well built I liked it so well I bought a second one for my work I get instant relief from my backaches and long term relief as well I removed the safety devices that kept the table from being adjusted for the various pivot positions It required wrenches and some disassembly to make the adjustments A call to the manufacturer revealed these items were add ons due to a claim of an injury I cannot see how such an accident can happen if the instructions are even haphazardly followed Instructions might be more clear on setting the foot bar to the appropriate position as well as the ankle instep pad adjustment However trial and error will resolve this to each person s liking Again the tinker toy wrenches are needed to adjust the foot bar The wrenches give out after about three to four uses Get some real wrenches to keep with the table Also it is very important to view the video that accompanies the table In the video the pivot adjustment is discussed and it is obvious the safety devices discussed above are not present on the machine used in the video 
4 0 Decent Piece of Equipment This inversion table is a decent piece of equipment It is sturdy not hard to assemble and relatively inexpensive compared to similar units It does feel good on your back but don t expect to hang upside down very long it will take some time to get used to the blood rushing to your head which will cut short the time your back has to feel decompressed or stretched out whatever term you want to use Some reviewers mentioned the ankle brackets as being uncomfortable I didn t find them too bad mostly it will take some time to get used to being held upside down by your ankles If you are kind of frail in the bones then I could see this being a problem because you are holding your body weight by your ankles While it is not designed to go totally vertical you can get there by walking your hands back on the floor The instructions say it will lock into place if you go vertical but I haven t found that to be true maybe other peoples do but mine doesn t All in all if you are really sure you want an inversion table and don t want to invest a lot of money into it then this table will fit your needs One recommendation If you can try using an inversion table of a friends or at a store a couple times to make sure this is something you will really use 
5 0 great for balance Recommended to me by my trainer at the gym to improve my balance I m in my late 50 s and have enjoyed it tremendously Takes a while to get the hang of it great results 
5 0 Just what I expected This is your basic wiffle bat Good deal for the price 
5 0 The Rolls Royce of plastic yellow bats This is the classic wiffle bat fluorescent yellow and 32 inches long A lot of people will try to sell you a black and white bat or a red bat that flares out at the end You must decline these bats politely but firmly The wiffle bat has stood the test of time and will continue to do so long after the imitators are gone Most people know that the wiffle bat is ideal for hitting the aptly named wiffle ball but few newcomers know about the bonus features 1 If your opponent throws a hanging curveball and you make solid contact the ball will slide down the bat even as you are hitting it The result will be a monstrous home run that makes a whistling sound as it disappears into your cranky neighbor s yard 2 The lower part of the wiffle bat has a textured grip Nice 3 The base of the bat has a little hole in it that when the bat is waved around makes a cool low pitched whistle not unlike the hum of a light saber Highly recommended for anyone with a ball a yard and a friend 
5 0 A very nice racket We purchased this racket for my daughter and she loves it She loves the color and she feels like a real tennis champion learning to play tennis with it The quality and the brand are just excellent 
5 0 Must have for enthusiasts Never thought I d own a hyd pack but now I don t know what I d do without one This company offers free lifetime tip replacement Previous reviews are accurate no initial taste or odor Take proper care for long periods of storage rinse with lemon juice or baking soda and you ll enjoy a long life out of this Zippered pocket is nice too 
5 0 Every thing I wanted I found this product Hydration pack to be every thing I read about it and I am very satisfied with it 
5 0 Ironman Chin Up Bar Perfect item desired super easy to install and great price and delivery 
5 0 A great distraction My three month old loves it I first put it in his crib at 2 1 2 months and his face lit up and he immediately reached for it I usually hit the smiley face which plays a melody and he spins the two wheels and stares at himmself in the mirror He used to fuss when he woke up and could not reach it but now he can move over to it himself He can play with this for up to half hour before wanting to move on to another distraction There are two things I wish it had a remote so I don t to continuously reach in to hit the smiley face though this is meant for the baby to activate he is still not physically able to do this himself and changing melodies it plays the same melody over and over and although my son does not mind it can drive a parent up a wall I also love the fact that it is two sided toy and will grow with him All in all a great item I highly recommend 
4 0 good but not the best I own both this trail seat and the camp seat The camp seat inflates twice as thick so it offers more of a cushioned feel Both are great in that you can let the air out roll up the cushion and then let it self inflate when you re ready to sit 
5 0 Perfect for my daughter s first lessons Enough said this was light with a small but secure grip and big head perfect for her first lessons 
5 0 Quality Home plate for backyard This home plate solid and of good quality to last many years of backyard baseball games 
5 0 Dora the Explorer Low Rider Trike My 1 year old niece loved it The lowest height is perfect for small children and we ll adjust it as she grows The bright colors really caught her attention and the back support on the seat makes it safer for small children 
4 0 Grandma Review Bought this trike for my 2 year old granddaughter for Christmas She loves Dora but this trike with its low profile looked especially safe It has lived up to our expectation It does not tip over and is easy for her to climb onto without assistance Only problem was Dora picture for the front of the bike did not have great attachments and is now in the toy box 
4 0 one of few trikes with rubber on tires it s hard to find a tricycle with rubber treads on the wheels most trikes and big wheels have hard plastic wheels which slip on the concrete when the kid pedals i liked this one it was easy to put together except for the front decorative plate with Dora on it but it wasn t necessary and my daughter doesn t know who Dora is so i just didn t put it on the trike is small enough for a really petite or young child which is why i bought it we had a bigger trike the Radio Flyer which was no where near small enough for our 2 year old my only complaint is that the bar that the seat is attached to and connects to the rear axle is just a little bit loose fitting but it doesn t seem to be causing a problem very good trike overall 
5 0 fine clubs I am a begining golfer These clubs are fine for my purpose so far it has been great 
5 0 Very good quality for a very good price Got them last week and have played 3 games and been to the driving range for a total of 6 hours No problems with them at all they feel great and play well I put them through a few very rough swings to the ground and no bends or breaks VERY solid Great clubs 
5 0 Best online shopping Site Ever I was very impressed the free shipping The time it took to get to me And the quality i got for the best price on the internet This is the best shopping network in the whole entire internet Honestly 
4 0 From Beginner to Beginner I bought this set because I was just getting into golf looking for something inexpensive and that looked OK Eight rounds of golf later and lots of time at the range I m still very happy with this set I gave this a 4 because I like my set but there are some things that I don t like It comes with a pretty good bag I carry my bag when I play I don t use both straps because I make a lot of noise that way but it s comfortable enough on my shoulders just using one The stand is a great feature It also has a good number of pockets The bag and head covers are a little too blue and some of the plastic makes it look cheap to me but nothing has torn yet The woods are cool looking and the hybrid gets a lot of attention The hybrid can be used off the tee on the fairway in the rough and to chip so you can avoid the irons until you get some practice with them I m glad that the woods came with head covers or I would have scratched them all up by now It has just one long iron 4 the rest are mids and shorts I think that s good because I ve seen some sets that come with a 3 instead of a hybrid The long irons are pretty hard for me to use I think that s true for most beginners I hate the putter It handles poorly and it s cheap looking They may have changed the putter on later sets It will be the first club I replace 
5 0 Nice clubs OK I should first say that I m not a great golfer I started playing a few weeks ago and bought these online because they looked like a great deal A customer of mine invited me out to a golf outting and the club rental fee on the course was more than I wanted to pay and being that I d most likely be doing this again it s not really about the game is it now I figured these would pay for themselves in 2 or 3 outtings I m not a great golfer I don t know much about clubs But these seemed to swing ok my buddies were kind of impressed considering what I paid and I didn t do too badly Nothing came broken nothing broke on the course the drivers had decent range the irons did they re job If you re tall like I am you ll find the irons a little short and will need to get the grips extended I m 6 4 I ll keep these until my game deems me worthy of something nicer 
5 0 Ease Your Back Pain If you suffer from chronic back pain this inversion table is your solution It s extremely sturdy and perfectly engineered 
4 0 Great Product Overall Brought this table based on price Amazon s was by far the best and ratings The table was easy to assemble operate and adjust The materials are very high quality which means that it should last your lifetime under normal conditions The only problem encountered was with the ankle anchoring system The ratchet works fine but it puts excessive pressure on my achilles tendon and hanging becomes increasingly uncomfortable as time passes Hanging for more than 4 5 minutes actually becomes painful As a powerlifter there is more mass packed onto my frame than the average person To be fair this may be part of the problem My solution has been to add additional wrapping around the ankles Other than the anchoring this is a great product that should last forever 
5 0 terrific I purchased this item for my husband who is working out of town He has used inversion tables for years and even has two older models He has bad back problems and when he goes out of town to work he works construction as a heavy equipment operator his back gets even worse I had this inversion table sent to where he was and he can do nothing but rave about it It was easy to put together easy to take apart and EASY to use I m very impressed especially for the price KM 
5 0 Inversion table This was purchased as an Xmas present for my wife She uses it daily and claims it has helped with her chronic back pain The table is excellently made It is very sturdy The design is well engineered It is perfectly balanced when set up to the correct body height A very good buy 
5 0 Ratchet system is worth the extra cost I had the opportunity to try a table with telescoping ankle system for several weeks before I bought this It was enough to let me know inversion tables could do wonders for my back But the ankle restraints were uncomfortable and I had to put on shoes every time I used the table I m so glad I paid for the ankle ratchet system on this lifegear So much more comfortable and easy to use The rest of the table was what I expected solid and well designed Lifegear my back thanks you 
5 0 Great for Back Problems My husband and myself have suffered back pain for years We ve made multiple trips to the chiropractor over the years in search of releif and would get it if only temporarily I knew there were inversion tables out there somewhere cannot find in stores out here so one day I searched on Amazon and low and behold Amazon came through for me again I love this store I admit I m an Amazon junkie I had purchased this inversion table as a Christmas gift for my husband He was very excited to get it It didn t take long to set it up and in no time we were using it and trying it out We could feel some instant releif on the 1st day It releases the tension and pressure in your vertebrae and adjusts your back After a really stressful day it s relaxing to get on it for a few minutes to feel the stress in your back just go away If you have a desk job and sit all day that compresses your vertebrae and this releases that compression The padding in the ankle area is comfortable Unless you have a bad ankle it makes it more comfortable to hang upside down And it adjusts to different heights pretty easily so everyone in the family can benifit from it s use It s hard to use when you have a bad head cold and your congested it s hard to breathe when your standing upright let alone hanging upside down But that is not the fault of the machine I just couldn t use if for a few weeks due to a nasty head cold and my back suffered as a result of it As a result of getting this inversion table we ve made fewer visits to our chiropractor who does advocate the use of inversion tables You do need to be careful and as with any other piece of equipment you bring home and use you need to follow all directions and consult with your doctor first Your heath and safety is your 1 priority you do not need to jepordize it 
5 0 LifeGear Delluxe Inversion Table Great unit solid easy to assemble and easy to use Great Price plus free shipping 
4 0 LifeGear Deluxe Inversion Table After reading many reviews and doing price comparisions I settled on this product I got fast shipping as always This table for the money is well worth the purchase price I am using this table to help stablize a bulging disk in my lower back The table was easy to asemble and operate I am sure I will get many years of use from it because of how well it is made I would recommend this table to those who consider price to value Thank 
5 0 Great My daughter got these roller skates for a present And we have to go skating more often than before She loves them she likes the pink wheels that their white she feels very girly We went from the barbie skates that she was having a little hard time with and when she put these on she was rolling like a pro I m not sure what it is but she is actually rolling instead of walking still falls some but I believe that takes a lot of time before that stops 
5 0 Great skates After searching every store in a 6 town radius we found them on Amazon the kids love them 
5 0 Well Received The lanyards and whistles were purchased for a Christmas gift which was well received Thank you 
5 0 Fun for the kids Your kids will be waiting for their turns to use it 
5 0 excellent The twist board was exactly what I expected everything was shipped and received on time 
5 0 Great bike mirror Easy to install Easy to adjust angle Stays in place Clear view of road behind cyclist 
5 0 It s not bad The pink color of this bag is not the same shade as the pink 1 4 Extra Thick Deluxe High Density yoga mat It looks pink purple yet the mat is hot pink However it fits the mat very nicely Also it s very light weight and it s very easy to fold up when not in used Even though it has no extra pockets for cell phone stuff I think it s better than canvas bags which is quite heavy I bought this bag and the mat at the same time so the shipping rate was not too bad Of course it would have been better if it was cheaper 
4 0 It does it s job very nicely I wish the shipping wasn t over half the price of the item but the service and item are very nice for the money If you want to pay more for a more comfy or longer strap so be it Otherwise this is the best deal I ve seen anywhere And I researched thouroughly on and off line 
5 0 Yoga Mat This just arrived and appears to be a nice quality mat I m excited 
5 0 Great backpack and style I would normally wear totes from abercrombie or hollister When I saw the black crazy dots I thought it looked really cool This is the best backpack I have ever found and I wish that I figured that out a long time ago Bit you know what they say it is better late then never finding that out Overall JanSport mad another great durable and cute backpace I reccomend it for anyone that needs a new stylish backpack 
5 0 Good Bag I always liked JanSport bags for their durability I bought one for my husband 5 years ago He uses it to go back and forth from work to rock concerts and when we go rock climbing 
4 0 A nice backpack I ordered this backpack as a temporary solution I thought it was cheap 20 item around 10 shipping but now I realize it isn t Maybe I will start with the negative aspect of the product Too simple only one big and one small compartments with the small one being the front pocket In addition The straps are small I am big but I see many larger people than me around and to be honest if you are aroun XL or XXL size it would be quite uneasy to put the backpack over a jacket as its straps are simply too short The good part it looks durable does the business and now I will keep it as a spare since I now have another one Not JanSport but sill the price somehow appears to be alittle too much for me For the same amount I gave I could find a real nice Adidas or Nike original ones back in my country 
5 0 Love Jansport This is the best I have always used Jansport backpacks they last forever 
5 0 Great Backpack This is a great backpack it has plenty of space for all my stuff 
5 0 Good sturdy pack I bought this pack for hiking I find all JanSport products to be of good quality I don t like lots of bells whistles on a day pack and this one is pretty basic It is a decent size to allow me to carry all my necessities and some extras but not so big to tempt me into over packing A larger pack would be preferable for a winter hike to carry bulkier items This pack is fully functional and if it lives up to previous Jansport packs I ve owned then it will be around for some years to com 
5 0 Jansport Superbreak Backpack The backpack was very good however it was packed in a box that was wayyyy to big and i have to incurred additional charges since it was shipped out of the US to the Caribbean I will really like it if you guys can send make your packages much smaller Thanks Remo 
4 0 geat brand for a great price This is a nice looking sturdy back pack for most elementary school children The only drawback is it s a bit small I bought it for my middle school son He loved it but could not fit all of his books and school supplies in it My fourth grader who is notorious for tearing up back packs uses it every day It s a perfect fit for him It is holding up quite well 
5 0 Very easy to use The pump that came with the ball was easy to use and I was shocked at how quickly I was able to blow up the ball with it Not saying it didn t hurt my arm but I m quite out of shape hence the fitness ball It really just took a few minutes and it was blown up I was a little confused at first about how to fit the pump into the hole but once I got that figured out it went very smoothly The ball itself is very easy to use and it works really well The fitness guide that it comes with is nothing more than a small piece of paper with three or four exercises drawn out I was thinking it was going to be a DVD or something For 15 though I can t complain about that I think it s completely worth the 15 I paid for it 
5 0 Everlast is right I ve had this exact exercise ball for at least 2 years My mother brother and myself all use it I am a 200 pound gym rat and I can tell you this is the best ab tool you ll ever need My brother is 250+ pounds and the ball has never popped leaked I am actually purchasing another one today because my brother is moving out and wants one for X Mas Just put on the TV and do crunches during your favorite shows 
4 0 great item I like this item I got the one with the lock because of the ease of carring the lock I use a chain with the lock to secure the whole bike I had a problem with the reflector breaking off I called the company and I had a replacement within a week Great Service I use this rack with both the topeak bag and basket I love the versitility Great purchas 
4 0 Good quality but medium was too small These gloves are of a good quality though have a strong smell leather dye I assume I am using them almost daily and they cusion palms and fingers nicely The velcro on the back is slightly uncomfortable probably due to the sie being too small I ordered gloves in medium size but they are too small for my relatively small hands If you think you need medium you probably should order large I am giving 4 stars for the size issue but the quality and price combination is very good 
5 0 Top of the line weightlifting gloves These are the best pair of weightlifting gloves I have owned They last forever and do not tear Also great for batting and biking 
5 0 Good quality for Backyard Games These bases are solid and of good quality to last many years of backyard baseball games 
4 0 Great carrier that grows with us I bought this carrier to carry my MTB Later my 5 year old son joined me with his 20 inch BMX bike Then my wife and my 4 year old daughter wanted to come with us too So I bought the 4 bike adopter Now we are very happy with the complete set up It is very easy to use and I could store it in the back of my mini van The only area I see that can be improved is the finish 
4 0 good rack for the price Pros Fits any bike no crossbar adapter needed for Y frames Folds up nicely for storage Easy to load unload 30 seconds to hook the rack into the hitch 30 seconds to load a bike on the rack can t beat the price optional extension sold separately allows for carrying up to 4 bikes light I can carry the rack in one hand low price Similar Thule and Yakima racks are nearly 3 times the price Cons the rack does not extend out far enough at least on my Hyundai Tucson SUV When mounted my bike s handle bars and pedals come within 2 inches of my back door I m worried the pedal could scratch my vehicle s paint I usually put a sock over the pedal just to be safe the hooks can be hard to adjust because the release levers are small and tend to stick Squeezing the lever can be painful on your finger the rack has several inches of sway perhaps a hitch stabilizer would fix this i found the assembly a little difficult luckily you only do this once 
5 0 Nice Rack Bike rack was very simple to put together and with a full suspension bike you can adjust the wheel holders to fit and holder ratchets down very tight to hold bike very good 
4 0 Great Bike Rick I really love this bike rack It is so easy to load bikes and they ride with no swaying 
4 0 Swagman XC Cross Country 2 Bike Hitch Mount Rack All though I have not used the bike rack as yet I have put it together which was very simple to do This was exactly what I was looking for as I travel in my motor home and needed to have a bike tack that I could transport my new Jeep bike with out taking it apart 
5 0 Great Product This is outstanding for my use I have a SWB recumbent bike as well as a road bike and both fit the system very well Easy to assemble and adjust Exactly what I was looking for 
5 0 I Feel Fortunate to Have Found This I spent some time searching for a bike carrier for my SUV trailer hitch I selected the Swagman based upon the reviews posted here on Amazon I have been very pleased with this unit It is very easy to put on and take off The bike loads easily It probably takes me 30 seconds to get the carrier on the car and 15 seconds to load the bike No hassel at all 
5 0 Best bike rack I have owned Very impressed with the rack set up and ease of use The description does not do this bike rack justice Very functional and easy to mount the bikes on even if they are odd frame shapes or sizes They ride very securely and the rack has very little wiggle with no noise Center arm moves out of the way to open the tailgate if no bike is attached Arms that hold the bike ratchet down and lock until a clip is pressed to release them I love it money well spent 
5 0 A MUST HAVE Don t spend the money on the bearings without buying the lube squirt some in and notice an immediate difference 
4 0 I love this stopwatch I really like the look and feel of it It has a really good heft to it and feels like it is build like a battleship If you threw it at somebodys head it would leave a dent unlike the cheap plastic ones out there The large display is very easy to read The buttons are very positive to use and have a nice click to them It looks like the old fashioned mechanical stopwatches but is only a third the price 4 out of 5 because I wish it had a stand by mode it is always on and Emerson do not seem to have a website and I have lost the original manual and want to reset the default count down time to something else Guess I will just have to sit and play with button combinations for 20 minutes or so 
5 0 This Stopwatch This stopwatch actually stops time the way you would expect a stop watch to So all in all stopping time good A watch that helps you do it even better 
5 0 Good sword The sword I purchased isn t the sharpest But nothing a sharper couldn t fix The item is good of quailty 
5 0 Great buy I purchased the 26 Ninja Sword with Sheath Sharp Stainless Steel Blade on march 8 2007 and the service from Defenderblades was excellent and the sword was good quality In face i was impressed how nice the sword was 
4 0 Very nice but It is very nice and everything about it is great down to the pleather lined sheath only fault is the blade it isn t very sharp but a knife sharpener could fix that in no time 
4 0 This Fiberglass Foam Board is a Good Economical Upgrade from a Wood Board I ve been riding wooden boards for over 2 years now I saw this board for sale and thought it was way too cheap for a full fiberglass foam board but I decided to take a risk and give it a try It s a major upgrade from my wooden boards With this I can waveskim or sandride It s very light weighing only 5 lbs has a mild rocker and comes with a limited lifetime warranty It s not going to perform as well as 200 300 namebrand boards like Victoria Exile Zap etc but for the price I paid I m very happy 
5 0 Great racquet This is one of the best racquets I have played with I am jsut a part time player who plays tennins for a past time and this racquet has lived up to the expectations 
5 0 Good Bat for Mid Range players this is really a very good bat it has very good control I tried couple of others but this one is the best of all 
5 0 Wilson nCode N6 110 Tennis Racquet I am very satisfied with the quality and also supply chain management Thanks 
5 0 nCode n6 Racquet Review The best racquet i have tried in years Excellent groundstrokes and volleys and true no more elbow problems Highly recomended for intermidiate to advanced players for all court position 
5 0 Great Racquet This is a very great racquet I always had tennis elbow problem Not this one Not sure whether it has anything to do with the advertised nano technology but the frame has better feedback and control than most of the popular racquets that I have tried More power even with slow or medium stroke The look is also great Highly recommended 
4 0 Great Knife Love the knife it s just a little too large to carry in my pocket on a regular basis I returned it and bought the Chive it s perfect 
5 0 Sexy yet stabby Like the Chive this knife is a nice small package that s deceptively stabby Sure it looks innocent but how much of that blade do you want in your eye Hypothetically speaking of course I would never indicate that you should stab people with this knife Never ever The high points are the sleek design flawless assisted opening and light weight I have problems with thumb studs on assisted opening knives so I am very pleased that this has an index opening For the safety conscious there is a safety lock to keep the blade from opening in your pants Not that it will but just in case I guess The Leek is a perfect knife for people with small hands that i s assisted opening is a definite bonus Too many assisted opening knives are too bulky for my hand or too powerful when it snaps open Kershaw Tactical Blur for example The Leek firmly snaps into place without recoil and is light and small enough for people with small hands to easily use But don t be fooled by its innocent appearance This knife can be a deadly little package and should not be underestimated 
5 0 VERY NICE I bought this for my boyfriend as an exact replacement knife He had lost the original doing god knows what He loves it it s not too big but not too small securely clips on your pocket and is so sharp its down right scary but I guess that s why it s a men s knife Opens quickly and the serrated part is a nice addition 
4 0 Nice little knife Maintains a decent edge the opening lock closing mechanism is simple and smooth The color is as intense as seen in the pic and pretty resistant to wear In general happy with the knife 
5 0 Speed safe broke but no big deal I ve had this knife and their rainbow leak model for few years All I wanted was a thin small and light knife and I got it The blade material is hard enough to stay sharp for a while soft enough to easily sharpen but not brittle like a ceramic or carbon steel knife for example I have had the vary tip break a couple times but it s because I was doing something foolish with it like using it as a throwing knife wink wink It s not the best it s not the worst but can compete with ether witch is the best in my opinion Shortly after I bought it the speed safe spring broke eehhh who cares it opens fine without It s vary well made it can take all of my fat butts weight easily when laying sideways on a hard surface It s vary thin profile is comfortable and I sometimes can t tell if I have it with me or not It has what looks like brass or copper washers bushings instead of cheap thin steel plastic ones means no binding up even when in need of oil The frame lock is far stronger than a line lock and best of all it deforms and wares much slower meaning my knife will stay ridged when opened for a long time My favorite thing about it is the fact you can position the clip henge up or down I chose henge down so it s ready to open the second it comes out of my pocket If you want nice quality and availability for the price kershaw is worth looking at 
5 0 I love this knife I m not a huge outdoorsman but wanted a nice everyday pocket knife The Kershaw s Leek fits the bill I love the size long enough to get your whole hand envolved with the task yet small enough to have clipped to your pocket and forget its there I was planning on taking the clip off and just letting the knife float in my pocket but fell in love with the clip The only thing better than light weight in your pocket is no weight in your pocket I find that the knife is well designed and I really like the Speed Safe opening action It has a solid click that lets you know that the knife is in a locked position Super sharp and the perfect drop point blade 
5 0 A great Knife The knife is sleek and has a great profile I love the speedsafe function on it The blade lock is a bit stiff but I suppose that s just so it doesn t slide open on accident 
4 0 Great Quality Great Carry Knife I purchased this knife at a gun knife show three years ago and have carried it everyday since I ve owned 60 00 Spyderco and 150 00 Benchmade Automatic knives but this Stainless Leek model is slimmer quicker to draw and has a better clip than both of these knives Because of the unique spring action mechanism many think it s an automatic knife My only recommendation is to occasionally lubricate clean the mechanism to keep the action quick I did have to tighen the allen screw to keep the safety from slipping on in my pocket I will be ordering a second one at this price This is a very well designed well made pocket knife 
5 0 Very nice This product is very very nice It came quite sharp I figured it was dull so I brushed it up against my skin lightly just to see and I cut myself on accident So it s quite sharp The sword is smaller than I thought it would be though Width wise I mean the bladed part is about an inch and a half in width and like the titles says the sword is 18 long That s less than 2 feet for you people that aren t that great at converting measurments Anyway the sword seems very durable and the LED light is quite bright The only problem is is that the screws were loose on the light when I got it out of the package and it was wobbling around and wouldn t stay in place But a screwdriver fixed that in no time I was shippeda black sword actually not a silver one But that s a plus for me because I love black swords the handle of the sword is wrapped in a green material not black like the silver one All in all this is a very nice blade I recommend it to anyone who collects different types of swords and anyone who is looking for a nice weapon to keep under their pillow at night especially since it has the LED light attatchment 
5 0 Nice little sword This is a great little sword It is very sharp and the LED light is bright I keep this sword next to my pillow in case of emergency or bad dreams Good product at a low price How can they sell it at 5 bucks c mon the LED light is probably half the price already LOL 
5 0 You d think it would be bad because of the price This product along with all the products from X BOWS are a very high quality The company overall makes there money fairly and the way money should be made Selling at very very cheap prices for extremely high quality products This particular sword is very sharp It comes with a cool light and sheath Its very sturdy and is stainless metal Overall in terms of cost delivery and quality I give it like 18 out of 5 If you like playing with swords like me then X BOWS is definitly the company you want to buy from There an awsome company that makes awsome swords 
5 0 Very nice good for hunting The one I ordered seemed to be black so its a plus for me since I like black knives I guess I cant really call it a knife or a sword it would stack up more as a small hunting machete Very well build and light but strong recomend it for camping 
4 0 Nice and cushy but bulky This 5 8 mat is a pretty color and very comfortable but a bit heavy and bulky to carry I would recommend a mat no thicker than 1 4 to take to the gym 
5 0 One of the best investments to enjoy yoga I love this mat Because of it s thickness it really helps to give me the support that I need to enjoy yoga poses and to say in the pose without feeling as if I m on a hard floor It would be nice if it was available in more colors other than red 
5 0 Excellent mat for a big guy I ordered this mat when I started a morning exercise class that includes yoga I like the size but especially the thickness From past experience I know how uncomfortable it can be doing sit ups without sufficient padding This mat has plenty I couldn t be more satisfied 
5 0 Very comfortable mat I bought this mat for my wofe who is very petite It is perfect for her She does not feel the floor and can do all of her exercises Very pleased with i 
5 0 great mat at a great price This mat is so soft and comfortable The price is great and I highly recommend it 
5 0 Great mat very long This mat is great it s got nice padding and is very long Because it is long it would work great for tall people and or larger men Folds up well and stores well wonderful 
4 0 Exercise Mat I use on a basement floor which is concrete but there is carpet over padding Really makes a difference using this mat Very comfortable 
5 0 Great family room putting green This putting mat is a winner My three guys have been using it nonstop since I gave it to them on Christmas day and it still looks like new no curling edges or signs or wear yet They are serious golfers and they give this a big thumbs up They swear it has helped them perfect their shots 
4 0 Does the job I was expecting a roll of astro turf but this turned out to be a shorter thick felt kind of surface The mat has three holes at one end and the sand trap water hazard and hole are actually pictures printed on the inside flap of the box that the mat comes in you pop them out and wedge them into the foam Not sure what I was expecting for 16 99 but I guess aside from looking a little cheap this will work 
5 0 Learning coaching from running strengh makes clear Guide for Health Learning coach including in the Suunto T4 with pc pod and foot pod reveal running strength is adequate or not One of the impressive point is the coaching is not limitted to the data inputted into initial setting The coaching is a self learning teacher living in the watch Of course for a speciallist there is no need to learn running strength for health promotion or improve his body As to me who has not enough knowledge and experience very usuful guide which is shown in the watch windows and PC software 
5 0 Best Training Tool ever I was a bit hesitate to purchase the marathon pack I felt it was a bit more than I needed but after utilizing all the accessories I deemed it the best training tool ever It is the simplest way to track overall all performance effort and training effect The Suunto marathon pack provides more than just a watch to keep track of laps but if you want it to it will also be a little coach letting you know to speed up slow down and relax If you are just looking for a watch this is not for you but if you want the versatility of a complete training tool partner and coach I suggest you get one yourself 
5 0 Awesome product My daughter loves it to bits and I love that s it s strong enough I especially love the price I paid 
4 0 New school functionality at old school pricing Very good product especially for the price Amazon had the lowest online price I could find Product delivers all advertised functionality hip color scheme and comfortable shoulder straps Zippers can be a bit difficult when particularly when backpack is cinched 
4 0 Inflatable punching bag My 8 yr old loves it Have had no problems with it except it does take quite awhile to fill w the little manual pump 
5 0 nice cooler Good quality cooler at a good price i am very happy with i 
4 0 Good value Keeps food drinks cold and ice did not melt during the 12 14 hrs we used it daily on a trip Good capacity sturdy construction with good handles Only issue is that it is a bit hard to open but perhaps the snug fit is what helps it work so well I think it is a good product at a good price 
4 0 A great buy Easy to inflate and our guests have commented on how comfortable the air bed is even better than our sofa bed Very happy with this purchase 
4 0 Good Nights Sleep I was skeptical at first but upon reading Empyreal s review I went ahead and bought it It provides a surprisingly comfortable surface and a great nights sleep I agree with Empyreal now and dont see the need for buying an actual bed and matress for quite some time Oh and maybe it was just me but I didnt realize this item required batteries The inflator requires 4 D batteries 
4 0 No complaints The mattress itself is fine when i woke up on it it had deflated some I dont know if thats how the majority of air mattresses are but it did do that The infaltor works alright id rate it a 4 10 I dont like that its battery operated 
4 0 Good Alternative To Your Bed I ve had this unit for a couple of months now w o any complaints except for this one The nozzle s allow for quite a bit of air volume leakage when you remove them try to close off the valve This is true with all three nozzles The inflator included isn t really strong enough to over inflate to allow for this air loss so the mattress never seems fully inflated to me As far as quality goes this is a great made air mattress Strong seams all around The cover is almost like felt and is textured as well It feels good even w o any covers on it The corners tend to fold over when I lay next to them but that goes back to the inflation problem IMO I weigh 165 so my weight shouldn t be the cause 
4 0 my air bed actually i had some problem for abt one week when i bought the air bed the air was leaking i thought of returning the product to the amazon since i used it for two weeks i dint feel like returning after the second week the air stopped leaking suprisingly now i just fill the air once in a week i feel the air is great problem with the air bed is that u get the d c pump u have to fit the battries u dont get a a c pump rest all things is fine about this product i am enjoying it 
5 0 Extremely durable comfortable and firm Living on my own for the first time I did not have my own bed I decided to use an air mattress as a temporary solution while I saved up the money and shopped for normal beds A year later and I still used this Swiss air bed every night There seemed no point in buying a normal bed when this one was so comfortable and durable It didn t lose air meaning I only had to fill it up with air maybe once or twice a month yes month It was comfortable And it was durable lining on this thing is extremely thick It spend several months propped against a metal heater with sharp edges and the thing never got a hole Unfortunately after 13 months of nightly use it developed a small hole along one of the seams in the top of the mattress I couldn t find one at the store having to settle with a Coleman which is absolutely nothing like my Swiss The Coleman has a very thin lining making me paranoid about what I set next to it It loses air and requires refilling everyday it s comfortable but because it loses so much air it is not firm So now I really do have to get a real bed 
5 0 Durable and easy to use I love this trailer When I started looking for a trailer I saw how expensive some of the other brands were like Burley and Chariot I thought I would have to spend a lot of money to get a decent one But talking to women in my bike club I got many recommendations for Instep because you can get them at a reasonable price and they are durable So I bought this one and it was very easy to put together No tools are needed I love how it s not a pain in the rear to use It attaches to the bike very easily I also bought a second coupler through instep for my husband s bike So we can easily switch trailer from bike to bike even mid ride if we ever needed to It collapses almost completetely for storage which is another nice thing My son who is 15 months old and almost 30 lbs uses it and seems to be comfortable since he loves riding in it 
5 0 Works like a charm I love our new bike trailer We try to take it out every weekend My daughter loves to ride in it on our rides It also holds so much in the storage compartment I was surprised This was a great investment 
5 0 SAK s are the best knife value on the planet This particular knife has almost all the tools one can use only missing the scissors Much thinner than the plastic scaled versions the Alox versions are very strong but not quite as smooth opening due to the lack of stainless liners The blade steel is a proprietary stainless that holds an edge pretty well and is easy to touch up with a ceramic stick 
5 0 nice pocket knife Got the cadet pocket knife two weeks ago I am really impressed by how thin it is It is so thin that I could keep it in the pochet at the back of my jean and would not feel its existence by contrast the regular kind with plastic handle is at least 50 thicker Another plus of the metal handle is that I will never need to worry about scratches And the knife is really sharp Overall a very nice pocket knife for everyday use 
5 0 Awesome Sword This sword is an awesome replica in terms of actual size to that of Sephiroth s Only thing that I think takes away from the sword is that the handle is a plastic wrapped in black cloth When sword is held outstretched it does become very heavy and a lot of pressure is put on handle Despite the handle and cloth the sword overall is massive and amazing to behold Great collectible for any FF goru 
5 0 Its what it should be For 89 99 I think it was a great offer i got it today and even though the handle is wrapped in plastic and the sheath is wood the sword IS and I repeat IS sharp it really is a replica but if you were to be in a battle you could hypothetically could kill someone No one is expected to be able to weild it In the game you never saw sephiroth s sheath anyways he always had it out It makes me feel like sephiroth when i hold it 
5 0 Great Choice This Blade is of superior quality and craftsmanship I never beheld such a blade and knew that I owned it Please before getting a knockoff purchase this one 
5 0 Pretty cool sword I have this thing and personally I love it While its not a very pratical sword for actual fighting for a number of reasons replicas like this aren t made for that anyway but you just feel so powerful with it As far as weilding it I found it s not as hard as everyone says I can weild it pretty well although I am a bigger guy Weight is not 29 lbs though don t be alarmed it s more like 10 the length just makes it feel really heavy 
4 0 It couldve been the PERFECT sword had it been real As much as I love anime and stuff this sword actually isnt real enough to do any swordplay with It s hard to accept it isnt TRULY real but it isnt hard to accept after you get all the fanboy ish fantasy nonsense arranged properly in your mind albeit thats the only rather an obvious con of it Other than that its a truly wicked artifact and to FF7 fans its almost like having a piece of the game as memoriablia and also the wonderful thoughts of weilding a blade similar to who could be quite possibly be the greatest villain of all time BTW Weilding the thing is quite a feat as someone with short arms can struggle getting the sword out by themselves but thats hardly my problem as my arms are sorta lanky along with the rules of physics Last but not least as being your official piece of property and after you drooled or allowed some other bodily fluid to somehow leak onto it just remember 2 important things 1 Take care of it as rust is a constant threat to any metal or combination of metals and 2 Don t let the size of it go to your head and also try to keep it at home I dont think that the local authorities would like to pull someone over for a typical traffic violation only to discover that they are carrying a blade over 4 feet long in their vehicle Just a word of advice 
5 0 Sephiroth s Sword the Masamune I laugh at the people who think any Final Fantasy replica sword is wieldable 1 It has CHINA stamped on one side And since really cheap things come from China this is a piece of stainless steel High carbon steel is more expensive than stainless steel High carbon steel obviously has a lot of carbon which atracts moisture and causes rust pitting and corrosion Stainless steel is softer because there is less carbon in it thus preventing the rust pitting and corrosion 2 This sword is too massive to wield Any skilled martial artist can easily defeat someone who tries to wield it Any hardwood weapon such as a bokken tonfa staff and even nunchaku can break the weapon 3 Since this sword is long and heavy it really only has two easy modes of slashing vertical and horizontal If someone tried to attack vertically it can be blocked with a weapon or doged either causing the sword to get stuck in the ground or damaged That is when the opponent can move in and attack If slashing horizontally chances are it will be swung somewhat hard and fast The opponent can easilly dodged it or block and attack 4 Even a high carbon battle ready sword will not last long if struck against another sword If a hard sword is hit against something equal as hard or harder it will break There is a reason why a sword is never slashed against a tree Sword play seen in the movies is purely for show The swords used are either rubber plastic or thick stage steel A samurai tried to never draw their sword unless it was absolutly nessacery To die when it is right to die to strike when to strike is right Bushido the Warrior s Code 5 If you try to imitate something like swordsmanship fighting or anything else staged on anime and video games go home and rethink your life You are really dumb if you tried anything like that Same with movies You can learn very little martial arts from movies Stephen Chow did If you really want to learn swordsmanship go find the nearest dojo or at least find a book I gave 5 stars because the sword is a nice replica 
5 0 im confused i was just wondering the actual things about this sword ever since i seen the game and played it iv wanted the sword of sephiroth but i want to know actual information like even if the edge is beveled can it be sharpend is its steel 440 carbon will it fall apart if its actualy used is it full tang or half tang whats the gaurd and pommel made of that kinda thing i just wanna make sure before i pay 100 for it that it can be used please if anyone knows any of these questions answer them for me by replying to me at Envy_274 yahoo co 
4 0 Pretty Pretty That s one long sword I don t have it but my friend does Looks good but you really shouldn t go around swinging that thing it s not like you re going to expect fighting or practicing with a near 5 7 sword but looks awesome really worth the money 
5 0 So beautiful Such detail such fine work This is a near exact replica down to the tiniest details It s a shame the blade isn t 7 or 8 feet long like the real thing but that makes it all the more better A weildable Masamune This makes me wanna buy it 
5 0 Allen Deluxe 5 Bike hitch is a winner The hitch is easy to assemble and easy to use We found it holds our bikes securely with out scratching the frames The straps are easy to fasten and we like the fact the straps are attached to the hitch so they do not get lost I also like the fact the bikes are easy to see in my rearview mirror but they don t obstruct my view or my taillights It is a well designed product but we modified the holes on the hitch to match our receiver so that we could utilize a LOCKING hitch pin This is too nice a rack to leave unsecured on a vehicle If you re hauling bikes you probably are going to leave the vehicle parked and ride the bikes Unless the hitch is locked or removed from the vehicle it is open for an easy theft The hitch is lightweight but of very strudy design We also like that it can be tilted to gain access to the cargo area of the van We had a hard time finding a bike rack that would hold five bikes It is easy to fold up and store in the garage This is great Well designed A great product 
4 0 Good deal for the price I spent a great deal of time searching for a 5 bike rack The greater challenge was to find one I could afford This rack fit the bill It was considerably less expensive than other 5 bike racks yet it works rather well Good points Easily adapts to various bike frame types I carry one men s frame one old women s 10 speed a women s autobike a 24 inch women s frame and a 26 inch women s mountain bike with a large tube design Each of them fit the rack without any additional parts or hardware Solid design It doesn t rock sway or rattle nor do the bikes Even at freeway speeds everything stays put Bad points Less than easy installation It comes with a bolt and locking nut for mounting to the receiver instead of allowing the use of a regular pin The hole is too small for a pin This is supposedly to make it more solid see good points above However I plan on buying a different collar and bolt style stabilizer and drill out the hole so I can use my locking pin Pulling out wrenches every time I want to put the rack on or off my truck is a PAIN Ok I guess that is my only beef with it right now Overall you get more than you pay for with this rack If you are on a budget I highly recommend it 
4 0 Very good rack that CAN hold 5 bikes If I could give this rack 4 5 stars I would I have owned this rack for about a month First off it was easy to assemble and has a quality feel to it Once attached to my hitch it is easy to load and unload You load 1 bike from the backside of the rack and 4 from the front I put 3 26 mountain bikes and 2 20 BMX style bikes on it with no problem The tie downs are easy to use and the optional lower strap holds things in place nicely I was skeptical that this rack would actually hold 5 bikes but it does My only complaint about this rack would be that the hole in the end of the rack that goes into your hitch receiver is only 1 2 So if you want to use your standard 5 8 receiver lock you are out of luck The rack comes with a no wiggle bolt that holds the rack to the hitch BUT anyone could come along with a couple of wrenches and steal your rack SO I bought a 5 8 drill bit and made the holes bigger so I could use my standard hitch lock Now I can easily take my rack on and off and not worry about the rack being stolen while out riding our bikes 
4 0 Good value for the price This glove fits very well and is comfortable to wear It seems to breathe relatively well and can be secured by the velcro straps I m very happy with mine for purposes of an everyday workout glove Would recommend 
4 0 Focus on lifting weights not getting blisters I recently started casually lifting at the gym After getting into heavier weights I found that my limits were more based on what pain my hands could take from holding the metal weights and bars instead of what my muscles could lift So I bought these gloves and couldn t be happier Now I can focus on lifting the weight rather than worrying about my hands getting torn up I m new to weight lifting but even for light to moderate weights these gloves make a big difference I m sure other gloves would do the trick too but these had a great price and look They run small so order a size up if you re uncertain 
4 0 Try It On First I am satisified with these gloves However I had to cut the area between the ring finger and index finger because it was sewn too closely When my hand was in the glove that area bit into my hand I am uploading a photo so can see what I am talking about because I may not be explaining myself very well Other than that I like the gloves They smelled of heavy chemicals when I got them Just FYI you might want to wash them with your unimportant laundry to get the toxic smell out I did not wash mine And these gloves do not turn my hands black That s nice Had I first tried them on at Sports Authority I may not have bought them But after making the small cuts in the gloves they perform fine 
5 0 Perfect For Me I wear them riding my bike to work and back I work out doors and handle alot of money they are perfect for counting money keeping my hands warm and riding my bike They are well made and strong 
5 0 Hubby s 1st ADULT bike Surprised Hubby for his Birthday and he was amazed that very little assembly time was needed He enjoys pedaling around the neighborhood acting like the little boy I know exists inside him 
5 0 Schwinn bike Very nice bike My wife and I each got one for afternoon rides Easy on the old bones Great price and free shipping 
5 0 Great Bike Easy assembly I found the assembly for this bike to be very easy You ll need a ratchet 2 sockets an open end wrench 2 hex wrenches and about 40 minutes Handlebars Seat Front Tire Pedals Air in the tires Then final adjustments to the seat handlebars That s it My brakes gears needed no adjustments The reviewer who had trouble must have truely gotten the oddball item My guess is that his cycle was a returned item that was re shipped with the parts thrown haphazardly back in the box After 35 years of riding racers the upright riding position will take some getting used to for me Still I found the bike s ride smooth comfortable with my Amazon gold box discount the free Super Saver shipping this was a great bike at a great price 
5 0 A great bike at a bargain price I printed the picture of the bike and assembled it in about 1 hour Most of the time I had to search for tools I took it for a ride and the bike was terrific I priced similar bikes at bike shops on Cape Cod and they were asking more for beat up rental used junk Buy this bike you cannot find a better deal 
4 0 Nice Bicycle I grew up with a single speed bicycle and later purchased a 10 speed when they were all the craze and hated it It was so very uncomfortable nothing worked well and all those gears and levers made me nuts That put the end of my recreational bicycle riding until now I like this bicycle This is my first bicycle in 20 years so I am amazed at the light weight of this machine The electric blue paint is briliant and exciting and two of my adult neighbors have commented that they really like the style I do too I am 5 8 175 lbs and have found this bicycle to be a comfortable size for me The riding position is upright and comfortable just like it was when I was a kid No stooping over into a racing position for me The 7 gears work easily and smoothly with an easy rotating motion on the right hand grip No more goofy levers for me The hand brakes work well and are quiet No more squealing brakes for me The seat is comfortable for a 2 hour ride along Chicago s Lake Michigan bicycle path No more skinny and painful seats for me The tires are fat and ride smooth like they were when I was a kid No more skinny and rough riding tires for me I find this bicycle to be an overall pleasureable riding experience Before you get me wrong I am not against speciality bicycles or technology in any way I m just not a technology victim I just want technology to work for me and I don t want to pay for capability that I will never use I want a comfortable ride that can keep up with most of the pack and this bicycle meets those requirements for me The bicycle arrived in good condition and was secured in the shipping box very professionally It took me a while to assemble the machine foot pedals handle bar assembly seat assembly front wheel inflate tires and adjust the seat and handle bar height The bicycle comes with an owners manual with an overwhelming amount of assembly information that is mostly useless Most of it pertains to other models and assembly that has already been done at the factory If you have a few good tools take your time don t get overwhelmed by the printed material and have a little mechanical ability you will get the assembly done in a few hours My tips Make sure that the front fork is facing in the correct direction I put it together backwards which made the front tire hit my foot every time I turned the handlebars Don t inflate the front tire until AFTER you install it on the frame The inflated tire will never clear the brake pads Inflate the tires fully before you check to see if the brakes need adjusting The wheel rims will shift slightly when the tires are inflated changing the alignment with the brake pads and I did need to do some adjusting of the front brakes The front wheel has some wobble to it but nothing serious If you don t have any mechanical ability and some basic tools I would not recommend trying to assemble this bicycle You won t find this bicycle in a Schwinn store and the closest Schwinn model that they have will cost you almost double Four stars 
4 0 A great product for very little money I purchased this child carrier seat for when we visit the grandparents At home a have a trailer that both of our kids ride in This little bike seat was perfect for the occastional use Some of the shields that are meant to protect the child from the wheel are a little flimsy so I would not want to take them on and off on a regular basis Once it s on the bike it should probably stay there But for our purposes where I didn t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a second bike trailer to be used for maybe a month out of the year that was great bang for the buck I had my 2 year old riding in the back and he was perfectly happy safe 
5 0 Great deal I have used my 3bike xport FreeLoader Hitch rack on a 4000 mile trip this winter and it works beautifully is extremely stable and easy to use Highly recommended especially at the great Amazon com price 
4 0 Helmet Mounted Mirror Much better than the conventional round mirrors which are only slightly larger than a dental mirror In many cases I still needed to twist around to see no pleasure with a bad back It has not been an issue with this mirror 
5 0 The best rearview mirror you can buy I purchased this after using a friends and it is fantastic The quality is second to none It attaches to you glasses easily and stays put It is easy to adjust in just about any direction I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a rearview mirrow for biking 
5 0 The best way to look behind you I had never used before a small mirror like this however it took me 1 minute getting used to it Believe me there s no better way to look behind you The closeness of the mirror to your eye gives an incredibly big picture of things behind By the way one mirror is enough to look both to your left and right rears 
5 0 Best Cycling Mirror This mirror is great It is easy to attach to glasses and is very durable As it is somewhat larger than other mirrors it provides a very good field of view It was very easy to get used to and now I wouldn t ride in traffic without it One turn of the head and I can scan everything behind me much more confidently than turning my head The mirror is VERY durable It fell out of my pocket while attached to sunglasses and was run over by a car The glasses were ruined and the mirror was unscathed and I m using it a year later 
5 0 Cute colorful pizza set Educational too Our daughter loves this pizza set It s wonderful for pretend play as our daughter loves to pretend to take our orders and mix and match the toppings to create her own custom slices pepperoni only for daddy mushroom and broccoli for mommy please We re also using it to learn very basic math skills It helps her visualize 1 2 and 1 4 and understand simple addition and subtraction If you have three broccoli florets and take one away how many are left This is a nice quiet travel toy As it is made of fabric it is soft and lightweight and the velcro helps keep all of the pieces together We just returned from a long road trip with this toy and didn t lose a single piece 
4 0 decent enough for a compass I must admit I like it The compass is very precise and the brass case feels nicer to hold than a plastic case Outside of that the compass does and feels like it should I would however recommend a cheaper plastic cased compass for those who don t use a compass that often Enough said 
5 0 well rested camper I took this for a weekend hiking camping trip and was very pleased with it The comfort astounded me to be perfectly honest I was told beforehand that the self inflatable mats usually needed some help blowing up via mouth the first time or so because of being packaged so tightly for a period of time This was true but not a problem whatsoever It took only a couple of minutes to have it all set up and it stayed full and comfortable the entire weekend The mat compacts fairly well and is definitely light enough to take along on any hiking trip I think it is well worth the money 
5 0 Great Quality we are so looking forward to using this over the spring and summer this year i have purchased bocce ball sets in the past and this one sure has the heft that will make it comparable to proper sets but without the huge price 
5 0 Great box for the money We purchased this particular model for weekend trips It fits a full size roller suitcase and another large duffle bag which for us frees up the back space of our suv so our labrador can join us Great item 
5 0 This product is great I love my Thule rack The sidekick is the perfect size its not too big and not too small It is easy to install on top of the car and doesnt make a lot of noise 
4 0 Really did the job for us I bought this with some skepticism having read other reviews that gave it low marks and also having bought Thule products in the past and cursed them as I tried assembling and installing them what with missing pieces and the like Happily this box is fine It does seem flimsy when you re assembling it and it even seems that way when it s open on top of the car It seems to be engineered to be as light as possible which it is and that can be unnerving until you get it fastened down and locked closed Assembly It s awkward It took two of us me and my 2 year old Seriously It s a bit hairy for one person to get it right since you have to match the hinges with the sides of the clam shell and their fit doesn t seem quite right until you tighten them up well Still it went OK about 20 minutes for me to do far better than a Thule roof racks I installed some years back where I was dealing with bent and missing parts If you do this alone you need to brace it well at an angle as you hook the top and bottom together Much easier with two people Installation Dead easy on the factory roof rack We have a Pontiac Aztek THERE IS NO NEED TO BUY ADDITIONAL BRACKETS though when viewing ads for this you might think so at first glance The package includes 4 U brackets which attach to your roof racks and are held inside by hand swivel bolts whatever they re called One thing I added while doing the installation was to put duct tape over the inside holes for the U brackets There are several holes in each sequence and you only use two out of 4 or 5 the others are exposed Covering with tape might help keep spray out Performance Pretty good We drove 2300 miles with this unit of which about 300 were in driving rain During the worst rain we did have dampness and some droplets of water at the bottom front inside but the gear was sitting up on ridges and was fine bag in front was damp but not wet If you have cloth bags that press to the very bottom I d put them in plastic if you ll be hitting heavy rain and ours was VERY heavy and at 70 mph driving speed We noticed an increase in wind noise at high speeds and in our rough tests it knocked about 2 mpg off our gas mileage at 75 mph but on a 50 mph stretch of several hundred miles we couldn t tell a difference Removal takes literally five minutes You undo by hand four pairs of swivel bolts and lift it right off the roof Reinstallation is about the same Overall we re extremely happy with it and very glad we bought it 
5 0 The best trainer you can buy I have had several other trainers of this type that were used by my son and myself for training on Road Mountain and Recumbent This one is the best From the moment you heft it out of the shipping carton until you set it up you know this is quality and not like all the others It is BUILT strong I am 6 3 and 215 lbs This trainer acts like I m not there The greatest feature is the quietness with which it operates You can watch the Spinerval DVD or TV and not have to be blasted off the seat Bike mounting on the trainer is straight and very simple while being very secure I love it and use it regularly with great results 
4 0 Wonderful I bought this for my husband to use and he LOVES it The only thing I can say negative is that it is quite noisy and he has to have the TV turned way up in order to hear the directions above the noise of his spinning 
5 0 love my sore muscles I got this trainer thinking that it would be a good workout for days when I was too lazy to carry my bike downstairs or go to the gym I ve taken spinning classes for a few years and never thought that using a trainer would produce a workout as intense as my classes This trainer definitely does I ve never used another one so I have nothing to compare it to but I LOVE this trainer Keeping the resistance up will give you a great workout and you can use your gears modify the resistance while riding It remains stable even when I stand up on it Overall I just love it It s quiet easy to use and takes up minimal space 
5 0 Kurt Kinetic has the best fluid trainer I ve had my Kurt Kinetic Road Machine since 2001 and it has never leaked I put an average of 1200 miles per winter on it and it s always been reliable relatively quiet and has a better feel than any non fluid trainer The Road Machine Pro has an even heavier flywheel so offers an even better feel I d say The best thing you could do is read the reviews on other sites Try a couple out at a local bike shop and then buy the best After all my initial reviews and ongoing knowledge of bike trainers Kurt was and still is the best 
4 0 great beach cruiser Got this bike for my husband and I put it together first as a surprise It would have been nice if it came with allen wrenches The instructions aren t the greatest either Once it was all together though it works great and looks cool cruising down the beach road 
5 0 Great Cruiser Bike delivered on time was easy to assemble and is great for cruising around town I use the bike for exercise and ride for an hour plus each day A good choice 
5 0 Coolio PeeWee Herman Cruizin Park Ave is hip hop cool its a splash on campus delivery was prompt nothing broken took about 15 20 min to assemble just need a bell and basket now 
5 0 Excellent for sparring This practice weapon handles very well and feels comfortable in my hands Its weight in my hands is very comfortable And I am able to execute all my movements easily with it It is worth the price of purchase 
5 0 Good product I have pretty soft skin and these don t give me blisters after wearing for an hour or two They work ok in the rain and with occasional washing have managed to not reek 
4 0 wonderful camping chair i used this chair in the north georgia woods for 3 months while i hiked and camped it is comfortable and easily carried it isn t a huge chair and it folds in half for many options on your pack however i m a taller guy and i needed a taller back b c the support poles poked my back the chair is not water proof so sitting on wet ground will usually result in a wet 
4 0 Lightweight and comfortable We ve only used these chairs once but I can already see that they re going to save our backs I ll never sit in the bleachers without one again Highly recommended to fellow race car fans 
5 0 Awsome Home Gym I bought my Xtreme 2 from Bowflex because at the time they offered free shiping But since Amazon ships this item from Bowflex anyway its still a great deal here Even after a month of using this machine I can t believe how well its made and how many exercises you can do It does not take up much room either I looked at home gyms far and wide and for me I could not find a better value for the price and quality I also comes with instructions and a diet plan to help you to get a Bowflex Body 
5 0 I bought it and I like it All five boxes arrived in relatively good shape some punctures but not bad The internal components are packaged in styrofoam so they are well protected I decided on the Xtreme2 after trying out the Bowflex SE and the Xtreme 1 The Bowflex SE s seat was very uncomfortable for me and didn t have the multi pulley system like the Xtreme2 so it would require a little more effort to move cables around I would recommend the Xtreme2 over the SE for a few hundred dollars more Setup took me about 4 hours but I was moving at a slow pace so as not to miss any components The instructions are pretty good When assembled you can see that this is a real solid piece of workout equipment Bowflex did a good job on it Have been using it for approx a month and am amazed at the many positions that are available and probably lots more if you use your imagination Highly recommend the Xtreme2 for those who know that this is the machine that they want Serious bodybuilders should go elsewhere because the resistance is a totally different feel and I know the weights do not compare one to one for the Bowflex versus free weights For anyone wanting to put on muscle and tone this is a great machine If your sole purpose is to get huge you should get some type of power rack I did call Bowflex three times with some minor questions comments and they answered the phone within 15 seconds each and every time day or night Great customer satisfaction One last thing if you are serious about working out and are fairly strong get the 310 upgrade because it will make changing out rods much easier for you Look around for prices too Also one more comment I purchased a 50 x60 rubber mat from Amazon for approx 49 and it is pretty nice but I don t really think you need one for the Bowflex since it sits only on the four corner legs and nothing else touches the floor anyway You probably could get by with some small size pads Try one out somewhere before you buy and Good luck 
4 0 Very Nice Machine This machine is very well put together and Xtremely sturdy It took a friend and I two hours to put it together so be prepared for that While assembly was a bit trying the end results are worth it As a 40 year old man I wanted to start working out again I hadn t worked out since my Memphis State days and I didn t want to join a gym I have the 410lb model and it will be all the resistance that I ll ever need As I said earlier the motion is smooth and challenging While the power rods do deliver tough resistance it is not challenging as free weights For example I can bench press 300lbs on my X2 but on free weights I can do only about 240lb That is a big difference and all the exercises are that way too That being said I still find the bowflex to be a great homegym and I m getting the results I desire I m not trying to get as huge as a wrestler but the bowflex is changing my body and adding mass Don t pay attention to the bowflex commercials where the guys are ripped to the bone That just won t happen on a bowflex machine and I m glad they ve started showcasing real people with real results For the average man or woman this machine will deliver With around 100 different exercises and variations you can target all your muscles legs chest arms abs back and shoulders I m very please with the 10 months I ve been on the machine Though its kinda pricey its worth using my tax refund on it If you are thinking about a homegym the I highly recommend this machine You should also upgrade to AT LEAST 310lb rods because the leg exercises are pretty easy and you ll need the extra rods For guys I think you should get the 410lb rods because you ll see rapid results I ve gone from benching 220 to 300lb in less than a year There are cheaper machines and free weights will give you much better results But if you re looking for an all in one machine that will last for years then try the Xtreme2 
4 0 Quality Product and Convenience So far with two weeks and a handful of workouts under my belt I m pleased with the Xtreme 2 The unit is very well built with heavy gauge steel tubing and platform and the cables and pulley system appear to be very durable It s very easy to adjust the pulleys and install remove accessories Moving from one exercise to another is very quick once you get into the routine I m still using the basic 9 exercise routine but the book shows a huge number of variations in the exercises This should keep me from getting bored with the machine I didn t like one of the exercises in the routine and finding another that worked the same muscle group was no problem I have found that some exercises require you to maintain a somewhat difficult balancing position I suppose this will become easier as my conditioning improves and again the variety of exercises available allow you to avoid those that are too difficult Another minor gripe is that some exercises are a bit uncomfortable The leg accessory for example puts stress on the back of my legs when doing extensions The padding could be a little softer to reduce this discomfort I ve had gym memberships for many years prior to owning the Xtreme 2 This unit provides an excellent workout in the privacy of your own home I m sure I ll appreciate it even more in January when I don t have to bundle up and venture into 10 degree temperatures to drive to the gym I ll just walk down into the basement in shorts and a t shirt and get started 
5 0 Pleasantly Surprised I did a ton of research before buying the X2 I run on a treadmill 3 or 4 days a week about 12 15 miles a week and work up a good sweat and my lower body is pretty lean However being almost 40 and not having trained with weights since high school I felt I needed to start doing some weight resistance training particularly on my upper body Well after 3 weeks I can tell a huge difference after using this machine I m also glad I got the X2 instead of the X because of the ability to work out faster without pully changes I also have been able to gradually increase the weight so that I m going to buy the two 50 rod extensions I highly recommend this machine to anyone who doesn t feel comfortable in a gym and or just doesn t have the time to go I have small kids and being able to hit this machine at 5 30 am when everyone is still asleep is a huge benefit for me As for assembly it was fairly easy if you follow directions The only difficult part was the pully system make sure you have it right as that is the backbone of the entire system The pics in the instructions could have been a little clearer Otherwise bottom line is that this thing works and was a great purchase 
5 0 bowflex xtreme 2 really works I think the bowflex xtreme 2 is awesome I now have had it for about 2 weeks and I can really feel a difference I recommend this machine to the person serious about a good home work ou 
5 0 Note on design flaw I wanted to write a review concerning the design flaw mentioned in the previous review I to had this issue when I first got my bowflex and was quite frustrated particularly when I read the review on this site I decided to try turning the power rods around just to see if this worked and in my case it did I had to unscrew each power rod from the base turn it ensure it locked into place and then rescrew it back to the base After doing this even the flimsy 5 pound rods no longer hit the cross bar After doing this I contacted bowflex to see what they had to say about this issue They informed me that they were working on a fix that would be sent out as soon as it was done My main reason for writing this was to make sure anyone else that had this issue and found this review knew that the issue IS solvable at least for some cases As to the bowflex itself I have only been using it for about a week now but really enjoy the versatility as well as the action of the rods and pulleys It is very smooth and easy to use and I would definitely recommend it for the average user My roommate is a fitness guy ex fitness trainier he worked out on it a few times and definitely felt that you could get pretty cut toned with this machine if you are looking for bulk look elsewhere 
5 0 Great for arm strengthening and toning I ordered two sets and use the balls on a daily basis for arm strengthening and toning I taught myself how to juggle when I was in graduate school to release frustration when I was writing those long theses Anyway now I juggle with the weighted balls and it has really helped tone my arms overall They are the perfect size and weight I keep them right by my bed so I don t miss a day 10 minutes a day is all it takes 
5 0 Great Family Fun Product Since assembling this product we have had great fun playing against each other or individually The assembly instructions were good up to the point of assembling the height adjustment It was easier to look at the picture on the box and figure it out rather than use the instructions 
4 0 Very Nice This is a really nice basketball system but the instructions were very difficult to follow it took 3 adults 3 hours to put it together I would definately recommend this product just make sure you have plenty of patience when it is time to put it together 
4 0 basketball hoop system Can find no fault in the product but had to spend two days on the phone to get DHL to deliver to rural address 
5 0 The other comments are accurate This is a very nice basketball system and the instructions are a challenge But the bottom line is this is very much worth the money and the time to put it together 
5 0 Just what we wanted This basketball hoop is nice looking sturdy and perfect for home use Someone else set it up for me and said it wasn t that complicated but it did take some time and work I did take notes from the other reviewers and passed them on to the person who put it together It arrived in perfect condition with all the parts and arrived on time Overall we are very pleased 
5 0 Quality product Sturdy product Great value for the money Easier than expected to put together 
5 0 Great product great value Bought this item to upgrade my daughter s starter hoop to something better It takes a little thought and review to decipher the instructions but the final product is definitely worth the effort This is a good quality product and we re delighted with the both the looks and the features of this backboard 
5 0 portable Basketball Hoop This is an excellent product for the money We researched quite a bit before we bought it and read all the reviews on amazon We were a little worried about putting it together becasue of all the negitive reviews we read But we didn t have any trouble It went together simply and easily We were careful to read all the instuctions before we began and kept ready a few steps ahead and it wasn t hard at all Our kids have been playing non stop ever since 
5 0 BEST BUY I HAVE EVER MADE THE PORTABLE BASKETBALL SYSTEM I PURCHASED WAS THE THE BEST BUY I COULD HAVE EVER MADE IT WAS BETTER THAN BETTER IT WAS GREAT MY GRANDSON WAS TO HAPPY THANKS AGAIN FOR ALL THE LOVE ON THIS PURCHASE HAPPY NEW YEAR GWEN JOHNSO 
4 0 Camelbak support items Performs just as described Excellent way to control drying of hydration bag Shop around to get this below MSRP 
5 0 It Does Its Job With No Aftertaste Before I rarely used my CamelBak Zoid because it was insulated so I could go skiing with it because did not have a removable reservoir and therefore could not be cleaned well Because it never got a good cleaning it still had a plasticy aftertaste and one day I forgot to empty it and left water in it for a few days and some funk began to grow in it Thats when I broke down and bought the cleaning kit I did not get a lot of crud in the reservoir because I could clean it out with a regular brush but I pulled out a lot of green gunk from the hose thanks to the hose cleaning pipe After that I ran the cleaning tab in there This made such a difference Not only was the mold and crap gone but the plasticy aftertaste was gone too Now I use my CamelBak for biking and all kinds of other outdoor activites Also the tabs didn t leave a bleachy aftertaste I was worried because they smell quite chemically when you put them in 
4 0  does this gun have a charging rod and also how long does it tak e for it to chARge anhow many yards acan it shoot 
5 0 Awesome Gun best gun ever shoots hard and fast i have two of them they are sweet buy this gun 
5 0 advanced or not great gun i bought this gun for battles in the woods with my buddys and i works great pick off my friends for 50m away this is a great gun for any one shoots hard shoots fast and best of all this is my most accurate gun i have and i own over 17 so all in all great gun best machince gun i have if you want a machine gun buy this on 
5 0 you people have no clue what ur talking about my bro has one of these and it has had for half a year already u ppl just need to take better care of it im not kid i just do not have an acount he bought one off the site awhile ago hello kitty mommy lol 
5 0 Great gun for 25 This gun seen under a bunch of different names here at Amazon if they look alike chances are they re all the Double Eagle M83 really impressed me the day it came only 4 business days to ship from LA to PA While I was waiting for the battery to charge I toyed around with the gun The sight that comes standard on the gun is pretty handy but it s almost required to remove the handle part of the sight nearest the trigger to but the electric sight on Even then it s more of a showy accesory than anything because you have to aim higher than the crosshair shows The flashlight is a nice addition to everything as well You have to be careful when putting on the strap because my friend who bought the same gun put his on and the strap came off resulting in the gun falling to the ground the barrel hitting first and the mock silencer broke off My strap hasn t failed me yet just like every other part of the gun So now to the fun If you plan on using this gun during wars capture the flag etc I strongly suggest you buy an extra magazine and speed loader and practice reloading The gun is accurate up to about 30 feet until it starts to curve a little unless you use the useful hop up system By switching the lever from normal to hop up mode your gun puts more of a backspin on the BBs making them curve upwards and get more distance This is great for shooting people high up that are far away once you get the aiming down The automatic function is a lot of fun and great for taking out lots of people during gameplay The magazine runs out fast though so use it sparingly I measured the FPS to range between 220 260 depending on battery power type of BBs 12 gram giving the highest FPS and wind I ve used it for 2 battles so far both of which were about 4 hours long The battery didn t even show signs of slowing down so just keep it charged and you ll be fine I highly recommend this gun to anyone looking to impress and have hours upon hours of fun with friends PROS 6 setting adjustable shoulder stock easily caters to your shooting style High battery life keeps you in the game all day long Gun hasn t jammed once in over 8 hours of use Hop up system is great for that extra distance Looks pretty sweet Accessories Flashlight Electronic Sight Extra Barrel are a fun addition the gun Powerful but not too powerful for children of all ages Realistic look and weight gives you the feel of an actual M16 CONS Only accurate up to about 30 feet until BBs begin to curve Plastic screw on barrel has a chance of breaking if dropped on barrel Sight can be complicated until you get used to the gun Reloading can be annoying but not a problem if you practice 
5 0 Great Gloves I bought these gloves for my high school son He wanted a glove that would still allow for some dexterity He rides his bike daily to school around town and on paper route He has worn these gloves daily since they arrived They are sufficient for most days in Northern Ohio and are thin and fitted enough to wear as a liner under another pair of warmer gloves for the coldest days low teens and below They seem to be wearing well 
5 0 Great for winter running I can t speak highly enough of this product Running is one of many physical activities I engage in throughout the year but during the cold winter months the skin on my hands gets dry and cracks from the icy cold Wearing these gloves has virtually eliminated the need for moisturizing hand lotion and the band aids I would have to wear over my cracked knuckles after a January or February jog They re also surprisingly durable considering that they re fairly thin and made of the same material as the company s high tech workout shirts 
5 0 Being a BIG Procrastinator I LOVE IT I just opened my Gazelle after buying it for myself for Christmas yes I thought of every excuse in the book I finally put it together and did my first workout I also bought the tapes I highly recommend getting the tape because he teaches you all of the techniques and the time goes by very quickly I had the option of doing 10 minutes beginner 20 intermediate or 30 minutes advanced I opted for the 20 minutes for my first time and it was great I really look forward to doing this tomorrow Again the tape is great it s a 3 pack I did the lower body workout because it s not all about just gliding back and forth Tony teaches you that it s all different techniques It is also light and easy to fold up and put away which is a plus I look forward to doing this tomorrow 
5 0 You have to be the speed Obviously this machine doesn t have a speed dial so you control the speed You have to direct your own workout and really have the drive to make your own workout Other than that it s easy to set up fun to use and does the job for the price If you want something cheap because you can t afford the real thing this is a perfect buy 
5 0 Tony s Gazelle What a great piece of exercise gym equipment The overall body workout plus the non impact regime is perfect for all In just 10 20 minutes a day on the gazelle makes a significant difference in my general health I love it 
5 0 Good Machine I bought this because I was just looking for a low cost machine that I could use in my spare time I was not looking for a hard core workout machine so the Gazelle Edge is perfect There s not any resistance but I found that if you buy some ankle weights and use them while on the machine it works very good This machine is perfect to use while watching TV instead of just sitting on the couch I have stress fractures from running and there s no impact so this is a good machine to get the heart rate up and a good workout 
5 0 Great workout The Little Gazelle Edge Fitness System is exactly what I was looking for The workout is perfect for an older person like myself who is looking to put some exercise into thier life but are just getting started I highly recommend this product to everyone 
4 0 It is what you make it I just finished my first workout on the Gazelle Edge I wanted something that would make aerobic excercise convenient in my garage when the weather is nasty and I didn t want to spend alot of money Overall it did a very good job for what I wanted I had been using a very inexpensive machine with a similar motion for many years with great success My previous machine ran on a track with wheels and like the Gazelle had handles for arm motion although separate from the foot action no tension adjustment and had a very basic computer I literally wore this old machine out I decided since I had stuck with this machine for so long I could treat myself to something fancier I knew it wouldn t become a clothes hanger I started my hunt and tried several high end fancy expensive units but kept saying to myself why do I need all this stuff Would I even use it Most retail stores I checked only carried things with bells and whistles so I searched yard sales and Goodwill for something simple with no luck It was all too fancy and still expensive or too beat up and run down Anyway I did a search on Amazon thinking if I was going to spend a bunch of money I better know what I was getting I found the Gazelle read the reviews and decided to give it a try It seemed like many different abiliity levels were happy with it the price was fair and the motion similar to what I was used to Glad I did I think it s going to be great As far as no tension adjustment I don t have a problem with that maybe because I m used to it It also seems like you can get more tension in the arms by pulling against the motion of your feet My only big complaint why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that the speed calibration on the computer is very choppy for lack of a better word I would be going at very fluid steady pace and the speed reading would vary 2 3 mph in a period of just a few seconds I tried it at slow and fast speeds always the same The only one that I think was accurate was 0 I have always used the speed on my old unit to help me regulate my interval training If I can t figure out a secret to getting to to read consistently I guess I ll have to guess at it Also I don t think you should rely on the calorie meter to be correct Like another reviewer mentioned you can t be sure of that without knowing alot of other variables But it is useful is comparing one workout with another If you write things like that down Not a complaint so much as an FYI If you are looking for an aerobic workout machine to use at home this should do the trick Just remember like any exercise program or machine the results you get are going to be a direct result of the effort you put into it 
5 0 Glad I bought it I ve been using the Gazelle Edge for 9 weeks now I ve been using it every day since the day it arrived for between 45 and 60 minutes at a time It has a smooth and silent operation and folds away when I m done using it I like that you can choose to make the work out session as easy or as hard as you want I wondered if it would be good quality and a pleasure to use and then easy to put away when I m done for such a modest price and have found that it is on all three counts Recently retired I needed something that would replace the two 30 minute walks I used to make every day to and from work This piece of equipment has done just that 
5 0 navTraffic is worth it I have this unit with a Pioneer AVIC D2 headunit I use it for both XM and NavTraffic I have to admit that NavTraffic s incident report isn t always very up to date and I really wish they would write WHEN the event occured Now it just says Accident next quarter hour but come back in 30 minutes and you still have the exact same message up on the screen However it is much better with the highway information And also if highway traffic is slow and you have a router programmed the unit will ask if you wish to go around the traffic jam Sometimes the alternative is worse because the unit doesn t know speeds off the highway so if you choose to avoid you may get in a worse traffic jam As far as the XM reception is good some channels at times sound like a 56kbps mp3 but most of the time it s good Also it sometimes doesn t get artist and song title information I m not sure if this is the unit s fault or xm s I would definitly buy this unit again especially with NavTraffic 
4 0 Why are there others I bought my Whisperlite in 1996 and have yet to have a problem with it I think I may have cleaned it once Simmering is a bit of a trick but if you use it several times before taking it into the woods you should be able to cook any food you can take in a back pack There are stories about these stoves going into meltdown during light up on cold days but it is always because the user either over primed the stove or was using a damaged fuel line If you accidentally over prime do not add more fuel Just let what you have burn off I have never had problems lighting the stove or keeping it going although I did run out of fuel once Light and VERY easy to use Funny thing it is a bit loud but you never notice until you turn it off 
5 0 Great product This is a fantastic concept I am currently in the Bermuda Regiment I am in the boat section of support company During weekend camps that we have once a month we travel to an abandoned warehouse that we store our boats in and we sleep there throughout the weekend The problem is that the warehouse along with almost the entirety of the rest of the abandoned naval base that it s on is in a state of disrepair Every year we do a little bit to make it better but nobody has done any work to the roof in donkey s years This makes for an interesting situation when it rains since the roof of the building is very leaky I ve been woken up in the middle of the night several times by rain water dripping on me in a steady stream Also there is the odd occasion where we have to create makeshift tents for ourselves when we sleep out on one of the islands Now I can stay warm and dry throughout my rest periods thanks to the tent cot Definitely worth every penny Though I don t think that I d want to have to go on a hike with it on my back along with the rest of my gear Thankfully my section doesn t have that issue Also I d like to note that the size of the cot is great for me I m 5 11 tall and weight about 155 lbs I fit inside the item with great ease This cot is slightly longer than the standard military issued cots that we have 
5 0 Convenient sturdy in a wind Strong rain safe w rainfly No it isn t horse proof I think one horse thought it was a couple of hay bales beside one another but I scared them off That was fun This thing is great After a quick fold up I started out storing it behind the passenger seat but couldn t easily reach though to the back seat well I optioned later to store it above some added cargo straps that I draped across the front and back sets of entrance handles sometimes provided in cars that will fold down to aid a person entering the vehicle So barely enough room for the top of my head and forget the interior ceiling light really unneeded as I have front map lights that are brighter anyway Get the rainfly it can be quickly placed in a strong rain if needed and then secured better once back inside the tent When I want to entertain a breeze I keep it folded inside should a strong rain sneak up later and wake me after a peaceful driftin off The storage case is nice now that it is home but seldom used it on the road Being separated from the somtimes wet insect filled ground is great but after arriving in cooler climates I debated on just what I could use as extra needed insulation below me as the provided foam pad insert works well for stability but does little to keep out the cold As an extra foam pad just seemed to defeat the portablilty issue I decided on just an extra regular sleeping bag The current small down bag I was using would insulate fine from the top as it would stay fluffy but as my weight would compress the down below me I found it did little to keep me warm from underneath but was exceptional to team up with the new one as an insert I have yet to try the giant down bag that was later given to me by my older brother as I proceeded along my journey I should mention the screening is great I doubt the almost microscopic No Seeums could even pose a problem Also I got the more expensive version with aluminum stucture which I would strongly advise from the standpoint of less weight and freedom from possible corrosion I even bought some pvc pipe and cheap bungee cords and made a sort of canopy using the rainfly and its zipper open entrance 
5 0 up off the ground away from the critters this is a very comfortable easy to set up sturdy product it is a little big to carry on your back we tried it but good for camping near the car 
4 0 Nice mags Well built mags heavy weight and durable I have dropped these a few times out of my gun and they survived They dissasemble very easily if needed and they look good to boot My only complaint is that they hold 40 or 45 rounds but they re only 4 bucks each so buy 3 or 4 You re gonna need it 
5 0 Perfectly comfortable perfectly priced I kind of went overboard researching products in this category Finally I went straight to the person who d be the first to sleep on it my 21 year old daughter It would be her bed during Christmas vacation Any recommendations I ask Without hesitation she recalled sleeping on the Wenger at a friend s apartment in NYC She said it was a huge step above other inflatable mattresses In my experience here s why it s so good it s big it s really comfortable it s super easy to inflate and deflate and it folds up nicely into the compact stowaway bag which is included Verdict I really cannot imagine a better value it s easily worth twice the price 
4 0 Mad Shoes Shoes are great cannot faulter them Am Hanging for the weather to cool a little to give them a propper flogging 
4 0 Good for the price Does what it says it s supposed to do Difficult if not impossible to store it in its built in zippered pack unless you want to spend a long time doing it 
4 0 Topeak Bike Cover We have a large high end bike collection We keep them in the garage covered and on racks These covers were one of two solutions for keeping our bikes in perfect shape the other was to put large sheds inside our garage that did not work because of space The covers fit the bikes well and are good quality The bikes are a little difficult to put onto the racks with the covers on them but overall we are satisfied with these covers We bought 8 covers and we use them all the time 
5 0 Simple and effective Nice addtion to your dart collection I have gotten better over time and I consistantly hit my flights now and these guys have done a great job of keeping my flights from getting mangled in just one night I haven t noticed any difference in my flight patterns so I guess the added weight at the end is nominal 
4 0 Worked well We purchased this for a hike that we were doing this year and previously at this same area we had a serious problem with Ticks This year we didn t even see any ticks so I can t say if this product would have helped in that area But we did see a lot of mosquitoes and of the 5 of us that went there was a total of 1 bite for both days we were in the woods The spray doesn t seem to repel the mosquitoes since we saw a lot of them and had them buzzing around us I am not sure of its killing power since I didn t see any dead mosquitoes on my clothes But I didn t see any live mosquitoes on my clothes either It was kind of a hassle treating the clothes prior to the trip so I would only recommend this product if you knew you were going to a bug infested location for a few days Otherwise use a more convenient bug spray 
5 0 This can scored big The Cardinals waste basket is a perfect fit in my son s room It is large enough to hold a week s worth of trash but small enough not to dominate the room And of course the brightly colored logo is perfect for the rabid Cardinals fan 
5 0 compass I bought this compass to use with my telescope and it is large enough to use and see with a red light at night 
5 0 Pacific Daisy Bike This is the most adorable bike ever My granddaughter loves it We needed a replacement for a defective part and it was immediately sent to us from the manufacturer Great product Great service Great value 
5 0 Great little bike My daughter is 3 and loves this bike Fits her just right and it was easy to assemble 
5 0 Wonderful gift I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift He was thrilled with it The knife is beautiful well balanced and has the basic function 
5 0 Great item for runners I use this product everyday It is great for sore muscles Especailly working out your quads and calfs after a marathon 
4 0 Nice purchase The Schwinn 203 was rather easy to put together About an hour by myself The only thing not real mastered yet is the computer Wish it had more button options but would rate it good for the price Easy delivery no need to be home and sign for delivery 
4 0 Schwinn recumbant exercise bike We love our new Schwinn exercise bike I checked consumer reports and this one was the best for the price 340 00 We were extremely happy with the fast shipping of the bike although the box was bashed in on the corners and box open The assembly was direct and not difficult except for the shoving of the back seat section into the front half of the bike It took all of our strength then we realized that the wiring was cramped up inside and we had to pull it apart again The next time we shoved the two together it slid easily and we watched for the wires This caution is not in the instructions you may even need to tape the wire to hold it in place maybe not the best design Everything else is an absolute peach The seat is very comfortable the monitor display is easy to read the seat is adjustable for two tall people the bike is super comfortable The warranty is at least a year Thanks Schwinn thanks Amazon for helping us get back in shape in time for Summer 
5 0 Excellent Buy This is a great bike for the money It has a variety of programs and resistance levels The higher resistance levels are quite challenging so I believe this bike would be great for all fitness levels This bike is extremely quiet during operation it is virtually silent I read a review on a different site before purchase and the expert stated that if you are going to get a low end bike that Schwinn was the only way to go Even though you could possibly save 100 and get a cheaper brand it just isn t worth it I completely agree with this reviewer For an extra hundred dollars you get so much more I am extremely happy with this purchase Assembly was fairly easy and all of the necessary tools were included in the box I have had the bike for a little over a month and I have not experienced a single problem with the performance or construction of the bike 
5 0 Happy with the Schwinn 203 I am age 60 have plantar fasciitis foot pain and cannot leave my disabled husband alone so needed a way to exercise indoors This 203 Schwinn recumbent has been excellent It is clearly a quality product very quiet The seat is supportive and comfortable so I do not need to use my hands to steady myself Thus I have begun doing arm lifts and such while I ride for a more complete workout I am a short 5 foot 2 1 2 inches but on the closest seat setting I can reach the pedals fine Anyone much shorter or with very short legs might have problems reaching Also it is not the walk through kind so you must be able to lift your leg over the center section to use it I wish it had a brighter or lighted digital readout and that it would read my pulse with only one hand on the side sensors but those are small problems I recommend it highly and would choose it again 
5 0 Impressive This is one of the few LED flashlight things that I really like It gives room filling light and you can hold it in the palm of your hand It is a dandy thing for camping and power outages and has a low power 25 setting for longer battery life It uses 4 AA batteries but gives almost as much light as a full size 4 D Coleman camping lantern with a krypton bulb The size is surprising small about the size of a regular 2 D flashlight minus the head It also has 2 small but nice features The top has a small loop handle made of wire that can be used to hang or attach it to things if you have small fingers it will fit 2 fingers through It also has small feet that you can slide out for greater stability My only concern is the battery life the package does not list it but the manufacturer s website claims 80 hours I am rather skeptical so carry spares just in case Mine has new batteries so I cannot tell 
5 0 Perfect Just what I was looking for Thank you for the amazingly fast delivery 
5 0 2 Lb Weighed Balls I absolutely love my 2 lb weights They are easy to hold in my hand I use them for a specific exercise video where holding hand held weighs would not work Thanks 
4 0 Very happy with this rack I have been using the rack for a couple of months and I am very happy with it It is quite solid and convenient to use The strap does not hurt the car at all It is slightly inconvenient to have to undo the strap to open the trunk of my car but it really only takes a few seconds It carries my bikes very securely and I can get them on and off the rack in no time One thing that was a surprise to me was the rack is fastened into the received with a special no wobble bolt rather than a standard pin This takes some time to install and you really need to torque the bolt if you want it to stay tight I have had to set aside the right size wrench and socket just for use here so that I can install uninstall the rack reasonably quickly I am also concerned that the first part to wear out is going to be that special bolt so I wish it had come with a spare 
5 0 Excellent Bike Hitch My future wife and I like to make a four hundred plus mile trip to visit friends on Mackinac Island in MI After several years of walking the hills there I decided to spend the money and buy this hitch so that we could take our bikes and see more of the island I was looking for a hitch specific attachment that would not rub or create scratches on the car I attached this to my Dodge Stratus and made the trip to and back without and problems The bike rack easily is mounted and unmounted to the car hitch with a bolt The rack fit easily in the trunk of my car when I don t need it The bikes fit securly in place I also used some bungie straps just to help secure my bikes a little more for the trip If I need to get something out of the trunk there is a quick release that lowers the rack a few feet so that I can swing the trunk hood open I am more then quite pleased with this bike rack and will continue using it for our camping and vacation trips to visit our friends 
5 0 Allen bike carrier does the job I ve had mine for three years now and it works well The strap that another review complains about is necessary It helps stabilize the rack in the 1 1 4 inch hitch If I had to do it over I probably would purchase a receiver with a 2 inch hitch they appear to be more stable for bike carriers But for those of us with the 1 1 4 inch receivers this rack works great The carrier is well made and keeps the bikes away from the car The strap does t harm the car my wife would kill me if I damaged her Lexus RX300 
5 0 Amazingly fun workout This is a wonderful workout from Cathe As a recent Cathe convert I am just begining her workouts and this one was so much fun The workout will make you sweat and provides a great cardio as well as weight work Cathe is encouraging and cues very well Don t get me wrong the workout is challenging no doubt there This will will remain in my dvd rotation because I can t wait to do it again 
5 0 Another gem from Cathe I LOVE this workout The choreography is simple yet fun and with the blasts you get an excellent low impact yet high intensity workout Many of the strength training moves are compound exercises which makes the work out both effective and efficient I wish I could say Cathe s low impact workouts are easier than her other workouts but she finds a way to work you to the max and challenge you every time 
5 0 Fun Exercise This ball is the least expensive of all my exercise equipment and yet I use it more than all the others It is very durable and alot of fun to use The foot pump makes it extremely easy to air up I usually have to add a little air every couple of weeks I use the exercise chart that came with the ball but I haven t viewed the DVD yet I highly recommend this kit 
5 0 Ideal exercise tool GoFit Burst Resistant Ball The GoFit Burst Resistant Ball exceeded my expectation The quality is worth the cost which is extremely reasonable This is my first purchase of a stability ball and I believe I made the right choice The package for the GoFit Burst Resistant Ball came with a DVD The instructor on the DVD is excellent and guides you smoothly through each exercise There was also a poster showing the different exercises for those who prefer this method I encourage anyone who wants to start focus their training on core areas such as the abdominals to purchase a GoFit Burst Resistant Ball The cost is reasonable and you get the added bonus of a DVD and a wall poster Including instructions on how to piece together the pump for the ball would be helpful But it is relatively ease to figure out Go GoFit great produc 
5 0 cool lion sword this sword i got for my mom for christmas she loved it so this sword is good for any collectio 
5 0 Nice and Neat The sword looks better in reality than in the picture It was suprisingly cool It arrived on time No problems here 
5 0 product was very nicely made sturdy and heavy the product ordered arrived quickly and packed cautiously I was happy with dealing with this dealer and the product was of better quality than I expected it would be It is sturdy well made and actually quite heavy It even looks better in person than on the pictures which any buyer knows is usually the opposite way around a good buy worth the money It slides easily out of the scabbard and was also sharpened My son likes it alot 
5 0 Impressive This lamp is worth the money and then some How often have you come up behind a bicycle at night on the street and seen the rider before you saw the little bitty blinky light they had hanging on their back That isn t going to happen here this thing is Bright Don t look straight at it in the dark from close range because it ll dazzle you pretty well Each of the two rows of lights has three facing back and one on each side and the two rows are switched independently so you can have two different flash patterns running at the same time The options for each switch are all 5 flash together steady ripple side to side and random I usually set the top row to flash together and the bottom to ripple Let me tell you this is one kinetic and eye grabbing display You ll actually see objects to either side of you reflecting the side firing lights as you ride past No one is going to miss you when you re pulling this lamp Yes it s pricey How much is it worth to you to have that bloody eight foot wide Hummer 2 see you in the dark Thought so Spend the cash you won t be disappointed Ride safe and enjoy 
5 0 best of the best various independent testers have concluded this light to the best of the best i am completely satisfied if you want very bright then this is the light for you 2 rows of lights independently controlled allows you a myriad of lighting patterns and intensity the light is pricey but this is one item i wouldn t suggest scrimping on designed and made in japan it is as expected well done 
5 0 Perfect tail light for your bike A friend got me one of these recently and I have to say it is the best light I ve ever used I get a lot of biking in especially in the early morning sometimes at night The light it emits is VERY bright you WILL be seen The lightbulbs on each SIDE of this thing add further visibility So far it is very sturdy and reliable There are two rows of lights You can illuminate one or both for maximum luminescence It offers several combinations of flash patterns which is cool 
5 0 Love this item My daughter got this for Christmas and she loves it Its easy to set up and fill with air and hold the air She mostly plays on it but so far its held up to a 2 and 4 year old Great product and worth the money 
4 0 Worth the money My wife left me and took all the furniture and the kids furniture so I needed some temporary replacements My 3 children told me that these air beds are more comfortable than there original beds Thanks for bailing me out of a bad situation 
5 0 Very nice for the price I purchased the Wenzel Twin air bed in anticipation of a friend coming to visit not for camping which was probably its intended purpose The air bed is very nice for the price very functional and easy to set up It took a few seconds to figure out the manual pump and then a few minutes to fill it up get ready to use a little elbow grease The beds are pretty short when fully inflated so I would agree with the buy two suggestion if you re using them at home If you re using them for camping and only need to get off the ground then you re probably more than fine with a single 
4 0 I thought Twin meant double bed I got this airbed thinking it was a double as it said TWIN on all the information However when I received it in the post it turned out to be a single I m still a little onfused but maybe it because I m British and twin means single in the US can anyone help me Twin in my opinion means double Or am I completely wrong Apart from my confusion and disappointment that I didn t get a double my poor dad had to sleep on the hard floor the bed is good quality and pumps up easily A good airbed but make sure when you buy the twin you realise it s a single or maybe I m the only person in the World to make a silly mistake like this 
5 0 Air Bed with integrated pump no batteries needed A+++ The best deal on Air Beds with integrated pump no batteries needed You can use your hands or foot to pump it I got 2 of them so placed one on top of the other they make normal hight bed for guests in the house or tent They keep iflation well the kids like to pump them without help VERY GOOD BUY 
5 0 Ultimate Fractional Motor I have had one of these fans since year 2000 I found my first one at the Real Goods store Used it in my truck instead of the air conditioner and in my trailer Then I took it to Haiti and used it in my jeep The A C works in that but is noisy and eats a lot of gasoline Basically I prefer a fan rather than chilled air The motor and wiring are still going strong very well built I had to replace the fan blade itself once A replacement blade unit was available thru a Marine Supply store Ca fra mo means Canadienne Fractional Motors These units are actually built in North America Northern North America Canada They still build things there I need to get another as I am in Kalifornya now and left my fan with the Jeep in Hayti I ll buy it thru Amazon as all other purchase methods require entering credit card data again 
4 0 Extremely Powerful Solid Construction After an extensive analysis of various battery and 12V fan options I decided to purchase this product to facilitate my cardio workouts Instead of mounting the fan to the dash of an automobile or boat I have attached it to one specific piece of equipment the LifeFitness 9500HR elliptical machine This is to aid cooling during my one hour 1 200 calorie workouts For this purpose it has done an excellent job The Caframo Ultimate 12V fan is the most powerful compact fan I have identified thus far With exceptionally solid construction it is far sturdier than other 12V or battery fans I have tested The quality components are evident throughout the design highlighted by a large machined brass knob that controls the angle Other design elements are questionable however The one feature of this fan that I dislike it s use of exposed soft fan blades In my particular application this has led to a vibration problem To realize the power and life required I have connected the fan to two 2 9 8 volt RC batteries in series for a total of 19 6V In this arrangement the fan develops an intense volume of air There is quite a bit of vibration that I assume is due to the flapping of the blades The lack of a housing which directs the airstream creates another problem Any crosswind however slight severely limits the fan s effectiveness It would seem almost impossible to use this in any outdoor application for this reason In short this is one of the best consumer 12V fans available However you may want to consider alternatives if the fan will be subjected to any disruptive airflows 
5 0 thanks thank 
5 0 Excellent cap This cap arrived only a few days after placing my order I was a little worried that the quality wouldn t be good since it only cost 3 99 but was pleasantly surprised at how great it looked and felt when it arrived A great deal 
5 0 Statistics do not support players complaints The new ball soon to be the old ball is a marvel of technology NBA players complained long enough and loud enough to the league to have it replaced Yet the statistics do not support the complaints Shooting percentage is up slightly this year with the new ball and does anyone believe that skills are up this year This ball will now become a collectors item Recreational players have a lot of options including a new ball reputed to need less frequent filling Ball preference for most of us is just that a preference Some prefer a tackier ball some less Some balls are great when dry less so when wet Like different shoes I like to keep a variety of balls around and choose depending on mood and conditions This should be as advertised an indoor ball only 
4 0 Great Ball Crazy price I have always been a nut for buying new products when it comes to basketball I have tried several basketballs when it comes to the higher level end balls NCAA Solution NAIA Rawlings Leather NBA Leather Game and now the NBA Composite Game ball I will say that when it comes to grip the NCAA Solution ball is still the tackiest of the basketballs but the new NBA game ball has a much better initial grip than the old Leather ball This has some advantages and disadvantages Grip Advantage Players with smaller hands will be able to grip this ball better The ball seems to almost stick to your hands whereas the old leather game ball did not Disadvantage The ball seems to also stick to the backboard whereas the other ball would glide off of it I did find that I was having problems bouncing the ball it did not bounce properly but this problem was fixed after a game of playing The old leather balls took months before they lost their plastic like feel I do not feel that the ball gets slick when wet as was the complaint of NBA players who played with the ball Obviously I am not at the caliber that they are at but I feel that the ball always had a constant grip whereas the old leather game balls would get slick when wet The downside to this all is the price I feel that the 100 price tag that most retailers are charging for this ball is a bit high Hopefully this ball will go down in price I am hoping that Spalding will take their cross traction technology to their other composite balls that way other players will be able to take advantage of the new panels Panels I really did like the new panels that this ball has I do feel that the bounce is more consistent with this new design Overall I still think i would prefer the NCAA Solution ball but this ball has a very short life span The NBA composite game ball is a high quality ball but if you enjoy the classic feel of leather you should buy the old game balls before they entirely zone them out 
5 0 FABULOUS Helps put my son back to sleep He s used it since he was 8 months and has used it every night he s now 2 5 yrs old LOVE IT 
5 0 The one thing that soothed my cranky son If I had to choose only one toy for my baby from all that he had in the first three years this would be it Hands down He was facinated by the sights and sounds and UNLIKE so many baby toys that have music this music was actually pleasant and easy to listen too Beautiful classical music Brahms Lullaby and a very nice rendition of twinkle twinkle little star Twinkle Twinkle was so smooth and calming it took me awhile to realize what I was listening to because it wasn t blaringly annoying My sons crib was in our bedroom for the first 6 months and listening to this crib toy play music was so calming and pleasant even for me It is a definite must have for your little gem It is the gift I ALWAYS give at baby showers 
4 0 very versatile We received this acquarium at a baby shower At first I was concerned it was going to be too TV like However it s very interactive and is appropriate for a broad range of developmental levels My daughter is 8 months old and still enjoys pulling the lever and spinning the ball As far as being a soothing instrument to aid in falling asleep I can t say this provided anything like that However often in the mornings she will wake up and play quietly for 5 10 minutes 
5 0 Very happy This is the second Ocean Wonders Aquarium I have bought My son took the first one for his second child s crib My first grandson won t go to sleep without the Ocean Wonders Aquarium playing its soothing music It is the best I wish I had one for my four children in the 70 s 
5 0 Awesome This is the best My daughter is now 17 months old she still uses it every day She has a hard time falling asleep the music light seem to be soothing to her I love it because she is able to turn it on when she s upset or is having a hard time falling asleep it turns off on its own She enjoys spinning the starfish turning the ball that opens closes the clam s mouth Now that she s tall enough she also gets a kick out of being able to reach up change the song herself by moving the switch at the top 
5 0 Wonderful little thing This is a great nighttime soother for my daughter She s now big enough to press the button to start it herself if she wakes up during the night and feels a little lonely 
4 0 Perfect match I love this basket I have wanted a removable basket for my crusier but wicker looks best on it I like being able to put all my stuff in the basket and then carry it around with me The basket is bigger than I thought it would be and it sets up high on my handlebars because of this I have had a hard time mounting a headlight which is required by law where I live at night 
5 0 Best used for the purpose intended First of all the thing to understand about this cable is how it is intended to be used You can use it as a low security bike lock with a padlock of your choice Onguard s web site rates the security of their products and the rating on this one indicates the amount of security it provides You can also use it in tandem with a u lock to secure your front wheel to the u lock and the rest of your bike In this situation the security provided should be quite good Secondly the quality of this cable is outstanding for what it is All of the pieces fit together very nicely and the materials used are excellent This is a far nicer choice than many others out there So if you are looking for a decent lock in low crime areas or if you want something to use with your more protective u lock this is a great choice On the other hand if you think you can use this and some padlock you ve got lying around then you are going to be disappointed 
5 0 Weight Training Without Space Anyone interested in weight training without a lot of space at home to do it will love this small set The weights are easy to change 
4 0 Very good for the price I have this set but not in the cool black color Amazon has I got mine from walley mart for a few dollars less They sell the dumbbells with 24 pounds weights for about sixty dollars and the add on 24 pound pack is another thirty Mine is in blue and yellow so the color amazon has might be worth spending the few extra dollars for Amazon has since changed the picture to reflect what I have color wise With that said I m female I was interested in the bow flex 552 set until I saw it at my local store Good god they are HUGE I thought about the 220 set which I m sure is smaller but no one carried it in store And since I didn t want to go through the hassle to ship it back if I didn t like them I passed on the 220 The Sports blocks are far smaller then the bow flex set perfect for women or teens and people with not much space The weights themselves seem well made my only concern is the changing pin for changing the weights The hand is plastic with two metal pins and a small knock you turn You turn the knob pull the pin out and move it to another weight The knob is what locks it in place I believe the knob is metal but again it sits in a plastic housing the handle and I have bad night mares of it breaking while over my head So far though they have been fine just plastic makes me nervous when its holding 20 pounds over my precious skull The weights are very easy to change except for when you try to put all 48 pounds on them For some reason it has a hard time lining up and with the pins being on a plastic handle you really don t want to force it in It would have been better to charge another 10 bucks and make the whole pin handle metal Other then that time will tell how long this pin handle will last I hope Gofit sells replacements for it Still if your short on cash but need a good adjustable set that will grow with you you really can t go wrong with this set I would have given this set a 5 if not for the plastic pin handle 
5 0 GoFit Sportblock This is a great pair of adjustable dumbbells at a fraction of the cost It is very simple to use and takes the place of 8 sets of dumbells in a very small space It has a great trey that everything fits in and besides it just looks cool The DVD workout that comes with the GoFit Sportblock is incredible It is produced by Mark Verstegen who is the owner of Athletes Performance and is considered the best trainer in the nation Mark s workout is very simple and takes about 20 minutes to do the whole thing but I have seen incredible results in my arms stomach legs and butt It is awesome Buy it you won t be sorry and you will see incredible results 
5 0 Best Ever We love this water bottle One thing we like that a previous poster did not is the fact that it s made with the hard polycarbonate plastic That means it doesn t leach plastic particles and plastic taste into your water This water bottle is a real boon to lactating women it may be TMI but when you re making milk you need to drink lots of water and this bottle makes it easily accessible and yet spill proof which is helpful when you have a toddler on the loose LOVE the colors only recommendations is that Camelbak come out w some more colors in their largest bottle and that they create a 24 oz bottle that will fit in a bike bottle holder and most car cup holders Wife of Willie Two Beards 
5 0 Excellent Water Bottle I am very happy with my purchase the unique way that it allows you to drink without raising your head I got it mainly for when I am on my motorcycle 
4 0 Use For Swing Not Hitting This is a great item It looks awsome feels awsome But it s not strong at all Use this only for working on your stance swing control things like that DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT go around hitting things with this It will break faster then you can say bull You finish this lol I got it in the mail today and by the end of the day i was taping it up with duck tape lol because i was practicing and i hit my floor by mistake But anyway this is worth the price I ll buy it again if i had the money 
5 0 fantastic excellent product the envy of my kendo class fast shipping good service i m happy all around thanks again 
4 0 Nice Boken Nice Price It s a nice boken it feels nicely balanced looks good and has a nice price The handle wrap was the main reason for my purchase of this item it keeps the boken in your hands even if they are sweaty I was a little wary of the wrapping to come undone so I just placed a few drops of super glue on the ends and a few of the places in between just to make sure it stays in place It s a good practice sword and it serves its purpose worth the buy in my opinion Another reviewer has stated that his boken broke when it was struck this may very well be However it is not because of faulty craftsmanship it is because the boken is not meant for contact It is purely a device to help you hone your sword handling skills without chopping off your arm which you could do with a real katana If you want a contact sword to spar with friends I suggest getting a shinai Unlike the boken a shinai is actually meant for sparring and will not break under normal use 
5 0 What a great idea The cord wrapped handle is a great idea offering more of a real sword like look as well as a firmer grip My hands tend to get sweaty and slip around a bit with long practice particularly with the sealed lacquered finish on most bokken This wrap really helps though it needed a touch of glue to get it to stay in place The two piece guard design is a nice enhancement too Though you really don t need the guard at all for many applications it is nice looking and appears stronger than the original It s still a fairly cheap piece of wood compared to an ironwood version but at this price it was 9 99 when I bought it you really can t go wrong A nice enhancement over the basic bokken Recommended 
4 0 Made a Splash But Not Happy I thought I had thoroughly researched the Kettlers but I didn t get all the details on this one Unfortunately Amazon got them wrong They advertised this bike as having the free wheeling option when it DOES NOT I love the quality of the bike have had no tipping problems and the upgraded wheels are great I m giving it four stars because the pedals hit my daughter s feet when she doesn t keep them pedaling I d recommend spending more to get those free wheels 
5 0 Chrome Basket This basket was exactly the size we were looking for and was easy to install Arrived promptl 
5 0 Exceptional buy I bought this pogo for my oldest daughter 5 years ago It has been through 5 children twice yearly block parties being abandoned in the rain and generally abused It was still in great shape right up until last week when my 7yo left it behind my car and I ran it over She is now saving her allowance to replace it with an identical pogo stick It s perfect for petite children the only one they ve ever tried that they can actually get to bounce One of the few toys they ve used year after year Update The replacement pogo just came today Although I was expecting pink and purple the color is actually deep red and blue This was neutral for me as we have girls and either color scheme works This one looks even sturdier than the one I ran over The frame is of larger diameter it weighs a little more and the tip is bigger and heavier Good thing because I have 3 more kids behind the older ones who haven t yet sampled the joys of pogo sticking 
4 0 good to go this pogo stick is well made that is the first thought that enters your head when you see and hold it for the first time i bought this for my 6yr old she is small and does not weigh a whole lot she has a tough time getting the spring to compress she is somewhere between 45 to 50 lbs i noticed a lot of reviews complaining that the tip wore down and kids were receiving head injures so i bought and recommend getting a helmet elbow and knee pads 
5 0 Outstanding Service The service Amazon com provided was absolutely outstanding I had order a Foam Maverick Pogo stick on Dec 15 2006 and I received it on Dec 18th Prior to ordering through Amazon I tried to order the item from Target Toys R Us and a couple of website and they all stated they were either out of stock or the item will not be shipped until mid January I totally freaked out and was about to panic because the pogo stick was the 1 item on my daughter s Christmas list When I had tried the website again Amazon prompted and I thought I ll check it out I couldn t believe the item was in stock shipping was only 2 3 days and let alone on sale I was ecstatic I order it and got it within 3 days The pogo stick is very nice and my daughter is very happy Keep up the outstanding service Amazon com 
5 0 6 yr old loves her pogo stick I got my daughter this pogo stick for Christmas and she really loves it It was a bit stiff at first just like the enclosed directions indicated but once I bounced it up and down a bit it loosened up enough for her weight to have it go up and down a bit Mine was red and blue OK for a boy or a girl She s have a great time learning how to use it and getting exercise at the same time 
5 0 pogo fun We got this pogo stick for our 5 year old son for Christmas At first he couldn t do it But he kept trying it and now has mastered it He loves it It s very well made and can go really high If you have a child that it fairly active and likes running and jumping this is a great toy It also gets them outside and away from the tv 
4 0 Love it Our 5 year old loves this pogo stick She can t do it by herself yet but she s having a blast trying If your child gets frustrated easy it might not be the best since it takes a lot of practice Otherwise it is one of those timeless toys that you might recall using as a child yourself It s very sturdy and has taken a while to break in but overall it was a great buy Looked great next to the Christmas tree too with just a bow Obviously it s a better toy for the spring and summer maybe by then she ll get the hang of it 
5 0 Pogo Stick Purchased for my 6 year old and while she has not mastered it she has a lot of fun trying and with it all padded it seem to be as safe as can be It was damaged when I received it I called the company and they had a replacement part to me in just a couple days 
5 0 Green Pilates mat This mat is the best I have found Went to several local stores to buy a mat All were either the same price or more expensive but terrible quality Pilates mats need to be non slip and a bit cushy The Stott Pilates green mat is all of above and a great price too Mine came with a sunrise DVD that is fantastic as well Stott Pilates is the way to go 
5 0 It s not that bad I bought this toy for my 6 month old daughter and she likes it Can t say she loves it though She likes to chew on the key as a teether and she loves to pull the turtle hair 3 strings on its head I really don t think it s a bad toy at all Legs are a little hard to squeeze but I figured if she likes musical toys I ll buy her a real one Not this turtle 
5 0 Not as nice as Octotunes We ve debated getting my daughter Octotunes because we ve played around with it in stores and it seems like a fun toy Her father and I both have some musical background from being in band and want her to be engaged in music when she s older We thought fo 5 29 this would be a bargain since Octotunes is about 25 When it came I thought it was cute but noticed immedietly that the legs don t honk as nicely as the octopus Not only that but one of them doesn t honk at all unless you really squeeze it I can t imagine a young child being able to do it The shell which is supposed to be like a drum makes almost no noise Would have been nicer if it was more hollow Instead it sounds like the equivilent of banging on a wall The head which is a maraca barely makes noise The whole toy leaves much to be desired Although I can t complain for the price we paid it is a nice size toy even though it is rather large and bulky for a young baby I was expecting a bit more It s colorful and cute but that s about all it is 
5 0 More Effective Push Ups Your home gym won t be complete without these great workout bars They re sturdy and easy to transport The comfortable grips are built for tough workouts 
5 0 nice and compact seem sturdy looks like cheap plastic but they are tough enough to handle hard exercise suprised at the comfort level of these Much better than the ones I use at the Gym nice handles and they can be stripped down to transport Seems to meet expectations for this type of equipment 
5 0 efficient very nice a must have for home workout takes up no space works very well turning your hands at different angles ads versatilit 
5 0 Great for doing Push ups Like other reviewers said these are made of plastic However that said it s high quality thick plastic and they never feel weak at all I weigh more than the two reviewers before me 230lbs or so but they still feel completely solid so that shouldn t be any issue at all I like these bars for a couple of reasons One you can lower your body below your hands providing a workout for different muscles Second it s a lot easier to put your hand around a nicely padded bar then flat on the floor so this makes the whole setup easier They also break down so you can store them in smaller areas or even travel with them You wouldn t think it makes much of a difference but it does well worth the money 
5 0 More effective push ups Although these push up bars are made from plastic they support my 185 lb frame just fine They make push ups more effective by allowing you to dip lower Very comfortable Great item 
5 0 Does the job as promised IF you re buying ANY model with maximun weight less than 300lbs you truly miss out on the benefits of going heavy As long as you re serious about gaining muscle mass then you need to upgrade 
5 0 Upgrade After you ve surpassed the 210 pounds of resistance you ll need this upgrade bar to keep increasing your weight This bar adds an additional hundred pounds of resistance 
5 0 As good as advertised I ve had two different Bowflex versions over the course of about 10 years I ve never had a problem with either of them These rods are upgrading the older model and it is still going as strong as ever 
4 0 Much better For most of us who exercise regularly the Bowflex Sport is a fine exercise machine Unfortunately though two hundred and ten pounds of resistance is not enough The 310 lb upgrade is a neccessity for serious workout I found by upgrading to 310 lbs I can t bench press the whole machine I would recommend for any serious lifter when you buy the the bowflex sport to immediately upgrade to 310 lbs 
4 0 Lordy This is tough but good If you want a good workout you got it with this This is tough and challenging but WILL give you results for sure There are three super challenging workouts here and each targets specific body area using heavier weights than normal but slow repetitive movements This is done to really fatigue the muscles and make them work harder You aren t using momentum but instead concentrating on intensity and that s how you get the results There is a Legs and Shoulders workout a Triceps and Biceps one and a Chest and Back There is no way possible you won t get results if you do this often It is tough but it s worth it and worth every penny spent She is an outgoing and motivating instructor and you are bound to love this dvd 
4 0 Great Quick Reformer Workout I am glad I purchased this dvd along with the Upper Body DVD Marjolein Brugman is a great teacher and it starts with warm ups for the lower body in some ways similar to the Upper Body Workout I did feel the burn with the exercises The time passed quickly and there are alternate views of foot position using a mini picture screen in the top right hand corner of the screen There is faint classical music in the background I wish the music was more inspiring though 
5 0 Great Bike I searched for my wife a bike and everywhere I went the price was way more than what I wanted to pay I wanted a bike that was well constructed lite and has high rated parts on it I found this bike and I compared the price with a comparable bike at a bike shop and it was nearly 100 cheaper plus free shipping After we received the bike we were very satisfied of the product except for the seat but you can purchase a nice gel seat for around 15 Great deal 
4 0 Bike is nice though did need some adjustments I really like this bike it is a great little starter road bike It can take some rougher terrain but I wouldn t take it off roading constantly I don t think it s built to tolerate a whole lot of that After assembling the bike we did take it to our local bike shop and spent 10 on getting it adjusted just right the gears weren t shifting right from lower 4th and 5th They were getting hung up a little but the shop fixed that right up Seems something was bent a little I also had the brakes adjusted as they were riding the rims of the wheels and they definitely weren t supposed to be that close Nice bike for the price though and free shipping Can t beat it 
5 0 Good basic exercise mat Amazon doesn t provide much detail about this mat Mine just arrived so here s some extra info It is 22 wide by 70 long and 3 8 thick The integrated velcro straps work very well keeping it rolled neatly for storage 
5 0 Best thing I every bought This is the best thing I every bought I will never be without one again This is a must have for every womans purse 
5 0 Playzone review I love this it s the second one I have bought It s easy to put together easy to move around and it keeps the baby safe and entertained 
5 0 this item is great We purchased this item 2 months ago for our VERY active 1 year old We found that it was nearly impossible to keep up with her all the time however when we put her in the pack n play she would scream This is THE perfect alternative We did purchase two of them she needs a lot of space The assembly was easy its easy to get in and out of but she could not pull it apart the gate is very secure and she loves the toys attached to the back of the pen My only complaints are this it s still relatively small as i said we purchased two of them to make a large pen the superyard XT comes with more panels but i felt that the edges were sharp there s no gate and it s hard to pull apart Also the toys run out of battery so fast and there is no on or off switch for them 
5 0 Amazingly important to a busy mom As a WAHM of 4 including 11 month old twins the only way I can ever get a lick of work done is to corral my busy babies They have had this playzone since they were old enough to sit up I bought two extensions to start with but have since upgraded to a total of 4 it is SO worth the money for the upgrade I have set up activity centers of my own inside of it with little people stations stuffed animal stations blocks stations book stations etc And I change it up constantly so they don t get bored Now that they are walking they fight over the phone but still love their playzone I definitely recommend this for any busy mom 
4 0 Good flexible playpen This playpen is nice because you can get extensions or like we did just buy two of the full set and configure it for your needs It is particularly useful because you can keep it on the smaller side for normal use but add in extensions when other kids come over to make it larger Everything fits together well is easy to assemble and the battery powered sections are amusing for the kids Some pieces are little rough nothing alarming though 
5 0 We have 2 of these Very nice doesn t look like a dog cage and Cyney loves the activity center and the bright collor 
5 0 Amazing My son loves it He enjoys playing inside the playzone area Not only that it helps me a lot when I m doing some house cleaning and able to finish my job This is a must have 
5 0 Love it We got this to corral our twin sons and it works awesome The colors and board entertain them and they have yet to figure a way out on there own Sometimes we leave the door open and our older child likes to go in and play too Its quite a hit with anyone who comes to visit with little ones 
4 0 Excellent sturdy pogo stick The pogo stick is very well built We first bought one locally but had some problems with the foam splitting The second one we bought here on Amazon It came quickly it s had no problems and the kids have really been enjoying it One thing to be careful about there is no packing or space around the pogo stick after all it IS already foam wrapped Since the ends of the box are heavily glued you might be thinking about using a knife to open it Since the pogo stick is just under the cardboard with no protection and you use a knife enough said In fact the packaging is the only reason I marked it down it s just too easy to damage if you use any tools at all to open it Just rip it apart and you ll be fine Highly recommended 
4 0 Not for smaller children This is a fun throwback toy but be aware that the child you are buying it for should be at least 100 lbs in order for it to be effective The 80 lbs that the company recommends is just a little too light to compress the spring in the pogo stick I would also recommend not using it on rougher asphalt as that is what seems to wear down the tip the most Using it on smooth driveway concrete seems to be just fine and all the neighborhood kids come around to take turns bouncing around on the pogo stick Hey its a fun toy for kids that encourages exercise Having tried it out it s quite the workout There are the obvious safety issues that are part and parcel of a toy of this nature but that is not just specific to this particular pogo stick it s pogo sticks in general so it is somewhat unfair to single out this paricular product as being hazardous 
4 0 Durable Pogo This pogo stick is very well built and worth the money The handlebars seem a little close together and I wish they were longer but my niece and her friends love it Not good for anyone under 70 80 lbs because of the heavy duty spring needing more weight to make it bounce The best pogo stick I found for the price 
4 0 Master Pogo a big hit My son got this for his birthday He LOVES it and uses it whenever the weather lets him After only 1 week of using it a plastic part broke on it It still works but not the exactly way it s supposed to 
4 0 awesome whoever claims they got hurt on this stick just an fyi its probably your own fault it rocks for just jumping up and down but it is even better for tricks the only problem with it is that it wont stand up to much abuse i tried to do a vert stall and ate it hard and the hanlebar bent but yo can order replacement parts online so it okay overall awesome stick 
5 0 ultimate pogo stick My 9 1 2 yr old son got his 1st pogo stick when he was 4 yrs Mastered it in a few days jumped on it sooo much the metal of the jumping pole was paper thin Since then he has owned a couple more Well he is now close to 90 lbs 5 ft tall and it was hard to find a durable enough pogo Well the Neon was a perfect match He can jump on it forever and it still has plenty of spring and allows him to reach incredible heights Very sturdy A winner 
4 0 Pretty fun but makes lots of noise I got this about 5 months ago When I first got it it was the only thing I would be doing At first I had to get used to it being a little heavy but after I got used to it it was really fun All my friends learned how to do it Of course like every toy it got old after awhile So if you re not sure you will use it for a long time don t by it yet I have read that the tip has worn off on other people s pogo sticks but I have been using this for along time and nothing happened yet Overall if you love the outdoors this toy will keep you outside for a good amount of time 
5 0 Best I ve Used Halex Cyclone 1 Star Table Tennis Balls are some of the BEST that I have used they are a GOOD Value for the money 
5 0 Great product Just what we were looking for easy to assemble quick delivery quality product not overpriced good value 
5 0 Love this knife I ve had several fat Swiss Army knives over the years and this is my favorite The highlights for me were three things The screwdriver socket set the pliers and the pull out pen I also like the option to get this knife in blue I have been so used to the red ones I was glad for the change First regarding the screwdriver socket pieces they are pretty well made with a tiny spring loaded bearing in the middle This means that when you plug the pieces into the socket they sort of lock in and won t drop out when you are trying to use them The 4 socket bits are double sided with a separate driver head on each side They contains 3 different sizes of Phillips heads 3 hex heads weird but useful on the off chance you need them 1 octagon head basically a blank and 1 regular screwdriver head Keep in mind that the knife set also contains the standard screwdriver options as well so that explains why only 1 socket is a regular screwdriver You also get a tiny screwdriver which is stored within the corkscrew and a larger one that flips out from the back of the knife Second is the cool set of pliers They are relatively thick so can actually be of some use and most Swiss Army knives don t come with this feature Third is the tiny pen which you can separate from the knife entirely I keep this knife in my car and on many occasions I don t have a pen lying around and I grab this one to help me out Finally I am quite pleased that this set did not contain a USB drive like some of the other new Swiss Army knives This might be initially entertaining but in 6 months it is going to be so outdated that you are going to wish you had a plain old knife Imagining trying to give this knife to your kid in 10 years Dad what is this weird thing on the knife Great Stocking Stuffer 
5 0 Perfect I received one of these as a gift 3 years ago in sapphire and I absolutely love it As a PC tech its handy to have a screwdriver on hand or a dip switch setter pen I ve found myself utilizing every element on this knife at one time or another since I ve owned it I definitely recommend it to any self professed geek 
5 0 They are durable I got quite a few in 3 years and they are really durable washable and are not ripped off yet They re good wraps for heavy bags but get some gloves too 
5 0 Awesome handwraps I purchased this wraps for my Tae Bo classes I use them to make sure that my hands are always closed when I m punching Mostly for good form I used them to punch mitts I absolutelly loved them I read the reviews and some said that these were a bit short It has been perfect for me I have small hands but still the wraps are so long I encourage these for everybody 
4 0 great wraps These wraps are comfortable and easy to clean I d recommend them to anyone for training 
5 0 The All in one Toolkit This product works great I love it I love swiss army materials Always a good durable product Doesn t dull very easily that is why I love it The scisscors and pliers come in handy a lot The saw did once two when a friend of mine couldn t fit his couch through the door so we sawed off a corner on the couch and bingo it was through 
5 0 Great Product We got this for our 3y o son to have indoors during the winter We have a large outdoor one for the summer that the kids love This is the perfect one to have for indoors to get some exercise It is not too big so there is less chance for injuries and it is easy for my son to use 
5 0 Happiness in a Bag This product is a bag of happiness I have 3 kids and an extended family that includes 17 children When we get together which is often Field in a Bag always makes its way out of the trunk Whether we are playing softball Little League baseball or just running bases this product is indispensable Imagine running bases with all those little kids sliding and not have the base sliding halfway across the yard And the best part when the fun is over it all goes back in its bag and in the trunk of my car for next time Love it 
5 0 Great Gifts for Grandchildren I purchased two sets of Field in a Bag to give as gifts for two of my grandchildren Both of their parents told me that the kids loved to set up the bases and then play baseball They would imitate the major league players by pitching sliding and base running One of my sons said that he loved the fact that the bases were designed to help avoid foot injuries when a child would slide into the base with a lot of force My other son is not very astute with following directions and he loved the simplicity of setting up the bases with the enclosed measuring strings and directions Great gift for all kids who love to play baseball 
5 0 It s in the Bag What more is there to say The National Pastime has never been more accessible It s about time someone thought of this 
5 0 Play Ball I have 2 children each of who have lots of friends and i can say that there are no more boring afternoons since we ve become the owners of Field in a Bag Its a great way to break out with a baseball game anytime anywhere The children are able to set up have lots of fun playing and clean up themselves It s easy to use and the bag keeps all the parts together Can it get any better than that 
5 0 Great Product Loved this product Found it child safe Easy to set up Have used it many times very durable Lightweight and easy to transport As stated in the directions it is not meant to be used with cleats Great gift for kids of all ages 
5 0 Great Headlight I am very happy with this product You can always count on Cateye and this Headlight is no exception It is well worth the price 
5 0 Best quality and perfectly made These come in 2000 piece bottles and random color so if you order two they will both be the same random colour 
5 0 High quality BBs very low price Very smooth polished BBs Not orange though Bought two bottles both green 
5 0 We love it We bought this model for my husband so he could keep up with our kids who have the smaller Razor scooters The foot bed and handle bars are both a bit longer than the other model which is great for his size 12 feet and taller stature It rolls very smoothly as well 
5 0 A fun way to spend time with kids I remember when the Razor scooters first came out and I have this idea they were fairly pricey at the time Well they are very inexpensive now and if you weigh more than 143 lb you will need the Pro model Everyone in our family has one and we happily scoot all over the neighborhood on weekends 
5 0 Strong scooter I bought this for my son and one for his friend and they are 14 years old They like to do tricks on them and jump high stairs The regular scooters would break in a couple of days but this pro model really lasts 
5 0 Nice ive own this scooter and it has severd me well if you are an advancing scooterer like me i would recomend this scooter or the A2 or A3 VERY sturdy great scooter 
5 0 Fun fun fun Our son hasn t stopped zipping around on his new scooter it s very durable 
5 0 Bets scooter This is the best type of scooter Definately worth the money My sons ages 9 and 12 use these in the street and on the ramps 
5 0 great fun i bought this for my husband as a surprise xmas present he was not expecting a razor scooter but since i bought the same thing for my kids i thought it d be funny it was funny but it has also been great fun scooters are not hard to ride and it s a great way to be active with the kids good family fun 
5 0 Automatic Jar Opener I love this thing It hasn t failed to open anything that I ve tried on it My hands say thank you and when it bites the dust you can bet another one will be on it s way 
5 0 Hey they are needles What can one really say about inflating needles They are well made and were exactly what I was expecting No surprises here 
5 0 A great bolster Quality batting a little larger than most good for me I m 6 3 and a bit less expensive than others I looked at online 
5 0 Everlast Wraps These Are great wraps for little money If you re just working the bags as a hobby or just for something to get the blood flowing these are great If you re really getting into boxing or any sort of pugalistic sport spend the extra money on some gloves 
5 0 very good although a little to big for me i still like them they are very good hand wraps and i think you sould buy them 
5 0 Everlast Hand Wraps Purchasing from Amazon was much more convenient than going to my local sporting goods store No traffic no lame excuses of why the product is not in stock and no waiting in lines I received a good quality product that was hassle free 
5 0 Quality simple and cheap Not much to say if you are in the martial arts industry and need hand wraps this is it the price is right and very high quality 
5 0 Well Made and Functional This is a well made tool that serves the most needed bike tool functions in a minimum of space and weight 
5 0 Christmas fun I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loved it The colors look great at night 
5 0 A fantastic toy for all ages This is awesome It is great to play ultimate or just throwing around at night we had one a new years party and played with it in the dark house too they keep up well too I ve played with mine in the snow in the water in the sand just make sure to clean out the battery compartment this is a great toy for any family or friends they are also fun to play with in dorms 
5 0 super happy Labrador My yellow Lab is crazy for Frisbee It s her favourite thing This one is briliiant The colors are bright and really pretty flying through the dark It s made playing with her even more fun She waits by the window for dark because she knows what comes as soon as the sun sets night game The lights make it easy for her to see the disc flying a help even during the day and therefore easier for her to catch We have four of them so we always have one in the air for her to run for which means she goes to bed exhausted and is an angel all night long Beware if you are shy or self concious you will inevitably have an audience if you pair these surpsingly pretty flying discs with a dog who can catch them in her mouth especially if you play near children 
5 0 Cleverly named well crafted disc I picked up one of these flying discs just a couple of weeks ago I have a green one but they are available in red blue and multicolors as well It s a well made American product which makes this disc an easy choice over the competition that flies straight and does not hurt to catch at least with the hand After a few missed catches a few collisions with trees and landing in the road the Flashfligh never blinked It seems sturdy unlike some other light up discs that didn t last through a weekend The LED makes it easy to spot without being distracting so catching the disc is easy and finding it not a matter to be taken lightly during a late evening endeavor is effortless as long as the light is turned on 
5 0 Finally a good use for LEDS Our Familly recieved one of these discs for Christmas and we are amazed how well it works Easy to fly and the lights are incredible making it a blast in the dark 
5 0 Great price great features I got this for my wife to replace her Nike heart rate monitor The features are great time in zones is a very good feature addition the display is easy to read while working out My wife tells me that the chest strap is comfortable and that it looks nice What more do you need She has had no issues with the buttons etc that other reviewers have previously mentioned and she uses it 5 days a week 
4 0 Suunto can t beat it The service was fast and the product is great thank 
1 0 Surprising quality level in a bad way Why do I say that Because I have two Crosman airsoft guns a P22 pistol and an S32P shotgun Both are great but both right now are using 0 12g rounds so they re not as accurate as I want I tried these 0 20g rounds and they jammed my shotgun on nearly every shot and the rounds are made by the same manufacturer as the gun itself When you look at them you can even tell that they re not all perfect spheres and that some are slightly different sizes than others I did not try them in the P22 as I bought that after these rounds I would strongly avoid 
4 0 Safe and sturdy but bulky My daughter has the two wheeled Razor so I expected something more streamlined That said it s quite stable and my son s only complaint is that it doesn t go superfast like his big sister s Razor 
5 0 My three year LOVES it Got it for my 4 yr old but she isn t into sport activities so much It just stayed there for a couple days when my three year old and she just LOVES it She wants to take it everywhere we go Good buy Very sturdy and stable Easy for a little girl So far we haven t had any accidents with it I like that they have a spare wheel in the back and a small compartment for holding the tool for winding the screw Good idea I highly recommend it as a transition to a bike or a two wheel razor 
5 0 scooter time this scooter is great all three kids loved it especially the young one this was for it s easy to use easy to set up and hours of fun thanks for a great price and a great scooter 
5 0 Good little scooter This scooter was a good buy It was inexpensive and meets our needs The three wheels allow my daughter to balance She doesn t hit her pushing foot with the back wheel as with some other scooters 
4 0 Great for 3 year olds I bought this for my 3 year old She was able to get on and go right out of the box I love the three wheel design because it really doesn t tip easily The pink is a bonus that compliments the little girl s love for that nasty color I m daddy so don t tell her I said that Definitely follow the recommended weight limits We went on a walk with the girls riding their scooters When my little one was too tired to continue I scootered her home by putting my foot on the back and pushing her so we were both riding That tore up the plastic bearing on one of the rear wheels Luckily there is a spare and the tools included to swap them out which only took about 5 minutes I definitely recommend this one for those that don t have the balance yet to ride the two wheeled version Just keep in mind the plastic bushings on the wheels 
4 0 Pretty in Pink Santa brought my daughters Pink scooters and they love them They are easy to adjust for height and I like that they come with an extra wheel Pretty easy assembly after you discover where the wrenches are 
5 0 Just Great My daughter received this gift for Christmas and really enjoys riding around on it with the bigger kids She has no problem keeping her balance and loves to ride I recommend this to anyone 
5 0 4 year old loves it This is such a great scooter for a young child My 2 year old is even able to use it The back wheels give it more stability so they can learn with out falling Kind of like training wheels on a bike 
5 0 PLENTY BIG STILL HAS STYLE My middle school daughter was always struggling to fit her books in her old backpack which up until this year worked fine I went on line to find the roomiest one I could and still get style color choices and outside pockets We were amazed at how much room this had inside Now all her books fit nicely and she loves the extra pockets so she can easily find her lunch pens pencils her cell phone and other extras 
5 0 A 20 day test I just returned from a 20 day trip and this new backpack went along It is comfortable commodious and just the ticket I have a 25 year old JanSport backback still ticking but a bit tattered that I have used and used and I expect this one will provide the same service It s great 
5 0 Satisfies this law student s needs I have ridiculously large books and a half hour walk to and from the train station each day Unlike every other backpack I ve tried the straps of this one have yet to start ripping or fraying apart from the bag The only feature I miss is a buckle connecting the two straps across the front of the chest so they don t pull apart at the shoulders However the bag is heavy duty and roomy and I m easily able to fit my laptop Con Law book maybe the largest book ever made Crim Law book 2nd largest ever and pocket dictionary Overall if you can get as good a price as I paid for it I would recommend it to any student or other user 
5 0 Very pleased Great Price and Great Product Jansport has always had quality products Can t go wrong Lots of space and compartments 
5 0 Great school backpack I got this for my 8 year old son It is just the perfect size to carry all of his work and whatever other things he needs The pockets help him organize things so he knows where they are He has had problems with the straps of other backpacks breaking but this one is very sturdy and has not had any problems 
5 0 Great Choice for the Money This is a good backpack It is very sturdy I got it for my high school son because he ripped through his first backpack for the year in less than a week We paid about the same for that backpack as we did for this JanSport backpack He has had it now for a couple of months and his holding together just fine When he first got the backpack he said the shoulder pads were very hard but now he says they don t bother him anymore Maybe he has broken them in or just gotten use to them If you are looking for a good and roomy no frills backpack for school this one has worked out great for my son I had a JanSport years ago when I was in college and I remember it being a good choice back then too This Big Student Backpack is a great choice for the money 
5 0 Jansport Big Student Backpack is terrific The Jansport Big Student Backpack we purchased has been utilized daily for 2 mths and is terrific It holds all of the books musical supplies and accessories any adult or teen would need on a daily basis 
5 0 fast service backpack just what I expected and I got it really quickly THanks 
5 0 Great backpack I am very happy with my purchase of this backpack The color is great and it has plenty of compartments but not so many that you don t know what to put in them I especially like the mesh holder on the side I put my water bottle in there so I don t have to carry it around I m a graduate student so I have a lot of materials I have to lug around and this backpack is perfect for it The straps are very sturdy and don t cut into my shoulders It is very comfortable to wear 
4 0 Doesn t leak and hoping it doesn t leach plasticizers I purchased this item to have a water bottle that won t leach plasticizers The sellers don t seem to really know about this issue I think it s the right stuff though It does not leak your drink which is amazingly rare to find in purchasing bottles Re using water bottles is the cheapest way to go for no leaks but they re supposed to begin leaching chemicals over time The bottle is just the right size for me and it s attractive and nice to hold My complaint is that I can barely open the pop up drink spout but my kid seems OK with it I entirely can t open it if the lid is off of the bottle for cleaning I just screw the top off to drink I prefer it I loaned one to another kid and saw him using his teeth to pull up the spout yikes don t tell his mom Handy and worth the price 
4 0 Inexpensive dependable and includes pump I bought this bed as a literal quickbed for guests It inflates quickly doesn t take up much room and is actually quite comfortable It does not come with an AC adapter but I haven t found this to be a necessity I also thought it inflated quickly I m wondering if the one reviewer who had a problem had a defective pump For the money I think this is a great bet and you can even reverse the direction of the pump to deflate the bed quickly 
4 0 Very reliable airbed Bought this a few months ago and have used it everytime I needed The included air pump is very convenient and the bed itself is very comfortable It has served me very well as an extra bed every time I needed it And the way that it s transparent and you can see the inside looks cool too 
5 0 Good quality and doesn t tip over I have a hard kicking 11 year old soccer player and we tried 2 other soccer goals before getting this one The main difference is that the weight of the metal poles which the net attaches to allows it to stay in place when hit by a ball the others we tried that were made of PVC plastic pipe fell right over this goal is worth the price Easy to set up and take down too 
5 0 Great for backyard soccer This goal is perfect for backyard soccer games We keep the goal in the garage and out of the weather and after three years of almost daily use it still shows little wear 
4 0 Excellent size excellent price but the net doesn t last This is the perfect size for small sized games 
4 0 does the job Obviously not the best but for the price it does the job I just got mine so Im not sure how long it will last It looks cheaply made but still I think you can get a lot of use out of it if you re not a serious boxer Adjusts well to fit and protects the face 
5 0 van dessel road bike i have been riding since 1973 i bought a van dessel 2 years ago on a former national team members recomendation i was so impressed i now own two and am looking to buy a track bike also i am over 200 lbs and find the van dessel stiff for sprints and climbs it tracks like it is on rails and is not real harsh as i just did a century in vt on my van dessel best of all is the price and an owner who stands behind the products that he also races van dessel is a great bike and company you will not be disappointed riding one 
5 0 Excellent all around bike great for the money The Van Dessel Kermis is easily one of the best if not the best bike in this price range Its weight along with its stiffness and price easily makes it one of the best bikes you can buy I have ridden cannondales and treks and this outperforms them both Kudos to Van Dessel for making such an excellent bike If you don t trust me read the review in Bicycling magazine for more details even they gave it an extremly positive review 
5 0 Great road bike I have the older model of the Van Dessel road bike and I love it It s very light it handles well and it s still comfortable after 4+ hours in the saddle It s also kind of fun to have a bike that s different from all the treks and bianchis out there 
5 0 Awesome racing bike I have raced and trained on this bike for over a year and it has been great Very responsive and stiff yet still comfortable over the longer rides It is speced very nicely while still being affordable and has exceeded my expectations for a bike in that price range 
5 0 Delectable Durable and Dangerously FAST I have been riding the older brother to the Kermis the Campitello for four years and must sing this frame s praises After riding a Trek 5500 a CAAD 7 I had the name brands but with the Van Dessel I have had great durablity and speed The frame is strong and has a great feel with the carbon seat stays making is a comfy and responsive ride for the long days in the saddle or for the sprints out of the corners at the races I like my century rides at 18 mph+ and this frame absorbs the shocks of that much road The bike is made by true cyclist and the intimate relationship of maker to machine and his connection to the sport can be felt in the design I am truly impressed with this bike This bike makes me want to get up in the morning 
5 0 Hard work Cathe Friedrich is my absolute favorite for working out This workout is hard you feel it right away It is put together very well in that you can select the exercises yourself or just hit play and do the entire video Her personality is great she is very motivating without being chatty I discovered Cathe by watching FitTV and now own many of her DVDs I just purchased this one as my problem areas are lower body You will need various equipment though a high step dumbells barbell stretch band and stability ball Since I have been exercising to Cathe I have eventually purchased all equipment and use them all regularly I highly recommend this DVD and any of the Cathe Friedrich items 
5 0 Real focuses on the Butt and Gut WOW what a workout i have a lot of Cathe s workouts but this one really works the Butts and Guts i had to do this dvd 2x to really feel the burn the first time i was not concentrating on the target areas but when i did the next time i couldnt walk right for 2 days this is truly an excellent dvd you will WORK your butt area and you will get that six pack just eat clean for better results Enjoy 
5 0 Excellent This is an excellent exercise DVD I m a beginner but I was able to follow all the exercises and I really felt my muscles working I highly recommend this DVD There are several pieces of equipment demonstrated but I found I could get by with a balance ball and exercise bands As I get more advanced I will add the hand weights Don t let the equipment keep you from trying this exercise routine Cathe Friedrich really knows her stuff 
4 0 Be prepared to work O If you have seen my other Cathe reviews you ll know that I think she is fantastic and makes you work hard yet she s motivating and keeps it interesting In this dvd you will work your trouble spots very hard and it is tough but well worth pushing through The results can be found if you do the workout often There is a wide spectrum of exercises here Every possible movement is done like your squats and lunges etc and you will be feeling it in no time You start with standing workout that work the glutes and then classic floor moves like side leg lifts and inner thigh work You WILL fatigue your muscles in a good way Following all of this there is intense ab work and she uses hand weights and ankle weights to up the ante The other thing you should know is that there is a lot of equipment needed one reason I dropped a star in the rating You need different amounts of weights barbell stability ball resistance bands and a high step platform Personally for me if I need this much equipment I d rather go to the gym Cathe is one tough trainer but she will give you results After doing this workout for the first time I didn t think I d be able to make it out of bed the next morning It was a good sore so you know you ve worked out well I really recommend this but not if you haven t used your glute or ab muscles in some time 
5 0 Manduka mats rock Manduka really knows how to please the yogis in everyone This mat is fantastic I highly recommend this mat to friends 
5 0 Great mat This mat is very firm and dense and will last for years Has excellent grip but a little slippery when wet Note to travelers much heavier than most other mats 
5 0 great yoga mat I am very happy with my manduka purple lite mat I had tried out a friend s original black manduka mat and was hoping to get the same quality with a little less weight to carry around in the travel purple lite mat I wasn t dissapointed Manduka mats are so great because of their density they provide the thicker cushioning other thick mats do but unlike other mats they are also dense enough to support the wrists which take alot of stress with a regular yoga practice I recommend this mat to anyone who is regularly practicing yoga the investment is worth it 
5 0 The Rolls Royce of yoga mats What can you say about a Manduka They are the best mats especially the full size and weight mats But they can be cumbersome The Purple Lite is the perfect compromise almost as cushy almost as slip proof almost as roomy Just not quite Alas this makes the mat more portable I am a yoga fanatic and have put my Manduka purple thru its paces It is still in great shape hundreds of classes later And only during the sweatiest of hot classes does this mat get slippery 9 months out of the year no ashtanga rug or Yogitoes is needed Brilliant 
5 0 A Great Yoga Mat I love the Manduka PurpleLite Mat I debated between the thicker black Manduka mat which is awesome and the lighter purple one I am happy with the purple one it is much lighter and easier to carry to and from yoga The purple mat is soft and comfy I never need to use a towel to support my knees It s great and I would highly recomend it 
4 0 Great product little tricky My six year old just received this for his birthday and he loves it This product is not necessarily marketed for kids though There is a safety on it that has to be pressed when launching it so it does require a little bit of coordination It is a little difficult for him to do but not as hard as casting a regular rod I wouldn t recommend it for anyone younger than my son though unless he or she was highly coordinated Still a great product overall 
5 0 My son loves it I was a little hesitant to spend around 30 for a fishing rod for my son who is 8 But he really wanted it so we took the plunge It was well worth the money for us He was so excited He watched the instructional DVD with his dad then we were off to the lake He used it for about a day and we had a little trouble with the capsule that goes into the barrel It went in a little crooked and got stuck I thought oh boy this is broken already But we managed to get it out and reloaded It continued to work great He had a great time using it although he thinks it is broken beacause he didn t catch any fish with it Guess they just weren t biting But he still had a good time I think it s a great product 
4 0 Kids Love it I got 2 of these for my son and nephew They loved it My son s 5 my nephew is 8 They had a ball with this Easy for them to use and it made not cathing any fish still a very exciting and fun trip Not that the rod couldn t catch fish it s just they wanted to reel it in as soon as it landed so they could launch it again 
4 0 Rocket Rod bought the rod in the winter my nephew is excited to use it when it gets warm outside 
1 0 Broken in no time I bought this for my grandson It took him about three minutes after receiving this to have a problem with the release latch I was with him and saw he did nothing more then cast and retreive I think it is a waste of money 
5 0 A fishing pole for all ages Bought this for our 4 year old son who saw it on an infomercial I wish I bought it from amazon cause I paid a lot more for shipping I also had to pay an extra 6 dollars in shipping added to regular shipping price to get it within two weeks for xmas Now that my neice and nephew 8 10years saw it they want it for their b days in febuary I will definately get them from amazon because it s cheaper here Anyways the product is pretty cool It shoots pretty far and you don t have fishing line issues that you have with regular fishing rods It will definately be more excited to fish with Dad this summer It s very easy to handle that my 4 year old can do it by himself and its cool enough that even a 10 year old enjoys it and wants it 
4 0 Unique Idea My 8 year old son loves this fishing rod Received as Christmas gift and not able to actually test it out fishing yet but appears to work well Seems like a safe and more fun way for a child to cast out for fishing 
4 0 A well made bag This bag seems to be well made It was very easy to install and it stays firmly in place under my seat even during rough riding The only improvement I could imagine is that the zipper could be a little easier to open and close but it s not difficult and it appears that it would keep rain out if exposed 
5 0 Works perfectly solidly built Does what you need it to do Installation is solid and the bar is a bar 
5 0 Solid Bike Found this new Schwinn S 15 in box almost all put togher on Amazon for 119 00 less than at your local stores Shipping was with in two days of order and I am very happy with it 
4 0 Loving the bike I received the bike about two months ago and I can say I m loving it Though the flaws lie in two things the shipping and the gears When I took it out of the package I noticed one thing the rear wheel was warped ever so slightly Now just a slight warping can screw up the brakes but I managed to adjust them fine So problem solved there I haven t been able to ride it as often as I d like but it s still smooth I d have to disagree with the guy that said you shouldn t ride it on trails as that s all I ve been doing I have a problem with the gears I love the gear shifing system easy to use But the one thing that s upsetting me is the slippage on 1 7high on 1low I may need to oil it a bit so it may just be my fault I m glad with the purchase and my grandpa s glad to know I ve got a Schwinn too 
4 0 Priced right for the city boys This is not a mountain bike Do not take this on serious trails That said this is a great commuter bike Slap on some slicks tighten the suspension and tune the gearing now you can tackle almost any set of stairs in any city An aluminumn frame full suspension bike for under 300 is unheard of Set the bike up after you get it and you can ride the urban trails on a quality frame with easily upgradable components Gears Gears Gears And check the brakes All in all this is a comfortable bike with teeth and I recommend it to daily commuters and hard road riders Just don t forget to fine tune this bike after you get it 
5 0 Instant Hyrdration I love it I go running with it every day and never have to worry about needing water Just enough water all my needs while running hiking bike riding or walking the dog and barely weighs anything i never notice it there untill i m thristy 
5 0 Great Gift for my Sister In Law I bought this for my sister in law in the hope that she would take a long walk It worked great 
1 0 Highly Inaccurate I had this pedometer for a few days and returned it because it was so inaccurate I would walk like 10 steps and it would register at 20 It was maybe too sensitive I don t recommend it 
4 0 Pedometer Review IMHO this is among the most accurate of the low cost pedometers It has a delay which minimizes the movement registered by some other pedometers This is my second one the first lasted two year 
1 0 Totally Unreliable Inaccurately counts steps useless 
5 0 go eagles awesome texture and design i especially love the eagles motif on the ball even though the broncos are my team go get yours now 
5 0 NFL Logo Football Scores BIG Points Our 12 Year Old is branching out from our home NFL Team to many others San Diego being just one of many I also ordered one of the New Orleans Saints footballs for a Valentines Day gift which we gave him early because I couldn t wait any longer They are in his room under display cases and as he told to his friends will never be taken outside These are great items for kids or adults especially if you enjoy collecting simple memorabilia for your favorite teams I plan to order more teams soon I was unable to find these anywhere but on Amazon com They arrived quickly and look AWESOME Thank you Amazon 
5 0 NFC CONFERENCE Love the ball s colors that represent the team logo we chose Love the designs and the fact that it s a collector item This football will help my child with memories of his hometown in the best year yet in the NFL 
5 0 Great This product was a great find Looked better in person than on the website 
5 0 Nice Football My son loved it He is thirteen and loves the Broncos so he was really excited to get this football Thanks for the fast shipping and great product 
5 0 Grandson s Favorite My grandson is a rabid Chicago Bears fan When he unwrapped the football he about went nuts with pleasure It has already received some rough use and is still in good shape and still being loved by the 10 year old 
5 0 Husband Loves My husband just loves the red skins and just loved this football I purchased for him for Christmas I was so grateful to find something so unique 
5 0 This is nice I just got this gun a couple days and am already loving it It has pretty good accuracy for its range and givin the fact its an AEG and its power is phonominal although I havent hade a chance to skirmish with my friends I will bet it to do some serious damsge there are some minor flaws but not with the gun its self just with the accessories the first one is the sight dosent really aline true to the center could just be a broblem with my gun and the fact that my flashlight stoped working almost immediatly also probobly just a problem with my gun but in the longshot the gun is definately worth the money And im not mary im her son 
5 0 Good for starters I purchased this product at a local sports show and paid 15 more for it than it is here Price aside it is a decent gun much better than my first AEG If you use 2 gram BBs it is reasonably accurate even with wind It seems really sturdy but I ll really find that out on my first op with my friends in the spring There are problems though The mag capacity is small especially on full auto I would advise purchasing extra clips which go from 3 to 10 bucks apiece and can be connected for easy reloading Be careful when loading there is a little switch by the feed for the ammo that will send your just loaded bbs all over the place Also the scope that came with mine is poor the adjustments for the light do not affect the position of the light Overall a great buy for those just getting into airsofting Heck at this price why not buy two and go Rambo on your friends PS i m not really Beth I m her 15 year old son 
4 0 Resistance band Easy and Effective I bought the yellow resistance band and I found it challenging and very effective I have used it mainly for leg exercises I took off one star because there should at least be a sheet listing the various kinds of exercises that can be done with this band 
4 0 Resistance Bands Good procuct that can be used in a variety of leg exercises without weights 
5 0 resistance band green Medium resistance to work with Good place to start working the hips I have another I cut so it s a line and not a ring and use it to work my chest I wouldn t want one with less resistance 
5 0 Great product Works so good in conjunction with weights Durable A definate must 
5 0 Good Quality at a Good price I checked around on the web looking into the company and comparing prices for the yoga wedge The Amazon price was the best offer I have used the Hugger Mugger Foam Yoga almost daily since I received it It is sturdy enough to work well for a currently overweight and shrinking yoga student It arrived earlier than I expected The foam is high quality and the color matched my mat blocks and strap a nice plus 
5 0 Handy little item I tried all of the sporting goods stores and could not find the yoga wedge The only place I could find this item was on line I ordered the item on a Thursday and it showed up at my house on a Monday very fast service It is a very handy item that helps you mantain proper form in several yoga poses I even bought one for my daughter 
5 0 great price This is just what I was looking for and it was just the right price Great for stretching 
5 0 FUN Personal Water Bottle This is an upscale designer water bottle top of the line and so much fun The designs Of Sigg s water bottles are gorgeous from the plain solid color bottles to the ones with intricate designs They are simply beautiful I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns thinking it take more work to maintain These do necessitate regular cleaning I clean mine every day but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun Sort of like my rings glasses and watch I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory reminding me to drink more water making a statement about my values and expressing myself with a special design Yes all in a water bottle Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality made of light aluminum on the outside slightly insulated and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles They are light durable and perfect for any activity Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles just like from the tap I bought this particular top because I don t like sports tops and I don t mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink It is totally leakproof which is important to me The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner I like carrying mine though I get comments on it all the time What s that I love it Sigg makes their personal water bottle in 6L and 1L in this style I have both I use the 6L for sports activities because they are smaller When I won t have to carry the container I like the larger bottle They are expensive but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health so they are well worth it value wise for me Highly recommended 
4 0 Razor Harley Bike My son really enjoys this bike and it stays charged for a long period of time It will go up to 15 miles per hour COOL ITEM Thanks D Quall 
5 0 total fun I purchased this for my 10 year old son He is totally satisfied with the bike It goes fast enough to be fun and not to fast to become dangerous It operates quietly and the neighbors definitely appreciate that 
5 0 FUN FUN We got this for my son and he has had a blast on it 
5 0 zippy little chopper I bought this bike for my 7 year old son for xmas he absolutely loves it although he still was driving a battery operated four wheeler you know the power wheels kind of thing he had really outgrown it the razor chopper has quite a bit more speed he can ride it around our long driveway and through the yard with no problems it will handle up to 200 lbs so i bet we have a long time to enjoy the chopper has a very wide turning radius a challenge in our driveway and doesn t make our skateboard ramp very well but other than that the bike has been a great selection for the price 
5 0 Loves his chopper We were looking for this chopper for some time and I m glad that we found it on Amazon for the price that was right We bought the chopper for my son and he loves it It was easy to put together and doesn t take long for the chopper to charge The chopper can last quite a long time on one charge We also bought a Dot motorcross Helment for my son to wear while riding his chopper from Amazon Everything came on time with no promblems 
4 0 A good mixer I belong to a group who play a card game using 5 decks this shuffler makes it much easier and faster to mix the cards So far it has performed very well and is not as noisy as some I have used 
5 0 good oly tyme speedometer I HAD A SPEEDOMETER LIKE THIS ONE EXCEPT IT WAS SQUARE SHAPED WHEN I WAS A KID AND I LOVED IT SO WHEN I CAME ACROSS THIS ONE I PURCHASED IT FOR MY SON HE LOVES IT HE LIKES THE FACT THAT HE CAN SEE HOW FAST AND HOW FAR HE HAS GOME ON HIS BIKE 
4 0 upgrade bearings Comfortable durable good looking skates but I would recommend upgrading the bearings They re a bit slow 
5 0 Cool Sleek At a reasonable price these indoor roller skates are durable they have a smooth ride are really trendy The Black body of the skate teamed up with the Blue wheels with CHICAGO printed on them really turns heads at the rink My son loves them 
5 0 Great skates These are a great pair of skates for the price I purchased these skates for my husband and he loves them I would recommend these skates for either beginners or pros 
5 0 Excellent Idea No more trips to buy bottled water I might also suggest buying the Brita Pitcher 
5 0 Great Wrist Weights These wrist weights are perfect for trail running Thumbholes help keep them in place You ll feel the difference after only a short distance 
5 0 Exactly what I wanted This item was exactly what I wanted Light weight with the comfortable neoprene grip Also a very reasonable price and free shipping 
4 0 Easy to assemble works well The stand assembles in around 10 15 minutes depending on if you know which pre drilled holes to use or not The build quality is reasonable but the bolts for the casters don t all fit screw in evenly This doesn t affect the functionality but seems like something that shouldn t be an issue w today s manufacturing technologies The casters are great allowing some movement of the bike and stand without removing the bike The only areas of improvement are maybe some better design or feature that further prevents the wheel from tipping leaning in either direction Preferably a simple machining or stamping solution as part of the regular manufacturing process that doesn t increase the price would be best Compactness is good too I have 6 bikes in the garage and they all store neatly next to each other Value convenience and size are this stand s strong points 
5 0 Love it I ve been using this stepper for about a month now and I love it It is very portable and easy to store in my apartment and gives me a good workout The only problem is that the wheel does squeak a little bit 
4 0 Luis Ramos I was somewhat please but numbers are a little dificult to see in daylight And you need to go to school to understand all its fiturees And it came without a case 
5 0 Great watch Looks great functions great Manual is a little daunting and a couple of the words on the display are very small I have 20 20 vision and I can t always read everything that is being displayed It is mostly in the Alt and Barometer functions where there is lots of info being shown Highly recomended 
5 0 Almost Perfect I recently ordered this watch from Amazon as a companion for a LTt Observer to wear in the field While the Observer is a more updated model they both share very similiar features and ease of operation My first recommendation is that you do order this from amazon com and be wary of the same item offered by market place sellers At the time I initially placed the order amazon com was out and the wait was estimated to be 3 to 5 weeks Since the item was also offered by another seller in amazon s referral system I placed an order and wound up with the wrong watch turns out the market place seller didn t carry the black face model Fortunately amazon got a supply in and shipped my watch within 24 hours good service The black face is a little hard to come by Now then to the watch itself First of all it IS big but very light almost as light as the titanium Observer I have The larger face makes it easier to read and Suunto has apparently gone back to the leather waterproof band which I prefer Functionally the watch is a full blown time keeper and non GPS navigation system including stop watch chronometer functions an accurate altimeter a barometer and digital compass Both the compass and the altimeter are as accurate as I ve found in analog portable units The alarms are sufficiently loud unlike the only chink in the Observer and my only criticism is that the back light is weak compared to the Observer but that fault doesn t draw anything away from the 5 star rating Add the user replaceable battery Suunto makes a kit that includes the battery a water dust seal and a new cap the intuitive operating system and you have the ultimate back country time piece Suunto was the first to offer this type of time piece and in my opinion still offers the best I ve used their diving computers and field compasses for years and am a fan of the company s many products I don t think there s a clunker in the catalog 
5 0 As always buying Suunto means buying Quality For those who may be new to Suunto they are wrist top computers designed and manufactured in Finland and are in use all over the world by Hikers Bikers and outdoor enthusiasts of all kinds What makes the X Lander stand out are at first glance obviously its sheer size Let there be NO illusions the X Lander is a mighty big watch Despite its size it doesn t FEEL as big as it looks though The aluminum case is VERY light and quite comfortable too The next thing you notice would be the HUGE amount of bells and whistles packed into such a small device 1 An accurate altimeter This is an invaluable tool for the avid hiker and biker One thing you MUST be ready to do is remember to adjust it DAILY Find out what the altitude is and set the watch before you begin your trip and then at the end of the day you need to make note of where you stopped which you can do with the internal recording function and properly adjust it before setting out the next day This is NOT a flaw every single altimeter watch I am aware of is exactly the same 2 Barometer I found it correct at least 75 of the time which is more than I can say for the local TV Weatherman This includes a thermometer as well which in order to be accurate must be removed from your wrist for at least 15 minutes in order not to get a false reading due to lingering body heat 3 Digital Compass This is truly one amazing feature by the way Once you calibrate it which you may need to do weekly you will NEVER be lost especially if you know how to use a map 4 It tells pretty accurate time too believe it or not It also comes with an alarm a countdown AND a stopwatch Suddenly its size now makes sense huh I happen to LIKE big watches I don t exactly know why but I just do IF I were to have ANY complaint whatsoever the one thing this watch is lacking is exactly what they have included in the much less expensive Vector A tiny little bubble which helps you to level out the watch in the compass mode for a more precise reading The reason why may have to do with the fact that the X Lander is mineral crystal and the Vector is plastic but either way it d be nice to have I am VERY impressed with just about everything associated with Suunto and their fantastic line of what they call Wristop Computers IF size really DOES matter to you well you may wish to go with the Observer or maybe the X6HR which does everything the X Lander and Observer can do PLUS it has a built in heart rate monitor both are smaller than the X Lander Vector Yachtsman and many other Suunto models yet still offers a LOT but keep in mind with the smaller size comes the bigger price Factor all that into your purchase plans and once again if at ALL possible do NOT buy until you have the chance to see some of these or any models IN PERSON That will make a HUGE difference in how happy your purchase will end up being and good luck 
5 0 Excellent Watch This watch screams high tech and anyone venturing off to a comic book convention is bound to get a few nods from people dressed in Sith Lord garb and even a wicked witch or two So it s big real big but cool If you want a little more discreet go with the Observer The new synthetic band that has replaced the leather is a real improvement After all whoever heard of a sports watch with a leather band The idea is absolutely absurd HOWEVER the back eyelit got chafed and worn away the first two weeks Of course it doesn t show but it s annoying especially considering this isn t an el cheapo watch If you re into mountain biking running swimming hiking or training of any sort this is the watch for you It doesn t have super sports specific functionality but in my experience I ve never used stuff like that in any case so this watch accomodates me perfectly And women DROOL over it Well sorta 
4 0 Suunto M3 Great Watch What you see is what your get huge numbers that are easy to read while counting down the start Light comfortable to wear and nice looks Two defects 1 no protection for the glass and 2 it is not as simple to use as its functions would imply which together with a deficient manual makes it hard to operate taking advantage of all its functions If what you are looking for is a large number format countdown timer with nice looks this is it 
5 0 Watch designed for one design sailboat racing I bought this watch for one design sailboat racing and it has many thoughful improvements over other watches countdown timers It has a countdown timer with sync button and reminder beeps a tack gybe angle calculator benzel like a one wheel Musto Compucourse or the Citizen Sailhawk or Navisail It fits a nice niche below the expensive full function regatta watches like the Citizen Sailhawk and Suunto Regatta that would be a shame to beat up while racing and more features than the inexpensive Timex Ironman or Optimum Time series race watches PROS Countdown timer with beeps on minute and on every 59 seconds every ten seconds for last minute and every second for last ten seconds Count up or repeat option after countdown is complete The repeat doesn t stop after seven times unlike the Casio watches Long hold required to stop the countdown timer An electronic lock for the sync button can be manually activated Countdown to a particular time so race committee can start the gun at an exact minute like 11am promptly Tactical benzel has click stops every five degrees so less likely to drift and lose track of wind direction during a race Reasonable large numbers on the countdown timer Nice Euro look isn t fugly IMHO unlike the old Musto Competition watch or the Ronstan Clear Start Watch so it can be worn outside the race course Left out silly sensors such as the electronic compass barometer altimeter that are useless for day racing and makes the watch more afforable than the Suunto sailing watches that have these functions One design class legal because it doesn t have a built in GPS Still love my Foretrex 201 in races which allow them but this looks like a good pre start timer for strict OD class regattas that don t allow GPS CONS Benzel only has click stops but no lock so can drift during normal sailboat operations No 5 degree markers on the benzel interpolating between the 15 degree labels can result in errors Also no 70 degree or 80 degree tack angle marks on watch inside of benzel Why doesn t someone come out with a cheap digital tack angle computer on a watch to help us Joes with poor memory remember tack angles Calculation tack angles is easy Its hard recalculating the tack angles to detect headers lifts because you forgot the numbers while steering the boat in puffy choppy conditions while simultaneously looking for air looking for the mark and jostling between a dozen other boats going upwind Non intuitive buttons and menus with strange short or long press of certain buttons having different functions requires time spent with the instruction manual and scratching one s head Not all functions documented in instructions such as the logbook Silly designers mixed up the starboard and port tack angle arrow colors The arrow pointing 45 degrees to the left of north would be in the port direction but is starboard tack and should be green Gybe angle colors are correct 
5 0 ULTIMATE Street Ball This basketball is so cool The dual action micro pump works It is kind of hard to pop the micro pump out You have to push down on the pump and while you push down on the pump you unscrew it It takes a long time to pump though To deflate the ball you push down on the pump The ball doesn t stay inflated for long The basketball feels good and it has a good grip The silver paint fades away quickly I RECOMEND THAT YOU BUY THIS 
5 0 a wonderful gun i got this gun in 3 days and it came with everything it says it does plus a few more which is really impressive it shoots around wat it says 280 to 300 fps the clip hold around 20 bbs its powerful pertty actuate and goes far its a wonderful gun it have i love it and i recommand this gun for everyon 
5 0 Good Reliable Gun This was my first gun I ever used I dont knwo why the other guy said if you are new you wont be able to use it Well this gun is reliable I dropped it down my friends stairs on hardwood picked it up and it shot just as powerful as before The power is pretty low actually compared to a gun that actually shot 350fps this was way slower than that Using 2 bbs I was able to reach about 50 feet before they hit the ground and I did have to arc my shots to do this Overall I say that this is a good beginners gun and would recommend it to anyone new or anyone who wants a backup gun if their primary fails on them 
5 0 crazy gun i got in in 2 days i pulled out of the package loaded it and i didnt go to school the next becuase i had so much fun amazon says 280 fps i d say more like 350 if u know how to use an airsoft gun great for sniping the scope works great NOT FOR BEGINNERS if u are a begginer u will not be able to use this gun 
5 0 Good pack just the right size This pack appears to be of good quality and is a good size for what I wanted It would be too big to jog but it has enough room to disappear for the day with lunch water binoculars basic first aid poncho and other essentials For hunting it holds enough of my gear that I can get away from the truck all day Good adjustments well thought features 
5 0 So Many Uses This versatile workout bench is of commercial gym quality There are also numerous attachments available to help you get the most out of your new equipment 
5 0 This BENCH is AWSOME I just got this bench with the pullup bar and the abs attachment After shopping for a VKR and a BENCH for a month I stumbled onto this setup and WOW what a great product The workmanship is first class it s packed well and it goes together in minutes Best of all this bench can be every bench you ll ever need flat incline decline and the chinup bar is perfect I bought this setup to hit the P90X work out program and it should work perfectly If your looking for a bench this the one to buy you will definitley get your money s worth They have many other great products to check out 
5 0 Killer Bench I wasn t looking to buy a bench when I came across this gem When I was ordering my IM2000 self spotting weight lifting system I decided to stretch my budget and give this a try It s versatily stability and usability were much better than what I was going to use I glad I went for it Since getting it I ve discovered the many attachments that are available for this bench as well 
5 0 Incredidble multi bench I have this bench and it is so dang solid and easy to use I love it It feels like a commercial gym equipment I also have some attachments that I bought on the Ironmaster web site like the dip handles and crunch situp I also have the adjustble dumbbells which are awesome 
5 0 love it very comfortable This bike is so comfortable and well made I am glad I got it and would recomend it to anyone looking for a comfortable bike 
5 0 Schwinn bike Very nice bike My wife and I each got one for afternoon rides Easy on the old bones Great price and free shipping 
5 0 Schwinn Tornado STRONG BUY Great bike great value easy to assemble I actually like it better than my 800 Specialized Mountain Bike 
5 0 great bike First bike bought online and though it took a bit to put it together it is great For cruising in town it s smooth the handlebars are the right height the seat is comfortable and it works great for someone who doesn t need a mountain bike 
5 0 Tornado A Great Bike And Easy To Assemble I purchased this bike because of the great price It arrived within a few days well packaged I had never worked on a bike before but was able to put the entire bike together myself in a very short time Most everything was already assembled before shipping The bike rides well and shifts smoothly I would highly recommend this bike to any woman who like myself likes a comfortable upright position bicycle for street riding 
5 0 Great product We got 2 of these for our boys for Christmas we are very happy with our purchase highly recommen 
4 0 Pretty darn good gun First off if you like things to come to you by mail quickly then don t buy from HIT Now with the review First this gun is awsome and shoots a good 330 400 fps Second I would buy a lot of extra ammo with this thing It eats ammo up fast And third this gun is so powerful that my freinds are afraid of it So I definately reccomend this gun 
4 0 M4A1 Well R7 Enhanced Version Overall this is a pretty good gun It shoots fast and hard as advertised but its main drawback is the battery which can take a long time to install the first time After a little practice however it gets much easier When i first got my gun and tried to fire it there was gear churning but no firing Thankfully there is a hex tool that can fix the gears easily My main disappointment was with the seller of this item I bought the gun when it was advertised for the current price but the day after it arrived the information about it had changed and new parts were included making it now the RIS version I really wanted that flashlight In addition the flap gate over the hop up system though not very important was not working because the spring attaching it had come loose Despite this it is most definately the best Automatic Airsoft gun one canbuy for under 70 once the kinks are worked out ie Gearbox and Hop up adjustment I greatly recommend this gun to all those on a budget or looking to just play woods games with their friends 
4 0 Watch out for weeping leaking batteries Ordered this for my 15 year old son The merchant offered a good price and it was received quickley Upon receiving it the battery seemed to be weeping and would not hold any charge Contacted the merchant by phone and they shipped another battery out right away Very satisfied with the merchant standing behind their sale and now that I have a good battery and happy with the gun also Good power etc Rating for the gun package as received from the manufacturer a 4 out of 5 rating for the merchant a 5+ 
4 0 Big Cooler This cooler is a lot bigger than what I thought It s almost picnic size but it will be very useful for those long haul drives where I can store lots of food as well as cold drinks too 
5 0 Do it all lunchbox I m pleased with the quality of this lunch box Having two separate insulated compartments is very nice The salt pepper shakers are a nifty extra Just make sure and keep the box right side up or the shakers will pour out I haven t owned this product very long so I can t vouch for its durability It appears to be very well made with quality materials This box may be a bit pricier but the quality extra compartment and flatware shaker pocket are worth it Using this on a daily basis at work instead of eating out will pay for its self in a month or so 
5 0  They handle they wear like iron and flats are gone What more can you as Well OK so they re not free 
5 0 Grippy and tough I switched to these from my Continental semi slicks after numerous punctures and a few near wipeouts on wet corners The Continentals do not grip the road well enough when there s just a thin layer of water and I ve had too many punctures The Michelins on the other hand have proven to be plenty sticky and keep the rubber side firmly down Puncture resistance has been great too thanks to the protective liner I don t think it s actually Kevlar as many other brands models have but it s been fine for the last 1 000 miles They have a very stiff bead and are a little tough to seat into tubeless ready rims Mavic Crosslands but a little liquid soap wiped onto the bead really helps The added bonus of a reflective sidewall is that you end up presenting two huge lighted hoops to cars getting ready to T bone you at night but officer I didn t see him Great buy you won t regret it 
5 0 Excellent Backyard Screen House I purchased a Eureka Hex Screen House 3 years ago for my wife we live in the country and the only way I could get her to be outside with me was to get her a screenhouse to sit in She absolutely loves this screen house I have been setting it up in the spring every season once the bugs start to appear and leaving it up all summer The two doors allow easy access to either side and the interior is large enough that her A Frame swing will fit inside she relax s bug free and comfortable while I work in the garden This is a very high quality screen house for the price since I leave it up throughout the summer it has withstood many gusty storms and never had an issue 
5 0 Eureka Hexagon Screen House The screen house worked as advertised It was easy to set up and pretty easy to take down I couldn t figure out how to get everything back into the box for winter storage but that s a minor problem I ve had the screen house for less than a year so I don t know about long term use I see a bit of rust stain where the metal sub poles come together six poles composed of four sub poles each make up the screen house s external framework I set the screen house up under some pine trees so it was never exposed to high winds but I expect it would be pretty stable under most conditions I recommend this product it makes for a pleasant environment in the evening when the fireflies can fly around outside on a summer night while the mosquitos buzz helplessly not getting to my exposed skin 
5 0 Great Quality After having two or three other products of this type which did not last we found the mini jammer This will be the last one we will need to purchase 
5 0 Awsome hydration pack I absolutely love this hydration pack It has one large and two small pockets and two quick stash pockets with the bladder in its own seperate pocket on the back The large pocket has a space for a discman and has a headphone port Furthermore the bladder is very high quality and I haven t had any problems with it The bladder and hose are easy to remove so it is not hard to clean it Also this pack is offered for a much better price than the overpriced camelbaks All in all I think that this pack is definitely worth the money that I paid for it 
5 0 Fantastic for everyday use I am 7 1 2 months pregnant and this hydration pack is a lifesaver I am able to take long walks without having to carry bottles of water with me The size of the pack is small enough not to be a bother but large enough for my keys ipod cell phone and a snack This is a great deal for all of the features you get 
4 0 Good gloves for training I find they fit well with a good snug fit which can be adjusted to as tight as you like it using the Velcro straps They hold the wrists fairly well to avoid wrist injuries The fingers and thumb fit well Some individuals might want bigger more padded gloves for sparring 
5 0 Best Investment This was a present on our girls 3rd birthday She rode off an on from 2 until 9 She loved it so much we couldn t wait for the battery to run out For the rest of the day she would only stop long enough open another gift then back to the car Quick to learn how to drive it Loud a little bit but hey it s a kids toy If they didn t make noise the kids wouldn t like it Great Toy Great Value 
5 0 Happy Children Great product fun for children nicely designed easy to operate I purchased 3 of the razor bumper buggie Ladybug cars for 3 of my grandchildren age 4 3 and 2 The cars arrived promptly At Christmas I charged the batteries and gave them to the children The cars work great Even the 2 year old can work her car Just like her big brothers Although one battery did not hold the charge correctly a quick call to the company and a new part was sent immediately GrandmaLind 
4 0 WOW best toy for 2007 This is the best toy I ve spent money on in years It s cute my girls love them I bought two They are great to ride in the garage or believe it or not they go well on carpet They have laughed bumped even learned how to use the driving handles with their feet Great fun 
5 0 Hours of fun We bought these so the children could have something to play with during the winter We backed our vehicles out of the garage and zoom they were off having fun The box says Ages 3+ and up to 55 pounds The bumper buggie looks small but it is roomy enough for my 5 1 2 year old He weighs 45 pounds and is 45 inches tall He can stretch his legs out in the car but chooses to keep his knees bent while driving My two year old can also work the controls It is easy to use and the kids can do a complete 360 My only complaint is that it is a little bit noisy but no more than other battery operated vehicles I highly recommend this item It is so much fun Best part is that there is little assembly required The only thing we had to do was screw the seat into the car 
1 0 Worst Customer Service in the world We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy s for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member Both of them were missing the charger for the battery and other hardware so our kids couldn t even play with them They were very disappointed What is worse Razor s customer service is TERRIBLE They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt Of course since they were gifts we didn t have the reciept Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement which won t be for a couple of weeks Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers All this hassle all the hours on the phone when they could have just sent us the missing chargers like any decent company would for such a high price item Our poor kids just looking at their motionless bumper cars Of course we can t actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it Happy Hanukkah to you too Razor 
4 0 slow leak I ordered this to take to Hawaii on vacation and when we got there we discovered the inner tube had a slow leak and wasn t able to use it We did find the exact same product in a dive shop for only a couple bucks more which worked perfectly We had a good time using it although it let my 6 month baby slouch more than sit up 
4 0 Great toy for a baby new to water This float was a vacation godsend I had spent all kinds of money on fancy contraptions to introduce my 5 month old to the water on a recent vacation but all the babies in the pool when we got there had my baby float Baby was a bit nervous her first time in the pool without a float and I worried she wouldn t take to the water but we put her in my baby float and she was so happy it seemed to make the pool feel less big and overwhelming for her There is no doubt that any baby using this product should be watched at ALL times but the criss cross seat does a good job of supporting her in the water and still letting her legs be free The other reviewer mentions that the inner tube sits lower than the outer tube it is designed to be that way and wasn t a problem at all I am not sure what the issue for that reviewer was unless she was using it wrong I highly recommend this as a cheap fun thing to bring along on any pool trip I appreciated that a small baby didn t get lost in it And best part when deflated it is flat and folds up really small Best 5 I ever spent totally changed our vacation 
5 0 Great Stove I used this stove this past week for the first time and it was great I went backpacking for a whole week and another group with us had the whisperlite and the dragonfly was obviously so much easier to use than the whisperlite It s heat is so much more adjustable and therefore uses much less gas than most other stoves Also the stand is much easier to use causing far less spills and more stability than the whisperlite It heats water much faster and is more user friendly I definately recommend it 
5 0 Great for toddlers Our son had some trouble learning to catch with traditional inflatable balls Some times the surface would be too slick or the ball itself would just be too big We were introduced to this ball in our weekly class at the Little Gym The surface has a texture which makes it easy to grip and you can easily deflate the ball a little These two factors make the ball much easier to catch It s a great confidence builder for little hands 
5 0 AWESOME BALL FOR CHILDREN My 2 yr old son has played with these Slo Mo Balls for about a year now The soft material and fact that he can easily grab hold of them makes it a fun ball to play with HIGHLY RECOMMEND 
5 0 kid pleaser the package arrived damaged and evidently pieces were lost during shipping when they went to put it together they discovered the missing parts my daughter called kettler not the internet company i bought it from and they sent the parts out so she had them 3 days later well somehow the instructions in the box that they ordered the replacement part from was not the same model that was actually in the box so the parts were not correct well here we are 4 days before christmas and the show stopper is not able to be put together again my daughter called kettler and they shipped the parts out overnight and the backhoe digger was put together in time for santa to deliver it too a very construction orientated 4 year old and i don t think he has been off it since he got it 
5 0 Cat Front Loader It s huge and a little difficult to put together The instructions were not very good My 6 year old grandson who I got it for loved it and was fighting with the 2 year old to ride it Even the girls wanted to ride it It is a great toy for the yard and I highly recommend this for all children under the age of 6 
5 0 The Perfect Hammock This hammock is perfect Light weight easy to pack and virtually able to hang it anywhere My wife and I have used this on the beach mexicao and while camping in Northern Wisconsin We have tried a couple other hammocks but none come close to the quality of this hammock Highly recommended 
5 0 Great Winter Toy Excellent accessory for kids play in the snow Helps them construct something they can enjoy building and using 
5 0 awesome buy Great poker chips high quality and a low price no defects hardcore rock solid case that took an xbox falling from my closet top shelf on it without a scratch 
5 0 Best ever I bought the iGolf after watching a friend in my foursome use one The most remarkable thing about it is how easy it is to operate Basically you just pick it up and look at the screen and all the information is there updated to your position on the course One flick of the control knob and you are set for the next hole Likewise measuring the distance you hit is also easy you tell it start measuring here a flick of a button when you hit and walk to where your ball got to and flick another button and your hit distance is displayed Actually though the most impressive thing of all is the quality and speed of customer service You phone and immediately talk to the technician It really is magic the computer companies could learn a lot from L1 Also has far more courses than the competition I haven t found a local course that wasn t alreadiy mapped into the software I love the unit and have no cons 
5 0 This works better than I expected When I bought the Igolf caddie I really had some questions as to how good it would be Especially since it is so much cheaper than its highly advertised competitor Before buying I checked to be sure the courses I play the most were in the database they were all there I did have a problem when I first turned the unit on I received an error message when trying to install the software I uninstalled the software and reinstalled it a couple of times but could not get the unit to work so I sent an email to technical support on Saturday morning I expected to have a reply by Monday afternoon Well I received a response within a couple of hours with an explanation and a link to download the latest version of the software I did and everything worked great I used the igolf caddie for the first time the next day Sunday The course I played had recently swapped the front nine and the back nine and when I turned on the igolf caddie I noticed that it still had the old configuration Since I could select the hole independently it was not much of a problem When I got home Sunday afternoon I emailed them to let them know about the front and back nines being swapped This is on a Sunday afternoon and they responded within hours saying the problem had been corrected I downloaded the new setup and everything worked great Since then I have used the igolf caddie about 10 times and it has been perfect everytime I use the hole marker feature to note some layup points and carry points It has performed flawlessly and I believe pulled at least two strokes average off each game By being able to see the distance to the front back and center of the green I find myself making sure I carry at least to the front of the green This has really helped I m a pretty aggressive golfer by nature and this helps me make better course management decisions and remain fairly agressive Bottom line is that the product works great and my experience with their technical support has been nothing short of remarkable They give the type of support I wish I could find in other companies I m still in the process of marking different points on some of the holes but overall I m in the low 80 s now and hoping for some high 70 s here pretty soon A few tips first get yourself some rechargeable batteries since the batteries go down to about 50 after one round I bought NmH batteries and they work great just don t forget to put the switch to rechargeable on the igolf unit Second since I tend to scratch the front screen on my cellphone I could see me doing the same thing here so I put a piece of clear shipping tape over the screen and then used a razor knife to cut around it That way I can replace the tape when it gets scratched without damaging the screen I do the same thing on my cellphone Bottom line the unit delivers as promised and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their game 
5 0 Works as advertised This device works great Load in the software put in your batteries turn on the unit escape out to main menu go to settings go to battery type and tell it you re using rechargeable and you re good to go The software uses send instead of download to send a course from your computer to the unit Connect computer to unit software says connected Go to sync handheld on unit enter and unit says waiting Send on your computer and unit shows the download as does computer About 90 seconds and you have a course If a course isn t on the igolf website download the scorecard and use it to map your own If no scorecard get one from the course or the internet and type it in using igolf software at your computer about 3 5 minutes then send it to the unit and map the next time you play that course Doing that at the course using unit is time consuming I bought a simple Duracell charger with 4AA NiMH batteries at Staples As for your golf well knowing the distance is only part of the puzzle isn t it 
5 0 Great price and really good quality I was looking at 3 different basketballs before purchasing I decided to buy this and we loved it so much we purchased another Amazon has the best and quickest shipping out there THANKS 
5 0 Workouts Anytime Work out while you re sitting in front of the television Though this piece of equipment is not for intensive workouts it s a great workout for very little effort 
5 0 Armor Abs 2 Very easy to use and adjustments to tension are made by just turning the handle The abs 2 gives you are very good workout with minimum effort Its a lot better than doing conventional crunches or situps 
5 0 Haven t run into a Pelican case that was anything but good This case was ordered to hold some medical equipment that must travel with me on my about two weeks per month business travel The good part is that this case will probably survive falling into a black hole The bad part is that it takes up half my carry on suitcase But that s what you pay to have protection for expensive equipment 
5 0 Great scope for airsoft I knew this scope wasn t made for airsoft rifles but I mounted this baby on my UTG Master Sniper and they seem to have been made for each other They complement each other nicely in looks feel and operability The scope comes with the necessary rings two flip up lens covers protective lens covers which unfortunately drastically reduce visibility and a sunshade that will practically eliminate glare unless you re looking straight at the sun itself I ve used this scope every other day for nearly 8 months and it does its job like its fresh out of the box Only complaint I ve got is that the mounting rings are rusting which has me baffled because they haven t had any contact with water or any other sever element The scope itself is fine though Magnification is great though detail is slightly blurred at high magnification I back this one all the way 
5 0 A great find This scope is a great buy for anyone looking for good optics as a low price I mounted this one on my Remington 700 in 308 and it works grea 
4 0 the ring is worth the purchase I have used the ring 3 4x week since the purchase and very happy with it It has provided sufficient resistance and has not broken down I do not use this ring with the dvd it came with I didn t like the dvd it came with but have used the ring with Winsor Pilates and Karen Voight workouts that use a pilates ring I ve been satisified with the results 
5 0 Pilates Magic Circle Excellent product The video is easy to follow I like that I can take the Magic Circle on vacation You can really feel your muscles working against the resistance of the circle and the routine only takes a small amount of time to complete I would recommend the product to anyone 
4 0 served it s purpose I bought the magic circle in efforts to up the anty in my pilates routine I am glad I purchased it but I found the DVD to be about a 2 star out of 5 start rating Since I live far away from a Pilates studio I purchased other DVDs in efforts to learn about the magic circle the DVD from Classical Pilates Inc called The Complete Magic Cirlce Mat Series Reformer Mat Workout also on Amazon com taught me more about the circle s use than the DVD that came with it It is a basic straight forward mat routine DVD but it was practical and I am well on my way to a more complete Pilates workout I also use the magic circle to burn off extra energy while sitting and I find my boyfriend picks it up and uses it to get a few exercises in every day It can be used in many ways but it most certainly enhances a pilates work out 
5 0 Seems great I haven t used this product yet though I have put it into the Nalgene 32oz wide mouth bottle and the fit is great It is a nice tight fit these are pretty inexpensive and I think they will make hydrating while walking much more spill proof They fit it tight and pop out easy for refilling the bottle 
5 0 Great Lamp No Problems This lantern was used to replace my old pump up liquid fuel Coleman lantern that used the cloth mantels While not as bright it stays cool which allowed us to use it inside the tent as well as out side It also worked very well during a recent night time power failure at home The metal ring on the handle is a nice touch and allows the remote to be clipped to the lantern so you don t loose it when stored When needed quickly as in the case of the power failure the controller is right there There is an override On position which is nice in case the remote isn t handy There are two down sides first the 4 D cells make it a bit heavy to hang inside the tent Secondly the florescent U tube has a special base which will limit availability to Coleman parts I don t view these as problems just inconveniences Over all I m very pleased with the lantern and the ease of use HR 
5 0 Another use for this lantern I purchased this lantern for a different purpose than what it is advertised for I have a hall with no light and it is very dark at night Sitting on a shelf my little lantern gives exactly the right amount of light and I can cut it on before I enter the hall Neat huh 
5 0 FUN Personal Accessory and Water Bottle This is an upscale designer water bottle top of the line and so much fun The designs Of Sigg s water bottles are gorgeous from the plain solid color bottles to the ones with intricate designs They are simply beautiful I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns thinking it would take more work to maintain These do necessitate regular cleaning I clean mine every day but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun Sort of like my rings glasses and watch I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory reminding me to drink more water making a statement about my values and expressing myself with a special design Yes all in a water bottle Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality made of light aluminum on the outside slightly insulated and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles They are light durable and perfect for any activity Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles just like from the tap Sigg bottles come with several different types of tops I bought the screw top because I don t like sports tops and I don t mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink It is totally leakproof which is important to me The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner I get comments on it all the time What s that I love it The sports top version is ok I just am not a fan as I don t feel like I can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top However for convenience you might prefer it For children there is a cap type top All are leak proof If you are ever unsatisfied with the top you can buy a screw top separately to fit your Sigg bottle Sigg makes their personal water bottle in 6L and 1L in this style I have both I use the 6L for sports activities because they are smaller When I won t have to carry the container I like the larger bottle Sigg also makes a smaller 3L bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people You can buy Siggs in alternative sizes too such as 75L 4L for kids 6L 5L You can occasionally find this bottle in the 1 5L size also Search Amazon for the perfect size Pick a style and pattern you like as this bottle is a personal accessory and should reflect your style The colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on Amazon They are expensive but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health so they are well worth it value wise for me Highly recommended 
5 0 Indestructible I first purchased one of these for my older daughter in Germany It s five years old and still looks great My younger daughter loved hers I purchased the twist top attachment she s too young for a sport bottle top and she drinks from the open bottle more easily than a cup Perfect size for little mouths I was concerned that these are not meant for the dishwasher and I was skeptical of the claim that they only needed rinsing It s absolutely true I bought some special cleaning tabs and I ve used them only a few times always when traveling and some sort of juice has been forgotten for days It s so easy to clean them out this way warm water plus cleaning tab 30 minutes later it s brand new inside Great for lunches or backpacks no glass to shatter or plastic lining to transfer taste Can t live without them now 
1 0 Pure Junk A total waste of money You can t hear the bell even if you have it clipped to your body the vibration feature didn t work and the timer has a mind of its own I smashed it with a pipe wrench and felt good afterwards 
5 0 Brilliant and motivating This is a nice inexpensive alternative to a gym timer Use it for jumping rope hitting the bag etc Also great for Tabata Protocol workouts Google that to learn about it Nice and inexpensive and has a real bell sampled sound Great

4 0 Grandson s Christmas Gift We ordered this Speed Sensor Baseball as one of our Christmas gifts for our grandson living in California and he has enjoyed playing with it 
4 0 A Great Pocketknife for the Price But Be Prepared for the Size I bought this pocketknife as a gift to replace my husband s smaller lighter Swiss Army pocketknife This version is a wonderful heavyduty pocketknife with practical utility purposes but be prepared to receive a much larger and heavier version of its smaller lightweight relatives It is too heavy and bulky for my husband to carry in his pocket he said that he would have to wear a sheath on his belt to hold it comfortably However he loved it and wanted to keep it anyway He still has the smaller version that he has carried for years and still does in his pocket and the new pocketknife has found a home in the glove compartment of his car 
4 0 Pretty good I think the wipes are a little small to clean an entire may but otherwise they seem to do what they are supposed to 1 star for size Pleasant smelling but not at all lingering or overpowering I suggest using this right before your practice as the aromatherapy dissapates pretty fast 
1 0 Not for children I bought this thinking I could cut it down and that it would fit my 6 year old son It does not fit even with cutting it like the instructions say You re going to have to look for a specific childrens mouth guard I m looking into the Shock Doctor line of guards 
5 0 Awesome training tool When I first started using this product the cord was very rigid and did not perform like the commercial showed however I contacted the manufacturer and it turned out that I just had a defective Hit A Way The manufactuer sent me a free replacement and I noticed a huge difference This is a great training and warm up tool and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their hand eye coordination and swing The concept is basic the price is reasonable and it works 
5 0 Challenging and flexible perfect for the busy but serious exerciser I love Cathe Friedrich s workouts She s energetic and encouraging but not too much so think Denise Austin I just can t take that level of perky Plus her workouts don t pull any punches they re designed to challenge you and push you to challenge yourself I regularly do several other of Cathe Friedrich s workouts Muscle Endurance Pyramid Upper Lower Body Supersets I love them all for variety but I think Muscle Max is my favorite It is 68 minutes of a complete workout upper body lower body and core with barbell dumbells and resistance band You get it all You don t need a barbell however All exercises can be done with dumbells alone Better yet you can choose what you want to do The DVD comes with Premixed workouts loaded If you don t have time for the 68 minute full workout you can do the 42 minute upper body the 23 minute lower body or the 53 minute time saver OR you can go to a Mix Match section to choose your own specific exercises from the entire DVD The Mix and Match section has its drawbacks it takes a while for the DVD to switch out of the program into the menu and back into a program which makes this the most inconvenient of the options However it s great if you want to match up one of the premixed workouts with the core workout or if you just have time for one small group of exercises say triceps I LOVE this DVD It is the most comprehensive and flexible strength training workout I ve ever done and I ve done a bunch including many from The Firm series I highly recommend this one 
5 0 A challenging whole body butt kicking workout Since starting with the Gym Style series I ve become a big fan of Cathe s Her workouts are unsurpassed they re the toughest around and results are guaranteed Muscle Max is no exception Other reviewers have already given the detailed breakdown of the workout so I ll just add my praise for this tough and effective sweatfest She hits the chest back biceps triceps shoulders core and legs and hits em HARD I find the chest tri s especially challenging Man whatta burn The only thing I m not that crazy about is having to change the weight on the barbell multiple times But I suppose I should just be happy I m getting a breather All in all this workout ROCKS and I love how it s transforming my body 
5 0 Excellent medicine ball There isn t much to say about a medicine ball but this one arrived exactly as I had imagined and what I wanted This particular ball is just like the ones at my gym This ball s material is easy to grip and hold and doesn t slip out as you re doing sit ups or other floor exercises with it 
5 0 I like this WAY better than the liquid fuel stove This is my first propane stove and I will never go back to liquid fuel again It lights very easily and stays lit very well with the wind guards in place correctly Clean up is simple with the removable splash guard It gets VERY hot VERY fast so keep an eye on your food the first time you use it I boiled a large pot of water in about 5 min 
5 0 Perfect Stove We just got it and it s perfect Larger then we thought and plenty of space for large pots and skillets Ours will be hooked to a large propane tank and is perfect for our family Well worth the money 
4 0 Great For Young Boys Great gift for you boy where he can play with the football and practice kicking 
4 0 Silica Gel I am using the Silica in my gun safe in Florida It went a little less than a month before needing to be rechareged Seems to be keeping the safe dry 
5 0 Camp Cot Great product Easy set up Left two up all summer in a 10 tent Storage bags are a nice extra 
5 0 The Mity 8 has all of the important features except cadence Recommended This is the lightest most reliable most commonly used computer on the low end of the market the 15 25 range You re buying what everyone else is which is both good b c tells you many consumers who did some research agree with your decision and bad because well you re not hip and individualistic oh well This cyclocomputer is great for what it is Installation is pretty dang easy even though the instructions are basic at best really just make sure the sensor is close enough to the magnet on your spokes and that the wires turn with the handlebars If you re in the market for a device to tell you how fast you ve gone how far and for how long this is it The only negative comment I have is that operation is not intuitive but the instructions make it clear Really this is an issue common to all similar devices and cateye s mity 8 is no better or worse than others The next step up is a similar model that also measures cadence The speed at which the pedals turn measured in Revolutions Per Minute Inexperienced cyclists tend to ride in higher gears than they should pedaling at a slower cadence experienced riders in the 70rpm range Again Cateye is the way to go and as expected more features means a higher cost Beyond that are devices that include heart rate monitors This is great but there is a substantial extra cost and gadget factor A separate monitor may be better like on the wrist 
4 0 met expectations installation was easy works well does what it says it should instructions were poor it could have been easier to access infrequently used features like reset odometer or change tire size if it had another button all in all I m happy with it 
5 0 Great Ball We ordered this to help trim down and develop core strenth and the exercises that were also included have done wonders We really do recommend it to our senior friends 
5 0 The best whistle I first came across the Acme Thunderer in England I think they re based in Greenwich a few years ago It is the most powerful whistle available something to do with the size of the pea and the size of the chamber It s fun to know you can get the best of something for such a modest price 
4 0 Great one For the price you pay it is a great buy Works well and loud enough for a well attended soccer gam 
5 0 Awesome deal The original insta bench and with the free shipping it s the best deal on the web 
5 0 Great Product Great product that is very easy to set up and take down What a great way to keep teams in a designated space The bench arrived at my house in 3 business day Good service and price 
5 0 Insta bench Outstanding Product We first saw it at a tee ball game and had to get one We ended up buying two for our team Easy to setup and put away easy to carry strong lightweight Everyone asks where we got it 
5 0 great for soccer team I ordered this for our 6 yo soccer team and it is AWESOME They love being able to cheer for their teammates and sit together as a team Very easy setup and not too heavy Highly recommende 
5 0 excellent product i am thrilled to have purchased the bench knowing that it is an excellent product and the best value for my money i am very happy that i now have my own bench equipment so my two boys and their teammates will have more fun and comfortably watching the soccer games while on the side i am looking forward for the 2007 2008 soccer season to begin 
5 0 Great for all ages I coach a 6 year old team and play in an adult soccer league This bench is awesome for all ages It is very convenient and easy to fold up and go My teams love it and are spoiled waiting for me to get there with it every game 
4 0 soccer Bench Purchased for Granddaughters soccer team The girls love sitting on it and between games it makes a nice place for them to stretch out and rest on it Only complaint is that after using for 2 months now approx 12 games the bottom material is pulling away from the top and hanging down Hopefully it will not affect the durability of the seat itself 
5 0 Excellent Value for Portable Soccer Bench We ordered this six seater folding bench for my son s soccer games and it works great Folds very easily and compactly and no problem getting it into the carrier bag With the endless fire ant problem in our area it s nice to assure the boys aren t sitting on the ground while waiting to sub into the game 
5 0 So pleased with the Bench Its nice and light weigt holds alot of weight My wife and I sat on it with my 3 year old and 2 other adults were sitting on it at an indoor soccer field Everyone that walked by had something nice to say about the bench I was the talk of the town for the day I got it for my soccer team for the spring so that the plays didn t have to sit on the ground My daughters travel coach used it and now the kids watched the game is stead of horsing around or the side line He asked if he could buy mine I said no way heres how to get one 
4 0 Sweet Dreams Speed Dreams My year old son loves the Nascar Jeff Gordon Bed Tent he got for Christmas It is easy to assemble even my son can do it He can also keep his bed made with the tent on it It is made of very light weight fabric so it is not intended for rough play It is not going to keep anyone from rolling out of bed because the sides do not attatch to the bed One side has two flaps that can tie back for an easy tuck in 
5 0 world class sniper this gun is the best sniper rifle and has the best site that is adjustable for example my friend and i were having an airsoft war and he was 100 yards away and i shot him rite inbetween the eyes and it has a scope attatchment and hint the kind of scope you want is like the one on a bb gun they sell one on amazon under airsoft and there is only one minor prblem that the cock is real tough but you get used to it real easy and it does kind of loosen plus i am trieng to find were to get a extra magazine even though it hold an awsone amount of capacity 
5 0 A true Sniper rifle This is a sniper rifle that comes in full black hard strong plastic and looks awesome The package does not contain much gun jam pipe speed loader bb s and a track to hook on for the scope It has perfect accuracy only with 20g bb s is ajustible up down left right Great for 52 00 shipping included 1 problem It does not come with a scope and does not tell you what kind of scope is needed It also seems when you put the scope track on it would be too far up to see through a scope But besides that great gun ACCURACY 5 5 WEIGHT 6 5 pounds feels very heavy a bit too heavy to hold PLASTIC STRENGTH 5 5 DAMAGE 5 5 with 0 20 bb s SIGHTING 5 5 LOOKS 5 5 TOTAL 5 
4 0 VERY good gun I got this gun a week late because when it arrived in Indianapolis where I live it somehow got shippied off to Seattle Besides the terrible shipping the gun is awesome It is very sturdy plastic and weighs around 6 5 pounds This gun shoots really well and is ve accurate and can shoot through one end of a soda can and out the other from at around 10 15 feet away My only problem is is clip If you overload it it has the tendancy to explode all of the BBs out of the clip And there is no way of knowing how full the clip is either Well there could be maybe I haven t found it yet Overall if you are looking for a excellent airsoft rifle big budget or small budget this is one of the best rifles out there 
5 0 This airsoft gun is the bomb and the beast When I had first receved this gun I quicly opened It and I picked it up and the weight of the gun was very realistic I went outside to shoot it and to load each bb in the chamber you actauly have to cock the gun eack time just like an origional sniper rifle But the 1 ABSOLUTLY COOL THING about the gun is when you have some of the heavy white bb s they could shoot a hole in a tree about 11 inches you can make it in the hole from about 30ft away this gun is one of the best purchases on an airsoft gun I have ever purchased Ohh by the way if you buy the gun with the speed loader buy an extra one just for the battle feild Its not a bad idea to be prepaired 
4 0 Great gun for price i got his gun off airsplat and it shoots extremely hard it will break skin from about 20 feet away the accuracy is really nice and fps is around 380 if u need a low budget sniper rifle this is a good one to get but i also recommned the UTG sniper rifles too and as far as durability goes i had a big war in a creek and i was completely under water with nothing but my head and the muzzel of the gun showing and it still shoots fine two thumps up 4 this M1 
5 0 Great for the money At first I wasn t sure how this gun was going to be I looked at the reviews and thought what the heck For 40 bucks this gun is a steal It says on the box that it only shoots 275 fps but it shoots more than that overall it s great for the money and if you re on a tight budget this gun is for you 
5 0 Amazing gun for the price For 40 dollars you can get a decent gun But this is by far the greatest gun you can get for forty bucks It shoots dead on accurate from pretty far away It also packs quite a punch too It weighs about 5 6 pounds and has a very realistic feel 
5 0 The Rolls Royce of Swim Goggles Very satisfied with these not only do they look great but they re anti fog anti uv and latex free and it comes with a secure double head strap I also like how although there is a blue tint from the interior everything is clear Not only do you get to look cool but you get a very functional pair from the best in the business 
5 0 Love this Hammock I LOVE this Hammock I bought it for 15bucks at gander mountain and It s REALLY REALLY comfortable I cant believe the price of the other hammocks on this site this is definatly a good buy a great way to rela 
5 0 Very durable I have owned this item for about 5 years and it is still going strong I use it for about 20 45 mins day about 4 5 times per week Bare knuckle or with gloves I primarily do boxing workouts but it has seen its fair share of kicks knees and elbows and never seen a tear or a worn spot The padding is about 4 thick and beneath is a solid plastic ring that alows you to adjust the height This is also what keeps it from getting worn spots like a regular punching bag I used to work out at a friends house who had a 40lb everlast hanging bag and after a few months we tore it and had to hold it together with duct tape which made us all sticky after every workout You can fill the base with water or sand i have never filled it up all the way but its pretty stable If you cant use a hose and have it inside i made a funnel by cutting the bottom off of a 2 liter coke bottle and running back and forth to the bath tub with milk jugs Great product for anyone not wanting to drill holes in their ceiling to hang a regular punching bag 
5 0 Not just for kids This helmet is great even for adults I bought it after trying it on at a local sports store and it actually fits better than the adults sizes which tend to look a little too large for my small face 22 year old female It looks great I bought the gray black stars and when I got home my husband at first made fun of me for buying a youth helmet but after trying it on he decided that he liked it better than his current helmet and went out today to buy his own Great little helmet if you feel like adults are a pinch too big 
5 0 Worth the bucks I ve never considered trading in my air mattress for a cot But after reading all the product reviews I took a chance I will never go back to air mattresses again Air mattresses not only leak but they do not keep the body warm This cot is huge like a twin size bed and works great for one big guy or even two children I woke up toasty and rested using a sleeping bag And with its sturdy construction this cot will last for years I ve never known an air mattress to last for more than a couple of months with regular use Yes the cot is higher off the ground than other cots which might be a hassle for people with shorter legs but I had no problems I m 5 8 Be aware it makes a funny creaking sound when you change positions Idea I purchased a quilted twin sized mattress cover and it fit perfectly over the cot Nice and soft 
4 0 convenient rack especially if you rent Extremely lightweight and easy to install because it is pressure mounted you don t need to make any holes in the wall floor or ceiling It s a little awkward to mount two bikes though not impossible An excellent product 
5 0 good for the money I really like this bike trailer I am not a seasoned bicyclist I really haven t rode much in the past three years I did not find this hard to pull on the local trails I think it is a bit hard to pull on slight hills though My kids are 17 months and 3 years Their combined weight is about 65 lbs My daughter is tall and she seems a little crammed in the trailer but she doesn t complain They both really like riding and my son usually falls asleep There are little pouches on the inside of the trailer for sippy cups or snacks The compartment behind the kids is roomy I can easily pack a diaper bag and a lunch box in it It was very easy to set up and folds down I can fit it under the back seat of my minivan I usually don t have the third row seat in the van so I usually leave it set up and it fits in the van without being collapsed I am very happy that I bought this When my daughter doesn t fit with her brother anymore I might buy another one so me and my wife can take the kids in their own trailers Great product If you are thinking about buying the cheaper ones that they sell at Wal mart please keep in mind that the storage compartment is smaller It also is a different brand My sister in law has it and I prefer mine to hers 
4 0 We love it We got this to use as both a bike carrier and a double stroller Putting it together was SUPER EASY since it comes mostly assembled It is bit tight for 2 kids though a 4 year old and 2 year old Because the seat is not firm they tend to slide together and then fight because they are pushed up against each other It attaches easily to a bike but be warned there is alot of drag almost like pulling a parachute I am guessing every carrier would have this issue though As a stoller it is very easy to manuever and push There is some storage behind the seat and that adds to its convenience 
5 0 So glad I bought it This trailer is absolutely perfect for my two year old daughter who is still a little young for her own bike but wants to go on rides with Mom and Dad She has been enjoying it and even fell asleep in it a few times I recommend propping up pillows or towels next to your child if you think he she may fall asleep If not she s bent over in half I was surprised that I didn t really feel awkward or much extra weight behind me and my daughter weighs at least 32 lbs We live in a very flat area so that must help We ordered an extra coupler from the company for Dad s bike so it s easy for either of us to pull her We recently took our bikes and the trailer on a weekend trip and I was pleased to see that set up and break down is pretty simple The trailer fit in the trunk easily I definitely recommend this trailer and am very happy I bought it 
5 0 Easy to Use Rides Great We just got this 2 weeks ago to use with our almost 1 year old son He s already a walker has great head control so we had no qualms about using it earlier than 1 year old This was easy to assemble even with the beagle toddler helping out and we were ready to roll Riding the bike you barely notice the trailer is there My son weighs about 21 pounds and the trailer is about the same but only going uphill did it even affect my riding Otherwise the only time I noticed it was going on off curbs that weren t quite wide enough My son enjoys the ride but we put a small pillow behind him so that his helmet isn t pushed forward by being all the way against the back of the seat Now he can see what s going on and loves going faster than when we take the dog for walks It really is a great product 
4 0 Easy to use Simple to put together and even easier to put on the bike We use ours for our dogs We made some minor adjustments but now I can exercise and not leave the dogs home 
5 0 quality piece I bought this model with the CR rating in mind The box arrived early and in perfect condition Only thing missing from the box was the water bottle It was fairly easy to put together I had two 23 month old assistants and had it up and running within 2 hours The machine runs quiet and smooth The screen is difficult to read My husband and I both use it and is holding up wonderfully We ve had it for a little of a month now It s great and even better for the price 
4 0 ellipitcal 418 trainer It went together fairly easily and so far we are pleased with the product 
5 0 Schwinn 418 Elliptical Trainer My shopping at amazon has been a good experience Didn t want to wait for the delivery but they got it here on time actually early The machine has been great thus far but it has only been 3wks of using it I wore out a horizon 618 Elliptical Trainer in 6wks This is a lot better than that one 
4 0 Great Machine Bad Monitor We received our elliptical way before the expected delivery date which was great Assembled it in about 2 1 2 hours which was relatively easy However the monitor does not function properly It will turn off after 4 minutes Every time Very frustrating to have to reset it 10 times during a work out I have been in contact with customer service who gave me trouble shooting ideas to try and fix the problem After many attempts the monitor still is not functioning as it should They tell me the cables have to be replaced and they have been ordered I will continue to use the machine because it is a great work out It is quiet and smooth I will update this review when the monitor is in full working mode I am sure once that is fixed it will be 5 stars Theresa Joppa M 
5 0 Nice quality for reasonable price I chose this machine after months of research I managed to put the entire machine together in under two hours with only a little lifting help from my husband The parts list was a bit confusing as they were not labeled but I laid out all parts and read the instructions before I began assembly There is a note in the parts listing that lets you know some of the parts are already attached The machine is incredibly quiet and gives me a great workout I have been using a gym elliptical for two years and notice very little difference in the performace of the 418 aside from the programs and placement of the cup holders I also appreciate that I can run the computer with batteries or the ac adapter The only complaint that I have is the machine is not quite as easy to move around as the information led me to believe It moves fine in a straight line but is difficult to turn Overall I am very happy with our purchase 
4 0 Reading the reviews saved me assembly time Overall I m very happy with my purchase My criticisms relate to the assembly manual the so called computer and the instructions for using it Had I not read the other reviews of the 418 here I would have decided that two wave washers were missing Instead I expected them to be installed and they were It took me about an hour and a half The installation manual barely meets the criteria of a manual The computer is really a control panel that acts as a timer a rheostat to set the resistance and a calculator The computer manual rates a 0 to 1 star It doesn t even tell you how to change the user which we found out by trial and error Push the USER button followed by enter up key the number to the one you want then ENTER again Simple once you figure it out Once over these rough spots of assembly and setup it s a good workout 
5 0 Great Machine Confusing Assembly Instructions The Schwinn 418 Elliptical Trainer is solid and well built It s operation is quiet and it makes exercising as painless as possible It is an excellent value for a consumer elliptical machine for home use The problem that I did have was with the assembly The instruction manual is very confusing since it does not clearly differentiate between the various sizes of parts and does not state that some parts are already attached to the pedals and are not in the hardware packets There were two washers missing and two plastic caps which were not labeled to determine left or right since they were two different parts but looked identical I also had difficulty getting one of the pedal assemblies to fit properly since one of the welded brackets was misaligned I called customer service and they quickly sent me a complete package of hardware to assure that I had all necessary parts I highly recommend the 418 Elliptical Trainer but make sure that you identify and sort all of the parts before you begin assembly so that you don t come up short 
5 0 A GREAT PRODUCT I bought the Suunto brand on the advice of a friend It was great advice The T3 monitor does and tracks EVERYTHING It takes a while to learn how everything works and to get it set up but it s time well spent The foot pod is equally as good Once you set it up you get very accurate tracking of your distance and speed Being able to track data over time on the watch is a huge plus and the multi line display let s you see multiple reading at a glance Get one if you re considering it You won t be sorry 
4 0 Excellent product but not for the meek I have had my Suunto T3 and footpod for over a month now and have enjoyed it very much The Training Effect feature has been particularly valuable in gauging my workouts and keeping myself from under over training The only downside to this device is the same for many like it you have a tremendous amount of functions and only five buttons to access them with The basic functions were fairly simple to master but I still find myself digging out the manual to use some of the other functions That said the watch is comfortable and moderately stylish and the monitor strap fits well and doesn t slip easily The footpod is pretty accurate as long as you keep a regular stride The pod gets in my way for cycling so I take it off for those sessions but thankfully it is easy to take on and off All and all an excellent product recommend for everyone 
5 0 Great Product at Amazingly Low Price I can t not imagine having a great machete and it s easy for me to imagine many things I would want one for This one is cheap not very big and of good enough quality and the kukri style is great for cutting brush chopping and would be fine of fighting too if you had too Truly unless you have more money you want to spend on a machete or really don t need one because you never leave your house out of fear and don t play Jumanji or perhaps you have no arms this machete is for you With care chop on chop on SamKoche 
5 0 A flotation swimsuit that actually works We have tried numerous flotation swimsuits life jackets for our 3 year old little boy They were all a huge disappointment either his mouth was under water or the flotation device overpowered him bobbing him forward or backward into the water This swim trainer by Swimline solved the problem it does exactly what it s supposed to do keep the child above water either in an upright or swimming position He can move freely and switch between swimming and upright floating effortlessly never losing his balance or confidence The vest style upper body goes on and off very easily We also tried a similar swim trainer with attached shorts and found that the crotch would just ride up making it quite uncomfortable for little boys We prefer this vest only style worn with regular swim shorts It stays on him till an adult takes it off Our son likes to be thrown up in the air and then splash into the water the swim trainer stays on him nicely he cannot slip out of it no matter how wiggly he gets Wearing the swim trainer with regular shim shorts is also nice when we are at the beach or pool party don t have to strip the child naked when he is ready to get out of the water He can keep his swim shorts on and continue to play on dry land It has a strong inner tube built in NOT like the cheap plastic rings that made of material like beach balls You need a bike pump or air compressor to inflate if you don t have one you can take it to the gas station and use the same pump that you use for your car tires You cannot blow this up by mouth It is truly a great item looks nice durable affordable and most importantly WORKS We are very pleased

4 0 Smooth Ride All Terrain My husband and I love this stroller We take a lot of walks and this can handle any terrain It is very smooth and maneuvers well even with one hand We added a bundle me during the winter and a ray shade for when it s really sunny A con might be that the cup holders are shallow so drinks often times spill when you go over a bump and it is a little heavy for quick trips to the store so I would suggest a cheap light weight stroller just to keep in the car This is a great stroller especially for the price 
5 0 awesome turning jogging stroller that swivels in the front very fast glides easy to manage even a 5 year old in it 
5 0 Love it This stroller has quickly replaced our travel system stroller+car seat for several reasons 1 The ease of navigation with the swivel front wheel is great for those times you have to push one handed 2 The wheels are sturdy the wheels on our combo system snapped off 3 It folds to about the same size as the previous one and has just about the same amount of storage space If I had one area of improvement it would be the drink cup holders aren t deep enough When we are out jogging the roads are sometimes a little bumpy and the water bottle will bounce out but you can get those drink holder adjusters at the auto store and that should solve this problem 
4 0 Awesome stroller I love this stroller and it has been getting me off my butt to take walks with my son The swivel wheel is a dream it veers to the left a bit when walking but you have an option to lock the wheel when going for walks or runs I just choose not to and I m sure it can be aligned I was amazed at how easy it was to push this stroller and the handle height is perfect for my 5 10 husband and myself 5 7 My son is 2 5 yrs and he loves the stroller He even fell a sleep in it when we went for an evening stroll The adjustable recline of the seat is great although I wish it could sit a bit more upright I took off half a star for that The bottle holder is a bit shallow as one reviewer has also mentioned and my water bottle falls out at every major bump there goes the other half star but there is a little pouch in the back The stroller is a bit bulky as expected and we have to take off the wheels to fit in the back of my car lexus sedan and my husbands car navigator but the wheels easily come off on and on Just expect to put in a little effort when trasporting this stroller to malls recreation and amusement parks But the effort is worth it once your all set The stroller manuevers well in malls It s nice that the front wheel is situated under the foot rest so it doesn t need extra clearing room when pushing through aisles and stored in the mall I researched the heck out of all the swivel wheel jogging walking strollers thanks to all fellow amazon shopper for their reviews and I must say for the price you get superb quality Why pay more when this stroller has everything you ll ever need I am very satisfied 
5 0 Great stroller I recently bought this stroller and I m really happy with it My two year old son weighs almost 35 lbs and didn t fit comfortably in his stroller anymore and it was starting to fall apart I didn t want to buy another flimsy stroller so after doing some research online decided on this stroller It is so easy to push it glides along like it hardly weighs anything It aslo has a swivel wheel in the front so it s easy to turn I use it mostly for running errands It s great for going to the mall and I m sure I ll use it all summer at the zoo etc I may even take up jogging now 
5 0 We love it and baby loves it We are very pleased with the performance of our safari stroller Set up was very easy and took only a few minutes We re not joggers but we use our stroller to go over all kinds of terrain including snow and ice with ease The large wheels make asphalt curbs especially easy to go over We ve only encountered a few minor problems The foot brake sometimes drags unexpectedly so you have to lift it up occasionally The stroller is a little wide for narrow store or bus aisles Also folding the stroller takes some practice We bought the rain cover for 20 which also works effectively as a wind shield for those cold but drafty days Our 10 month old often takes naps in the stroller so I guess he must be pretty comfy The price is fantastic for the value Now if we could only find a nice ski pulk for the same price 
4 0 Great Stroller This is a great stroller It had nice sized tires for a smooth ride Pushes well over any terrain Child has ample room inside padded seat for comfort Handle adjusts to varying heights for adult pushing GREAT feature Only downs to the stroller are sometimes doesn t fit into tight store aisles well and the storage basket could be a bit larger Otherwise this is the BEST stroller we have purchased Would definitely recommend to others 
4 0 Best I found for slippery paws I was so frustrated with those so called sticky mats and skidless towels I left everything to try a jade harmony mat This product worked really well for my slipping issues When my yoga classes get really hot however i do notice I may slide a little in down dog but it is nothing like any other mat I ve tried Some people complain about the weight of the rubber mat since it comes in 3 different thicknesses Since I have scoliosis and want to carry as little as possible on my back I chose to get the thinnest rubber mat 1 8 travel mat While at the yoga studio I place one of their common mats under my mat for added cushion I also recommend doing this since the rubber mat tends to be a dust magnet So if the floor isn t the cleanest say if you practice at a gym studio dust hair and fuzz tends to attract to the mat The smell of the harmony mat is overwhelming when you first get it It would make my entire room smell of rubber when I was trying to air it out The smell however fortunately goes away over time Just make sure you air it out for as much as possible I ve had my harmony mat for about 10 months now and I don t notice any wear on it 
4 0 Good mat short life span I enjoyed using this Jade mat for the past 10 months or so My only real gripe is that it wore out so quickly To be fair though it didn t last any longer or shorter than my previous mats But for the price I had hoped that I could get more than a year of use out of it The mat is heavier and thicker than most mats It is also at least initially perhaps a little less sticky than some of the other mats I ve used Once in a while I did have some trouble slipping on the mat during my practice but this was due to sweat and I doubt any other mat would perform better in this respect For the money I would probably go for a Manduka mat That s what I ve switched to and I have no complaints The benefit of a Jade mat however is that it is more ecologically friendly since it is I believe constructed entirely out of biodegradable material which is something you can t say for most mats including the Manduka 
5 0 LOVE this mat I had been on the lookout for a decent non slip mat for some time Fortunately not only did I find a good one but it s environmentally friendly too And in colors early rubber mats were in white snore The cushion is nice too especially if you attend classes at a studio with a hard floor surface those thin plastic mats just don t cut it on hardwood It is heavier than the average mat so you ll feel the difference rolling it up and carrying it around Plus it doesn t slide in and out of my cloth yoga mat bag like the plastic mats so I ve given up the mat bag for velcro straps There s a heavy rubber smell in the beginning but that goes away with time Easy to clean too I just rub down with anti bacterial wipes I can t comment on durability yet as I ve only had this mat for about 3 months But I use it nearly every day and drag it back and forth to class and it s as solid as the day I bought it 
5 0 Great Perc but cheaper elsewhere Makes great coffee We just ordered a second one from Coleman s on line website for 24 00 Odd that amazon says the list price is 34 99 eh 
5 0 Best Coffee Perc out there This enamel coffee percolator is a really well thought out and built item The pot and lid is constructed of enameled steel and the stem and basket is aluminium The perc knob is clear glass sealed with a gasket in the lid allowing one to easily see the color of the coffee as it percs to determine when your perference of coffee strength is reached I have used mine for years with only one very minor problem The aluminium stem that holds the coffee grind basket got slightly bent but I successfully bent it back into place without damage As noted by another reviewer these aluminium items are weak However what are these items designed to do and what strength holding a basket of perking coffee grinds might be required I bent the stem trying to stuff a small bag of coffee grinds and the bag of filters into the pot with the stem in place for storage That was 100 my fault not that of the product I quickly learned that the coffee pot is NOT for storage but for percolating coffee Go figure uh Aside from me slightly bending the perc stem the coffee percolator has performed flawlessly and has produced quality tasting coffee The coffee easily loads into the coffee grind basket for perc ing Being a 14 cup perc it out produces other 12 cup percs The handle is large enough for a gloved hand or a pot holder to easily fit into so as to hold pour the coffee The item is very easy to clean including removing and reinstalling the glass knob and seal Have not had a problem with chipping the enamel under normal use which chipping can easily happen via abuse Nor has the glass knob cracked or chipped or any damage to the knob seal Both the knob and seal are readily available at sporting goods stores should they need replacement Should you be searching for a coffee percolator that produces quality coffee ease in use large pot handle clear glass knob ease in loading coffee basket ease in clean up ease in storage and manufactured of quality materials that will be around for years to come then the Coleman 14 Cup Coffee Enamelware Perolator is the unit you re looking for A few tips Do not fill the pot with water high enough to touch the coffee grind basket If you do grinds will float out of the basket and you will end up with coffee full of coffee grinds Be sure that the water level is below the bottom of the coffee grind basket before you start to perc Secondly slightly dampen the bottom of the basket with water prior to putting in the filter paper That way when the filter paper is placed in the basket it will immediatly stick seal to the basket s bottom This way the filter paper can not slip or pull up allowing grinds to get inbetween the filter paper and the basket Should that happen those coffee grinds will escape into the coffee 
5 0 Tough for Low Impact This is a great workout I needed something to give my knees a break from all of my other high impact step workouts And this one definately succeeded Cathe knows how to make you sweat with this one you have 7 intervals of different sculpting moves and the combinations are easy to follow before each blast I loved this workout And I have been doing it once a week on the day I need something not so jumpy 
5 0 Great Workout I was looking for a challenging low impact workout and couldn t find one until I found Low Max This is a great workout and I raised my step to 8 and I feel the burn Cathe is a wonderful instructor and I have really become addicted to her workouts My cardiovascular conditioning has been bumped up a notch thanks to all of her challenging yet fun workouts Great Music Great Instructor 
5 0 Don t let the name fool you Don t let the name fool you Low Max is anything but low intensity As other reviewers have stated this workout is not for beginners it is truly for advanced exercisers With that being said I thoroughly enjoy this DVD and it is currently the workout I do most often I love that the DVD has several premixes so you can choose to do just the step aerobic segments just the power blasts or two shortened versions of the aerobics blasts combined when short on time or less motivated The choreography is a little tricky but if you are familiar with other Cathe videos you can pick it up pretty quickly Unlike Imax 3 you get a chance to practice the moves a bit before you combine everything together good for those days when I m a little less graceful shall we say I also love the fact that Cathe finally has a good lower impact workout that doesn t skimp on the calorie burning My knees are thankful hopeful Cathe will do more DVDs of this type Definitely crank up the ceiling fan have a towel handy for this workout 
5 0 Fun challenging I so love this dvd It s a great challenging workout Simply put Cathe is the best of the best I wish there was the choice to just have vocals no music She did that on some of her older DVD s so you don t have to get sick of the same songs 
5 0 Intensity and sweat Finally I was able to try one of Cathe Friedrich s new DVDs Her Low Max workout is intense but fun I really enjoyed it and burned a TON of calories in the process This workout is mostly a low impact step routine with intervals of floor toning but it isn t easy by any means I don t recommend it for beginners or anyone with two left feet The music is great but the fast tempo and intense pace will frustrate those new to step aerobics Cathe mixes a few dance moves like the mambo and the chacha so the choreography may require some amount of practice Still if you re up for the challenge and looking to workup a SERIOUS sweat this DVD is for you I plan to order more DVDs from Cathe in the future She does a good job of cueing and looks great Wow scale 9 out of 10 Difficulty Advanced Studio setting A bit boring but current for the times 
5 0 very good tennis racquet I am a beginner of tennis sports With this light weight racquet I made some progress during this summer I like it One of my friends who is a very good tennis player has used this racquet for three years and he also likes it 
4 0 Great racket for beginners I bought this one a month ago I just started to play tennis for 2 months about 8 times I had a cheap racket under 40 The TripleThreat really made quite a difference to me It s a oversize one has lots of power much easier to hit at the sweet spot The control could be a tricky but still way better than my previous cheap one I saw reviews complains that it gives elbow problem not to me I truly believe that this should be an ideal racket for all beginners I am still learning so couldn t comment on more advanced features 
5 0 Great Racquet I love this tennis racquet It has a perfect blend of power and control It is great for players that are able to generate their own power but are looking for a little more control The balance is a little head heavy but its not so heavy that it tires out your arm The oversized head 110 sq in gives this racquet more of a sweet spot area This is a great racquet for groundstrokes and volleys I had a little more trouble controlling my serves Overall I would recommend this racquet for any player at the recreational level or competative level 
1 0 customer service is dead every person i communicated with was not only rude but were clearly annoyed by my need for help and completely unwilling to assist me I returned the product that i was charged 103 10 for and was refunded 40 70 thank 
5 0 Outstanding Purchase I had this airbed shipped to my mother s house over the holidays for out of state family to sleep on Everyone commented how really comfortable and convenient it was It only takes minutes to inflate and deflate the built in pump works great I was so happy that it didn t lose air after two weeks of use After the New Year it easily fit in the carrying case that comes with the mattress and packed it away in the closet for the next time 
5 0 MSR 30 Lightning snow shoes This is a review of MSR 30 Lightning Snow Shoes Weight 3 lbs 14 oz 1759 g per pair Size 8 x 30 in 20 x 76 cm I weigh 180lbs I own Sherpa Tubbs x2 Atlas Salomon MSR Denali and now these MSR Lightnings These are simply the best These have incredible non slip ability They are very light and the bindings are OK Salomon have the best bindings The crampons work just fine Side slope stability is the usual problem for snow shoes These are the best on side slopes that I have used Total traction They have excellent flotation for my weight plus pack A class product Well done MSR 
5 0 great product My son and his friend enjoy this scooter very much It handles very well 
5 0 Scooter The scooter is great My son loves it It does go faster that the regular scooters Highly recommended 
5 0 Great Fun My son got this for his 8th birthday and is having a blast It is very easy to put together took me less than 10 minutes It is like a combination of skateboard scooter mountain board etc He has been on it every day since he got it Its also good exercise and can really pick up speed Definitely a good buy 
4 0 This thing is a beast I am 16 and I tried this out at the park a few days ago This thing is so fun to ride It can lean side to side and the front turns all indenepently so you can choose how much to bank in a turn I don t understand why this is being sold at Toys R Us considering it s something that would appeal more to adults You can get into the high 30s if you found a big enough hill The wheels are the only problem whether to cut production costs or save kids lives by reducing speed it does hamper it s abilities to carve since they are made of plastic If you really plan to buy this and want it to go as smooth and fast as possible find a shop that sells Longboarding Wheels prefferably Sector 9 that are 70mm or above stick them on this thing and it will be a much smoother faster and grippier ride I suggest no one under 12 ride this down any big hills I seriously think they would kill themselves unless supervised by someone who could stop them 
5 0 SNow skooter Recieved in time for christmas excellent product High QUality very happy with purchase 
5 0 sno jack We haven t had much snow yet but product arrived super fast and was half the price of any other store Daughter loves it great seller 
5 0 Great snow toy but no snow We re anxious to use our cool new snow scooters They look great but we just can t test them out until the Globe cools a bit more and we get some snow 
4 0 Great tool for multisport I have been using the T3 and GPS POD for few months right now and am very satisfied The watch is great slim design with lots of functions but might be tricky to remember how to access all One flaw of the watch is the cheap plastic that is easily scratched For the GPS POD everything is fine small light except that it can take some time to get a satelite signal and that the battery life is rather short about 10h Overall conclusion great tools 
5 0 Great all around device I have had this device for over a month now using it 4 6 times per week I have used the heart rate monitor and the GPS together for cycling and running and have used just the heart rate monitor during weight training workouts I use the interval timer a lot during my cardio workouts to raise and lower my intensity levels That said I am very impressed with the T3 GPS combo for the following reasons X Accurate heart rate measurements X Seemless connectivity between HR belt and T3 X Accurate speed and distance measurements with GPS X Tracks and notifies HR zones X Tracks calories burned X Stopwatch and interval timer The T3 has a lot of other features that I haven t used to great extent yet but I have used the TE training effect feature which helps you to measure the overall effect of your workout on your cardio vascular fitness to measure and increase the intensity of my workouts when needed I ve also used the logs on the unit to review the recorded workout data It stores a year s worth of workout data that you can view from the T3 or you can buy a PC pod and download it to your computer The T3 also can be fine tuned to more effectively track and measure your workouts by entering your height weight max heart rate and fitness level Again I am very impressed with the T3 Multisport combo pack and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good HRM that can track speed and distance and record your workout data You will be very happy with its functionality and performance 
4 0 Works good despite a few problems I have had the bike for about 3 weeks and am happy overall It is very smooth and quiet even when the resistance is increased It also has a wide range of resistance with the highest resistance providing more than I would ever need But I do have a couple issues to mention When the bike arrived one of the plastic feet on the rear stabilizer bar was broken I called the manufacturer and they immediated sent me a replacement rear stabilizer bar When that arrived one of the plastic feet was broken on it too So I unscrewed the good one and replaced my broken one Apparently there is a quality control problem with that part When working out I noticed a slight click on each revolution It turned out to be coming from one of the pedals I tightened it down extra hard and the click went away Now despite a low frequency rumbling sound it is very quiet I think the sound is normal and it certainly does not interfere with the workout It is quiet enough that I forget about the sound once I get going The seat is hard and a little uncomfortable I can handle 30 minutes on it which is how long I am currently working out Maybe I will buy a new seat one of these days The seat post looks standard so any seat should fit But I would still buy it again if I had the choice I paid 400 
4 0 crazy this toy is awsome and crazy but it sucks that u can only get it online PUT IT IN STORES 
5 0 Pretty Good Ramp I bought this ramp because im a skateboarder I skate a lot I am pretty good and one of my friends is a sponcered skateboarder and he loves riding it I think it is kind of small but it is really good for a beginner If your gonna buy a flybox stick with ten eight not xfactor 
5 0 Fun stuff I am a Downhill MTBiker and i bought this so i could use the 2 jumps not the table top IM not saying its bad its just i jump 10 feet so i amde a 10 foot double out of this for those of you who dont know a double is a jump with a gap and then you land on a another jump landing thing anyways i used it and it works great Its very durable so i could go fast enough on it without it breaking to do whips of the jump 5 starts its so cool 
5 0 aawesome This ramp is tight you will skate it all day long Only problem would have to be the ramp sliding Besides that it is aawesome 
4 0 Not Bad If You Can Find It For A Good Price I bought this ramp for myself when I first started getting really into skating It has really helped me to become a better skater and it is fun too When I bought this I could barely go down or up one side of the ramp without being to scared or falling off Then I progressed to being able to go down one side then being able to go over the whole thing I can now ollie off of it and do kickflips on the tabletop Now I don t use it as much anymore because we built a halfpipe in my back yard but when I feel like street skating I can pull this out with my grind rails and set up a street course This ramp is perfect for beginners and it is fun to learn on Once you get to a certain point where you are doing kickflips over the whole ramp it s time to put it away in the garage This ramp is pretty durable and mine began to slip a little bit on the street after a year or so but it has nt really been a problem I would recomend this ramp as a nice starter but only if you can find it for cheap I got mine for fifty and it was worth that but I don t think it is worth much more than that 
1 0 horrible My order did not arrive by the expected date of deleivery It took over one full month from the time i ordered to the time it reached The protein wasnt sealed and it looked like it was half empty What basement is this company operating from 
5 0 Bowflex series 3 treadmill review I am very pleased with the ease of assembly and quality of this treadmill It is everything that I had hoped it would be ie easy to use quiet yet challangeing 
4 0 a nice buy 1 Eagle only sent one guy for the delivery He couldn t move the huge box inside the house by himself I had to help him a bit I m 30 yr female 2 The assembling instruction is not hard to follow But I would suggest 2 people do this It took me a little bit over 1 hour to install 3 It looks very sturdy and heavy The folding mechanism is easy but I ve yet to figure out how to move it by myself it s just too heavy for me to tilt 4 I ran on it for 15 minutes as a test A good buy with less than 1K price 
5 0 Bowflex Delivery Up to the threshold not over it Since we are in our seventies we misunderstood the delivery rule and was shocked when the delivery men explained that each company has it s own contracts for delivery to it s customers It was a bad weather day in Michigan and leaving this huge and very heavy box outdoors to get all wet just seemed so incredable to say the least Thankfully seeing that we would be incapable of moving the box indoors the kind delivery men pushed the box over the threshold and out of the weather Bowflex you need to make a more reasonable delivery contract 
5 0 Almost perfect home machine The only thing I wish this treadmill included was an option that would allow me to save MY settings for a workout There are several pre programmed workouts and I ve tried most or all of them Over time my speed is increasing so I m not using the pre programmed settings as is I typically have to do one or more button presses each time the treadmill changes to another part of a program in order to increase the speed to where I want it Aside from that however this is a wonderful machine Our old treadmill had finally died after 10 years or so And I hadn t REALLY been doing enough of a workout on it With the Bowflex Series 3 I set the treadmill for the program and time I want and start working out By doing this every day I ve started to slowly lose a little weight and more importantly my HDL the good cholesterol has increased over the past few months from 38 to a current 54 goal is at least HDL of 60 I absolutely credit this machine for the substantial improvement in my health 
5 0 great product I just recveived this treadmill after ordering on Amazon less than w week ago It is a solid piece of machinery and goes together really fast It took me 30 min to put together I did my research on treadmills and tested alot of them This is a great treadmill for the price No vibrations when running You will be happy you bought this 
5 0 Good as advertised The Bowflex Series 7 is rated best by CR but was to much for me to spend I was unsure about purchasing the Series 3 but it has more then preformed up to expectation This is a excellent treadmill and I would recommend it for anyone My wife walks one or two times a week about one mile and I run about two miles three times a week and it has done great for both of us It looks nice and folds up if needed 
5 0 great treadmill but heavy to get in the house This treadmill is a great product very sturdy and runs smooth It is better than the treadmills that I was using at the high priced gym where I was a member The only problem that I encountered was getting it into the house it took 3 strong guys grunting pretty hard to get it in the house Once inside though set up was easy and took about 30 minutes The only thing needed was a phillips screwdriver the one supplied could have done it but it wasn t too easy with it All in all I am really happy with this treadmill it s a well made product 
5 0 Great Treadmill I did a fair amount of looking before I bought this model and I am very happy with it I became interested in Bowflex treadmills after Consumer Reports rated the Bowflex 7 series as one if its best folding models Shopping on Amazon I realized that Bowflex made 3 folding treadmills the 3 the 5 and the 7 series Online these look very similar with the 5 and 7 series having longer tracks and a bigger motors Strangely the best source of information on these was not the Bowflex website itself it has no information on the 3 5 and 7 series treadmills just those crazy tread climbers but rather the specs from Amazon Consumer Reports indicated that the best way to buy a treadmill was to actually see how the machine felt I agree I managed to find a store that had a 7 series in stock I was impressed The 7 series was rock stable and has a very nice folding mechanism it locks in the up position and drops down slowly when released a great feature if you worry about your kids getting crushed by the track accidentally Unfortunately I could not find a dealer that carried the 3 series to try in person but it seemed like it would be optimal and very cost effective I also tried several Nordic Track treadmills in person These seemed to have very unappealing walking decks sproingy in a bad way and even on high hp power machines the motor seemed to power the track very unevenly I decided to take a chance that the 3 series would be as sturdy as the 7 series I tried I am very happy Amazon shipped the thing super saver in a relatively short period of time very appealing It was very straightforward to assemble once I got the thing in place parts are labeled and the assembly pictures are really self explanatory It is also a quiet machine and the deck is very sturdy even for a big guy like me 200+ lbs One quibble the grip heartrate monitor could work better sometimes it does not give a reading after even 10 sec of holding Also be aware the deck will not lock in the up position unless you reset the incline to 0 degrees The incline automatically resets to 0 every time the machine is powered on I use the machine primarily for walking for this application it is great the machine handles inclines and relatively fast walking speeds with no problem I can t comment on how well this machine compares with others for running fast For jogging it seems just fine A note on delivery and installation This thing is very heavy 275 lbs The shipping company chosen by Amazon Eagle did a great job I called them prior to delivery to schedule when they would drop it off thats the good news The bad news they would only bring it to the threshold just inside the house I asked if they would bring it upstairs for an extra fee and they said no way Three calls to moving companies and an estimate of 250 300 to move it from my entry up a flight of stairs this is not a two person job the shipping box is enormous 80 x 35 x 16 I solved this problem by recruiting my father in law also a big guy We turned the box on its side opened it and moved the main piece track and motor together by itself Make sure not to cut the restraining strap this keeps the frame and the track held in place making moving much easier Even then the main piece weighs about 200 lbs and was serious work getting around corners Very glad at that point that I bought the shorter 56 track Overall a great mo chine equal to much more expensive models Glad I managed to avoid a hernia during installation 
5 0 great machine I lost 32 pounds in 3 months using this machine I started off with 20 minute work outs then 30 now I m up to 50 It is easy to use and quite fun with ways to modify the duration and complexity of the workout My brother and i set it up in less than an hour It is incredibley well made strongly recommend it 
4 0 There are more good points than bad about this radio I m very satisfied with my two Hummer radios as they are very sturdy and very high quality I have no issue with the handle feeling like it will break easily and no big issue with the light button either however I do agree that the small analog tuning wheel is nearly impossible to read but I m capable of finding the stations I listen to with minimal inconvenience I didn t buy this as an everyday radio only for emergencies What I particularly like about the radio is it s smaller size compared to other similar wind up radios My wife and I both have small go anywhere fanny pack style survival kits and these radios are the perfect fit with room to spare 
4 0 Great Emergency Radio Light This is a well made product that met all of my expectations My only reason for giving a 4 star rating is that the analog tuner is very small and that makes it hard to tune in specific stations I am sure that I would be able to find a good station in an emergency and just leave it tuned there The sound is very good and the charging dynamo works very well 
4 0 wonderful mobile i received this mobile as a gift and i love it Our daughter falls asleep every night watching all the pictures all of which can be changed with replacement pictures that come with the mobile I especially love the music and the remote control that you can use to start the music which is great when you re in another room This was a great gift 
5 0 Excellent It was tough trying to find a quality tricyle for my 2 5 year old This trike is extremely well made as you would expect from Schwinn My son is on the short side so he can t completely reach the pedals yet but he loves scooting around in it 
5 0 Our Preschoolers Love This Trike Having researched every trike known to Google I decided to buy two of these for my twins 3rd birthday presents My deciding factors were these have metal frames most trikes now are plastic and lightweight they are low to the ground so balance is hardly even an issue and the wheels are proper wheels that inflate not plastic So comfort and movability are great The weight size of tires and low profile makes tipping almost impossible Another nice thing is that the seat adjusts very easily and can accomodate our 5 year old who has asked for one for HIS birthday They look cool too They do need to be assembled but the instructions were good The first one took me about 10 minutes and the second one took me about 5 minutes The only negative is that both of the front wheels arrived flat so we had to pump them up before we could use them Not a big deal and given how cold it is not surprising there were some flat tires 
5 0 Kids love it grown ups do too I bought this trike for my niece for her 2nd birthday She LOVES it My sister and brother in law were so impressed by the durability and quality The seat adjusts so it will last her until she s ready for a bicycle It s heavy and sturdy so you don t have to worry about it tipping over 
5 0 Great Experience Everything about the ordering shipping and receiving of this product was great The trike arrived just in time for my grandson s 3rd birthday and it arrived in pristine condition 
5 0 The Perfect Tricycle Well after getting this yesterday and putting it together today I must say this is a wonderful trike The weight on the trike is substantial but not too much that my 20 month old girl couldn t move it easily around the room The assembly was much easier than I thought it would be and it s very very stable The only thing was there is a couple small dents in the front fender but since it s probably going to get several more it really is a non issue to me Now I know that they say from 1 and 1 2 years but my 20 month old who has long legs and is tall for her age barely reaches the pedals She s happy using her feet for now I would wager this will be in this family a long time Sorch 
4 0 Good Little Machine This machine while not expensive did just what I wanted it to Does not take much room in the house either A good addition to my workout 
5 0 Thumbs Up My mini stepper arrived in new condition and on time Thank you Jod 
4 0 Nice This machine is compact and easy to assemble and use It is great for a quick workout 
4 0 Nice mini stepper This mini stepper is similar to the Impex Easy Step Plus Mini Stepper with Twist Board except that the electronic counter is more basic it gives time and counter only The package arrived in pretty bad shape and one piece of plastic where you put your feet was broken I didn t want to deal with replacing it so I use some epoxy and it works fine The manual to assemble the whole thing is bad but it is pretty easy to assemble it You can setup the height of the step very easily If you want it to be more compact you can remove the twister plate I like the small weights coming with it I recommend it 
5 0 Nice gloves for heavy bags training Very nice protection for heavy bags training Nice grip also There is one thing I have to say though these gloves tend to run small I mean my hands are medium amongst Americans and I had to squeeze them into these gloves every time I don t know what would happen to those who have bigger hands 
5 0 Yankees Fleece was a hit at Christmas My son loved the blanket it was one of his favorite gifts 
5 0 Nice These are really nice tires I used them and went more than 1000 miles on my rear tire with NO flats and very little wear I only changes it because I had a big race and was worried about number of miles on them Switched to Vredestein Fortezza tricomps but still would recoment these to They have a bit of a softer feel than the Tricomps but can only be inflated to 120 psi Tricomps give you 145 
5 0 It Works Now you do have to have some common sense here Pre heat the thermos with hot water before you put the food inside After the metal inside warms it does a phenomenal job of insulating and keeping food hot Cold food does well too And it s as tough as advertised If you ve ever dropped a glass insulated bottle you ll love this thermos 
5 0 Ice cubes the next day yeah I bought this water bottle to keep my water cold and after trying many other drinkers I saw this Hydration Bottle by Thermos I was looking for a drinker or bottle that had a CHUG style opening no baby rubber straws that flip up or inside straws that fall off when you add ice I wanted something that would give me water on the spot and was easy to load with regular sized ice cubes without cramming them down with the pick action of a spoon handle I also wanted something sturdy a bottle that could withstand a direct drop onto a concrete driveway when my water bottle falls off the floor of my truck and out onto the concrete First let me tell you this gem keeps your water freezing cold more than a day long I still have ice cubes the next day Also this awesome water bottle holds enough water to satisfy me much longer than those wimpy kindergarten 12 ouncers I don t like to run out of water I live in the desert The bottom has a rubberized base to eliminate scooting and also offer some protection from drops Also it s completely spill drip and leak proof absolutely The super cool push button flip open lid gives you instant clearance to chug a gulp of water this is particularly nice when you re driving and you don t have an extra hand The surface of this hydration bottle stays condensation free no wet hands I fill this every morning and don t leave home without it I like having water with me all the time but am picky about quality water so I take my filtered water no thanks Aquafina bottle water I ll bottle my own for free I love this product If it ever breaks I ll buy this same one again A NOTE This hydration bottle would be perfect for carrying baby formula in especially if you re traveling on vacation on a plane trip going to be away from home all day Your formula would be plenty warm and ready to fill more than one bottle The hydration bottle would relieve your worry of spoiling your formula or needing to find hot water quickly somewhere to mix your formula I wish I d had this when I was a new mom RECOMMENDE 
5 0 Good exercise ball for a great price I purchased this ball several weeks ago and have been using it pretty much every day It has been working fine The pump that comes with it is a real positive as depending on your lower back strength you can adjust the air in the ball Also no issues on the packaging and delivery The ball and the pump came without any defect and in a reasonable amount of time The price at 12 99 is hard to beat Highly recommended 
5 0 Beach Umbrella with chair The quality and looks of this item are great I was amazed by it I ordered the black chair the one without the logo Everything about it is quality and it s comfortable and light weight too Can t wait to use it The umbrella is stable when inserted in the slots on the chair unlike one that is clipped on The little table is nice and will easily hold my drink and a book Also it folds up very nicely to stick in the trunk of the car or back of our minivan I got my money s worth No regrets on this item Also the delivery was quick The whole experience was great 
5 0 Better than expected I am on the road a lot Sometimes I can t find the time to eat It tastes great and gives me the energy I need when I need it This is so much better than those horrible energy bars It is small and convenient I have noticed better performance having some food in me when I just can t find the time to eat For the person on the road a lot buy this and keep it in the car 
4 0 A little extra storage I love my Side Seat car Cover by Thule The Organizer fits very easily on my passenger seat side Its a perfect fit as it is the exact length between the top of the passenger seat and its armrest Thule has made it very clean looking and built it well It adds three pockets to stash your odds and ends It is very handy and mostly out of the way even when I reach back behind the drivers seat I use my vehicle as a support station and it helps hold stuff I need to get to quickly The upside Small compact and out of the way Easy to get to while driving Adds storage without cluttering up the car Build to last and easy to install Will work well with and will not interfere with other behind the seat storage devices or pockets Kids can t kick it from the booster seat And looks cool The downside It does not hold too much stuff and my passenger seat armrest cannot fold up while it is attached Not that it ever needed too anyway Good product for the money 
4 0 Stability Ball I love this product The only thing was that I believe it was smaller than what it said it was Other than that I love it It got to my home quickly 
5 0 nice this block is nice and sturdy but not too heavy much better than the foam blocks i have used 
5 0 A much needed change My boyfriend and I are active yogis and attend class at every opportunity I m pretty flexible and don t typically use blocks but he well he uses them with some frequency The foam blocks typically from Gaiam are inexpensive and so are propagated by yoga studios however they give very poor support and don t feel at all secure to put your weight on And the older and better used they get the more they give under you So I invested in these cork blocks as his valentine s day gift and voila Now we fight over who gets to use them They re sturdy and solid without being too heavy and buying them through Amazon the price was right they cost a lot more on the Hugger Mugger website and other places I highly recommend 
5 0 It s great I am very happy with my cork block It is a nice size and is heavy enough that it doesn t tip as easily when I use it to steady a pose 
4 0 65 cm Exercise Ball I have the 65 cm model and it came as described It is has more of a latex feel than some of the more rigid plastic feeling balls and it is not as rigid as I have experienced in the past Still rugged and very useful but it is probably better suited for folks 6 shorter than advertised 
5 0 I love it This scope is high quality for its price The scope package comes with mounting rings and other tools to install this scope onto your weaver rail The delivery was fast and I am satisfied 5 5 Start + 2 Thumbs up to these guys This scope is huge by the way and pretty heavy 
4 0 Just What I Expected I recently purchased this to replace an older broken computer The cadence helps significantly with training Wireless is always nice but considering price this computer is perfect It was easy to install and is easy to use 
5 0 Great for indoor resistance training I purchased this computer to replace another Cateye that was a front wheel sensor speed distance because I recently started using a resistance trainer indoors and needed crank cadence and rear wheel speed distance sensors Nice features and easy to mount and wire 
5 0 Must have Come on people this item is a no brainer If you have any or all of the Legend of Zelda games and enjoyed them then this is a must have it item 
4 0 Very good spotlight but it takes too long to charge I really like the brightness of the light The only thing I don t like is that it takes about 15 hours for it to charge and you can t use it while it s charging or you ll damage the unit It has 1 000 000 candle power which is excellent The fluorescent light is very bright too Besides it having to charge for 15 hours I really like this product 
5 0 Very Nice Light I had no such problems with my lantern I charged it for the recommended 15 hours and the light was super bright It lasted on and off use for about 4 5 days The light is super sturdy and is great because it does not use up batteries like other lights 
5 0 bumper fun These cars can be summed up in two words FUN and LOUD I have two and my four year old loves it and so do all his friends They work great throughout the house and hold their charge really well I am even thinking of getting a third They do leave little marks on the wood floors but it cleans easily Well worth it 
4 0 Bumper Buggie Review When the buggie arrived it didn t work I had to call Razor s Customer Service Dept Their service is awful The Senior Agent was very rude I managed to figure out the problem on my own The electrical unit was not connected Once it was connected it worked fine We have two of them The kids love them They are lightweight and ride well on carpet Overall the product is good 
5 0 Happy Children Great product fun for children nicely designed easy to operate I purchased 3 of the razor bumper buggie Ladybug cars for 3 of my grandchildren age 4 3 and 2 The cars arrived promptly At Christmas I charged the batteries and gave them to the children The cars work great Even the 2 year old can work her car Just like her big brothers Although one battery did not hold the charge correctly a quick call to the company and a new part was sent immediately GrandmaLind 
4 0 WOW best toy for 2007 This is the best toy I ve spent money on in years It s cute my girls love them I bought two They are great to ride in the garage or believe it or not they go well on carpet They have laughed bumped even learned how to use the driving handles with their feet Great fun 
5 0 Hours of fun We bought these so the children could have something to play with during the winter We backed our vehicles out of the garage and zoom they were off having fun The box says Ages 3+ and up to 55 pounds The bumper buggie looks small but it is roomy enough for my 5 1 2 year old He weighs 45 pounds and is 45 inches tall He can stretch his legs out in the car but chooses to keep his knees bent while driving My two year old can also work the controls It is easy to use and the kids can do a complete 360 My only complaint is that it is a little bit noisy but no more than other battery operated vehicles I highly recommend this item It is so much fun Best part is that there is little assembly required The only thing we had to do was screw the seat into the car 
5 0 Perfect Item I received the Pyramid Pro Gel Seat Cruiser Cover in a timely manner The cover fits perfect on my stationary bike Great fit and perfect comfort I would recommend this item to others 
5 0 Saris Guardian 2 This is a pretty nice bike rack It s sturdy enough to hold your bikes without worrying about them moving around and dislodging The product manual is really difficult to understand but the rack itself is simple enough that the manual isn t really needed Overall it s worth spending a little extra for this rack as you don t have to worry about anything when using it Plus it s got a lifetime warrenty Can t go wrong 
4 0 Pilates Ball I recently purchased this ball for my pilates workout So far so good the ball stays firm and the included pump is lightweight and convenient to use My only complaint is that the 55cm ball is only available in white I would have preferred a more vibrant color 
5 0 Good Stopwatch I got this stopwatch as a gift from my grandmoher It s very acurate and is the perfect tool for racing I also use this stopwatch for recording the number of minutes I play the piano I would nt recommend it for that use because it moves exactly he way the clock moves But overall this is a great item and I highly recommend it to anybody 
4 0 Works This is good Very tiring after the first 5 roll but its worth it Easy to assemble simple price and works A must buy 
5 0 Just what the chiropractor ordered This device is exactly what I was looking for Once you get comfortable enough on your knees try starting from the standing position very challanging I have to disagree with the not worth it review The whole POINT of this device is to force your body to WORK so a mechanism to make your workout easier would be counterproductive Stop whinging and do the work 
5 0 A Killer This equipment is no joke and it deals out quite a lot of pain for 6 bucks I decided that it wasn t that hard on the first day and did a couple more reps than a should have Needless to say I didn t work my abs for the next 3 days because I was too sore to move them around Get this and let your friends try it You ll love the great looks on their faces 
5 0 Its the cheapest out there I can t believe some companies will charge 86 for the same concept This one cost 6 Possibly the cheapest in the US market Performing this excercise is extremely hard I first saw this done standing by jackie chan in the movie gorgeous You need strong abs and chest to start with plus good arms to keep balance if you want to perform at this level when you start out on your knees Be sure to wear gloves the handles are stiff plastic Then TRY JUST ONE complete rep and celebrate If returning to the original position pinching your abs together is hard then try resetting yourself and just concentrate on going down stretching your back and abs out Then the next day try 2 reps Then take a day off Overdoing will be painful the next morning I really recommend doing this excercise as your FIRST workout before working other parts of your body It would be tough to even hold the thing together after pumping your tri bicepts or shoulders TIP leave an inch gap between the wheels by wrapping some rope around the bar to make the balancing act a lot easier Finally i happy to say after a few months of doing this on my knees i was able to start off from a standing position jackie chan style I have pretty strong six pack now I can take blows from a 10 year old But i still have a nice sheet of flab over my abs from the lack of running this winter Goodluck to those who dare this feat 
5 0 GREAT PRODUCT I bet you have never felt your abs get demolished the way this will If you have never used one and or you are out of shape stay away I tell my clients that if I am asking them to even do it once it is a compliment and testament to the fitness they have These things rule take up no space are cheap and get you ripped Enjoy 
5 0 Intense Core Trainer The Ab Wheel will strengthen your abdominals from top to bottom as well as your lower back It is a very intense exercise you will not have to spend a lot of time doing the exercise in order to get excellent results For most individuals myself included I recommend starting slowly Do not try to do a full extension of the exercise Initially the full extensions put some undue stress on the lower back With each work out you can extend a little furthur and in no time you will likely build up to full extensions 
4 0 great ab workout but no miracles expected This is a great little device to work your abs but it s not going to give you a six pack all by itself you need to watch your diet as well Two tips 1 make sure you stretch before use especially your back and shoulders since they will be getting a workout too 2 use it on a thick carpet or put a folded towel under your knees you ll be a lot more comfortable All in all this is far superior to the more expensive ab devices you see on late night TV 
4 0 The Best Ab Workout The Ironman Double Ab Wheel is the best way to get ripped sexy abs without breaking your wallet I ve used the Ab Wheel for a month now and have lost 20 lbs I admit that it was intense when I first used it because of the immediate burn that I felt but as soon as I got used to it the fat just shed right off 
5 0 Fits Nikon D40 Excellent Pelican Quality As with all Pelican cases I have a half dozen this case provides the ultimate in equipment protection from the elements I just wanted to say that this case fits the Nikon D40 w standard kit lens 18 55mm perfectly According to my measurements and eyeballing it it should also have no problem accommodating the same body with an attached 18 200 mm VR lens once I get that upgrade 
5 0 Best air horn This is the best air horn you can buy because unlike aerosol air horn cans it can never rust nor run out of freon I like this model of this type because it s smaller and the membrane diaphragm is protected from accidental tears by a grid cover on the large end I keep one in my 16 ft runabout boat And I take one with me when I m diving I would like to see the manufacturer make one half that size especially for scuba divers and snorklers My only complaint is that the lanyard came off So I drilled a small hole just below the lip of the small end and inserted a new lanyard This product works great Really LOUD It s quite durable but being plastic it is breakable and it is subject to stress cracks and ageing from sun damage But if you maintain it by washing it occassionally and keeping it out of the sun and not knocking it around it should last a long time And if it doesn t so what For 8 or so it s cheap enough to buy another 
5 0 Great for excercise or as an office chair Great for excercise or as an office chair The TKO Anti Burst Fitness Ball Set 75cm ROCKS Cool color too 
1 0 not impressed The footpump that comes with this ball is almost useless and very frustrating to use My Fitness Ball would not fully inflate I returned it 
5 0 Great snowshoes Crescent Moon Gold 10 I have many types and brands of snowshoes from traditional ash wood and rawhide to the new aluminum style with synthetic decking Crescent Moon makes the best of the modern design snowshoe The binding system on the Gold series is very easy to adjust and use when you have cold fingers Your boot does not slip out of the binding like my Atlas and Tubbs snowshoes They are well constructed with welded frames Many of the lesser brands do not do this The fit and finish shows their high quality standards They provide good flotation on fluffy snow and the crampons bite well on hardpack Another PLUS is that Crescent Moon snowshoes are made by an innovative company located in Colorado USA I also purchased a pair of Crescent Moon Gold 9s for my wife She loves them The Gold series snowshoes also have a lifetime warranty I highly recommend their products 
5 0 Excellent and convenient I have used this regularly not for Rehab but for routine exercise It is convenient to adjust the weight because the weight has been divided into 20 iron bars 
5 0 Great 1st Bike for 4yrs old and up We purchased this bike for our 4yr old daughter We chose a Schwinn because of its reputation and quality and we were not disappointed The bike is extremly well built and sturdy 3 wheels and will last for many years to come Our daughter loves the coloring tassels and the zippered pouch to hold all of her knick knacks The only thing that I did not pick up on when ordering the bike is that it does not come with BMX tires only smooth ones So heads up if you live in the country like we do However with 3 tires this bike can go just about anywhere 
5 0 Worth the money I purchased this bike as a first big girl bike for my daughter s 4th birthday graduating from the tricycle She loved the color and even the streamer handlebars which were an extra pleasant surprise for her Stability is excellent she successfully rode almost instantly Yes you can save or more and purchase a less expensive bike even with the Schwinn name as I did for my older son but the quality construction comparison is night and day The other bike is only two years old and has had reflectors brake off connected by plastic instead of metal When he s ready for a bigger bike I ll definitely spend the extra money 
5 0 Schwill Jasmine Girl s 16 inch Bike We purchased this bike for our four year old granddaughter We received prompt delivery the bike was easy to assemble and it is a joy being with her when she rides on her big girls bike 
5 0 excellent choice our daughter loves her bike it was alittle difficult to put the front wheel together with the frame but when we figured it out it all went together ok the bike is a solid frame very sturdy and my daughter feels safe and loves the bike this bike is well worth the money definately recommend it 
5 0 The Average Joe Workout Lose weight and tone your muscles with this home gym Anyone can get back into shape using this product The smooth motion of the workout is easy on the joints 
5 0 Great Machine I purchased the Bowflex Conquest in late February I was looking for a machine that my wife and I could both use My intent is to tone muscle and lose some weight The Bowflex Conquest arrived in approximately one week after ordering Eagle Global Logistics delivered it no problems The machine comes in four boxes that are quite easy to move around your home to wherever you decide to place this machine The heavist box is around 65 pounds Setup time from start to finish i e from opening to boxes to throwing away the trash was about 3 hours I was not missing any parts and the instructions are very easy to follow The machine seems to be very solid stable and well built I ve been using it every other day for about a week and am pleased with how it works The motion is quite smooth and it s easy to do a multitude of different workouts on this machine It takes a few times to learn the different ways of using this machine the book and included DVD help Overall this is a great item for the average homeowner It would probably not be the best choice for an avid bodybuilder or someone like that It s a perfect choice however for the average Joe just looking to get a good workout in his her own home Just a side note I had to call Bowflex Customer Service to ask a question they were extremely helpful and knowledgeable Overall I m very pleased with this purchase and am glad I bought it 
5 0 Making a change I bought the Bowflex because I wanted an alternative to lifting heavy weights that from various injuries made my joints ache After unloading my basement full of gym equipment I searched for the best deal on a Bowflex that met my needs and price range Amazon offered alot of choices at good prices so I settled on the Conquest I opened a business CC and have six months interest free to pay for it and ordering was simple The delivery went great and came in about a week or so Since it comes in four boxes I strongly recomend taking everything out one box at a time and spread it out Putting it together was fairly easy if you follow the directions and aren t impatient you can do it by yourself but it may help to have a second person at times My early thoughts are that I will love this product although it does take some time to learn all the exercises and the attachments The video does the best job of showing various things the booklet lacks good pictures of certain attachments and their use In the end I feel I made a great choice at 46 I enjoy an active lifestyle and this will help me keep it Plus I feel it won t effect my golf game in a negative way regular weight lifting did Dave Michiga 
5 0 Perfect for my needs Over the last 2 years I have been member of 4 different gyms I traveled a lot overseas during that time so I juggled the memberships quite a bit and ended up paying way more than I wanted My usual trips to the gym took 2 4 hours including travel time I m a pretty motivated person but after a while it is just becomes too difficult to get myself in the gym because of the time and money involved After coming back from a recent 1 year trip overseas I ve decided to look into home gyms to save both money and time After extensive research I ended up purchase the Conquest here on Amazon Some other machines I looked at were the Platinum Crossbow Total Gym Bandflex After comparing all the machines and going to the local sporting store to try out the Bowflex I had no doubt that Bowflex is well worth the money Other machines might be cheaper smaller and easier to assemble But I found that the Bowflex quality is difficult to match Setup I put together the machine in about 2 hours All you need is a couple of screw drivers the everything else needed is in the package The instructions were easy to follow and makes logical sense However my Bowflex like many others arrived missing a few parts In my case it was just a few washers and a couple of screws nothing critical but such problems seemed common from what I ve read Operation If you have not used a Bowflex yet you are in for a treat The Power Rods provide very smooth resistance and wonderful range of motion The resistance builds as you flex the power rods very easy on the joints at the beginning of the motion yet still provides enough to break down your muscles toward the end of the motion The DVD provides instruction for basic exercises about 15 and the manual covers over 60 different exercises A lot of them are simply variations of another exercise but I found myself creating new ways to exercise that is not covered in the included material The weight and type of exercises were easy to change and will not interfere with your workout I found this to be a very good time saver vs waiting for machines at the gym Size No matter how many times you have seen the Bowflex on TV you won t realize how big the machine truly is until you have put it together The conquest is easily 7ft tall and takes a huge amount of space in my living room It has wheels but you will not be able to fit it through most doors so think long and hard before you decide which room you will place it Value I ordered here on Amazon because of the awesome discounted price they had evident by the fact the machine sold out 2 days after I placed my order But after using the machine for a week I can honestly say I would gladly pay full price for the machine Like any other piece of exercise equipment if you make good use of it and it is worth every penny I noticed that this machine is nearly identical to the more expensive Sport model but is hundreds cheaper Summary This is the best item I have purchased in 2006 over the years I always ignored the Bowflex TV ads and considered it a fad But the Conquest proved its worth a dozen times over the last week for once a machine that works better than advertised Pros solid construction long warranty exercise variety smooth motion easy operation great long term value Cons Setup time size missing parts Neutral Decent resale value 
4 0 Nice flashlight ok lantern I was surprised by how bright this LED flashlight is when used as a flashlight They ve got a nice mirror lens for focusing the beam When you pull it apart to make the lantern it s ok would probably light up a tent just fine Would be a nice little light to take camping 
5 0 great product Gives alot of light not like other lamps we ve tried Great to have on had during a power outage Perfect for camping if you can recharge 
5 0 A VERY GOOD PRODUCT THESE LAMP IS REALLY USEFUL COULD BE USE IN ANY PLACE KIDS COULD USE EASY TO TURN ON DO NOT REFLECT HEAT 
5 0 Lipo 6 really works I just started taking Lipo 6 about five days ago and I ve already lost five pounds I m 6 1 and about 234 lbs My usual weight is between 190 and 200 lbs but I ve been having some rough times over the past few months so I kept packing on the pounds out of desperation Now this supplement is keeping me happy and awake The only side effect I ve noticed is an occasional case of the jitters but hey it keeps me awake I look and feel different already and this is from a cynical point of view I highly recommend this product The only side effect I ve noticed is an occasional case of the jitters but hey it keeps me awake I don t know if it ll keep working after reading some reviews but I m happy with it now If any more progress or anything negative I ll just update this review 
5 0 It works Ok I must admit you wll get a bit of stomach discomphort and READ THE LABEL do no take more than 4 caps a day It ll freak you out If you are sort of dieting and excercising THIS STUFF will work and you will LITERALLY FLUSH THE FAT OUT OF YOUR BODY Maybe thats why you get a bit of diaorhea at first DO NOT TAKE IT FOR LOBGER THAN 8 WEEKS I AM ON MY SECOND ONE AND I CAN SEE THE FAT GOING BUT IT WILL EVENTUALLY STOP WORKING Its ok 8 weeks is more than enough time to loose it all IF YOU ARE EXCERCISING IT WORKS 
1 0 I should have known better OK I got suckered by reading good reviews on the net and over hearing a trainer at the gym singing praises of Lipo6 So despite that I have never found a weight loss supplement that actually worked I decided I d give it a whirl I was amused by a previous review which says DON T TAKE IT IF YOU RE ALREADY A HEALTHY WEIGHT Well she then goes on to mention she is a VERY healthy 5 1 and 115 lbs But she took it Should have been a red flag to me I must be the only one don t see this side effect mentioned elsewhere but this made me a total BEAR to live with ok not the B word I REALLY want to describe myself as but it s the PG version I was irritable had daily headaches and saw no movement on the scale whatsoever Waste of money waste of time waste of quiet evenings at home ruined by my annoyed mood 
5 0 weight loss exercise aide This bottle is double in size from the one you can buy for the same exact price at Walmart I ve used the product at a level that is less than it recommends on the bottle as I find I just don t need as much of it to achieve what seems to be a good affect I m not looking to lose a huge amount of weight Honestly I find that this works amazingly as a energy booster for me during the day and I use it like most would a cup of coffee I get that awake energetic feeling without any side effect of jitters etc It s not upsetting to my stomach at all regardless of if it s on an empty stomach It says not to use it late in the day and I d have to agree if you don t want to be kept up then keep it to the morning and afternoon but I have actually taken it late in the day when I know I have to stay up late and stay awake or am on a long drive It just makes me feel better overall and when I go on my daily run or get on the weights I m tuned in and have the energy to give it my best I did notice a slow decrease in weight loss all over my body I was fighting the bulge on my middle and I did notice it helped with that as well I have recommended this product to many of my friends if they ask me how I ve slimmed down or they are complaining of a lack of energy When I quit taking it altogether I do notice a pretty strong reduction of my energy and tiredness and that is with only taking a total of one or 2 of them a day It states you should build up to 2 in the am and 2 in the afternoon I m sure that would really add to a rapid weight loss as it seems to curb your appetite I find when I take it I really feel great and don t seem as hungry so I don t really think about food since I don t feel like I m dragging I ve gone thru 2 bottles of it and am ready to buy my third One downside It can have a tendency to give occasional heartburn If you are someone who suffers regularly from reflux you might want to be careful with it but I found that a few tums would neutralize that when it happened One capsule did leak in the bottle and had an odor like peanut butter 
4 0 WHOA results My boyfriend took this last year for wrestling season and lost about fifteen pounds without at all altering his eating or exercise habits As an athlete he always gets a huge amound of exercise at practice and by lifting weights and running daily but eats whatever and as much as he wants He started the bottle weighing 195 200 at 6 1 and ended weighing 178 He maintained this weight for about six months too proving that it wasn t just water He DID experience pretty bad side effects however to the point where he said he wouldn t take the product again or recomend it to anyone Taking the suggested 4 pills a day he felt constantly sick like he had all the life sucked out of him and actually vomited twice pretty gross Anyways because of the significant results he experienced i ve always been tempted to try the product myself and finally picked up a bottle last week to my boyfriend s dismay So far I haven t felt sick or shaky at all and I think this is because my daily dose of ritalin has all but completely numbed my body to the effects of weaker stimulants like the 200mg of caffeine contained in this product I also unfortunately haven t noticed any weight loss and this may be for the same reason I ll report back when I finish the bottle 
4 0 firey Lipo 6 promises appetite suppression increased weight loss increased energy increase metabolism and target problem areas Does it work Maybe Heres my experience Weight loss I dont weigh myself often but I ve been told I look thinner I dont notice a radical change in my clothing but I do realize the scale is telling me something I like alot better than It told me a month prior to today But I dont have any official numbers on record Did I lose weight probably but I worked out and losing any extra due to this product is questionable Targeting problem areas I feel more comfortable with my problem areas but it could simply be more psychological I dont measure inches and I dont dont weigh myself Clothing doesnt fit much differently Appetite Suppression I should have focused more on this I know one day I hardly finished one serving of oatmeal while other days im pigging out on fruit and sweet potatoes and turkey burgers I never really felt as if days I were light on the supplement my appetite decreased or my appetite decreasing at all for that matter Metabolism Energy I d have to give this a plus here On days I so happen to forget to take the supplement I lacked the energy to pick up running and when I tried to force my way through it I d slow back down to a walk just a half mile into it Plus I lacked the horrible crash that I feared that taking this would give me when I stopped using it had to stop taking it for a few days twice Worst I had was a slight headache likely from the lack of caffeine Ok Negative side effects This stuff goes straight through you And the smell is horrible Its just short of diahrrea It wasnt something I was unable to work through it didnt interrupt my day but it was definetly a nuisance Because of that I cannot wait for this to finish and make its final course through my body Your will not like you because of this product but if your willing to tolerate that go for it it likely wont hurt you but keep in mind there are horror stories out there claiming heart palpitations stroke and death I just had a firey So take with caution there are also some incredible stories of weight loss go with whatever you want 
4 0 Cars fan We purchased this for my son s 4th birthday He LOVES it After camping for almost a week in the basement we finally took the tent down to get him back in his bed This tent is perfect for inside We haven t had an opportunity to test it outside yet but we will have a regular tent as a backup 
4 0 pretty kool i like all the items that come with the tent my son is 15 months old and we play in it in the living room he also uses the book bag and bottle on a daily basis as his baby bag we also take naps in it 
5 0 Happy Grandson My 4 year old grandson hasn t slept without this sleeping bag since I got it for him It was to have stayed at my house but he wanted to take it home Washed up great and colors stayed true Good value 
5 0 Excellent A product that is well worth the money OnGuard makes the best bike locks that I have seen Fast and easy to use this lock is a nightmare would be thieves prefer not to think about it I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a good bike lock 
5 0 Giant is GIANT and Colosal is COLOSAL Cordura is the best textile fabric In this case GIANT and COLOSAL are not just words are facts I have both the Colosal and the Giant versions The Colosal which I have is dark blue almost black actualy and is COLOSAL Is the biggest Duffle which I have ever seen in my whole life The Giant one is red and I must admit that I like the color This one is not smaller either Both are simple light do not have a lot of compartments and Cordura is the best material I have a pair of pants wich look like new after years and years 
5 0 Basic but well made This appears to be a well made basic duffle which will withstand heavy duty The addition of one or two zippered pockets would make it even better 
4 0 Good no frills duffle I was looking for a good no frills duffle for camping gear and this was just right It is strong and durable Only one compartment though I would have liked one small pocket for little items I have the medium size duffle which holds a tent and gear and the small size duffle which is very small It holds a fleece sleeping bag blanket and a small camping pillow and that s about all Also these bags include the shoulder strap Some gear duffles do not 
4 0 What to say It s a spork I bought this to use with my Mr Bento lunch kit and I m satisfied with it The spoon is deep enough to be useful larger bowl than for example the average plastic spoon and the fork simply does its job The knife edge is useful for foods that are already fairly tender ie tender enough to cut with the edge of a metal fork but the limitation is that you have only a knife not another utensil to hold the food in place since the knife is actually the edge of the fork Be sure to pack a napkin though since it ll need a wipe when you switch between spoon and fork The handle is a bit short which is why I take off a star All in all though it s exactly what I was hoping it would be and I would recommend for lunch kits etc 
4 0 Good for beginners except I like this balance board I m just starting out and I like that the angle is not too steep and that there are bumpy treads on the surface I also like that it is octagonal rather than round so it makes it easier getting on and off for us beginners One star removed for the enclosed exercises there are none Happy exercising 
5 0 Valentines present I bought these pink tennis balls for my dog for Valentines day She loves them Besides that I also gave some to a friend who is an avid tennis player and she said they were excellent They arrived two days before they were suppose to All in all I am very pleased 
5 0 Pure Convenience The E Z Foldz Step Stool is one of the handiest inventions in years No only for households with small children but for any household that needs that extra height but doesn t want to keep a step ladder handy Certainly a help reaching those cabinets over the microwave and frig and it stores in the smallest space even under the sink 
5 0 Unbeatable Performance for the Price We were looking for a step stool that would work to assist the ederly in and out of a van When we seen this we knew we sould give it a try although we wondered if it would have enough stability When it arived we were very impressed with the stability and so are the folks in the van pool A great product 
5 0 Cheap and Solid Ingenious and practical Does the job and then disappears What more could you ask for from any contractor 
5 0 Stores Compactly Very Sturdy I wish they had a picture showing how this folds flat This makes it so easy to store We use it in our RV as it takes absolutely minimal space I find that my ankles don t swell if I put my feet up on a small stool like this on long trips The plastic is very strong making the step quite sturdy 
4 0 Excelent Tennis friend It easy to play tennis with it confort and power at same time So you most to have presicion it s in ocation dificult to control it But at time you do it 
5 0 The best for the beginner intermediate I did a lot of research for a racket before purchasing this one One of the reasons I got it is because of the very light weight of the racket I have a sist which cuts circulation and strength in my swing wrist not allowing me to utilize the full force of my arm during the swings so I had to have a really light weight racket The other detail to my story is that I am a weaklink and I need a light racket I am also a beginner player and needed a racket that would bounce off any side of the racket I hit the ball with This racket is truly a wonderful piece 
5 0 Light and easy on the elbow I was using forearm banding for tennis elbow for a long time When my old racquet broke I did an extensive research for a new racquet that provided comfort and control rather than power I came across Head Ti S5 and after trying a demo the feel was so good that I took my banding off I bought a pair and for the past month I have not had elbow or wrist pain with this racquet And I play tennis 4 5 times a week The weight is light and the frame absorbs a lot of shock and vibration upon contact Besides comfort the larger head size and wider string pattern allow you to generate topspin without much effort If you are a beginner intermediate player with slow to medium swing you ll find this a comfortable and easy to handle racquet Highly recommended 
5 0 excellent well i just got my clubs today and i have been to the driving range and golf course already i must say the clubs are the best i ve used for a really good price 
4 0 Great Deal First let me state that I am a far below average golfer and am in no way qualified to debate the merits of different materials designs etc If you re seriously considering paying 100 for a full set of clubs you probably aren t the most discerning customer either Having said that the Hippo clubs are an outstanding value Bags alone run upwards of forty dollars at sporting goods stores The clubs are great quality for what they cost and I couldn t be happier with the purchase If golf ever becomes a more serious obsession I m sure I ll upgrade to a better set of clubs but these are perfect for someone who gets out once in a blue moon to chase a ball all over the course 
4 0 Good temporary clubs I was looking for an inexpensive set to have shipped to a relative s home out of my state where I visit occasionally Although I have not used them yet my relative says they seem like good clubs except that there was a defect with the bag where the clubs are separated Even so I was pleased with my purchase at a price of 100 00 including shipping I didn t find any other clubs even used ones that were priced that low Now I won t have to rent clubs for every round or haul my regular set through airport baggage terminals 
5 0 Great set of clubs at a great price The clubs are very good quality and are very forgiving on errant shots The shafts give you plenty of power My distance and accuracy both increased 
4 0 Good Value Clubs Hey I wasn t looking for anything special but I m tired of playing with seriously old clubs These aren t spectacular but I ve played with them a few rounds and they play fine I m sure if you re a low handicap you d find fault but for an average player they are fine and you can t beat the value I say get these and have some money left over for balls globes shoes greens fees and so forth 
4 0 A truly great surprise I have now had these clubs for 3 weeks They replaced an old set I had been using for 30 years What a joy to move into the modern age The set was good for 6 strokes on my first game The sweet spot is marvelous and the slice and hook ratio is way down The quality is much better than expected especially for the money For the occasional amateur player like myself they really fill the bill I would not hesitate to reccomend this set to others who would like to improve their game and only play occasionally 
2 0 Deceptive I just purchased this board on sale for 44 99 not at all worth the purchase board looks aged and faded would not recommend 
4 0 Hard to get to work The pointed screws that are meant to screw into the brackets to provide a ground are terrible They are too small what you need to do is go to the hardware store and pickup some longer pointed screws to provide the ground for the brackets then the lights will work just fine Other than problem with the wrong size screws the product was pretty easy to install and worth the whole 15 bucks I spent on it 
4 0 Requires retrofit but it works I was initially frustrated with this set but at 10 I wasn t really complaining once I got it to work The key to getting it to work is screwing the bracket into the frame so it makes solid contact through paint for a good ground I basically read the directions to get the general idea and then installed it myself based on what made sense I would buy it again but only for a cheaper bike not my good one 
5 0 Slip free and comfortable towel I used the towel last night in class and it worked great In the past I ve struggled with downward facing dog slipping on the mat and continually re adjusting myself a major distraction But with the towel on top of my regular mat I was solid and for the first time I was able to really focus on the stretch and my breathing I was tempted to buy a yoga blanket online but my trainer mentioned that some of the blankets are rough against the skin and you have to find one that suites you The Yogitoes towel is more like a towel material and is smooth against the skin making both seated and standing poses very comfortable The only downside so far is the total price compared to blankets it s not that bad a price but with shipping it becomes an expensive item That said I have no regrets 
5 0 yoga towel Can t say enough about this product Suffer from sweaty palms with my yoga and this has stopped the slipping Love it 
5 0 Great for Bikram hot yoga I love the yoga towel It is a bit slipery at first but once you sweat it gives good grip Much better than using a towel And it comes in so many color I wish I can get one of each but they are quite expensive I found some on www absoluteyogi com for a much better price so now I can get some more for myself and my friends as birthday gifts 
5 0 Easy to set up We first saw this tent on our vacation I watched a dad set it up in seconds It was a windy day and it didnt budge Mom baby were cozy inside I thought it would be great for our next vacation bc I will have a 3 year old and infant It is nice if you want to keep out of the sun changer diapers nurse your baby 
4 0 I m happy with my Hugger Mugger I purchased my Hugger Mugger yoga cushion about 3 months ago and have used it almost everyday since Since this is my first cushion I have nothing to compare it to but I have been happy with the overall durability My only complaint is that it is just a wee bit on the too firm side for me and occasionally causes some discomfort because it doesn t conform to my bottom quite as much as I would like But it does offer good support and hasn t broken down through use I do like the v shape a lot and I think it would a good purchase for the money Overall I m pleased 
5 0 Weight Flexibility This weight vest has about 35 weight pouches to allow lots of flexibility with how much weight you want to wear 
4 0 Solid Product Great Price While doing research online I was intrigued that a 40 lb weight vest was priced at approx 75 considering that the average retail price was closer to 200+ I was worried about some of the reviews posted but decided to give the product a shot Needless to say I have been pleasantly satisfied and would recommend this product The vest itself has a number of positives first the fact that the weight is conveniently compartmentalized into 35 or so small weight bags offers me a lot of flexibility in terms of weight adjustment and configuration I can put the weight high center it on my breastbone or place it low I found that placing it in different configurations actually changes my workout approach Second I like the fact that I can adjust the vest solidly around my abdominal line and not have to worry about the shoulder area which is permanently stiched Third I also like the fact that it has broad shoulder straps which has helped distribute the vest weight more comfortably Apparently this is a product differentiator with more expensive vests The stiching has been solid so far I was concerned because the vest is made of neoprene but no problems so far I feel it has only a few negatives the material of neoprene takes a little bit of time to get used to particularly its smell right out of the box I am still concerned about using neoprene b c of potential stich breaks my experience with wetsuits makes me leery of stiching in neoprene but fortunately there are no zipper area or cuff areas that may generate fraying The vest covers a lot of area and neoprene really makes you sweat when you work out Be very careful using this product in warm rooms or outside in the sun HYDRATE Finally since the vest covers most of my torso I get strange looks at the gym when I come inside wearing the vest Thankfully there is a logo on the front but in today s day and age the average fellow gym rat would probably do a double take to make sure I m not wearing some sort of bomb vest Perhaps if they would offer a different color such as grey or blue it would make the product more friendly in public Overall I thank GoFit for a solid product at a very reasonable price point I am a former military man who takes his workouts seriously and this item will definitely enhance any fitness regimen Thanks for reading 
5 0 Um it works Good service The product is slightly painful in the shoulders but other than that i love it 
5 0 Very Pleased This weight vest is exactly what I was looking for I have lost 125 and was not FEELING my workouts like I used to This weight vest was the answer It helps me to burn more calories and faster I wear it running walking and biking Please make sure that your legs can support it I have had 2 knee surgeries and at first they hurt but now they are much stronger Go slow and then add more exercise 
5 0 GREAT EXERCISE TOOL THIS VEST HAS BEEN GREAT WEIGHT IS EASY TO ADJUST VEST IS COMFORTABLE SO FAR WITH UP TO 28LBS IN IT ALLOWS ME TO WALK AT LUNCH AND BURN SIMILAR CALORIES TO TAKING A RUN 
5 0 Love it I wanted more of a workout while I walk my dogs so I wear the weight vest to add resistance I love it The little weights are easy to take out or add if you want to alter your weight It is comfortable too 
5 0 The Ferrari of Hand Grips If you are really serious about hand grips and you want something that is not your standard sport shop model this is where to go I got the Trainer and for someone like myself that has been using hand grips since childhood it was too easy Then I got 1 and that was tuff but I decided to get 2 and 3 as well I have just recently graduated from 1 and using 2 and maybe in a year or more I can go to 3 and get certified Let me tell you this if you can squeeze 2 at least once all the way you are good You can t really understand what I am trying to tell unless you get one So if you are person that has never used hand grips regularly if at all then go with the Trainer If you have been using hand grips for awhile and looking for something harder then get the 1 Remember to always squeeze hard P S I guarantee you will not be able to squeeze the 4 gripper 
5 0 Bag is perfect for my mat I agree with the reviewer who said the shipping was pricey 7 10 is a lot for shipping a light weight item in an unpadded envelope The price of the bag is steep too for a plain nylon bag with a handle and a drawstring HOWEVER this is the ONLY bag I ve found that fits my extra long Crescent Moon Pilates mat The usual yoga mat bags I ve looked at have all been too small even those described as large The mat cost over 70 so I consider a suitable bag to protect it is well worth the cost 
5 0 Sturdy and fun My daughter has been scooting away on this We had her use it inside the house during the winter on condition that once she starts using it outside it is not coming back inside It was put to some good use inside and it has moved out now My daughter has become a master of it The brake is very smooth The scooter as a whole is very sturdy Highly recommended 
5 0 Razor A2 Kick Scooter Arrived very quickly in perfect condition Couldn t ask for more 
5 0 She loves it All the kids in our neighborhood have these and love them This is really fun scooter Even mom wants a turn on it 
5 0 Best buy we made this past holiday season Our daughter loved this thing and it was unbelievably easy to put together out of the box I don t usually like to do this kind of stuff building toys because it often winds up being a huge headache It s often frustrating with hard to understand and or incomplete directions and of course you generally have the kid standing over you wondering why it s taking so long The thing went together in minutes and she was out on the sidewalk playing less than 15 minutes after she d opened it she wanted to get out of her PJs 
5 0 great price and great performance I am extremely happy with these bearings Smooth roll and not expensive Great choice for beginner intermediate roller derby Be sure to buy 2 sets for skates since only 8 come in one package 
5 0 Great Bearings for the Price These bearings are an awesome deal for the price If you mention BONES RED BEARINGS to the kids youth in the neighborhood they will immediately tell you all about the great performance durability reliability and quality to be expected when you own a set of Bones Just like with all bearings they will last longer and perform better if you clean them properly and regularly but I tend to believe BONES REDS will still outlast other bearing brands even if you don t service them as regularly as suggested THEY ARE JUST SIMPLY AWESOME 
5 0 Easily best value for the money I have these on my board now They re cheap and they roll silky smooth when you feel how your board rides with these you ll be amazed If you need some extra incentive the bearings have red sides that look cool and they come with a sticker 
5 0 best bearing i ever owned These bearings are so totally awsome The price is cheap too if your looking for high quality affordable bearings I took these bearings for a ride at the skatepark and could ride higher on ramps than ever before these bearings are great 
5 0 if you don t know you better ask somebody i don t know why other companies even bother making cheap abec 5 bearings everybody i know who can t afford swiss joints get these bearing to be a competitor of bones in the cheap abec 5 bearings market is like fanta trying to get in on sunkist s orange soda game it just aint gonna happen dude these things are so good and so cheap that I bought a bearings cleaner and cleaning solution got home looked a the receipt and realized that the money I spent on this cleaner and solution I could ve bought 2 new sets of bones reds get these 
5 0 Really awesome I just bought this stove tonight and absolutley love it It fits in the palm of your hand and lights in about 10 secs If you are looking for something light and small and don t want to carry around liquid fuel than this is the stove for you 
5 0 playing cards that make for a fun summer evening When I was 5 or 6 I liked to pretend I was an adult in a casino dealing cards I had a major obsession collecting playing cards I would ask my parents to buy me packs and packs of cards each set with a different design I d take the cards out of the box and place them all around my house All over the furniture the TV set EVERYWHERE Of course that eventually led to me wanting to learn how to play card games I learned many I grew up looking forward to summer evenings where I d play cards with my family outside and who can forget all the fun times we d have trying to keep the cards still so the wind wouldn t blow them away It was a fun way to spend time with the family You couldn t ASK for a better way to spend time with the family in fact One deck of cards can give you hours of fun because there s SO many games you can play I wouldn t pick up a deck of cards online because cards are cheap so if you order playing cards online you re just going to end up paying money for shipping and handling which will jack the price up a lot when really you can buy a deck somewhere close to your home for less than a dollar 
5 0 Great knife at a great price After sadly losing my favorite knife at the airport you know the drill I needed to replace it with one with the same features no corkscrew yes phillips head screwdriver I love it and I will definitely be more careful next time I fly 
5 0 Victorinox Has the Best Blades I own three Victorinox knives The blades on all of them are of the highest quality I also own a Wenger executive Swiss Army knife But if you are debating the difference between Wenger and this knife the Victorinox is noticably superior for quality and construction As the other reviewer has commented this does have the best mix of tools But unless you have a sheath on your belt it is unlikely you will be carrying this around with you It is just too bulky Highly useful as a knife to have in the kitchen drawer or glove box of your car The plastic handle material will wear and possibly crack over time but if you are not a tradesman it would take a long time for that to happen I will definitely purchase this knife for my nephew who is interested in camping and hiking A handy item to keep in the house so you don t have to drag out the toolbox every time something needs tightening or cutting This is one tool I think everybody should have in the house or car you will be suprized at how many times you will use it 
5 0 The best mix of tools This one has the perfect set of tools in my opinion The scissors most people will want The Victorinox saw is outstanding Be careful as it will make quick work of your fingers it is very sharp and cuts aggressively It is also good that the can opener and bottle opener are separate tools The Victorinox can opener works wonderfully but the combo tool which is a can and bottle opener rolled into one doesn t work well on cans Also the can opener has a handy little screwdriver tip which can be used as a Philips screwdriver sometimes The reamer is a lot more handy than you would think though not as a reamer I use it to change watch bandes as the sharp tip reaches in and releases the spring bars without too much fuss The most used tool for me though is the large screwdriver tip on the bottle opener The one disadvantage with this one is that it is starting to get a bit thick to carry in your pocket A belt sheath would be more appropriate if you can pull that off without feeling too geeky Personally I don t care hehehe 
4 0 Sponge bob skateboard This was a really cute item I purchased it for an 11 year old boy and he loved it Said it was his favorite present so far The price was 1 3 of retail It has been in the sand dunes wet pavement you name it and it is holding up well Great fun for someone who wants a beginner board 
5 0 swiss army golf tool I gave this item as a Christmas gift to my best friend fellow golfer I received one of these earlier and really like it The ultimate for your golf bag 
5 0 swiss army golf this was a great gift the person i gave it to was so happy especially loved the swiss army insignia on the golf balls grea 
5 0 Great deal great product Got this for my husband and he loves the swiss army tool It went straight into the golf bag of course the golf balls were a great bonus 
5 0 Good Bag just one thing though I agree with others that say this bag will slide across your floor especially if its wood However A very inexpensive solution I found is to use grip liner typically for lining kitchen shelves underneath the base It wont slide around or even tip over I filled mine with water and have had no problems since lining the base 
5 0 great work out and outside I am very happy with my Everlast Freestanding Bag I keep the stand out in the yard and just remove the bag after using to store inside out of the elements I have no issue with the weight it holds up to even kick boxing without tipping even in the slightest Its obviously well engineered If you are thinking of buying this product you won t be disappointed with your purchase 
4 0 Great workout great value The Everlast Freestanding Heavy Bag is a great way to keep in shape while taking out your frustrations It s a good alternative to traditional heavy bags which tend to be expensive and require hardware for hanging While it s a fun workout it s definitely not for kids or those with any type of hand arm injury or arthritis Use of traditional heavy bag gloves is a must and hand wraps are suggested Even with gloves and wraps my hands were pretty sore after my first few workouts Overall this is a great piece of gym equipment for those with limited space and resources but still want to get a good workout 
4 0 great camera case for Fujifilm A330 and A340 I bought one of these to serve as a travel case for my Fujifilm A340 digital camera It s a perfect fit It will also fit the A330 camera There s just enough room for it to shift slightly but the soft elastomer lining will absorb all but the most violent of shocks If you lay the A340 s webbing hand strap across the top of the camera it takes up all of the slack and there is no shifting at all I didn t give it 5 stars only because I have yet to give it a submersion test I have submerged my other older Pelican cases with positive results so I have no reason to believe this case will have a problem Don Childrey author of STAR TRAILS Navajo and Uwharrie Lakes Region Trail Guide 
4 0 Great backpack but zipper gets caught Love this backpack it s been with me to numerous cities and countries and survives the trips very well while protecting the contents well laptop included The outside large pocket is larger than you think when you realize just how much stuff you can fit in there and still fit under an airplane seat Love the two water holders on the outside Love the zippers are a loop so you can attach a carabiner compass or whatever The support is great you ll barely feel its there and if you do just use both straps and then strap the front for great support The pen storage area could be larger to accommodate larger pens but thats quite minor My only con is that the outside two pockets have gotten stuck twice already I am now on my third backpack gotta LOVE REI s return policy Hopefully this one will last as I have yet to find a better more complete backpack Update 1 30 2007 Third backpack third zipper to get caught time to return again I wish I could change the scale down to 2 stars 
5 0 Great Laptop Case I purchased this to help lower my back pain from lugging a laptop in a normal brief type case It has far exceeded my expectations I do wish that there was something just a bit bigger This bag is 3500 cubic inches and really if you have tools gear books and a laptop to carry around this bag just barely cuts the mustard but it is the largest laptop protected case that I have found The specialized pockets are great even if you are unable to utilize them by designation I found there not to be enough pen pockets but I stored them other places as well The book file area could be larger and when fully stuffed with support equipment for the laptop this space is full I had hopped that I could find a case with support much like a overnight backpack but this was as close as I could find I have had this almost a year at this point most cases only survive for about 4 months for me and it is still holding strong Strong enough that 2 other guys I work with have purchased the same model 
5 0 The Ultimate Geek Backpack This is the ultimate geek backpack It was designed by a geek for a geek If you re a student and constantly carry around 10lbs of keys and gadgets in your pockets this is the backpack for you The laptop pouch is also sufficiently padded I happily carry my Thinkpad and a number of books and a binder and don t feel like I have to nurse the bag at all It feels very sturdy The construction is good The zippers work well The inside is deceptively spacious For those of you not sold by the millions of comparments for all the geek toys or with any other gadget that this backpack might have let me leave you with a final criteria I used when selecting this backpack it looks good I can walk around with this and no one would know that it s a laptop backpack it s not square it doesn t have 15 million straps it doesn t ahve 40 pockets on the outside In summary it doesn t look like Terminator backpacks that I see people wearing And frankly for the price you can t beat it 
5 0 Best backpack available I bought this backpack from Amazon last week and I can say it is the best one available even much better than most of other top brands like targus Samsonite or Kensington Earlier I wasn t sure about the reviews about this product I saw on Amazon but still ordered it after reading and looking at its pics I am 100 satisfied with the product and whatever they say in the product description its all true Its strong with many different compartments suitable for your school or business I have HPDV4000 with 15 4 inch screen and it fits well The mesh on sides can hold even big bottles nice feature I have bought it for school but it has enough room to accomodate ur shoes and some clothes also along with books I enjoy using this wonderful backpack I would highly recommend it So go ahead friends 
5 0 Capacious well made organized and discreet I ve bought three of these laptop backpacks and this is the best Well made well organized and lots of space Seems durable but haven t used it enough to vouch for it Will protect my laptop physically with its padded pouch but also from theft How The backpack doesn t yell out I contain an expensive laptop it looks like a cheapo student bookbag And you can t beat the price Highly recommended 
5 0 Excellent Laptop Backpack This is an excellent laptop backpack It has plenty of pockets for all your electronic gear and cords There is also an abundance of room for files and other business items The section for your laptop is padded and convenient for easy access 
5 0 Backpack This is a great bag Very comfortable even with all the stuff I end up carrying around There is a pocket for just about anything you can thing of so it is easy to stay organized I love that it doesn t look like an expensive laptop bag which i suppose makes theft a little less likely 
5 0 Very Impresive This chain lock is just amazing I was very impressed with how massive this thing is Nothing I mean NOTHING is cutting this thing off You can read the details of the contruction on their web site The key lock is easy to operate it does seem to get stuck a bit but the intructions say to wiggle or jiggle the key in place So far I have not have any problems Just be careful though because even though it comes with a protective covering it may still scratch your bike Not that it will you just have to be careful with it because of its size and weight So far I m very happy with it and I got it for less than at local stores I m also very happy I got the longer length 64 The 44 one would have been too short 
5 0 Works great I use this in college pool for lap times and total time for swimming three quarters of a mile i e 1500 yards in oplymic style swimming Dropped in water twice Still works great Easy to use easy to read to pool light conditions 
4 0 Good product a little expensive I was very excited when I found this product because I had not seen one before However I found the same product at Academy for 15 00 cheaper 2 days after I received the item 
4 0 Not great but it does the job A sleep pad is essential gear for backpacking especially when backpacking in cold weather When you sleep in a sleeping bag your body weight compresses the insulation on the bottom side of your bag which can lead to the hiker losing warmth to the ground below A sleep pad provides insulation from the cold ground as well as additional comfort on hard surfaces The Thermarest Ridge Rest Sleeping Pad does both of those jobs adequately but not exceptionally The insulation does an adequate job of keeping one warm but the pad is too thin to provide much extra comfort Perhaps a bit of a weakness in terms of comfort this attributes makes the pad extremely light which is great when you have to carry it with you If your primary concern is comfort go with an inflatable pad If you re more concerned with weight go with this pad 
5 0 Doglovers with tennis ball loving dogs this one s for you This product unlike many made for dogs tennis balls is actually a top notch high quality product standing up to many hours of play or chewing My blue heeler dogamine is an aggressive chewer every other such product was soon chewed to the point of breaking the rubber core Not so with these tennis balls Twelve balls last him about 18 months but they take a real beating before succumbing to jaws Highly recommended even though I neither play tennis nor know anything about it 
5 0 Great buy for beginner Just started golfing and did not want to lay out too much cash on a set I first looked into buying a used set but was scared off with some of the things I read to beware of with pre owned clubs I only used them once but man what a huge difference in performance compared to the club I rented from the driving range Its early but I am definitely satisfied with my purchase 
4 0 Excellent For First Timers Soon outplay them I bought these clubs because I didn t know if I would like the game or be any good at it These are great clubs for first time players The softer flex of the clubs is good for beginners who swing at slower speeds The irons and hybrid are easy to swing and get the ball up in the air Distances will not be as long as if you buy a better set for all the clubs You will also not be able to shape shots but they will go straight The lack of a Sand wedge is problematic After playing for a year or more you are likely to start outplaying these clubs They have not broken or been damaged for me during the time but my skill has gotten too good for them With a higher swing speed and more control over my shots it is time to buy some better clubs 
4 0 no comment I got the product in timely manner only to see it drop 30 in the next 3months Overall looks to a good starter set 
5 0 Which is the weight of the product Which is the weight of the product Or which is the diameter of the box 
5 0 golf set this is the best starting set i have seen and it has all the elements that prove it to be a great set to use regardless of skill level The set arrived in great condition and in a timely manner 
4 0 25 strokes off my 18 hole round bye bye Pings Wow I am now shootin mid 80 s with these babies Maybe it was change of balls though 
5 0 To guy below WTH Do you even know anything about high quality AEGs And no your 30 AUG is not high quality nor is it an AEG its an LPEG This gun costs so much because it is made of almost 90 metal Plus 350 FPS is nothing Go to real battles where snipers reach 500 fps and the average AEG shoots 400 fps 
4 0 lovely thing I do love this little metal bottle It is light weight nasty chemical flavor free and lovely It is quite small what you d expect for 20 oz so I d probably get a larger size next time Also keep in mind that steel is an excellent heat conductor if you put in hot things the bottle gets just as hot to the touch and everything in it soon cools Likewise the thing is chilly on the hands if filled with icy water 
4 0 Trike is great pity about the screws We bought this as a Christmas gift for our 2 5yo daughter who had told Santa he HAD to get her a pink trike She loved it and the pink was deemed to be the right one which was good We loved the fact that the adjustable frame means it should last our very tall girl for ages she s only on the second setting despite being as tall as the average 4yo Fortunately we decided to assemble the trike well in advance of Christmas as the screws that hold the seat in place were so badly burred that they couldn t be used Two thumbs up to the Kettler spare parts division who sent an emergency express package with replacements so that Santa could come through on the day Apart from that issue the assembly was ok but not great and the instructions could have been clearer and we re both engineers so we re quite familiar with tools and building things 
5 0 we love this tricycle I bought this for my 3 year old daughter 3 months ago and we love it I like the sensible safety features and sturdy workmanship She likes the bucket in back lively colors and comfortable seat It is missing some features the other Kettler trikes have but this one is available for half the cost of the more expensive Kettlers It has the 45 degree turn restriction which helps prevent tipping over As with any trike some spills can happen over months years of active use please use helmets It is adjustable for rider size and is fairly easy to assemble despite slightly sloppy assembly instructions It doesn t have a bell but my daughter enjoyed customizing her bike with a bell of her own choice an extra 6 at a local bike shop The trike is sturdy but not too heavy like many trikes can be It goes off road on bare earth under the spruce trees in our yard but we got it mostly for sidewalk use where it does well My only other minor quibble is that the plastic tires skid on some dry smooth surfaces I think any child would be delighted with this tricycle 
5 0 Speedo Silicone swim cap Excellent quality much easier to put on than the cap I used before 
5 0 COMFORTABLE AND DURABLE I have used this cap almost daily for over a year It still fits snugly and is very comfortable Writing this review has made me think to order another one now for the inevitable day my old one wears out I have a rather large head and found many caps didn t fit comfortably This one is very elastic and is great 
5 0 works for me This swim cap is easy to use and thick enough that I can t imagine it ever ripping or tearing 
5 0 Speedo Silicone Swim Cap I bought this swim cap for my wife for Christmas and she loves it 
5 0 Great Swim Cap I had trouble getting water in my ears before wearing this cap Now no problem It keeps my hair fairly dry or at least drier than with other caps I ve tried It s easy to put on and take off no hair pulling It s lasted well so far Much better than wearing a cap with a chin strap 
5 0 Tiger Tail is very effective I wasn t expecting much when I first ordered the Tiger Tail but at such a low price it was worth a shot to relieve my aching muscles As an endurance athlete I get my fair share of aches and pains There is nothing like an hour with a massage therapist to relieve the aches but who can afford that everyday With the Tiger Tail you get deep tissue relief anytime you need it It helps with the pain but it also helps your muscles recover much quicker than I had hoped It s a great product and worth twice the price 
5 0 Tiger Tail is the best I recommend using this very effective yet very simple tool It helps work out trigger points little muscle knots and helps my recovery after a work out The Tiger Tail will save you lots of money compared to other products or services on the market You will not be disappointed 
5 0 bowflex This is a nice way to workout The software program accompanying is like having a personal trainer 
4 0 The Big Guy pulled a double play So my wife had our second child she got thin again I did not Christmas came and went and like all the lemmings in the united states I vowed a new health routine for the new year I am spending twice as much on groceries that contain half as much I am riding the Ironman elliptical machine and this machine 3 4 times a week each I am starting to feel good This machine will give you a pretty precise workout The price is right it gives you a program and it works My wife and I assembled it in 1 1 2 hours Over 60 real exersizes I would only discourage first timers because this machine does involve changing the set up frequently All the parts were in the box The CD Rom shows you everything you could possibly want to know and designs a workout for specifically you I spent 1400 on two machines after delivery We cancelled our Gold s membership and saved 700 a year If I lose the weight and sell this stuff for half of what it costs it s a wash I m happy 
4 0 Very good mat How much can one person say about an excercise mat Works very well doesn t slip around very good cushioning 
5 0 Very fun and unique The box came in very good condition and the blade came with no damage and packaged very well The blade is very nice to look at with the Griever insignia on the sides of the blade and it s unique shape However I must agree about the gun part of the gunblade It does look a bit grimy compared to the actual blade work However the whole weapon itself completely overlooks that little flaw With the Griever chain it will be a little hard to wield and swing since the chain will get some good momentum and hit your hand a lot Overall this was a good buy for me I am definitely a fan of weapons from the Final Fantasy series and this was one of the must haves of the series I will definitely enjoy practicing with this blade 
5 0 Wow Excellent delivery time and box arrived in excellent condition Product was just like expected I was very satisfied with this vendor 
5 0 Gun Blade Got to love it I didn t buy this blade from Amazon but I bought the exact same one from an Anime Convention for 30 dollars more So this is a good price for it The blade lives up to the gun blade reputation Yeah some of it is a little screwed up from the exact replica but it comes damn near close The blade is beautiful and it is easy to weild Only sword you d have trouble weilding out of the FF Weaponry would be the ACUTAL replica of the Buster Sword I have that on order should be fun I highly recommand this blade even if you don t like final fantasy 
4 0 An excellent replica and great prop for photo shoots We received this in the mail and it is much heavier than expected The blade is stamped with Made in Pakistan and really looks excellent The handle of the gun part of it is fairly shoddy but it is only 39 99 so it s actually worth the price even with the shipping costs If you re a Final Fantasy fan and also into collecting objects for photography or even things you might just end up hanging on the wall this is the perfect gift for yourself Or for the person in your life who is as much of a geek as me and my husband And while we re not ber geeky we re up there on the Final Fantasy geek ladder 
4 0 Good for the price Considering it s less than 40 it s a good buy The blade and the handle are pretty good quality though the dimensions of the blade are slightly smaller than in the game The revolver design is nothing like the game but all in all its a good buy The stand is nice but you might have to cut the sheath to get the blade to sit properly It has the word pakistan in very small letters on the right side of the blade but you could probably use a stone and grease to make it look like battle damage If you perfer one with the Greiver on the blade then buy that one but if you dont mind a clean blade this ones a good choice 
5 0 Shweet yo dudes this has to be the 2nd best blade on the site the best it the buster sword It looks exactly like the gunblade and the sheath looks soo sweet Peace 
4 0 Easy to assemble and sturdy We originally bought the one from costco com which was fancy and costed 250 But when we got the package and when my husband read the manual we returned that one right away coz just the installation part needed 10 tools not included and there are 50 steps to install Ok let s talk about this one Very easy to install It only took my husband maybe a whole afternoon Remember my husband is not very handy at all The only problem was it missed a piece So we called the support which is very efficent The support person just asked one quesiton what was the model number then she sent the missing piece right away We got the missing piece in a week and filled sands into the base which cost around 20 3 a bag of sand from HomeDepot The most painful part is filling the sand Other than that the basketball system looks good 4 starts because it missed a piece which I suspect it falls out of the box when it was shipped to my home The box was totally racked when it reached my home 
4 0 Nice It s not as adjustable as I d like but it is durable The kids and wife love it No slamming cause there s no spring loading of the rim and the adjustments are in increments that don t make sense Good product for the price 
4 0 Good for its purpose For the price this unit works fine for what it is for I would not give this particular unit to anyone in their teens or older who was serious about the game But this purchase was made to introduce my 7 year old daughter to the game and for that purpose it does just fine The over all contruction of the unit when assembled seems a bit flimsy and would certainly not handle a slam and Hang that is so popular with todays youthful players I m 47 and never could quite throw it down on a regulation rim even in my youth but I still play and like having a rim to practice the shot when I get a chance For that this system will do fine and I hope to be able to keep going long enough to teach my daughter a few things so that she can decide for herself if she wants to get serious about the game If she does I will purchase a new goal system for her when she gets older and most likely build a real court in the backyard to put in on permenantly The portable goals in general all have some of the same drawbacks and when these are dealt with adequately the goal itself looses its portability 
5 0 Very Sturdy Camping Chair This camping chair is just slightly heavier 10 5 lbs that other models due to the stainless steel legs However it is very sturdy It s expensive for a camping chair but you re paying for the quality Also the chair is compact fits in 6x6x36 carry case the fabric will not puddle water the stainless steel legs are rust proof and the 400lb capacity is much higher than that of other chairs which range from 200 250 lb capacity Overall I recommend the chair highly 
4 0 Final Fantasy Kadaj Sword Advent Children Double Bladed Katana The sword was great exactly what I was looking for The only gripes were the strange gunk on the blade mentioned in other reviews so I knew to expect it and the fact that the blades weren t the same length Still for what I was looking for it was perfect 
4 0 You already know what I did when I got this sword Ok Let me just off by informing you that this sword is for display and display only Usually there is always that one dumb person that reads all of the other reviews that say dont mess with it because its not ful tang it will brake in a fight its strickly for display only but they test it out anyway and brake it I noticed that Im the only one saying that for this one The shipping was fast It was wrapped nicely I had to clean the blades a little and straighen them out some Normally I dont buy Stainless steel swords but come on look at the sword I did sharpen them also I knew I was gonna buy another one thats why I did it in the first place It cut through some tree branches pretty nicely However another sword yeah right It broke right around the middle of the handle It didnt take no time at all to brake Waaay tooo top heavy From the top of the blade to past the gaurd to the bottom of you first hand is wear the blades end The rest is wood So if you are looking for a very unique sword one that is different from all other swords a sword to show off and get attention and you are a FF fan get this sword Overall this sword i say is worth buying Again for all of those including me that broke their s first one off of curiousity But please listen closely when I say DISPLAY ONLY DISPLAY ONLY DISPLAY ONLY Oh and DISPLAY ONLY I hope this helps all of you curious people out Curiousity killed the cat and in this case my sword 
5 0 Got exactly what i paid for I picked this up for my buddy whose a ff 7 nut I new this sword is decorative and he did to It was well put together well packaged One minor complaint is that i had to clean the blades when they arrived They had this goop on there But it wiped right off added some oil it was shining My buddy loved it Couldn t have liked it more 
5 0 YHea I got this sword And um lets see how can i put this oh yes IT KICKS ASS Kadij himself was cool but this sword is awsome 
5 0 wow i m suprised amazon sold swords I haven t been amazon very long but i had no clue that they had swords from ff7 available I haven t ordered one yet but i plan on buying at least two I found kadaj s sword cheaper at another site but i m loyal to amazon so i ll prolly purchase it here along with Sephiroth s masamune too Can t wait to get em 
5 0 Easy to set up and fun to use I recently assembled this Gamenamics 8ft air hockey When I opened the box I found the item to be packed well The table had a plastic film to protect the panels and the rails The item was easy to unpack for assembly I found the directions clear and easy to follow I was impressed with the fact that I was able to complete assembly in under a hour Once up and running I was impressed with how quiet the two fans were I found the puck action to be fast I thought this unit was as fun to play as some tables ive seen in the arcades 
5 0 Swiss Army Golf Tool Not only is this a great item but the price I got on Amazon was unreal Highly recommend 
5 0 Disney Princess Slumber Sack I was very pleased with the quality of this product It was perfect for my 6 year old granddaughter I recommend this product very highly 
4 0 Good sleeping bad good item wasn t as padded as i thought it would be but my niece still loved i 
5 0 good price never leak I bought a corrective goggle locally for 50 Surprised for find it on Amazon for only 15 and the quality is better than my locally bought one It fits well and never leaks It is very durable I have used it for 3 months and it is still like new I guess I will somehow lose it before it is worn out 
4 0 great product for the price The product performs well I can see in the water has a comfortable fit around my head and doesnt come loose to let water in As my nose is slim around the bridge these goggles perform well with little glare or fogging noted 
4 0 These goggles are a good deal but They are a bit tight I m a competitive swimmer who originally depended on prescription goggles purchased in Taiwan but when they broke I went online to find other options I found these goggles and remembering the generally high quality goggles Speedo has before my prescription goggles I only wore Speedo s Women s Vanquisher goggles I bought these They fit rather well and I guess the only qualm I have is how the goggles feel like they re sucking my eyeballs out That s what I mean by tight the straps are fine I haven t yet tried these on in a pool but from what I can tell now they aren t going to be the most confortable goggles ever If you ve tried Speedo s Vanquisher goggles you should know that the rubber lining forms a little air pocket for extra cushioning These goggles however don t offer that They just have one layer of rubber which in my opinion only helps to fend off the mold that grew in my Vanquishers Bravo If you swim a lot and think you can get use to slightly uncomfortable goggles go for this pair 
5 0 Very nicely built goggles I bought these goggles a month ago I was wearing normal goggles to swim every day before After first try on these goggles I really liked them and have not used my old goggles since My old goggles will get foggy after 15 min swim These new goggles did not get foggy after swimming for one hour They are very comfortable too The best thing is that I can see clearly while swimming because of the corrective lenses 
4 0 Mother of swimmer My son is a competitive swimmer He likes the goggle very much It s comfy and no leaking plus Amazon s good price I d recommended to several friends and them all like it 
5 0 These are great I ve been using these for a couple of months now They are not an exact match to my prescription but they are excellent for swimming I spoke to my eye care professional about them and he said they were a great deal If you aren t sure what strength you need if you have astigmatism etc your eye doc should be able to give you a recommendataion that doesn t always match your prescription s but will work for you Also these DON t leak 
4 0 great value These goggles are just what they state RACER goggles Do not expect a comfortable goggle for just lounging in the pool I have an average head and after loosening the strap a little bit they do fit albeit quite tight I can see why some people with larger heads would have problems the strap doesn t give much and is not very big They achieve a great seal that is watertight 
5 0 Golf Ball Display Case Product is excellent Very easy to hang and each individual golf ball cell has an individual seat to prevent ball movement within the case Great product 
4 0 Well worth the money While not made of the nicest materials I hate particle board for the price this product is amazing It s electronics are simple to assemble and work well All the pieces are durable and if properly mantained will last years I was lucky enough to find one for sale not through Amazon so I saved on shipping 
5 0 Solid Training Aid I purchased this after seeing the ad on the Golf Channel in part because I like Nick Price and his endorsement was meaningful to me The weakest part of my game has always been driving I m a solid iron player But not driving the ball well really hurts your score After a little practice with the Swing Setter I really felt like I was getting the club back in a better position with good wrist cock I am reasonably strong and can easily make the magnets click with both settings on 5 When striking an actual ball my driving improved dramatically from the point to where I used to use a driving iron to today where I use a driver The difference is hitting the ball 230 with a driving iron to hitting it 280 with a driver In my last four rounds since using the Swing Setter over 25 of my drives have been over 300 yards This makes the game substantially eaier for me since I now can hit driver 8 iron instead of driving iron 5 iron to a par 4 As a result I am in the high 70 s to low 80 s a drop off of about 8 10 strokes The difference to going lower is mostly short game as some poor putting rounds kept me out of the 70 s But shooting in the 70 s makes golf fun There is no doubt that the Swing Setter helped my game quite a bit I do not use the short routine they provide but rather just swing it to get a feel for where my wrist cock should be With both settings on 5 my tempo is quick much like Nick Price s But swinging fast but smooth is a key to hitting the ball squarely and far Overall I am very impressed because I had not been particularly impressed with Leadbetter in the past because he seemed so technical I just get up and hit the ball and this aid helps in just swinging the club properly If you do that the ball flies pretty well Five stars John Del Vecchio Dallas TX 
4 0 Overall Helpful This trainer helped me a lot to get my club speed up as well as learn to uncock my wrists more near impact than throughout the entire swing It also helped my beginner son to better understand the crucial role of the wrist in getting a fast club speed However one has to be cautious using this as it can potentially promote some bad habits including overswinging All in all was a helpful tool The included video was also a good golf lesson 
4 0 My coach loves it I ve been taking lessons now for about 4 years I had never played golf before and my handicap is now a 12 My best round is 76 very recently Still I ve been struggling with a late setting of the club that my coach has been frustrated trying to figure a way to get me to set the club earlier It leads to my lifting at the top of my backswing A student bought him one of these devices After only 2 lessons with this my sets are near perfect At first I was a bit skeptical as it really felt like I was being way to wristy to make the thing clap at the top But now it feels very natural and I don t feel like I have to rush the backswing to make it clap I have come a long way in a short time and this device has helped put another piece of my swing together It also helps with tempo and releasing of the club I am buying one so I can practice at home too I recommend this for golfers of any level But I think it is better for the beginner to get some instruction with it as well 400 in lessons is worth 1000 worth of training aids 
5 0 Worth it s weight in gold This thing is worth twice what you will pay for it Like other reviewer s I have purchased a ton of books video s and gizmos with little improvement to my game I did purchase the Refiner Swing Trainer and it did help me to some degree but did not cure my problems I was very flustrated and about to give up on golf when I bought the Swing Setter Now I am getting a lot more distance with almost no effort and great consistancy I sometimes pull a shot now but when I do I know why If you are a high handicapper you will see a huge improvement after the first training session if you use the drills that are provided with the Swing Setter Bottom Line Buy the Swing Setter before you waste a lot of money on other training aids 
5 0 Great entertainment When I purchased the Sing with me Magic Cube for my granddaughter I wondered if she would like it No worries she loves it it is great entertainment for us all She likes to dance to the music Since it doesn t sound tinny or too loud it is not annoying to hear it over over again it continues to be a joy to see how happy it makes her 
4 0 Very cool Musical Toy My daughter got both the Mozart Magic Cube and the Sing With Me Cube for Christmas this year and we love them both I am a music teacher and I think these are just really cool musical toys for young children The sound is much better than I expected and my daughter loves them both I give this one 4 stars instead of 5 only because the songs can be kind of hard to sing with because the music is a little elaborate It s easier for kids to sing along with simple arrangements and the cube s songs have lots of notes which make them great to listen to but maybe a little tough for a child to sing along with NOT a reason not to buy though Lots of fun and potential to be an interesting toy for a few years 
5 0 The BIG hit My daughter has had this toy and the Mozart Cube since she was 6 months old and at 4 1 2 both are still her favorites She now sings Mozart Sometimes she sings only the guitar part next time it s the french horn s part Woah It is so wonderful how you can pick and choose which instrument or combo to listen to and see how each sounds differently and together Awesome smart toy 
5 0 Wonderful toy My son now 20 months old has loved his cube since the age of 6 months He has a very short attention span but he can easily play with his cube 20 minutes at a time It has been dropped and he has thrown it too many times to count Today the battery cover popped off and broke I am hoping I can glue it together and make it work again If not I will be happily shelling out 29 99 to replace his cube It is well worth the money 
5 0 Fantastic Toy I ve had this toy for years and it still works great It has been dropped too Great way to introduce your little one to nursery songs And the little one can add instruments take away instruments which makes it more fun Great for motor skills for the younger ones because they have to press each side of the square etc Great invention 
4 0 Stylish Fun We purchased this lunch bag for our 13 year old daughter She LOVES it It is well made stylish and fun to use Price is a little high for a school lunch bag the only reason I didn t give it 5 stars but worth it when your teen likes it 
5 0 Great and Stylish Lunch Bag Great lunch bag and I love the style too Not only have I gotten many compliments on this bag but it really does keep your food nice and cold It is a good size for a bottle of water sandwich apple and snack I can even fit my frozen meals inside with a snack or too 
2 0 Great idea needs better construction My kids and I loved loved loved this product for two days It was fairly safe though did tip over if they were both on one side together they were well under the weight limit However the product came apart along a seam and the air came out after using it only under the manufacturers guidelines 
5 0 product fully satisfied my needs and beyond I needed a carrier to ride my baby on bumpy roads in the caribbean I am from Canada but lived in the caribbean on a small island I needed a carrier because of the fresh air I wanted my child to receive while I cycled and the ability to look around I absolutely love this carrier for many reasons I wanted a carrier that was only in front of me in the event a car would hit or fall for any reason With my child being in front of me and my body around to protect I can see what is happening at all times to my child I began to use this when my baby was 14 months old in Canada as a trial run People were amazed at how small she was confident and a helmet on loving to look all around as I cycled Satisfied with the trial for 2 weeks in Canada along the trails sidewalks and residential streets I then loaded it on the airplane for no charge since it s for the child I bought the helmet as an extra acces but threw it into the box and taped it up to the caribbean and had it put on the bicycle It loads easily on off with a strong bolt I loved it so much that I sold it to a professor on the island for his child and then bought another one to bring down again I highly recommend this product I wish I felt the same way about all the products I bought We have now moved off the island to the US and Canada as of a Christmas 2006 and I will still use it this summer at summer She will be 3 1 2 by that time My daughter loves it as much as I do 
4 0 Final Fantasy Buster Sword Sturdy Huge Friends Love It great for any Final Fantasy 7 Fa 
5 0 a masterfull sword I was probably the only adult to ever order one of these items for their 14 year old son It is a hunk of beautiful edged professionally designed steel A sword only a Fantasy Buster would enjoy It now hangs on the wall as a true reminder of hohoho merry christma 
5 0 Awesome The buster sword is an amazing item to own If you are a FFVII fan then this is definitely a must own item I suggest it for anyone who loves the Final Fantasy series or loves to collect swords 
4 0 Buster Sword full tang review The sword was delivered in a timely manner It is quite beautiful However the blade was not set straight in relation to the hilt and it has a couple parts of the blade that are slightly off color probably due to an uneven application of the metal polish they used 
5 0 Awesome Sword Overall the sword is awesome but it was very poorly packaged There was very little protection for it so it fell straight through the cardboard boxes during shipment and now the tip is bent But I would order another one in a heartbeat if only they beefed up the package protection 
5 0 Best reproduction out there It s a great match on scale and design It s quite heavy so the average sword stand won t work 
5 0 Samurai in Training Even though the hand guard doesn t fit it s an excellent training sword I accidentally smashed my friend s training sword in half with this one ^__^ It can take lots of abuse but it starts to look sort of rough when the paint begins coming off with use and time It s a great practice sword it s heavy about 5 7 pounds so it s also good to learn to control a sword so you don t stab yourself mid swing 
4 0 Great Workout I like this workout I have a lot of firm dvds and I like that you can squeeze resistance training in a short amount of time I pair this workout with a cardio one or do it alone on a lazy day This workout is not formatted like the traditional firm dvds the only person who will look familier is Ali The only thing you will need are the cords that come with the dvd 
5 0 Excellent Quick Workout The Firm has produced quality videos and dvds for many years and this workout is no exception There s more toning than cardio but it s still a good workout 
4 0 Good portable workout I do enjoy this workout It is quick efficient and different from previous Firm DVDs most of which I have I consider myself an advanced exerciser however and must tell you that the heavy cords definitely take strength to work I was having a hard time with the biceps move and definitely the forward shoulder motions You can really hurt yourself if you re not careful so it may be a good idea to do the workout as suggested without the cord learn the moves and then use the cord the second time around I have adjusted and modified my workout so that I use the heavy cord on moves I know I can achieve and can push myself towards and then I use a looser cord to do those forward shoulder motions until I am ready to take on the heavy cords again for that move Also they do move pretty quickly in this DVD as if everyone knows how to loop the cord through quickly I had to rewind a couple of times to see what she was doing Overall as I said it is a solid effective workout and definitely a nice break from the heavy weights and leg presses that I do every other day So if you re looking for something different but still under the Firm this is a good one I also recommend the toning ball DVD and the aerobic one with Allison in the lead Those are great too Like I said I have them all and I love the results they give 
5 0 Great workout I love this program for traveling It s easy to carry and I can do it in a hotel room I bought the heavy cord but also use the medium cord that I already owned for some of the excercises 
4 0 Worthy of Rotation These cords are a quick simple and eay way to squeeze fitness into your daily routine The workout is 30 mins with simple cardio strength training and cool down Be forewarned that the cords are at first awkward to use especially with the leg exercises They may seem short or not as pliable but that changes the more you use them They also work best with running shoes because there s an arch that keeps it from sliding I tried the routine in some flat pumas and practically smacked myself in the face because the cords couldn t find a grip Tina s coaching is clear and easy and the entire routine is done to the mirror image so you just go wherever she does this DVD would def work well while traveling this routine wont get you profusely sweating but is still a great buy nonetheless 
4 0 great compact sleeping mat I got this sleeping mat for about 1 2 year now this thing is very comfortable this mat include a self inflatable mat a foam pad and a soft zipper cover I have a Honda Element and I put this mat in the car with back seat fliped up I can have a great hours of sleep with this This is not really wide so don t expect you can roll yourself around Besides use this in a car I also take this with me to camping and stay over night at my friends place I even prefer this thing than a sofa The reason I gave it 4 stars mainly because the price is sitll a bit too high in my opinion but I think this is the best self inflation sleeping mat that s out there If you use this type of stuff alot is well worth ur invesmen This mat infate fairly fast I never encounter any problem with it yet 
5 0 let there be light This light takes all the guess work out of riding in the dark I previously relied on a cateye opticube LED 45 which places a round spotlight of light ahead of you somewhere This is fine if the streets have lights but is not enough when it s completely dark With the LED you have to remember what you see ahead of you With the LED you have to maneuver the light spot around to where you need it on track corners With the LED I found myself always concentrating to interpet what lay ahead The HID solves these issues by bathing the entire area in light It s lightweight good because i have to lift my bike up stairs The little dangly red yellow thing is the switch and display It has small red yellow green lights inside it to indicate battery status and you can mount this on the handlebars The HID light can be detached from the mount which is good when i flip the bike over for maintenance I get about 1 5 hours at full strengh and then it switches to the lower setting for another 30 minutes I can t really tell the difference between the high low settings anyway Charge time is 2 5 hours It first discharges the battery to keep it happy The manual says you get 300 500 cycles charges per battery before it s down to 80 and the light lasts 1000 hours It s a great light that allows me to ride faster safer and daydream about being the green lantern without crashing 
5 0 Inversion Table with Extra Features Relieve your low back pain with this unique inversion table Its features include memory foam and lumbar support Assembly is a snap 
5 0 BEST OF THE BEST THE UNIQUE FEATURES MEMORY FOAM TABLE LUMBAR SUPPORT OF THIS INVERSION TABLE MADE IT MY 1 CHOICE AFTER SEEING THE QUALITY OF THE MATERIALS WORKMANSHIP THE EASE OF ASSEMBLY THE EASE OF AJUSTMENTS AND EASE COMFORT USE I NOW MAKE THIS MY 1 RECOMMENDATION ONE FEATURE I CONSIDER POSITIVE WHICH SOME MAY CONSIDER NEGATIVE IS IT S INABILITY TO FOLD AND STORE EASILY IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY SOMETHING TO USE ON A DAILY BASIS WHY FOLD IT UP FOR MY PURCHASE I CHOSE FREE SHIPPING IT ARRIVED THE NEXT DAY EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE FROM AMAZON 
5 0 GREAT UNIT HEAVY DUTY EASY SET UP VARY HEAVY DUTY LEG HOLDERS COULD BE BIGGER AND SOFTER TOTALLY HAPPY WITH THIS UNIT IT S WORTH BUYING THIS ONE FOR THE EXTRA MONEY I SAW THE 199 ONE AT ANOTHER STORE AND IT DOSN T EVEN COMPARE 
5 0 Amazing how a little stretching can make your back feel My day to day job has me sitting in a chair long periods at a time every day I didn t realize how much it has affected my lower back but every time I had to lift something or even stand at the sink for a short period of time I would feel pain in my lower back where by I would have to stop what I was doing and stretch out on the couch or lay on the floor to relieve the pain After reading numerous reviews for inversion tables I figured I d give this one a try I used it for a few minutes every other day at first it would make me dizzy and nauseous and I had to invert myself slowly to avoid a head rush Now that I ve been persistent with it after a couple months of using for 5 10mins every other day my back pain has been reduced tremendously I can endure more lifting and standing for periods of time that I wasn t able to do before using the inversion table Also when I am doing a strenuous activity and I feel my lower back aching I immediately invert myself on the table and the pain goes away in minutes It really does work well The quality and finish of the table is excellent and the assembly instructions were very easy to follow The Memory foam is comfortable but when fully upside down you don t feel it as much because you re dangling by your ankles but as you slowly invert yourself back to an upright position the memory foam and lumbar pad feels good on the back I was rather let down of exercise fitness equipment I purchased in the past because it didn t always meet expectations but this inversion table is a worthwhile investment in my health If you purchase it go easy at the beginning until your body gets use to being upside down and when turning back to an upright position do it slowly to avoid getting a head rush 
4 0 Sturdy and Easy to Assemble but Instructions are Sparse I would actually give this product 4 5 stars since I am very happy with it The only negatives are that a small plastic piece was broken upon delivery and the actual instructions on use of the table are very brief Assembly was a breeze the broken part aside and the constuction of this table is very solid In terms of use I m a little embarrassed to say that I burst a blood vessel under my eye the second day I used it because I inverted too long in a relaxed position It hurt for a couple of days and was annoying but not serious As a treatment for my neck and back pain however the table is great Just 4 or 5 minutes a day really seems to help The key is to watch how the pressure from the inversion feels and tense your facial muscles accordingly in concert with other movements to keep your circulation moving Don t just hang there like a bat 
4 0 Ease I particularly like the ease of gently inverting and coming up again with the help of the angled hand rails I feel safe with the stop strap so the table will not invert beyond a comfortable position The ankle locking bar and straps are a snap and comfortable too 
5 0 Great use in pain management I ve been using this for about a week now I ll make 10 points 1 I have lower back pain from a car accident two years ago that is pretty much constant It gets worse after any exercising running treadmill eliptical etc 2 I have been taking ibuprofen for years to reduce the inflammation 3 The INVERSION table was something I saw and thought what the heck let s try it out 4 It is a GREAT tool in pain management it will help relieve pain obviously not permanent 5 I think it s working for me because it helps decompress my lower discs specifically the L3 L4 L5 S1 S2 AND I feel less clicks during the normal business day 6 Use it 2 3 times a day for short periods about 1 3 minutes and really try to let loose 7 I can exercise and not feel the sharp pain afterward my range of motion has increased 8 I ve noticed better posture 9 More range of motion 10 My expectations were met This table is very comfortable and not woobly like other I ve heard about 
5 0 LifeGear Inversion Table with Memory Foam and Lumbar Support We set up the table easily with careful reading of the directions It is particularly important to get the height set correctly In general plan to set the height as if you are taller than you are which make the initial balancing easier to achieve and the first inversion more controlled If you like the feeling of being upside down this is a great way to achieve that The table is heavy duty and very stable One of the users in this houseold has balance issues associated with MS The stability of the table is reassuring and the back muscle stretch seems very therapeutic We highly recommend this product 
5 0 Well designed and easy to use I bought this rack with a Topeak trunk bag Once adjusted the rack is easily installed and removed from the bicycle The rack can be used without the bag using the rack s bungee cords The bag securely slides on the rack I also bought a Topeak fender that simply attaches to the rack It s been a good combination for road and trail riding 
5 0 This rack is the bomb I have bought all three models of MTX racks This is not a replacement for the tublar racks for touring This is a great rack that fits a valuble nitch I commute to work but I bought a carbon road bike No mounts on the drop outs for a rack and not a good idea to clamp things to the carbon I travel with about 10 lb of stuff so the 20lb limit is fine I like that I can pop it off quickly and ride with out extra weight I have a mountain bike I often end up using with a trail a bike It is great the hitch arm attaches to the seat post right under the rack The hitch arm has full movement to swing and move under the rack This would not be posible with a frame mount rack Great for carring snacks I like the bags and the mount plate This is so easy to mount and unmount your bag to go into a store The mount also prevents the bag from sagging to one side If you use the shims and set the quick release tight it does not move I have banged and fallen with this rack loaded and it will shift in that case but no big deal just pick the bike up unclamp and reclamp and your off 
5 0 D R H in Iowa Hello I just got this rack for my mountain bike At first I didn t think I made a good decision But after I properly secured it to the bike and saw how good it went with the lines of the bike as well as how sturdy it was I knew that this rack wasn t going any where accept every where I went on my bike but on my bike for good Even though it has a quick release QR system that works great The way that Topeak has designed this system is great If you get the rack as a stand alone for your bike or get with it one Topeaks bags which I did you won t be disappointed The only thing I think would improve this rack is directions Not only for the rack it self but I think that the piece of plastic that comes with the rack that looks like a clip is a rear L E D holder This holder is most likely for lights like the Cateye TL LD1000 I m not sure of that but it sure looks that way I have heard of people saying that they have had a problem with the rack swaying back and fourth while riding but the only way I have gotten it to move is if my seat clamp isn t tight enough and it would then move my seat post But that is a simple fix by tightening the seat post clamp Bottom line if you have a full suspension bike and are looking for a good solid rack look no farther 
5 0 Great board Bought this board with a cabinet This is one great dartboard 99 of the soft tip darts stick in the board no problem if they don t you usually missed the dartboard The games included are enough for most players My wife and I have played on this board numerous times since we bought it and she s become a master I m still trying to catch up to her skill level My only complaint is that the LED s for the 3 statuses for Cricket are sometimes confusing Green and Yellow can look somewhat similar 8 feet away from the dartboard I would have liked to have the X and O like the Arachnid 800 but this is probably the best bang for the buck dartboard out there if you want high quality not kiddie and enough features for everyone but the most die hard professional PS the darts can be somewhat difficult to remove from the dartboard as my wife has experienced If you get the right type of darts shorter tips fatter bodies I think the 1 4 are better it becomes easier to remove 
5 0 Stadium Chairs Ohio State The product received was much better than I was expecting The quality of the purchase exceeded my expectations 
5 0 Deluxe staduim seat Excellent product I was looking for a stadium seat just like this one and couldn t believe I found it in our college team 
5 0 Amazingly Simple Brilliant +++ I bought this after having my foot reconstructed I noticed a physio using one and noted the name then ordered one I ve been using mine for a few months and my foot is getting much stronger and my calf muscle has grown back to normal Just follow the instructions and save on co pays 
5 0 You are daft if you thought you would get this product for four cents Tennis balls are tennis balls There is no such thing as a tennis ball that costs 1 33 cents three in a can makes four cents per can Any of you who thinks that this company should go out of business honoring an obvious pricing error should own your own company some day to see how it feels 
5 0 good product Not greasy no odor It was recommended for my baby by a pediatrician who said the slow release formula DEET does not penetrate the skin as much as other formulas so it s safer Kept all the bugs away in SE Asia which is a very buggy place 
5 0 The best Mosquito repellent I used this product for myself and my 2 years old daughter when we were visiting India I must say that it worked like magic Kept all those bugs away from bugging us One night I forgot to apply on my daughter and next day she had 20 mosquito bites to be precise 
4 0 Good product but This is a good holster for the price But to fit well personal height must be considered I would say it s for someone 5 8 or taller If you re short like me this holster will not stay on your thigh It fits most medium guns mgso 
4 0 thigh leg holster not a belt holster This holster hangs from your belt with two straps that buckle around your thigh to keep it in place In hindsight I should ve purchased a belt holster that is at hip level Anyhow this holster once adjusted does a remarkably good job of staying in position while running and I have never had a gun or magazine fall out while running I can even fit my M92 gas blowback pistol with laser sight in this holster and it still fits 
4 0 muh I like it pretty good but i recommend it for people with big legs its a little too small for me but its sturdy sometimes it slides over my knee and its hard to run but i still always use i 
5 0 Good This swimming glasses is very good Good price Good product I can swim long time 
5 0 Best Owned These goggles are fantastic Not only do they look nice but they work great They seal up to the eyes and do not leave marks around them They also allow for some peripheral vision 
4 0 Fun gift I purchased this as a gift for my parents The only disappointing feature is the flashlight You have to hold the button for it to stay on Other than that it s great I would recommend it Very light weight 
5 0 Almost perfect The compass is a little skittish but you get used to it And the small storage compartment is perfect for matches The thermometer is of questionable use except to quantify how fast you are freezing or frying 
4 0 Executive Punching Bag We purchased this desktop punching bag for a Technology Department office We put it on a table by the door so Techs can punch it when they come in or go out to relieve stress Amazingly it lifts up everyone in the room when someone punches the bag because we all understand the pressure and frustration that the work place produces and now we have a fun venting mechanism I was afraid that the suction cup bottom would not hold the bag in place but the cup securly holds the bag on the table top even with excessive and forceful punches When and if this one wears out we will definitely order another one No office should be without one 
4 0 Quite good for the price but does not stick that well I have always wanted a speed bag despite not knowing anything about boxing Since I live in apartments and tend to move quite a bit I did not feel like buying a professional one that required making holes in the wall When I saw this I bought it right away as I have a chest high counter that seemed to be made specifically for this It seems to work pretty well but the suction is not very good Once I managed to smash a dish when the thing simply took off after a punch but that was a rare event What happens on a regular basis is that the thing moves while you use it However I could have received one with a defective suction cap so do not be discouraged If you avoid putting breakable objects on the other side of the speed bag you should do fine Even if it takes off it is not heavy and thus it is unlilkely to do much damage Would buy it again despite this defect 
5 0 Get ready to burn fat and calories Wow Her workouts are tough but I love them all and they get you working She is always no nonsense and motivating and you need it to get through them It s a great feeling when you are done because you know you ve worked hard and burned a lot of calories and fat This workout is another great one from Cathe It s two separate workouts the first being aerobics with toning intervals and the second being high rep body sculpting routines The first workout Boot Camp is broken up into eight cycles each with four one minute intervals that include floor aerobics core workout upper and lower body workouts It s tough at times but stick to it and it does get easier Then you do the second workout which is the muscle toning and body sculpting You need a step and barbells for that challenging section as well as a medicine ball and hand weights It s also tough but the results are great At the end of that is a tough ab workout This really does give you a full body workout and I highly recommend it to everyone whether you need to lose weight or you just want to mantain and keep your fitness up and muscles toned It s a lot of fun and well worth working your way to the level you need to complete it in one full go 
5 0 Good product My daughter is three and she loves this tricycle It has everything she needs She puts her water bottle in the front basket and her two stuffed animals in the back The seat is adjustable and she likes it low It was a great buy and it s a sturdy bike We are very happy with it 
5 0 Nice little bike Nice first bike for my grandson Easy to put together Good buy for the money 
4 0 Good Item was received in a timely manner Haven t actually used it yet waiting for birthday to come around 
5 0 Love Love Love It I bought this off of Amazon for Christmas I got it for their hot deal price of 19 99 it promptly went back up the next day to its current price This was an excellent buy My daughter absolutely loves it It did not take long at all for my husband to assemble the bike and it is extremely sturdy I would highly recommend it to anyone And with the adjustable seat and handle bars my daughter should be able to ride it for a couple of years 
5 0 The Acme of Umbrellas Exceptional build quality Lightweight for its size Golfing in the rain No problem Handle fits into the Sun Mountain Speed Cart push cart umbrella holder Would recommend the 68 version for golf 
5 0 it s huge and durable It might be a bit big but if you re over 6 feet tall you need a big umbrella Works great in gusts Had it for over a year now on the east coast and it still works great 
5 0 GustBuster Firm Sturdy I own one of these for about seven years now and the umbrella is still going strong This is a true GustBuster 
5 0 Not just for golf I don t play golf but that didn t stop me from picking this umbrella up as I was sick and tired of cheap 99 cent store umbrellas that would break so easily This umbrella is indeed huge but since I carry a laptop backpack with me almost everywhere I go I wanted something that would keep it dry during the rain even though the backpack is water resistant I ve been outside in rainstorms with this and it just laughs at the rain and wind I see other people s umbrellas buckle under storm gusts even flipping inside out and yet this thing with its amazing flap system stays intact and I just hear the wind rustle through the flaps My only complaints are that the handle isn t as comfortable as it could be and since it s a 62 inch umbrella it s very tall and can t fit in a backpack like a mini umbrella Otherwise I love this thing and its lifetime warranty and I should ve bought this sooner Well worth the extra upfront cost to save in the long run and I won t be smashing any umbrellas against the side of a highway overpass in the rain after it keeps inverting due to high winds yes this happened to me and yes drivers started looking at me strangely 
5 0 Worth every penny Besides using during rain storms it works nicely blocking wind on cold days watching outdoor sporting events 
5 0 Excellent umbrella durable and lightweight This is an excellent product It is a family size umbrella it covers my wife the baby stroller and me and the build quality is very good 
5 0 One in a Million This is truly the best umbrella that I have purchased It was worth every spent 
5 0 Best umbrella ever This umbrella really lives up to its name GUST BUSTER I bought a black one from skymall com around 40 a couple years ago and used it while I was down in the caribbean going to school The strong winds down there would invert most other umbrellas but this one wasn t even phased by the wind The flap system they have on this thing is genius all umbrellas should have that Hope this review helps Chris Update get the same gust busting effect for much cheaper at Wal Mart 
5 0 The Perfect Umbrella I originally got this for the golf course It s size helps to keep me and my equipment dry What makes it great is that it hasn t inverted once in high winds When others I ve owned have this one keeps working I also use this when I m at college Like the golf course I do a lot of walking This umbrella does a wonderful job and also keeps my backpack dry Its size may make it a bit big for one person but it is worth it for what it does and it usually gets someone to ask me if I can share it with them 
5 0 Arrived in perfect condition I ordered the 112 because the 349 price was right especially after factoring in the free shipping and no sales tax My 112 was shipped by Bring s Cyclery in Wisconsin They did an amazing job of securing the rather flimsy Schwinn cardboard box by reinforcing each corner with stiff boards and on top of that they wrapped several high strength bands around the reinforced box ensuring that it maintained its rectangular shape and correct upright position The box was shipped by FedEx and arrived at my front door in 8 days There was one puncture in the box but otherwise it was in great shape There was no damage to the contents of the box It took me two hours to assemble and works flawlessly Amazon needs to correct their product description of the 112 a it has no louvered fan and b the electronic display is not backlit 
5 0 Love it I looked and looked for a bike that had a great digital screen with all the things I wanted calories burned RPMS distance heart rate and time one with a lot of different resistance levels and one that was going to be quiet I got everything plus more with this bike I m so glad I spent the extra 100 or so for this one instead of the 200 ones I was looking at Worth every penny I would recommend this bike for any at home exerciser looking for a great workout on a daily basis 
5 0 Schwinn 112 Upright Exercise Bike We LOVE this bike it s great The assembly was very easy and it came with all the tools needed the bike has great proggrams to get into shape and work up to more difficult programs This is a very samll footprint and has been great for the RV I would buy this bike again 
5 0 Completely Satisfied The bike works great It is a great workout It also arrived quicker than the original estimate I am completely satisfied 
1 0 Undependable Upon arrival the computer was screwed up and wouldn t work Called Schwinn and they wanted me to go out and buy an expensive set of specialized tools and fix it myself Yeah right I made them send out a repairman Three weeks later I had a working bike While working this bike is excellent I must admit However less than two months later while riding all resistance disapperared and I got the same error sign on the console I never took the bike over level three and rode three times a week for 30 minutes not exactly a heavy workload for an exercise bike Back came the repairman who promised it back to me in a week It is now six weeks later and still no bike 349 is a lot to pay for a bike that only works for two months 
5 0 Great bike great price I love this stationary bike It was actually delivered EARLY and very simple to put together using the small toolkit that was included It is very sturdy good programs and feels like the ones in the gym I was surprised to get such a quality product for such a reasonable price considering the cost of the commercial bikes that I looked into You won t be disappointed with this Shwinn 
5 0 a good buy After two weeks I m very pleased As noted elsewhere the packaging isn t very good The box in which it was shipped had a gaping hole and there was a small crack in the plastic housing Nevertheless I m very happy with the bike It took about an hour to assemble Read the directions carefully and take your time you ll be alright It is a very solidly built piece of equipment I weight 250 pounds and I find it very stabile and comfortable The electronics are easy to use and understand Also easy to read The seat and handlebars are adjustable moving forward and back as well as up and down I appreciate the postings noting the difference between the 112 and 113 I m happy without the fan and like saving the 50 Given my experience to date I would do it again 
4 0 nice bike I just recently purchased this bike first I must say that it is very comfortable My husband did not have any difficulty putting it together at all It does not take up much space and I enjoy the different programs It does provide you with a very good workout 20 minutes at level 6 the first day really surprised me My only complaint is that the pedal makes a knocking sound Hopefully this can be fixed easily as I really enjoy all other components of this bike 
4 0 Could be wider Overall I like this sweat protector but I wish that it was a bit wider in the middle If I ride and am not completly bent over sweat falls and misses the thong Other than that I like it and feels that it does keep a lot of sweat from landing on my frame 
5 0 It is what it is I wanted this item to hold the remote phone etc while I road my trainer and it does that as I hoped It does make getting on and off the bike a bit more of a hassle not much It is what is advertised and does what it claims to do Not a necessity but serves a purpose if you need to hold items As far as protecting the bike any cloth or towel would seem to do as well or better if you don t care to use the pockets

5 0 Good bike for the casual rider Pros Good value for the price Awesome Amazon service Cons None For the right user this is a great bike I can just see the bicycle snobs rolling their eyes In this case the right user me is in his early 40 s recovering from a knee surgery I am not yet able to jog was tired of the elliptical machine at the gym I wanted a bike for sort of rehab on wheels I wanted a heavy fixed gear bike to push my legs knees for strength flexibility I know that there are some amazing bikes in the market I am not one of these people who has to have the best of whatever Nor am I looking to impress anyone with the bike Between work family obligations I would be lucky to ride the bike once a week I checked out the bikes at Target Walmart but purchased it on Amazon for one reason only color Although I am not fashion conscious I just can t do the purple or lime green bikes with obnoxious stickers with images of skull flames or the word EXTREME on it I realize that all of us want to look appear younger but at some point it gets ridiculous Huffy Cranbrook for men came in black which is always cool in my book I did check out the local independent bike shops but I couldn t justify paying premium price for the same simple bike However they do provide full service carry bikes incorporating latest in technology When I am ready for one of those technological marvels I will certainly give them my business Anyway I placed the order from Amazon When the bike arrived it was very easy to assemble It took no more than 20 minutes with few simple tools which everyone should in their home I did notice that some parts such as the seat the fenders were not made of the best material but for the price I can live with it The bike did have a bent front wheel rim and I called Amazon customer service about a replacement To my surprise Amazon sent a whole new bike which arrived in 2 days I simply replaced the front wheel UPS took the spare bike back to Amazon Additional cost to me 0 I wish all my business transactions were that smooth I had the bike for few weeks now I met some neighbors while getting some exercise My legs the knee feel better My son joins me from time to time For the casual rider this is a perfect bike 
4 0 Inadaquate pounding The material seems and durable 15 pounds is ostensibly too light for ki training The medicine ball is also rather large and thus takes away from the succient and pinpointed targeting Good for beginners 
4 0 Medicine Ball That brand of Medicine Ball is good but the price is too high We are living in a fat nation For people to get fit fitness equipments and accessories ought to be more accessible in terms of variety and price 
5 0 Great time saver These bands provide a great workout and so convenient I love the strength and stretching exercises made possible with the bands Plus it is so easy to do a set or two before work after work before bed any time really A door that has good clearance in front of it is a must I like that the DVD is not in your face and it provides good direction and reminders about form I was surprised how well I liked the book It was a bit overwhelming when I first flipped through it but once you do a few exercise and get use setting up the bands the exercises become distinguishable and the illustrations helpful though not 100 accurate in my case 
5 0 Wow Everything it says and more This was sort of an impulse buy for me I have a set of dumbbells an adjustable bench a Crossbow that s gathering dust a treadmill you name it I seem to have it Other then the dumbbells all my fitness equipment is gathering dust The reason I bought the set I wanted to do lat pull downs for my back I saw on the Power 90x cd that you could substitute chin ups which I can t do with a resistance band and do lat pull downs instead I then ran up on this set and based on the reviews I bought it From there it began to get more interesting Blake the president of Bodylastic s sent me an email thanking me and giving me the info on how to get into their fitness university I decided to check it out while I was waiting for my bands to come What I saw just floored me With these bands you can mimic ANY exercises you might see in the gym From the circuit training machines to dumbbells There are exercises and lots of them for every single muscle Inner thighs outer obliques Abs forearms Triceps you name it the university tells you how to do it These exercises were so diverse from what I was already doing that I became excited and couldn t wait for the shipment to arrive That said the order was shipped out right away In the mean time I sent the company a letter asking more questions and within 24 hours Blake the company president answered all of them which impressed me as well My order finally arrived on Wednesday I had just completed upper body Monday so I thought well I ll give these bands a run for the money and do both upper and lower body today Let me tell you I started with lower body and by the time I was done my legs were like jelly my Buns yes even an exercises that targets that and its not a lunge had a burn I had never felt before and I sweat buckets within the first 5 minutes Lower body wiped me out I took a 20 minute break and finally finished off with a great ab workout Especially my obliques really felt the burn The range of motion the ability to change weights quickly and mimic any gym machine is just completely fantastic The resistance is challenging and extremely smooth Beats my Crossbow hands down And if your not comfortable doing one type of exercise like I couldn t do chin ups there are several more to choose from that works the same body part I never expected all of this for my small 50 dollar purchase and it was worth every cent if not more You cannot go wrong with this set 
5 0 hard to believe I ve been using the bodylastics for about two weeks and i m blown away that a product that is so simple and inexpensive can be so effective I m 54 years old and have been working out regularly for 25 years I have a complete set of free weights and a weight stack home gym this simple product can duplicate almost every exercise as well as my heavy expensive equiptment In a number of areas bodylastics are superior The potential for injury is much less and it is easier and faster to switch between exercises Finally the best exercise is the one you actually do on a regular basis I enjoy the bodylastic work out much more than using my old equiptment I m getting addicted and can already feel better muscle tone than i was able to achieved before These bands will work your muscles every bit as much as a weight set i m sore after every session The DVD that comes with the set is ok for a beginner but if you search the web you can find some sites with better info Look on ebay you ll find endless listings for bowflexes and total gyms that are being dumped after collecting dust from non use You won t find anyone selling a used bodylastic set 
5 0 Excellent Product First of all shipping time was very speedy three and a half days The bands are extremely well designed and constructed I ve only had them about a week so I can t say how they ll hold up over time but they are high quality and seem very durable The clip system and door anchor are both brilliant designs The handles and ankle straps are both comfortable to use You do need a decent amount of room in front of and to the side of the door you re using about six feet in front and a few feet on the side The online resource center that you get a year s subscription to is very thorough and professionally done The short videos for each exercise are extremely helpful in achieving good form The high number of different exercises allow for a great variation of workout routines Though I m fairly strong the set allows for much growth in increasing resistance levels Overall this is a great travel friendly complete system for under sixty bucks with shipping 
4 0 bodylastic I was impressed with the sturdiness and construction of this equipment and also in the variety of ways it can be utilzed during a workout The handgrips are very comfortable during use The set comes in a little bag to make it extremely portable The only drawback is that I normally work out with a friend and the kit only includes one set of grips handles though I believe you can order an additional set of handles without ordering another complete set 
5 0 A must have for home exercise One of my personal training clients showed me her Bodylastics set and I immediately bought one to use at home myself and to use with clients It s certainly the best set of exercise bands I ve ever seen and in fact it s one of the best fitness products I ve ever seen modestly priced infinitely versatile well constructed very durable materials and very cleverly designed with the foam door attachment and interchangeable handles One set of handles is for your hands and the others are ankle straps for leg and butt work This set is like having a cable crossover machine at home You can do anything with these bands that you can do on that machine at the gym I didn t care much for the routine they teach on the DVD and in their booklet but I loved the website I found many exercises there that I have never seen before including some that combine the bands with a stability ball I use the bands a ball and a jumprope to do my own functional challenging workout when I can t get to the gym Several other reviewers thought that serious weight lifters wouldn t like the bands or be challenged by them but I m a trainer and I love them 
5 0 Blake Kassel best customer service ever I wholeheartedly recommend the company and the product I have been buying online for 10 years the current purchase qualifies as my best customer service experience ever 
5 0 Holy Crap I bought this system from bodylastics and let me tell ya this will kick your buttocks and get them in shape Even though I have gotten out of shape over the years I thought for sure I could jump in and do the intermediate work out with the young lady in the included DVD disk during the circut training part of the program WRONG ANSWER I was thourghly humiliated at myself and gasping for air and if you don t think some rubber bands well surgical tubing on steroids can t give you a work out you would be wrong again If you want to get in shape on the cheap you have to buy this product very high quality and more than you would ever need Unless your a body builder Honest I have owned the total gym and I did love it but they now cost almost a grand or so for the better models and attachments which cost extra and the body lastics set will do the same thing for you I was really suprised and pleased Oh and I am now relegated to the all American Cubicle forest at work and you can use the device that attaches the bands to the door between the top of the desk and the space where the back wall of your cubicle attaches and get quite a few of the specified exercises done shown in the included manual Enjoy 
5 0 Thoroughly satisfied I just received my Bodylastics Maximun tension set and absolutely love it First you should know from reading this page that the item ships from the Bodylastics warehouse It took just 2 days to get it to me from their warehouse after I placed my order superfast shipping After opening it up I immediately put it to the test My problem area is my shoulder specifically my left and I have a hard time working it our properly with dumbbells The Bodylastics tubes gave incredible tension and allowed me to comfortably work my shoulder out After a few sets my shoulder had that healthy burn like I had just done my sets on a cable machine I then put it through every conceivalbe test I could think of Legs abs biceps triceps everything was given a thorough work out I want to make special mention that the door anchor did not do so much as put a mark on the door and I was using it on a hollow in door door not a solid outside door The tubes allowed me to perform each exercise slowly and deliberately while focusing on the muscle I was trying to work without having to worry about dropping a free weight on my foot The maximum tension set can produce up to 150lbs of tension if you use all of the tubes at once and use only one handle Plenty for me I would definetly recommend this purchase for a whole range of people Everyone from a complete beginer up to the most expereinced weight lifter I would especially recommend that people in physical therapy or anyone recovering from an injury consult their therapist or doctor and consider this product for use during their therapy workouts because the exercises using this set require slow deliberate and smooth movements without the hazard posed by free weights 
5 0 Great Outdoor Fireplace Great outdoor fireplace It s compact enough that it does not take up too much room in the courtyard You can have seating all around so everyone can enjoy the fire I had been looking for about 4 months to find something but would never buy anything until I found this one My sister had bought one and once I saw hers I knew this is what I was looking for 
4 0 Reveiw after use of Outdoor Products Ripcord 2 Liter Hydration Pack Graphite I feel this product provides excellent Value for the occasional biker or hiker While cycling I had filled the hydration bladder with water and ice I also carried a 32oz bottle of gatorade in the the storage area There was still plenty of room for snacks keys clothes etc I purchased a Sony portable CD player radio It fits nicely in a special compartment with the headphone wires coming out of a slot in the top of the pack My radio also has a remote which is great when you don t want to stop The chest and waist straps hold the pack comfortably yet snugly to your body so it is not bouncing around The one negative that would report is the bladder hook Rhis is what the bladder suspends from inside the pack I think it should have a latch or something to hold it more securely What I found is that when you take it off it may slip off and then it pinches the hose which prevents drinking I try to keep the velcro that closes that part of the pack close to the hook This seems to help Overall though I am very pleased with my purchase 
5 0 Awsome hydration pack I absolutely love this hydration pack It has one large and two small pockets and two quick stash pockets with the bladder in its own seperate pocket on the back The large pocket has a space for a discman and has a headphone port Furthermore the bladder is very high quality and I haven t had any problems with it The bladder and hose are easy to remove so it is not hard to clean it Also this pack is offered for a much better price than the overpriced camelbaks All in all I think that this pack is definitely worth the money that I paid for it 
5 0 Fantastic for everyday use I am 7 1 2 months pregnant and this hydration pack is a lifesaver I am able to take long walks without having to carry bottles of water with me The size of the pack is small enough not to be a bother but large enough for my keys ipod cell phone and a snack This is a great deal for all of the features you get 
5 0 Deluxe air mattress Very comfortable and versatile air mattress for camping or water sports Heavy duty construction and durable material with attached pillow at a reasonalble price make this a good bargain 
5 0 good purchase I play frisbee once every other week with a bunch of military guys that really can t throw anything but a cross body throw but it takes a beating as it gets ripped out of hands and people spike it Still works the battery has come on 2 occasions in 3 months of play but it alwyas works afterwards and i ve been happy with buying both the red and the blue shoudl have bought the green for a complete set Would be nice if it came with a spare battery but there s no complaints there Would recommend for even rough pla 
5 0 Crazy bright and fun We ve played for hours with these discs as we now have every color and have had the most fun in the most random of places It s easy to pull out a disc from the car the house backpack or suitcase and light up some faces with fun I read another review here and want to say that we ve not lost any parts to our discs and have had some pretty serious impacts a semi truck ran over one and the light stayed on and it works fine today My favorite feature is how bright the disc is ALL OVER It s not LEDs on the rim it s the whole disc lit up Our whole family is a fan and loves to play We are much more active because of a silly light up flying disc Crazy things happen this is one of them 
4 0 Good frisbee I got this frisbee about two years ago and I love it I play pretty seriously about 3 times a week and i really enjoy playing at night with this frisbee It is about 185 grams so it soars pretty well without being affected by the wind The only problem I have with it is that after a couple years of continuous use the part that holds the batteries inside the frisbee comes out and the light turns off when that part becomes loose which happens alot now but it is easily fixable by putting duct tape over it before playing The problem with the duct tape is that it makes it not as aerodynamic and it weighs it down but I am happy that I have gotten a good 2 years of use out of it I highly reccomend it to people wanting to play frisbee at night 
5 0 Priceless fun I bought this on a whim from a local store At the store it was hard to tell how bright the frisbee really was But once it gets dark this thing glows BRIGHT I got the red one The first time I used it was with some friends playing Ultimate Frisbee on a pitch black night It flies like a regular frisbee and has good solid feel to it It was pure fun We played for hours The fun factor I got from this frisbee doubled when I found it also floated and was waterproof So we had a blast with it while on a camping trip along a lake For those of you with swimming pools it should be a fun thing to play with at night Then one night at a friend s party someone came across a paintball gun Naturally we started looking for things to shoot at He had a huge field behind his house but no targets So out came my trusty frisbee which I always carry in my trunk for unexpected occasions such as these It glowed bright while we spent the night pelting it with shots Since it is lit up by an LED the battery will last for hours Mine is still working after many hours of use I highly recommend it From what I understand the red LED will have a longer battery life than the other colors or the multicolored ones 
5 0 Cleverly named well crafted I picked up one of these flying discs just a couple of weeks ago I have a green one but they are available in red blue and multicolors as well It s a well made American product which makes this disc an easy choice over the competition that flies straight and does not hurt to catch at least with the hand After a few missed catches a few collisions with trees and landing in the road the Flashfligh never blinked It seems sturdy unlike some other light up discs that didn t last through a weekend The LED makes it easy to spot without being distracting so catching the disc is easy and finding it not a matter to be taken lightly during a late evening endeavor is effortless as long as the light is turned on 
5 0 Way too much fun Our first evening out we had no idea that this disc could give us such pleasure We ran laughed and played for hours Now we schedule our night time raves in the park I m amazed at the abuse our discs have taken and they keep flying It is fun to have all the colors in the air at once Great product and more fun than you can imagine 
5 0 Lots of Fun We purchased this kayak a few weeks ago and have enjoyed using it in our nearby lake Initial use is very easy We had it set up and inflated within fifteen minutes using a hand pump for inflation Note the kayak does not include paddles so remember to purchase them as well The kayak comfortably seats two people with room for storage in the front and rear of the kayak We re using this to stow lifejackets for our boys The kayak includes two inflatable removable seats which can be moved around or removed We ve found that they are very comfortable and actually make rowing and maneuvering easier The kayak also has an easy to open and close drain for letting water out of the boat The size of this kayak makes it so easy for using and transporting Our 11 year old can carry it on his own and it actually fit inside our van fully inflated I don t plan on taking the kayak on any rapids but for use on local lakes and calm rivers it seems to be the perfect solution 
5 0 getting better I have been using this as part of a rehab program so I haven t put it to any rigorous use but it is sturdy and seems to do what it says it will do 
5 0 KSC 25g great for upgraded airsoft guns These are very good quality BBs Don t use these in cheap guns They are heavier than 20g and 12g used in regular guns but they work great in guns that are supposed to fire 25g I use them in my Tokyo Marui VSR 10 GSpec and I have no problems 
5 0 Delivered as Promised Product response shipping packaging all superb service I would definitely purchase here again 
5 0 Good workout for all types This is a great workout tool for every body It is total customizable for easy to hard I recommend it to any one looking for a no hassle workout that can be done almost anywhere 
5 0 Product I never want to use Preparing a disaster kit was made easier ordering and adding the compact ark to it The price was one of the best for similar kits on other sites The contents of water emergency blanket and emergency food rations good till 2011 fit neatly into my duffel of flashlights personal items and tools The only thing that could have been better is the Super Ark but I had most of the additional items in the upgrade I will note that the additional items cost me more time and money to collect than the price of the Super Ark buying them indiviually things expire at different times also Once I found how much this product fullfilled the need I gave the ark III out as presents to encourage others to be more prepared for the unexpected 
4 0 Great headlight This is a great headlight for biking at night It is surprisingly bright has a flashing mode which gets the attention of cars and saves battery life attaches to my helmet so I dont have to worry about it get stolen I don t know if I would feel comfortable offroading with this light but it s definitely great for biking around the dark neighborhoods at night I recommend it 
5 0 hasn t let me down keeping in mind i ride in nyc so the light is less to see the road more for others to see me the 410 has kept me visible and has at least psychologically kept me safe i keep it on blink mode most of the time but the steady on does make potholes and other road hazards more obvious down darker streets i have mounted the 410 upside down on my handlebar to keep it low profile the downside to that being i sometimes turn the light on with my knee when using more body english it s a great small powerful lightweight good looking light i am very happy with it and highly recommend it 
5 0 Tetragon 7 Very please My two boys and I went backpacking the end of December It was the first time for my 12 year old This tent worked very well Good construction Not too heavy for this type of trip I would recommend the next size down if you only have one other person but it s great for 3 
5 0 Great nights rest and STAYED DRY It didn t just rain it POURED And guess what We stayed dry as can be I defnitely recommend this one if you think you might be heading into some wet weather on your trip 
5 0 Seal the seams BEFORE it rains I don t own this tent but I have owned other Eureka tents in the past As with many good tents the seams are sewn together with thread but they are not sealed Sealing means applying a sort of thick glue to coat the threads and seams so water won t come through Some tents have some sort of seam sealer applyed at the factory they say I usually apply some of my own too Read the instructions it will tell whether the seams or sealed and recommend a seam sealer if not You can buy a tube at most sporting goods stores Ask a salesperson for advice on applying it There are sometimes a lot of seams that have to be coated top cover rainfly floor door etc anything exposed to the outside Especially the floor cause you can end up in a big puddle if it rains enough Sometimes you need to reapply sealer after several years If the fabric itself starts to leak something like Thompson s Water Sealer with make it waterproof again But it will also make it stiffer and change the color slightly Eureka makes good tents If prepared properly they don t leak Heck even cheapo tents don t leak if the seams are sealed About the only way you would get leaks is if there were holes in the fabric And then you would need to patch them If you take care of a tent when handling it holes are rare But careless use of lighters or cigarettes will do it 
5 0 Consumer Reports Excellent I don t own this tent but Consumer Reports ranked it as Excellent in set up test criterium in the Small Sized Family Camping Tent Comparison Also was a Quick Picks tent identified by them I saw this tent in person and I think it s a pretty good deal for the occassional to heavy camper 
5 0 3 Gal Polycarbonate Water Container Although time will be the true test of this product they certainly appear and feel very durable The screw tops go on easily and tighten securely I am very pleased at this point with this product I purchased six of these container bottles and have refilled them five times We get our drinking water from municipal wells the rest of our water comes from catchment Thank you for what appears to be a very quality product 
5 0 Just what I was looking for These bottles are very sturdy and the built in handles allow anyone to get a solid grip I expect they will last for a long time They were well worth their price 
5 0 As advertised This kit is full of good stuff for an emergency kit I picked one up at costco and it s the perfect size to just leave in the car 
5 0 Best Bike Hoist on the Market I have tried almost all bike hoists on the market The Racor is the cheapest at 21 and it works fine but feels and looks budget The other brands have similar design to the Racor but cost more and really don t work any better some say they can lift more weight but they have the same mechanical advantage as the Racor at 4 1 so anything more than about 80lb is really too hard to lift anyway The Kettler Spezi has a unique design It is around 50 but it feels good works smoothly and has the best locking mechanism If you must have quality buy the Kettler 
5 0 Easy to use I don t like wearing a wristwatch but want to know the time The Timex Grip Clip is a very handy alternative It easily fits in a pocket or attaches to anything belt loop messenger bag etc It s also a great value 
5 0 Super I needed a watch that would stay with me all the time but not on my wrist since a watch on my wrist tends to bother my typing I tried a pocket watch which is decent but I wanted to have something on the outside This watch is the best I found so far It is rugged and convenient It has useful functions such as a down counter a timer and an alarm The display has two positions the reverse vertical position good for hanging on your belt hook which is what I do or the vertical position for hanging on other things like bags I suppose It s also inexpensive The only thing may be that this thing is not exactly beautiful but on casual clothing I think it looks just fine 
5 0 Grandson Loved It My grandsons go through helmets about once a year so I ve been replacing them at Christmastime I have trouble with sizes every year This one was a perfect and comfortable fit with the additional pads for my soon to be nine year old I also bought the Bell Blade Youth Bike Helmet for my soon to be six year old and the Bell Child Bike Helmet and Elbow Knee Pad Value Pack for my soon to be four year old and they also were perfect fits 
5 0 Fantastic Deal Thos is a great stove I bought it for my boat and saw a very similar one in the West marine catalog for 65 bucks 
4 0 ok for the price a basic foam roller nothing much to say about it if you think you will use it buy it 
5 0 Perfect for Lower Back Issues Maybe a little pricey for what it is but it sure works for me Just a couple of minutes 2 or 3 times a day and it releives all of the stress in my lower back It is instant albeit temporary relief from my lower back strain and posture issues 
4 0 Suunto T3 Good quality product that came very quickly with standard delivery A great heart rate monitor with a bunch of other good features 
5 0 Suunto T3 Mountain Bike POD I really like the heart rate monitor on this T3 The heart rate keeps me informed just how hard or easy I am riding my bike The Training Effect function is also a very useful feature The T3 is a little complicated at first but with constant use it becomes easier to use I like the bike POD also as I can enter all the data off the T3 as I sit in front of my computer 
5 0 Outstanding I really enjoy the T3 The training effect is a new concept to me but seems to generally measure the intensity of my workout It is nice to have a single measure to summarize my workouts The watch has very nice log features as well The Bike POD works great Very nice to have speed distance and all recorded along with heart rate I have no complaints with the watch 
5 0 Very well made the stand is rather weak and wont hold the swords very well but im sure i can glue it down to keept it from falling the blades were very well sharpened they appear to be stainless steel The sheathes are very nice and well decorated as are the hilts 
5 0 Works great Okay so I am not an airsoft expert and can t really go into much detail about this gun First and foremost this is a toy and nothing more It has no need to go fast or hard but believe its not fun to get hit by it Compared to my Ak 47 it shots fast and very accurate I kept to short round burst and found the drum clip more useful The siliencer scope and orange tip extention are completly useless don t need them The strap hold on really well and the gun has a great weight What I like about this gun compared to my Ak 47 is its size and adjustability I barely charged it and my friend got some pretty nice welts on his back Also I have been using 12mm bullets on this gun and will be try 2mm soon I don t think the difference will be great but the adjustable hop makes up for it 
5 0 Cyma Mp5 Really a suprise very good quality shoots straight and hard very sturdy realistic looking A really good buy at that price everybody else sells it for much more money A steal 
4 0 Great gun Teen s review When i got this gun it looked really cool The assembaly is easy but the laser scope thing is the only thing hard to assemble I tried it and i would say it had 200+ FPS The only thing bad about this gun is that it takes some time to reload the magazine Also the gun says it comes w a flashlight It doesn t have it Also if you re looking for a good size gun this would b good 4 u Also IT S ALOT OF FUN DUDE 
5 0 Great This gun has a pretty high rate of fire and as long as you give the magazine a good shove when you put it in then you won t have any bb s jam This gun is worth every penny but not much more than that it is great for indoor battles or small scale outdoor battles The hop up is very effective and the gun can take any type of bb you put in there To truly get the best effect from the hop up though you should probably use high polished 12 gram bb s 
4 0 Excellent Starter Weapon However Cheap in Execution I ve been doing air soft parties with my Air Force buddies for quite some time so I get to try out a diverse selection of air soft weapons from the cheapo single shot handguns to the full auto SAW weapons The CYMA MP5 was a cheap alternative to purchasing over 100 rifles since you are then entering the price range of real rifles that I find more fun to shoot The CYMA MP5 did not take all that long to charge and depsite constant target practice and constant harassment to my unsuspecting neighbors when they re not looking and outside usage I have yet worn down the battery to necessitate a recharge Despite prior reviews I have yet to experience a problem with the stock 30 round magazine the drum however not quite so successful As for the power it s 200+ FPS may not seem like much but that may indicate your battery is low I tested the FPS out on my unsuspecting brother from 20 feet away and the lasting whelps on his arms suggest a rather unpleasant that WILL get your attention for this reason I strongly suggest taking safety precautions to avoid injury The rate of fire is consistant but with any full auto weapon it is vital to realize there is a difference between sustained fire and continuous fire Since air soft guns cannot easily be tweaked to lower the firing rate full auto airsoft guns are prone to jam unless CO2 powered due to the firing mechanism It is vital to understand that you cannot and should not just go Rambo and unload like there s no tomorrow You run the risk of throwing the firing mechanism out of whack and then you have a busted weapon 2 3 round bursts are the way of the day even when conducting supressive fire BEAR THIS IN MIND when using the CYMA MP5 especially if you re purchasing this for a younger user that may not be familiar with close combat beyond Counter Strike Now to name some cons this weapon is cheaply made The scope cannot be accurately mounted unless mine came broken It seems to makeshift snap on to the upper receiver and easily wabbles I compensated by screwing in with a power tool a weaver rail and mounted one of my actual red dot scopes Now it s semi accurate up to 30 yards My flash light attachment simply does not work and no matter what I tried I couldn t get it to work Oh well never gonna use the thing anyway Many people have noted the weapon is prone to jam on the first round and this is true and there s a way to prevent it pull the cocking hammer back and then slap in the magazine Once in slap down the hammer or you can insert the magazine then pull and release the cocking hammer Sometimes the full auto also jams on the first shot To get around this I switched to single shot fired then switched back to full auto since it already primed the next shot Then there s the instructions written VERY poorly I ve read garage door opener manuals with better translations It s almost to the point where I have to read the instructions soley from the pictures Other than this it s a good cheap starter weapon for younger or novice shooters It s also a great product to teach new shooters firearm safety since the basic safety principles still apply finger off trigger point in same direction etc There are better alternatives for more advanced players but this one is good for beginners and those like me that just want a beater 
4 0 Great buy This gun is great but the instructions are hard to understand unless you understand Chinese also the scope is hard to use but you can unload the smaller mag in under a second and the big on in about three so it fires very fast and at a pretty fast speed also many parts of this gun are meta 
4 0 Good product The product works well on my cannondale and is made nicely However I wish it was real glass All in all a good product Thank 
5 0 Nice Mat I used it twice each week it is pretty good Easy to use easy to store Satisfied with it so far 
4 0 great surface to do exercise this is a good mat to exercise it s not very big so it fits in most place 
5 0 LOVE IT I take a Pilates conditioning class and I bought the mat to have one of my own instead of using a community gym one I love the way that it never slips when doing any sort of workout and the feeling of it is just wonderful I highly suggest you try this mat it even comes with it s own velcro straps others make you buy them 
4 0 Second one I ve purchased This is the second Vector I have purchased My first six year old one has gotten beat up and the compass no longer works The watch has a large dial and is a little bulky but you get used to it You trade that for a large easy to read dial The watch has more features than you can use and a large instruction manual to go with it It has the compass barometer temperature and altimeter The 6 hour barametric pressure history box is nice to warn you of incoming bad weather The watch is a nice instrument but I would warn against abusing it It is shock resistant not shock proof 
5 0 outstanding outdoor tool I got my first Vector about three years ago from REI Yes it is large Not a problem for me as I am large I am on my third Vector the first two for some strange reason leaked water the first during an incredible monsoon rainstorm in the mountains of Arizona the second while taking a shower No I did not submerse the watch nor push any buttons while the water was on Fortunately REI accepts returns with no questions It is a testament to how nice this watch is that I continued to replace the watch Perhaps I had models from a bad production run as my present Vector has lasted for over two years with nary a leak The good I have found the digital compass to be very accurate and useful Remember that it must be calibrated from time to time and don t forget about declination The barometer is VERY useful The barometer function is constantly operating and accounts for a nice little symbol in the upper left of the display showing pressure trends over the past few hours This is very useful if you understand barometric pressure trends and their likely results If you do not look it up and learn as you will find it to be very useful if you spend a lot of time in the brush Remember that the barometric pressure must be calibrated against absolute sea level readings from time to time especially during rapidly changing weather conditions Once you understand the relationship between altitude changing weather you will master the complexities of both the barometer and the altimeter and understand just how simple they are and how reliable this device really is I have checked it against my high end GPS and other barometers many times and it is very accurate indeed The temp is useful if you need to know the temperature like all such devices it will have to be taken off of your body for about ten minutes before you will get an accurate reading The bad the lens is plastic If you have any experience with fine coated glass you will do fine with this DO NOT EVER wipe any dust or dirt off of the face Use a lens pen with a fine blower brush Or wait until you ve stepped under water with it Put simply it has been my experience that if you keep your grubby paws off of it and don t try to clean it with your cotton t shirt flannel shirt etc and instead use methods used for fine coated glass elements it will look like new forever Mine does and it has been in desert dust and swamp mud The battery does in fact eventually lose energy In normal use you can expect a year or more from the battery If you are one of those fellas that shows everyone that he meets his neat digital compass or actually rely on this as your primary compass in the brush it won t last nearly so long The digital compass is the primary energy sucker likely as much as the backlight Use the compass only when needed you should have a base plate compass anyway Suunto also makes some of the best of these as well As for the review stating the watchbands give out I find that remarkable as I have never had a problem with mine and I wear it constantly day in and day out All in all and in spite of the fact that I had to return my first two I heartily recommend the Vector Tough and useful 
4 0 Fun Watch I gave this watch to my fiance he has really enjoyed tracking our altitude gain on bike rides I ve appreciated knowing the temperature Can t wait for ski season 
4 0 It s HUGE But pretty darn cool This may be the outdoorsy ubergeek watch It s big it s ugly but has functions to make the fattest Swiss Army Knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy Overall I like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are The timepiece Outstanding It has HH MM SS DD MMM of course with a year setting to avoid leap year issues This should go without saying in a modern digital watch Stopwatch with lap function not that I ever use the lap function but I m sure someone is interested Countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown very easy to set Three daily alarms Special kudos for the alarms this is one of the loudest watch alarms I ve heard and I ve missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this The Altimeter largely eye candy but kind of neat Over four days my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level by the maps about 40m ASL Not surprising because it is driven by the barometer and I never recalibrated it but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want need it The Barometer Yup it s a barometer The part I like is the little display that shows the rising falling trend especially as this is always active even in normal time mode The Thermometer Take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist The compass Easily the best special feature Accurate precise enough for orienteering not for surveying easy to use It can be programmed for a declination but knowing me I d forget to reset it so I do declination the hard way The sighting notches are small but servicable The spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to Suunto and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass An outstanding wrist compass The package Big Really really big But the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing a problem for me with other watches The battery has a shortish 12 18 month life but has a hatch so you don t need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance The display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground and the display light is just right readible even and glare free but not an emergency flashlight Personally I m going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap but the stock strap isn t bad just not great Overall not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch compass and barometer and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter Well designed thought out and manufactured but really big

5 0 An amazingly tough watch and useful I m very hard on my gear and this watch has withstood it all It has all the features you could ask for in a watch plus a few you would never expect Large easy to read numbers for when your in difficult situations or akward positions and even while scuba diving note it says not to press buttons underwater but its still readable without the backlight usually are a great feature and although it s a large watch it has a certain style all its own I think the compass is my favorite feature great while orienting yourself with a trail map Also a great conversational piece while breaking the ice in the board room my watch helps me predict the weather D ok maybe not the best thing to tell your boss but still an amazing watch 
5 0 Great excellent product shipping and service could not have asked for more thank you so much 
4 0 Black 40 10 tsuka or handle practice katana A great bokken at a good price I do both Ninjutsu and Toyamma Ryu a katana martial art new to the U S that is a combination of Iaido and kenjutsu with a strong emphasis on iaido drawing and sheathing of the sword and on the perfection of the cut It is heavier than most bokken which I think is a good thing because its closer to the weight of a real katana and it builds strength in the forearms while practicing For Toyamma Ryu I use mostly my carbon steel Iaito unsharpened katana but still use it when we do kenjutsu techniques like blocking drills bokken to bokken It doesn t come with a saya sheath but I just made one out of thick black plastic from my water well tubing and heated to mold it into more of an oval instead of being circular I needed a saya because it is important for drawing in Iaido techniques For most bokkens you can use those old plastic black golf club tubes that they sell at Dick s Sporting Goods or wherever you can find them but you have to ask for them The handle wrap is durable and a really nice feature In Ninjutsu all we use is the bokken because we do body movement to avoid the blade which is obv much safer than a metal sword I ve wacked it pretty hard in practice and by accident a few times and it has held up really well and the handle wrap hasn t moved at all so I think it is a really nice practice tool that everyone will love P S If you are using this item for Iaido and you decide to make your own saya the paint is gonna scratch off a little bit from rubbing against the saya so you may want to get the natural wood color not a big deal either way 
5 0 it rocks i bought two of them so that i could mess around with one of them for instance i have a giant wild cactus field up in this lot by my house so i use it to slice through them so i know its realy sturdy because the cactus has broken a pvc pipe before so my point is buy it 
4 0 Good but the natural wood one is better The cord wrapped handle is a great idea offering more of a real sword like look as well as a firmer grip My hands tend to get sweaty and slip around a bit with long practice particularly with the sealed lacquered finish on most bokken This wrap really helps though it needed a touch of glue to get it to stay in place The two piece guard design is a nice enhancement too Though you really don t need the guard at all for many applications it is nice looking and appears stronger than the original It s still a fairly cheap piece of wood compared to an ironwood version but at this price it was 9 99 when I bought it you really can t go wrong A nice enhancement over the basic bokken I do however prefer the natural wood version to this one as it looks pretty bad once you start using it and the color scrapes off Nevertheless if you want an inexpensive practice sword this one is recommended 
5 0 GREAT PRODUCT I THOUGHT THE COLEMAN FOLDING TABLE WAS VERY EXCELLENT FOR MY NEEDS I M USING IT AS A COMPUTER TABLE AND FOR MY PRINTER IT IS JUST THE RIGHT SIZE AND FOLDS IN HALF WITH A HANDLE FOR EASY CARRYING 
4 0 good service but the product is liitle different than what I thought the table has Aluminum legs but the plat form is made of some kind of paper board but if you don t put too much weight on it it s pretty good 
5 0 Perfect Table for Flea Markets or Company We are very happy with our Coleman Dynasty Folding Table The construction of the table is very solid and it takes up little space when not in use It s strength and comfort are uppermost to us 
4 0 Good value We got four of these tables last year for our Summer Party and have been using them regularly None of them arrived damaged and all had functioned well We weren t expecting stainless steel sturdiness on the contrary they are light and easy to transport set up so we were not disappointed by their filmsiness This year s party will be bigger so we are purchasing four more 
5 0 Nothing beats Coleman for quality Bought this table for camping but use it for parties and get togethers at home as well Love it due to its easy transportability Folds up and sets up quickly unlike those cumbersome folding card tables Highly recommend for the value 
5 0 A great emergency boating lantern The first thing I was struck by was how well made this lantern is made It even has rubber footing so it won t slide around Others have noted the low light output but I bet they tested it by just closing room lights When you do that the light output is similar to a good candle However when one s eyes are adjusted to the dark i e getting up at night the light output is impressive It lights up a small room sufficiently to be able to get about You can even read by it I think it s an outstanding emergency light for one s home and for use on a boat as well We ve purchased a few more for those purposes 
4 0 good for blackouts Just received the unit Manufacturing quality is very good Small light compact design is excellent Installing batteries is a snap unscrew retaining knob and twist bottom cover 5 degrees to align the arrows and off it comes Wire carry handle folds down flush with the lantern body Very slick Unfortunately the brightness leaves a lot to be desired I was looking for something I could bring up into our unfinished attic but this unit is too dim For reading you have to have the lantern right next to the book and even then it s not really enough This makes the high medium low light feature kind of gimmicky The only use for medium low would be as a temporary night light in the kids room The blinking light feature is ok but the 2 second interval seems kind of long Great lantern for very light duty camping use blackouts or other emergencies 
5 0 life saver I bought this light as a night light light for my tent seeing how candles are NOT a good idea and other lanterns i have drink batteries i friend turned me on to it and you can also tell with the flashing battery indicator when the batteries need changing in advance to me it is more than bright enough for camping and emergencies and it has 3 light levels I FORGOT TO SAY I ALMOST HAD A FIRE WITH A CANDLE letting it run for 6 10 hours a day for a week i replaced the batteris once and that was only when the battery light just started to turn to medium life 
4 0 Great for Female Runners I love my Fuel Belt It s light and flexible If I have one complaint it s that the belt tends to fit snuggly The small is REALLY small so order up one size The velcro belt will ensure a snug fit The bottles tends to slip from your hands when you perspire but overall it s a great training tool 
4 0 Nice for a young child My daughter got this one for Christmas She wanted this one in particular so Santa Claus brought it for her It is lightweight so it s very easy for her to peddle and steer She is on the small side for her age she s 5 and weighs about 40 lbs but she has no problem peddling this car she can even pick it up to turn it around We have the larger one for our 10 year old and it is very heavy too heavy to pick up and turn around Our son doesn t ride the big one too much so our daughter will have one to move up into when she outgrows the little one I got it quite a bit cheaper through a different company 
5 0 Great I ve been working as a lifeguard on the beach for many years I don t know what I would do without this whistle It s the best 
5 0 a great bike trailer for a good price I have 2 children ages 2 and 4 and they fit well inside this trailer They have space for their shoulders heads and legs as well as a space for waterbottles etc We especially like the hitch It actually hooks around the bike instead of just needing to be tightened around a bar so there is no chance of it coming loose and falling off We had a lots of problems with this in our previous bike trailer It doesn t have lots of frills but we use it at least a few times a week and have loved it We also have 2 jogging strollers from Instep and they are great I trained for a whole year for a marathon while pushing 2 kids in it and it s still going strong Instep is a good quality brand with great prices 
4 0 Can t wait This is one of the most wonderful products I have purchased It is easy to set up and it is very roomy I love the drink and snack holders for each kid The only thing is it does not have good shade when the sun is shining right in front The kids need hats or shades Otherwise I love it I haven t had the chance to use it with the kids in on the bike but I know it will word great I plan to use it when they outgrow it to tote my grocies around 
5 0 It s a Be ute I ve had one of these on my mountain bike for over 2 years and 400 miles It survived the woods of Virginia and Maryland the streets of Washington DC and the mountains of Southern California Just recently the wire broke that goes from the sensor on the forks to the display on the handle bars The wire came lose and got caught in the tread on the tire is the only reason it broke It seems pretty accurate The installation was easy and the placement was easy to see while still unobtrusive on my handle bars Very durable and a good value for the money 
4 0 Great value for the features My first bicycle computer had half of the features this one has and cost me twice the price This little guy is a great value Although it doesn t have wireless connectivity it still has just about all the features you would find in a high end model Easy to install Easy to use Easy to detach when parking your bike or just to review recorded readings from your last ride 
5 0 My Football My Wilson F1100 Official NFL Game Football arrived days before it was scheduled to and in excellent condition I would like to thank you for the fast shipping and the good quality of this product I would also like to see you open up a line of hand sewn NFL team logo patches I think that would be a good collector s item Your satisfied customer David Ewing 
5 0 Legendary Football Game Day Pro Ball The best ball for recreating awesome plays in your backyard or better yet in your living room This ball rocks 
5 0 THE REAL DEAL NFL FOOTBALL As described awesome football Son is very happy to have a decent football to play with Great feel grip and quality Highly Recommend 
4 0 Worth the price I just got it today and I must say it was worth the money It is very sharp The only problem with it was that when you put it back in its sheath and take it out it has this white wax film in spots Its easy enough to clean off and it will go away after a while Another problem was that the stand gave me splinters This sword is ment for some use but dont try to go whacking away at things for hours I sugest this for any collector out there or even a kill bill fan 
5 0 The most beautiful trike ever I can t believe I was going to buy the crappy plastic foldup Radio Flyer tricycle Fortunately I noticed before purchasing that it was for 1 5 yrs 3 yrs olds and as I was buying this for my daughter who was turning 3 I turned to Amazon to find something bigger When I saw this I fell in love with it and BONUS it was on clearance for 69 99 It s even more gorgeous in person when she took it to the local playground for its first spin the kids there actually chased her around the park because it was so stunning The only minor drawback is that because she s still learning the physics of pedaling she pushes the pedals and pulls on the handlebars so hard to get leverage that the handlebars go a little crooked even after tightening them as much as we can But I can easily fix it by twisting them back and I figure it won t happen as much once she grows taller and gets the hang of riding it 
5 0 Best tricycle ever and it s even PINK I can t say enough GREAT things about this trike My 2 year old LOVES it It is very well made as are Schwinn Bikes It has so much style yet it is actually very well made We gave it to her today at her birthday party and I think the adults were just as impressed by it as the little kids Plus the seat is adjustable so it can grow with the child It is also very easy to assemble This is a must have for any pink loving active little princess 
5 0 The Pink Trike I ordered two pink trikes for my granddaughters their birthdays are 21 days apart They love them I could not beleive the shipping time for these trikes I think we had them within 48 hours after we ordered them Nothing but good things to say about this order and the products 
5 0 Absolutely adorable My 3 year old daughter just got this trike for her birthday Besides being so cute it is extremely well made and durable Very worth the money she and her 5 and a half year old brother actually fight over it even though he has a cool big boy blue bike of his own You know it must be fun if a 5 year old boy is willing to ride a PINK bike I am thrilled and couldn t recommend anything else if this is what you are in the market for 
5 0 First bike We got this trike for my daughter as a Christmas gift last year She is almost 2 yrs old and I wasn t sure if this trike might be too big for her When she first saw it she loved it Even though she could barely ride it she would push herself around the house ringing the bell The seat is adjustable so her feet were actually able to touch the pedals with no problem now she just needs to learn how to pedal The assembly of this trike was very easy requiring only some adjustable wrenches and a screwdriver and took only about 15 minutes The build quality of this trike is first rate it feels solid and weighs it too What impressed me most about it was the fact that the tires were real rubber needing to be inflated just like the big bikes My daughter absolutely loves her schwinn and my wife and I could not be happier with the quality and construction of it If you have a girl between 2 and 4 yrs of age that wants a bike THIS IS THE ONE 
5 0 Schwinn Roadster Trike The trike is very well made It appears to be safer than some of the other tries I ve looked at because of the low center of gravity and wide base My daughter has not had any incidents or near incidents of tiping over It seems to be securely planted on the ground 
5 0 Hi Quality I found this trike to be easy to put together Fit and finish was beautiful Child loves it Low center of gravity reduces but does not eliminate tip overs 
4 0 Great except for the pedals They are broken already We bought this for our younger daughter s 3rd birthday They are plastic and broke INSIDE so I m not sure there is any way to fix them Generally speaking it s easy for her to ride and it s very cute 
5 0 Love This Trike We gave this to our daughter for her third birthday It was easy to assemble and has room for growth Our daughter absolutely loves it She must feel very secure because she rides rather fast on it We love the fact she cannot fall backwards because of the high back seat We also love the fact if she were to fall sideways off it is low to the ground so there is less chance of injury 
5 0 It s rare to find heiloom quality Bought for 2yr birthday Looked everywhere Store s hardly carry quality bikes or anything quality for that matter Found doing a web search She loves it I love the quality Seems like it may last for a heirloom It s sets low great for safety And the 2yr old says it s beautiful 
5 0 beach chair I love it its comfortable and the fabric is sturdy It is practically weightless hen carrying it as a backpack and the bog pocket in the back fits a towel and all the other small gadgets that you want at the beach with you I like it I have been through many neach charis but this one has everything one 
5 0 Just what I wanted I searched all over looking for a good but cheap rack you cannot beat this product for the price and how well it s built It has a little hidden tray for a wallet or something comes with reflector and you can remove it and it s ready to recieve blinking lights clip ons Perfect for running to the store comes with two adjustable rubber straps Had it on in minutes comes with different size rubber shims to fit seat post size if you need them and best of all it doubles as a fender and keeps the water from shooting on me I have 26 inch wheels and I finished it off by getting the little extended fender that Topeak makes for it MTX DeFender Bicycle Fender 5 00 The threaded holes are already in the rack and with the 2 screws that came with the fender had it on It sticks out past the rack another 5 inches and total length Rack and fender from the center of the seat post is 23 1 4 inches I am very happy with it and it really looks good 
4 0 pretty good OK this is what is up with this gun the 012s are powerful at about 290 310 FPS they may not be the most accurate but they do some damage now the best BBs to use in this gun are the 20g BBs they are pretty powerful at 260 fps or so and are very accurate so this gun over all is good if you know how to use a sniper rifl 
5 0 nice gun this guy is amazing for hitting the target in a good amount of time i think that if theres a person who is good at sniping then u should buy this gu 
5 0 Amazing Gun for price This gun is amazing it s speed is awesome you could hit hit people with good force from a good distance its a little heavy at 6 7lbs it has decent aim and great power the bipod works great i would definitly reccomend this gun 
4 0 there is a lever under the carry handle and it swivels left or right according to your hand simple its big plastic and the mags are ugly other than that decent the speed loader sucks thoug 
4 0 Overall good First of all this gun is pretty good It s decently powerful and has pretty good range most of the time unlike a lot of other spring rifles it can shoot ALL the BB s in the magazine The only problem I had is that kinda randomly when i was cocking it the handle for cocking mechanism just broke off It s probably a fluke and the people at DealnSteal replaced it for me I would recommend getting a better red dot sight or maybe a small scope for the gun since the iron sights are kinda hard to set and the red dot sight that comes with the gun distorts the view a lo 
5 0 fricken sweet i just got this gun and it is amazing this is an awsome gun for this price and period i like the bipod that sweet i like the double magazines that help I am still trying to figure out how those dumba es think that you can waste a whole fifty round mag in like five seconds since its a spring gun its pretty good weight and its powerful overall this is worth the price 
5 0 WOW and Ouch this gun is amazing it probably has over 300fps and dead accurate this gun could probably peirce the skin at a close distance the only bad thing is that it runs out of bullets easily thats why it comes with 2 magz this gun also features a switch that you can customise on how straight the bullet shoot plz people buy this gun its unreal its worth the wait and worth the money i recomend this gun by fa 
4 0 handy wraps These wraps are allright They wrap around the hand and between the knuckles without leaving too much extra They seem to over stretch and deform after moderate use I m not too sure on the overall durability 
5 0 Larger Everlast Hand Wraps 108 hand wraps such as the Everlast 4455s are too short for most people to properly wrap their hands unless they have very small hands such as some females or juniors If you have normal or large size hands or use any wrapping technique that uses a lot of cloth like one that wraps between each finger I strongly recommend going with a 180 wrap such as these It may seem like a long piece of cloth but you ll quickly use it up protecting your knuckles and wrist Remember don t hit a punching bag or anything else without properly protecting your hands with wraps and gloves These Everlast wraps are cheap and basic protection 
5 0 Great value I am just a beginner to tennis and took lessons with this racquet for a few months so far My instructor even commented on the quality of the racquet It is very light weight and comfortable to use although I did get a blister the first time I played I do not feel this was due to the racquet but more the fact that I needed to toughen up my skin I have seen this same exact item in stores and it does not come with the vinyl cover as the one I purchased here online came with I would definitely purchase this item again 
5 0 really awesome I just recieved this product Monday April 16 on my Birthday the instructions are simple I have used this for 10 to 20 minutes a day it is quiet only a lite swoosh barely noticable the meter works accurately but the generic batteries need to be replace by fresh new batteries The first day I used The Fitness Quest XL Stepper I felt a burn in my thighs and calves so I know it is working I also add ankle weights 2 1 5LB each and 2 3Lb each dumbells The tension can be adjusted for long slow strides or short quick strides It is an easy storage and That is what I like about this stepper since I live in a small Apt with my husband daughter and a cat with very little or no storage 
5 0 Fitness Quest XL Stepper this thing works great have had no problems Does squeak but a little oil stops that yes its heavy so what big deal it works good counter works good also I Like it I give it 5 stars 
4 0 Nice but squeaky I have been using my XL Stepper for a month or so I am pleased that it is very solid sturdier than the mini stepper it replaced That stepper had a cable that broke this stepper is designed without a cable so it does not have that weak link The step and calorie counter has worked fine from day one The only complaint I have is that this stepper has squeaked badly since soon after I got it I have sprayed it liberally with WD 40 but the problem persists Occasionally it goes through a few minutes without squeaking but most of the time it makes noise Overall I am happy with this device It helps me get regular exercise improving my heart s health and keeping my waistline under control 
4 0 good and solid so far First thought when I took it out of the box was how sturdy it felt After the easy instructions were followed it was put together in a flash not that there is much to do at all In all fairness I don t use the counter at all I just use it for a timed cardio device I am not looking at the numbers I use it everyday and it works Would recommend 
4 0 Sturdy and quiet The machine is very quiet and the construction is solid so it should last for many years I like the fact that it also tells you how many calories you burn the calory burned count is more motivating than the number of steps taken 
4 0 Get what you pay for The product fit my bike perfectly Did not enjoy how it was shipped package damaged quality excellant 
4 0 Swiss Army Sig II pocket knife I received the knife a few days after the order which I think is very commendable considering the Christmas rush However the pen on the knife didn t work which mustr be a quality problem with the mfr I assume they don t check every one 
4 0 A Must Have As an engineer this item is quite simply a requirement The pen is the feature that makes this one special So many times I am somewhere and want to make some notes I reach for this knife and its handy pen Much easier than trying to remember the price of something in the store to compare it to the price on Amazon Of course the knife and scissors come in handy often also The light is dim but works well in near total darkness I have used it to work on the computer and read a star map on a dark night This knife is highly recommended I used the screw driver the other day to help a woman who had broken her glasses she was more than impressed that I had a screwdriver handy The only problem is that I want to take it with me all the time and you can t fly with it The one I have now is my second I lost the first to TSA at the airport after having mailed it back once for 10 You must rememeber to leave it home when you fly or you will be sad when turning to over to the Feds 
5 0 Nice knife light ideal for stargazers As one of the reviewers notes below the light is dim and red This is not necessarily a disadvantage Campers night hikers and stargazers may appreciate a light that doesn t disturb the eyes dark adaptation Moonlight or even starlight is more than bright enough to see by once you have given your eyes a few minutes to adjust but you will never get there if you or others around you are using bright flashlights A low level red light is ideal for illuminating a star chart the inside of a backpack or a footpath shadowed by trees It s also totally invisible to many nocturnal animals an advantage if you re hoping to see them The rest is just what it should be a Swiss Army knife with everything I need including a really excellent pair of scissors in a keychain size tool 
5 0 Carry it all the time but lost it and now I m lost This is the best version of this little knife The flashlight is useful especially for us old folks who are losing vision in dim places and a conversation piece The pen is always there when you need it unlike other pens I ve had and invariably lose Alas I forgot to put this knife in my checked bags and it has gone to the big security office in the sky I m buying another asap Maybe two one for a spare 
5 0 Great Keychain Companion I ve had one these puppies hanging on my keychain for about 1 year now and it s been a lifesaver at times The light comes in handy when you re stuck in a dark spot and I can t tell you how many times I ve been stuck without a pen and then suddenly remembered that I did have one on my knife The pen hasn t run out yet and always writes great The scissors cut with the precision you d expect from a Victorinox knife and the nailfile and knife are always useful whoever you may be All in all a great companion to any keychain 
5 0 Great Knife from a Great Company Swiss Army has always produced great knives and this one is no exception The light is a great add on 
1 0 field stream fishing tool set great service and seems to be of good qualit 
5 0 cute bell for both adults and kids This bell is a nice little addition to anyone s bike I have one on my road bike and like it very much Its not very aerodynamic with its 1 3 4 diameter but it is however light and capabe of fitting on any standard handlebars It comes in various colors so one is able to match it to their bike s color scheme and most importantly it gives off a nice and clear ring by the simple action of twisting the colored cap Its also a a wonderful thing if you have kids I got 2 more for my 5 year olds one for my daughter and son whom both absolutely crazy over this little jellibell 
5 0 Quite the convenience BERKELEY Portable line spooling machine I bought this item last year and it sure makes spooling line onto a reel a much easier proposition when adding 250 yards of line to open faced spinning reels It is also useful for Fly fishing reels I used to have to use pencils for spools or tie line to some tree it was always a hassle This works fine right on the kitchen table You put the reel on the spooler add the spool of line and adjust it for the tension you need and start winding It s great 
4 0 Good looking cruiser for the price Once you ditch the fenders decals kickstand and cheap plastic grips this is a pretty cool looking cruiser The frame is a nice glossy black and seems solid but the rest of the parts are low quality My front wheel arrived tweaked for instance but I m sure this can be corrected The wheels look like really cheap chrome The seat bracket is lousy too No matter how hard you tighten it the seat moves from side to side This will have to be replaced The seat is wide and comfortable though Would ve liked a matching black stem black handlebars black rims but hey you can t have everything Look elsewhere if you re a stickler for quality but this bike should suit most people s needs 
4 0 I like these gloves I really like these gloves They provide good protection they go on easily and wrap tight They provide faster and better protection than conventional wraps It is easy to learn how to get them off and on quickly Follow the instructions that comes with them and it becomes second nature in no time at all I think that the velco cross wraps on the back of the glove could be designed better They don t add a lot to the glove support and they don t connect very well But even without them this is a great product that I can readily recommend 
4 0 Easy Fast but don t last too long This is certainly a convenient alternative to wraps but the neoprene seems to break down too quickly As a level of support and protection under speed bag gloves I think they re great but as a layer under full 12 oz bag gloves I prefer wraps these make the whole show too bulky and uncomforatble Recommended for a good quick workout but I think they also run a bit small I have average to small hands and the Mediums are too tight for me 
5 0 Great Product but I paid less than 60 with a 25 off coupon These poles are great The carbide tips grip rocks and slippery surfaces surprisingly well The shock absorbers work very nicely and you can tell they help with the wear and tear on my body The monopod function is very nice I ve gotten some great group photos with it and I don t have to carry a separate tripod Get these when they go on sale 
5 0 the best nose clip I use a nose clip for swimming and this one is the only that doesn t came off in the first three or four strokes like the the other ones i ve tried unfortunately they don t sell it in my country anymore so i have to use amazon 
4 0 comfy and effective I used these nose clips when diving for sponges off the coast of Belize I was able to wear them for over two hours without discomfort Not a drop of water in my nose My only complaint is that the color is unattractive 
5 0 The nose clips of choice for modified SLD For reasons that are obscure a fair number of people lose weight if they use nose clips No one is sure why but for the people who are using SLD methods including nose clips this brand of nose clip is the nose clip of choice So far there are about forty people experimenting with nose clips and for what it is worth they seem to be losing weight best with speedo I m nonplussed by it but if you are browsing around for SLD method weight loss and have come to this advertisement you ve found the nose clips on Amazon that everyone else bought 
5 0 These do work well As a syncronized swimmer I have used almost all of the brands of noseplugs out there These are the best that I have found They stay on when your upside down jumping in and out of the water and even usually stay on when i get hit in the face I ve never had a problem with these they keep the water out very well and stay on tight If they are too tight or too lose just bend it a little bit to fit 
4 0 useful for new swimmers like me It is very useful for new learners like me But I feel it may get loose with time going on 
4 0 Sturdy and easy to install this is my first bike mount rack I was a bit worry about the strength and the installation But it s quite easy to install and it s seem very sturdy It doesn t bounce at all Highly Recommended 
5 0 Wow great product When you consider all the steps to assemble it it s actually very simple I get easily frustrated with instructions and these were pretty good The product is solid I use it on a 2001 Chrysler Town and Country and have no problems Even though it says not to do so I m able to open my tailgate with it attached I use it with 2 adult bikes 1 kid s bike and 1 bike trailer the 1 wheel type that hook on the back of an adult bike I looked hard for the right 4 bike mount rack and I m overjoyed with this one Now if I can just move from LA to a safer place before someone steals my bikes from my rack while we re in In n Out 
4 0 It s Ok This product is ok if you do not mind what the color is because I had thought it was going to be bright orange but it turns out to be dark green black Also hope you won t get bad luck as I did because when my package came the BB s were everywhere in the box 
5 0 Awesome This is a great buy for the price It is a great deal It shipped well and came in nice bottles without any scrathches or signs of wear and tear I will definitely buy again 
5 0 Better than expected These are some nice bb s from CYMA They are nicely polished and have a neon yellow look to them rather than the dull golden yellow bb s found other places This is a great price but after shipping it s not so great Definitly get these if you are already making a puchase from hotimporttoys anyway 
5 0 These are awesome pellets These pellets shot really good They don t jam your gun This is great gift for low price or just if you need awesome bb s buy these 
5 0 Very Smart Cycle Trainer I purchased this cycleops a few months back and just love it It is perfect for winter bike riding and fits right in my bedroom It is not heavy nor is it hard to put together I am not a professional biker I just do it for a little exercise This is as good as going out and buying a exercise bike but much cheaper 
5 0 A great ride during the cool weather I just got my CycleOps Mag indoor trainer this week and got my first ride in tonight I have only been riding for about 6 months but I am at a point where when I dont ride I just dont feel good With the days getting shorter and cooler getting time to ride after work was becoming impossible Add to that after school activities for the kids and there just wasnt enough time in the day I figure this will allow me to get some ride time in during the evenings without having to rush other activities Plus I can still ride on the weekends if the weather is bad Setup was easy The bike fits well I have a Bianchi road bike and feels stable The adjustable resisitance allows me to ride at a good pace and get a good ride in while watching my favorite shows on the Tivo All in all I am completely satisfied with the trainer and recommend it as a way to stay in shape during the cold weather months 
4 0 Great football BLEMISHED This is an awesome football for a 6 to 12 year old Smaller than a junior ball so little hands can hold on to it and throw it My only gripe is that it is Blemished I had no indication from the seller that it would be similar to an X OUT golf ball Of course my kid doesn t know the difference so no big deal 
4 0 Youth Footballs Footballs were usable and in excellent condition They were used in our Superbowl in which our 9 yr old team won 20 0 and finished the season 12 0 The footballs were blemished and were not advertised that way The balls were a value at the price 
5 0 Hell ya When the claws arrived I was speachless They are even better in person than by photo They arrived sharp enough to barely cut butter but some time with a good sharpener will solve that I m so glad I got them 
5 0 Like floating on a cloud I use the mattress on a Camp Time roll a cot which is the best cot around because it doesn t have end bars This mattress makes the whole setup like floating on a cloud I think I ll spend most of my time while camping in bed instead of fishing It rolls up pretty big though The straps work well to make a good bedroll I bought som 30 inch duffels to use as a storage sack for extra protection 
5 0 For camping with a bad back My wife and I have a problem We both like camping but we both have back problems This product allows us to get a decent night s sleep in a tent which means we can camp more Yeah it s one more thing to have to pack but it rolls up nice and fits just fine in the back of our jeep with our tent and sleeping bags I wouldn t get this product if you are a minimalist it s pretty bulky and it s too big to hike with However if you go camping like we do then why settle for the smaller and slimmer Therm a Rest models If you have a bad back and like to go camping it is the only way to go outside of getting an inflatable mattress too bulky needs electricity or just buying an RV which isn t camping at all 
5 0 Bands for health I teach group exerciese and in my opinion these are the better type of bands to use They are flexible and they dont hurt when you tie them around body parts like the tubing does Mar 
5 0 Great option for strength training I was introduced to Theraband by a physical therapist as a way to strengthen my back muscles Six months later I m still doing the exercises and have found more by visiting the Theraband website The exercises have helped my back pain and they seem to be helping core strength as well They re easy to do and the bands are completely portable They come in graduated stiffness so you can increase the resistance as you get stronger 
4 0 Great product to exercise anywhere I got this band to add to my strength routine and have been very pleased with it The band came quickly and has proved very durable so far It is very versatile allowing you to add a lot of different moves It is so small and lightweight I can pack it and be ready to do some strength training whenever and wherever I travel I thought when I bought the band it said it would come with some recommended exercises however no instructions were included That is only a small negative knocked off the 5th star as you can easily look up exercises on line or in exercise books and DVDs 
5 0 What it says it is This is what it says it is and at a good price free shipping to boot 
5 0 Hard to fit in Texas The Bell Triton is the first helmet that I ve owned that truly fits me For 25 years in the Air Force I had to special order uniform hats The base clothing sales never carried my size I consider the Triton to be the best fitting head cover I ve ever owned Thanks much 
5 0 Fantastic for those of us with ginormous heads I have a very large head so buying hats and helmets is nearly impossible FYI One size fits all is a line that has taunted me my whole adolescent adult life This helmet though fits great and was about a third the price of the other oversized helmets I found in the bike shops around Boston I d recommend it to all of my friends out there with embarrassingly large heads 
4 0 Golf Shoe Bag Package arrived in good condition and timley Everything was as advertised The bag works well and is easy to use I am sure there are better simliar products but at a much higher cost 
5 0 I love this rack I am totally happy with this rack I have a nice lightweight road bike that I don t want to clutter with a fixed rack but I wanted to have the capability to carry some extra gear or run some errands when I felt like it This rack is PERFECT for that I am impressed with the high quality material and welds and the quick release function works great I just did a 40 mile ride to Costco and stocked up with a rack trunk fits perfectly on the Delta rack under my saddle full of vitamins etc The rack was rock solid and vibration free The tag that comes with the rack actually states a carry capacity of 40 lbs vs the 25 mentioned here but I would be a bit wary of that much load Very high quality nice lightweight rack with super easy on and off mounting Five stars all the way for my purposes 
5 0 Great Product All that I can say about this product is wow I go to the gym 4 times a week but I know that everyone out there has those days when they just don t want to work out or are too lazy to get over to the gym With this product all wories are scratched out because you can get a good simple workout at home in minutes The resistance on something of this size is absolutely incredible I use the heavy tube and it feels as if there is at least 25 30 pounds of resistance You can increase this by standing on the tube closer to yourself and the weight practically doubles You can modify it and put it in different places in order to get different workouts This is one of the best choices I have made in the fitness category in a very long time I recommend this to everyone out there who is looking to keep their pockets full and have an alternative for going to the gym on those lazy days This is all together a great buy 
5 0 It s a nice Don t pay any more or any less for a mat This is all the comfort you need right here I m 6 4 and have no problem using this mat 
5 0 Very pleased with this durable mat We ve had this mat for over six years and we have a big family so it has stood up to a lot of use and abuse From somersaults and much jumping to use as a mattress for sleepovers the mat still looks good and performs great We received our mat as a gift from Grandma who thought it would come in handy for our homeschool physical education program and she was right For years it fit under our couch when folded until needed and until we changed couches We strongly recommend this hardy mat 
5 0 I love this This is by far my favorite water bottle I love the choices of color the ease with which you can drink without spilling anything on yourself and the size is perfect Even when it s full this bottle isn t too heavy which has been my problem with other bottles The little handle makes it easy to carry and I definately recommend this In fact since I recieved it for my birthday at the end of July three of my friends have decided to get their own and they are all equally pleased 
5 0 A thorough total body stretch program for all fitness levels Although Cathe Friedrich is well known for her more challenging advanced workouts Stretch Max is equally suited for both beginners and the advanced and very easy to follow along Divided into three roughly 20 minute stretch sessions the workouts can either be combined divided on seperate days after a cardio or strength training session or done on rest days The first part uses only a mat while the second part uses a stability ball and the third uses a resistance band The third session is probably my favorite because using the resistance band further helps in achieving range of motion and increasing flexibility The workout itself is a fluid and seemless interweaving of athletic stretches and basic yoga poses which allow the exerciser to modify according to their own range of motion and level of flexibility The music also wonderfully compliments the workout which is mostly a mix of new age neo classical and light chill I also thought the pastel pink and brown outfits that Cathe and the other girls were wearing were so cute and feminine now I need to find me one While frequent and thorough stretching is often overlooked it is an essential part of fitness which aids the muscles in faster recovery helps to protect from injury and in maintaining a youthful body Stretch Max is one of the best stretch programs I ve done and I d highly recommend it to anyone of all fitness levels You can watch a preview of it at collagevideo dot com Rating Excellen 
5 0 For my grandson on his birthday Very surprised at the quality and finish of bike After a little tuning the bike is a perfect mate for my grandson and has saved me quite a bit of money In two or three years if he will ride I ll invest in a top line road bike for him Thanks Amazon GMC 
4 0 Denali Bike for 11 year old My son really likes it it s a good starter bike for him to road ride though it is a bit heavy by road bike standards again starter bike pricing was key here I wanted him to be able to try road biking as it s not that popular and bikes for his size 4 10 or so that are under 500 are hard to find I wish the tires were a tiny bit more slick they re hybrid road tires which means they have more grip than road tires but not as much as Mountain bike tires the gears made it look cool to him it s got a water bottle cage and handlebar mounted brakes shifting which made him feel like he had a cool bike like my more expensive road bike 
4 0 Great for the money Can not beat the value of this starter road bike for kids Being a new bike I expected it to be better set up but the brakes and wheels need attention prior to riding it Better bikes out there but for 2 3 times as much 
5 0 Ride nice for less We ordered this bike for our son not sure of his committment level to riding After spending thousands on our road bikes we were very impressed with the quality of this bike It looks like we spent alot and the it rides great If you are thinking about biking this is a great start 
4 0 easy to get a sharp accurate edge The CD shows how to easily sharpen just about everything with an edge I ve just begun with my very dull knives and found they will need a bit of work with the medium sharpening stone I thought about getting a coarse stone to make things go quicker but after I get them sharp I m never going to let them get this dull again For a moderately dull knife this simple device will make it razor sharp with just a little effort I m excited to get my scissors in shape and never thought i d be able to put an new edge on my potato peeler 
5 0 A Cheap Sharp Knife is better than a dull High Quality Knife I am a knife collector even bought several sharpening systems This is the best Drawing the blade at the proper angle across the sharpening surface is the first important thing Spyderco makes that easy because the holder sets the stones at the proper angle and all you do is hold the blade vertical and draw it down across the two sides Once you realize how easy getting the edge you learn to feel the edge with your finger to tell which side the edge has a minute burre overhang Then one gentle draw down that side to straighten the burre and you have a blade that is really sharp Cheaper steel knives will not hold their edge as long as better ones With this sharpener it is so easy that even your cheaper knives will be almost as useful say in the kitchen because it is so easy to resharpen This sharpener will make you an expert if you give it a little practice I even under sharpen some knives because they hold their edge better when it is a little thicker rather than razor sharp which has a thinner edge Thorough instructions explain how to sharpen many different edges too like bread knives serrated scissors Japanese blades one sided fish hooks etc 
5 0 Best Sharpener I Have Ever Used Spyderco sharpener and hone is a wonderful tool I own several stones and a couple of other sharpening gadgets but nothing has put an edge on my knives like the Spyderco Like many I am sure I was a skeptic but after following the instructional video my fishing and kitchen knives are now razor sharp much sharper than new Thanks so much 
5 0 Amazing what it can do i just got that yesterday i sharppened my Ka Bar D2 knife and used it to shave the hair of my face literally if it can do that with D2 steel so enough sai 
5 0 Foolproof Sharpener The Spyderco Tri Angle sharpener is the best I ve owned It is thoughfully designed with all components storing neatly in the carrying case It is essentially a crock stick sharpener on steroids No clamping of blades no holding blades at odd angles If you can hold a knife blade vertical you can put a sharp edge on any knife It will also do scissors and other tools but for most people it will primarily be used on knives Although the manufacturer recommends using the flat side of the stones I am always in a hurry and so prefer the more agressive cutting of the edge There are lots of cheaper sharpeners but this is a quality product built to last a lifetime One word of advice when you are finished sharpening all the kitchen knives put a note on the counter cautioning your spouse It might prevent needless nicks or worse 
5 0 Great results for a complete beginner All my knives used to be in various levels of dull Hopelessly dull knives were left sitting in a drawer After doing a little bit of research I decided to give the Spyderco a shot I m very satisfied with the results I am not trying to compare my knife sharpening skills to that of a professionals results but I can say that my knives are much sharper and cut very well now The DVD and instructions were very helpful and got me up to speed quickly The Spyderco is easy to use and it sets up quickly I no longer have an excuse to have a dull knife 
5 0 Sharpens the way you think a knife sharpener should First off let me say that I was a little skeptical of the performance of this set Every review I read was near perfect if not perfect My mother has a 150 electric sharpener and I didn t feel that a 45 sharpener could be that good I got it today My coveted Wusthof blades were losing their edge and suddenly they seemed less attractive I am not a pro nor have I spent a significant amount of time sharpening anything substancial My knives are now sharper than when I purchased them No kidding I m running around the house looking for things to sharpen From what I can tell this is almost a perfect system for what it does It sharpens just about everything that doesn t have a blunt end or major nick gouge The thing I loved most was the control of the system which you just don t get from electric sharpeners You can put as sharp or as dull an edge you d like on your blade depending on the task and depending on what type of cutting tool it is You can tell it works as in any other sharpening activity because there is less frictional noise and resistance as you increase the amount of sharpening strokes The dvd and manual make learning the whole process really easy if you aren t already in the know My mother s 150 electric sharpener never put an edge on my knives or her knives like the one I have now In fact I m confident that if you were to give me a blind test a pepsi challenge if you will between two knives with my mom s sharpener and the spyderco I would bet anyone that I could pick the spyderco every single time The stones appear to be very high quality and seem to be extremely hard I don t foresee needing new stones for quite a while but even if I did I can buy them separately I m cutting my vegetables and almost forgot how dull most people including myself allow their allow their knives to get before sharpening them having them sharpened or throwing them away I wish knives really never did lose their edge like in those cheesy knife cutting can infomercials but the reality is unless you like throwing away money you re gonna have to sharpen them sooner or later Buy this sharpener Buy this sharpener do yourself a favor buy this sharpener 
5 0 Love my skates I ordered these skates for myself and I love them Chicago still maintains the good name they had some 5 years ago when I use to skate Thanks 
5 0 It works Pain in your heel when you wake up Fix it with this product It worked for me 
5 0 worth the money I had most of Leaderbetter s golf videos in VHS but I still think it s worth it The reason is that some computer animation or graphics help me to understand the difference which is better than his old videos 
5 0 excellent grip This is the best heavy grip series I ve used I m a college weightlifter and tennis player My coach from both teams have strongly recoomended them to me I m really happy now I can crush your hand right away 
4 0 Perfect for price I was pleased with how promptly the jo arrived after I ordered it The finish on the staff was not something I desired plus it was a little rough so I sanded the staff down and oiled it It is heavier than the practice staffs at my dojo and I enjoy that When I brought in my staff everyone remarked what a great staff it was where I bought it and how much it was Best purchase I ve made in a while just needs some sanding 
4 0 A Pretty Awesome Airsoft Gun I recently got this gun for Christmas and I liked it a lot There was only a couple things that I didn t like about this gun 1 It doesn t shoot that fast and it doesn t hurt if you re trying to have an airsoft war 2 You have to press down the safety every time you want to shoot it 3 It s pretty bulky I really liked this gun as a first airsoft gun and I hope you will too 
4 0 Desert Eagles kick a i am not familiar with this desert eagle but a friend of mine purchased a spring loaded 1 I was able to shoot him in the face from about 30ft away unintentionally The gun is a little big n bulky but is pretty accurate 
5 0 Good Gun I ve had this gun for a while now and i am very happy with it It is worth the money and I ll tell you the pros and cons Pros 1 It is electric so it good for shooting fast my cousin pulls the trigger fast enough to make it like a fully automatic macheine gun 2 It doesnt hurt so bad so if ur younger it is better 3 It never once jammed on me 4 Is accurate to about 40feet 5 It is on sale for onl 20 6 I ve beaten my friends with only this against a fully automatic m16 Cons 1 Takes a long time to charge 2 Battery runs out in about 2 3 hours where a spring has no battery 3 flashlight is pointless and hard to get on i would get this as a first gu 
5 0 good backup this gun doesnt hurt at all its a pain to load unless you get a speed loader then it takes 5 seconds this is a perfect backup wepon when your reloding your gun it shoots fast but curves a lot overall this is a good gu 
4 0 Nice product I like it Nice Hold 19 more golf balls than my old one 
5 0 Excellent All Around The product is great as well as the service My shipment came very quickly and I was tremendously pleased all the way aroun 
5 0 Comfortable feel with a powerful sound As a football referee I needed a whistle that will cut through the loudest crowd noise No other whistle does it quite like the Fox 40 It has a shrill piercing sound at 115 decibels The problem came with me chewing through my whistles When Fox 40 came out with their CMG whistle this problem was corrected This is the most comfortable whistle I ve used I wouldn t use anything else 
5 0 The most comfortable whistle How many times have you crunched thru your whistle and played the game wondering if you swallowed the little pieces that broke off let alone if you are going to chip a tooth This is the most comfortable whistle going 
4 0 PlayCoed Recommends PlayCoed is the largest network of sports organizers and provides a free service that allows people to plan less and play more The Mikasa 10 Playground Ball is used by PlayCoed clients such as Auraria Campus Western Alternative Sports Association Denver Sport and Social Club Big Brothers Big Sisters Miami Sport and Social Club and more This ball is great quality Do not leave it in the sun as it has a tendency to warp however is still an excellent product 
5 0 looks good I had it assemble in about 20 min Took another 20 min more to adjust the door to open square I had broken two clips that hold the shelves trying to assemble it Call coustomer serves who found the clip mail them over night for me great job Golfsmith I am very happy with the golf rack Now I never loose all my golf equiment 
4 0 quality product We used this for the first time this summer The bag held up well during 600+ miles of interstate driving It did let some water through during the rain but not real bad Be sure to pack your items in plastic bags if they re predicting rain or go for the more expensive waterproof Thule bags This is much more convenient than the big plastic cargo boxes since it folds up so small goes in it s own carry bag and fits on the closet shelf It also goes on the vehicle quickly with four straps Very easy to use 
4 0 Overall a very nice ramp In my lifetime I have probably built about 14 halfpipes and at least 25 quarterpipes The problem is that I live in Ohio and the weather ruins them every year I prefer a quarterpipe because it is not too obtrusive and you have more time to prepare for tricks One of the biggest challenges of making a good quarterpipe is getting the bottom sheet to lie flat on the riding surface especially after a few rainfalls has warped the wood I was hesistant to buy this ramp because I had never physically seen it I had watched videos and read some reviews but the reviews did not really give mouch specific info hopefully this one will The ramp is a 9 foot radius and is a bit under 3 feet high Although this sounds kind of weak it actually is a fun ramp The curve is deceptive If you look at each panel they almost look flat but when you ride it you get a nice lift Its not vertical but you can do airs The transisition gets you to about 70 degrees and the coping is excellent It is metal and fairly burly Lip tricks are very fun on this ramp The material of the ramp is an ABS type plastic it will not rot I leave my ramp out in the rain No issues at all on the ramp although there is some rust on the coping I may need to rpaint it but if you grind daily it takes care of it I am a big skater I am 6 1 and over 220lbs This ramp holds me with ease It has never slid and I can drop it do rock n rolls 50 50s and ollies The ramp does give a bit on landing but has not changed its original form The top deck is rather small but it can support 500 lbs and allows for lap over grinds The bottom of the ramp is a formed piece of metal which allows for a smooth start to the ramp I love that The ramps seems a bit abrupt at first but you get use to it So here are the pluses and minuses PLUS Can be easily taken down and folded away in winter or set up in basement The riding surfcae is fast and smooth You can link more than 1 ramp together fairly seamlessly Metal support is top notch and all connections are welded on So much nicer than wood transitions with screws The surface to ramp piece is excellent very smooth It loks professional I live in a nice neighborhood I peeled off the FRESHPARK logo and it looks a lot less obtrusive from the road MINUS expensive I bought 2 not very wide One unit is only 4 feet wide I bought two and hooked them together to form an 8 foot wide ramp When I just rode the 4 footer it was not so fun not a lot of room Adding the second ramp made it a who new experience more room and rock solid the wheels it rolls on are complete garbage I cannot believe how they skimped on this I will be looking to replace them They are plastic and have no bearings will not take any abuse For 400 a piece you think they would give you quality wheels The ramp is loud As much as I love the bottom piece of metal that allows for a smooth transition it can make a LOUD clanging noise after repeated rides I don t really mind it but I am not sure if my neighbors are thrilled by it Heavy This is good and bad It is very solid which is awesome but when it is folded up and on its wheels it is very heavy 150lbs It tips easier than it should If a child had this fall on him it would not be good Unlikeley but I had it tilt a few times as I moved it I was strong enough to correct it but a kid could have problems Potential theft I think they should provide a bar that you can attach and lock so that nobody can fold it up and take it from your driveway I have to bolted together with 3 major bolts so a theif would have to work to get it but if you only have a 4 footer and leave it outside it would take minutes to steal I love the ramp I looked for a LONG time for a ramp that would allow me to skate whenever I wanted but would not require me to rebuild every year A good quarterpipe costs about 200 to make You have to relaminate every year and paint etc This was by far the best solution once I rationalized I would skate it for many years Those plastic ramps are total garbage I never even considered them I hope that answers any questions about the ramp Bottom line is that it costs a lot of money but it is the best value if you want this type of ramp 
5 0 Best purchase I ever made I am the mother of a 13 year old boy skater The quarter pipe from FreshPark works great He loves it and so do all of his skater friends I was hesitant to spend so much money but so far it has been worth every cent The quarter pipe is made very well it is sturdy and safe Although it is heavy it is not too heavy to drag out of my garage onto my driveway and then back into my garage every day Although my son loves the city skatepark this has proven to be a good substitute when I cannot drive him there I highly recommend this I have never tried to fold it up so I cannot comment on the ease of that 
5 0 looks awesome and works great in their video I am 11 years old and a hardcore skater I have been begging my parents to buy me this for quite some time and they finally said that if I do good in my spanish lessons then I can get it I have seen their video on their website and it works great Plus the fact that it has detachable wheels and it folds up makes it probably the best quarter pipe on the market The only drawback is the cost I can understand why it is that much but if you buy 2 and make a half pipe that s bucks I highly reccomend this but ONLY for skaters who have been to an actual skatepark and have experienced a quarter pipe AND a half pipe P S I dont think this is made for BMX so you probably shouldn t try going on it with your BXM bike 
5 0 good product i was worried because it was cheap but it works well i did jumprope last night to 
4 0 Great bang for the buck I bought this 2 man tent to use while backpacking It sets up in a hurry is very durable and is very light for a 2 man tent I generally backpack with one of my kids and this will hold two of us plus a change of clothes and our small gear with no problem There are two doors which is great so that we don t have to climb over each other to get out of the tent Outside each door is a small vestibule which is a great place to put your shoes to keep them dry The tent poles 2 are aluminum and they are very strong and light I also like the fact that this tent is free standing Once you get it set up you can move it around easily if you re not happy with the location This is a great backpacking tent for the money It will hold two people with just a few things comfortably or one person with all your gear comfortably There are lighter tents out there but you ll pay for them 
4 0 Kayaking Without Blisters I always get a blister on my thumb if I paddle over an hour These gloves solve the problem The one thing I didn t like was that the fingers were a little long and stiff They do the job 
5 0 Get a grip Great gloves Never lose my hold on the paddle even when my hands are wet Comfortable too not too warm And a great deal 
5 0 Thule 926xt works great costs less and is versatile We ordered our rack for a Pathfinder but it works great on our Miata too That s really close to being universal Easy to mount easy to load unload bikes easy to take off The no sway brackets do their job well and everything sits secure and safe Half the price of hitch mounts without the cost of the hitch I just have to figure a lock system so they can t rip and run with the whole rack 
5 0 The best car rack I ve tried Recently decided to replace my old Rhode Gear rack clasps were rusted Tried the Saris Bones 3 horrible Returned it to the store the next day Very difficult to get the bikes on and off Now purchased the Thule 962XT from Eastern Mountain Sports 104 on a 20 discount special This is a beautiful piece of equipment Well made solid easy to set up and holds three bikes very securely The no sway mechanism works well this seems to be the primary upgrade from the earlier 962 version which now retails for about 105 without discount and keeps the bikes at a slight angle away from the car The bikes sit very firmly in place Still need to secure the front wheels of the bikes with the supplied cynch cord I prefer to use long pieces of velcro Great product A definite buy 
4 0 PERFECT After much research we purchased the Jeep Commando TJ12 for our soon to be four year old son Well worth every penny We wanted a well made bike that would last and found it Our son loves his new big boy bike and we love it s safety features ex the padding on the bar as well as the weight of the bike A good choice 
5 0 Very sturdy but bring your tools This is a great bike for our 3 5 year old son Just a word of warning make sure you have lots of thin wrenches bike tools otherwise this will need to be assembled at a bike shop My husband thankfully kept all his tools from his bike shop days otherwise it would have cost us a bunch to have it put together A great bike not at all cheap looking or feeling my son loves it 
4 0 Fine while wearing it but a little difficult to adjust controls For the price this is a good carrier It fits snugly and comfortably on my arm and the adjustable elastic strap is well padded so the player will stay tight and comfortable on your arm without being shaken around a lot even if you are running or doing other vigorous aerobic activities I use it at the gym for both weightlifting and cardio exercises and have had no problems with it slipping off or being uncomfortable It has a little side flap that lets you coil up the earphone cord when not in use and secure it beneath the flap with a velcro fastener which is very convenient Another plus is that I have used it with both the iPod and a Creative Zen Micro which is slightly larger and it fits both fine One significant drawback as another reviewer noted is that the plastic cover over the player is thick and not held tightly against the player so adjusting the controls on your MP3 player is difficult If I want to switch tracks or playlists or adjust the volume I often end up having to pull the player out of the carrier to do so before sticking it back in 
5 0 best frame mount pump so far While this pump may be heavier than you want if you are a weight weenie it is a great performer perfectly suited for long tours and tandems It is a little large to mount on some frames but great when you need it It works so well you ll be tempted to stop and help others that may be struggling by the side of the road 
5 0 The Pump Wars are Over Topeak Road Morph Wins Pros RELIABLE floor pump features in a frame pump size hose relieves stem snapping Cons potential over pressure due to ease of use but hurt me with this one This Thanksgiving I rode the 75 miles to the relatives Six flats later and four stops for filing slow leakers I was only an hour late The Topeak Road Morph was the only reason I made it at all I have tried and tested almost all the small frame pumps on the market Some don t work at all when you need them and some are best at snapping stems Few get the high pressure in the tire The Topeak Road Morph clearly is the winner in my book The Topeak RM is the perfect blend of floor pump and light frame pump Where I ride I have to have the reliability of a good pump and the Topeak RM is the only one I will use Tip Before your next long distance or solo ride get a Topeak RM If you don t get one for Christmas go buy one You will thank your lucky stars when it performs when you need it 
5 0 Big Bobber Cooler Wins High Marks I purchased Big Bobber Coolers as gifts for two fisherman and they both loved them They were a hit And they REALLY float Great gift idea for the fishermen boaters in your life 
5 0 Great Floating Gift This FLOATING cooler that looks like a fishing bobber is durable It s made out of high impact plastic and it s insulation keeps your beverages cold I mostly have used mine in the lake during the Summer as well as barbeques 
5 0 cheap functional wireless for 20+ its a wow working fine w no problem im not just sure how long the battery on the wireless xmitter will las 
5 0 I like it I am still learning swimming now I do not like water entering my ears I like this product 
5 0 lights up the night this light is expensive even when bought at a discount but is worth it for the opportunity it provides to ride relatively safely at night i also use it for working beneath my cars although it s much better suited for the bike i have had no problems whatsoever with the light so far i initially thought i had a defective battery but that was not the case you need to carefully follow the instructions on charging as you may have to unplug the charger and plug it back in occasionally 
4 0 Another Great Starter Weapon Yet More to be Desired I bought this little tyke for my little brother for Christmas and he loves it It s Glock 26 compact design allows for easy use for people of smaller hands which is the case for my little brother not so much in my case since I m over 6 5 The red dot on top is for the most part pure asthetics although it can be tweaked to be fairly accurate up to 30 feet the common effective accurate range of airsoft pistols IMO although it s FPS is not entirely impression Don t get me wrong it ll still get your attention if you get hit but it s range is limited compared to others The silencer supressor is pure asthetics but it actually serves as a stabilizer rifling for the rounds I tried 10 shots with the supressor on and off and found I was more accurate with it on could be personal preference or not but it is worth exploring As for the magazine capacity most state regulations on real sidearms place it at 10 rounds so this actually serves two purposes A it promotes accuracy and making them count shots as opposed to random Rambo shooting that many weekend warriors adhere to and B allows adults to teach novices and children firearm safety I would recomend using this airsoft pistol as a trainer for children hoping to use real firearms especially for parents As for it breaking easily my little brother takes it out bashes it around and shoots it frequently and so far no problems Perhaps I m just extremely lucky A few words of caution though do not go rambo with this and keep shooting and shooting All firearms not just airsoft have limits of how much strain the internal mechanisms can take If you continually shoot it without stopping don t be surprised if the internal parts break Make your shots count be concise If you want an airsoft handgun that has a better continuous firing rate get a CO2 powered sidearm but be ready to shell out more coin All in all a dandy weapon for the price but if you want quality be ready to get what you pay for 
4 0 not that great but will do slow not cool as shown but its good for little kids that are starters to use by the way great serice recomended grea 
5 0 super sick pistol For the price its the best pistol i ever bought pros good fps nice laser cool scilencer and also a good gun cons flash lite sucks It is over all the best gun for the pric 
1 0 Worthless HA This is the most disgraceful weapon I have yet to encounter Sure the mock suppressor and the sight and the laser are good features but the gun is weak and the magazine holds a meager 10 BBs I have very high standards and this gun met none of them It broke within 3 weeks of purchase But it is a pretty good backyard gun but it is nothing compared to the pro level airsoft pistols Should not be used as a side arm in pro level airsoft battles Good for backyard fights though 
4 0 Decent Poker Chips I got these for our game down at the VFW and I m delightfully surprised at the quality and feel of these chips They are not cheaply made as I suspected The design is very basic you are not going to WOW anyone with these However if you are looking for a great poker chip that has the right weight and feel then these are a must buy They hold up well under high usage and they make the great clinking sound of higher end poker chips The only flaw I have found is the case It is a very very cheap case I will probably buy a better case and give this one to my 5 year old son to play with 
4 0 BB goal is fine hassle to fill with sand Good overall took quite a while to put together and needed two people Getting enough sand to make it stable took a long time with a funnel 
4 0 my review i thought this product was very good but i think it is way too expensive people who would like to hav this product cant hav it coz it costs more money than they hav to spend i think it would sell better if it costed less and if this website was advertised more as i only recently found out that it exists bye 
5 0 Lasts a Lifetime Although I don t own this specific hoop I have owned a lifetime hoop just like this one for over ten years and there s nothing rusting or breaking off The only thing I had to replace is the net Even though it s not the biggest hoop with a breakaway rim it would last much longer and withstand decades of use If you re looking for an economic hoop for the beginner basketball player buy this hoop 
4 0 A good quality basketball goal This basketball goal is a good value for the money It is sturdy and relatively easy to put together my wife did it in under 2 hours though I should mention she is mechanically inclined With nothing in the base I can carry it It also has wheels on the base for portability I filled the base up with a hose to anchor it It was very easy to fill with a hose So far the goal has stood up well to some rough play including lots of dunks Here are the three negatives 1 the backboard is a little small 2 As mentioned in the product description the base takes up a lot of area There is no getting around this It s a tradeoff for making it portable 3 Even at the lowest setting 7 ft it s too high for my 7 year old daughter even with one of the smaller basketballs It takes almost all her strength to make a basket I plan to get around the height problem by getting a soccer ball or something lighter for her to shoot with She is not very strong so if you have a strong 7 year old it should be fine If I had it to do over again I would probably get one of the cheaper smaller goals but this one is made well enough so it will still be around when my daughter is strong enough to easily shoot at a 7 ft goal 
4 0 Good purchase This is my second Blackburn Delphi 5 0 Bicycle Cyclometer I liked so much the first one which I purchased in summer 2006 that I got a second one So far it has been easy to install to use and has been reliable My only critique would be that the part that goes on the spoke could be improved so that it would be more solid 
4 0 Nice cyclometer The Delphi 5 0 is an excellent overall cyclocomputer I found that the heart rate monitor functions more reliably that the Polar that I replaced and the cadence function is a nice addition although the cord to the cadence sensor takes some pursuasion to string it to its destination on the chain stay The indicator is VERY easy to read and has plenty of functionality I ve used mine for about a year and have been quite pleased 
4 0 glad I bought it This well priced 3 wheeler is excellent on pavement grass and gravel It takes potholes well and seems quite sturdy It s not for use in stores or tight spaces as the turning radius is quite wide The harness is the only thing I don t like about this stroller it s very difficult to fasten around a squirmy baby and the straps are not particularly adjustable 
4 0 Everlast Heavy Bag Stand Speed Bag The Heavy Bag Speed Bag stand is a good piece of equipment The heavy bag part of it definitely requires add l weight hint bags of sand are much cheaper than the amount of barbell plates you ll need to keep this thing from moving I use 200 pounds of bags of sand to keep it in place I was able to get these for about 2 50 a piece from Home Depot Also be sure you get a double end heavy bag too i e one with a bottom D ring otherwise you ll get too much bag swing Try to get a heavy bag with a foam liner Some of the cheaper bags are like punching a rock which won t do wonders for your workout enthusiasm You can also put a true double end light bag on this portion of the unit which is a nice change of pace from the heavy bag The light double end bag is the small inflatable that has two bungees holding it at about chest level and reverberates like mad when you hit it It will occasionally smack the center support which makes a lot of noise but otherwise has no ill effects The speed bag platform is a bit flimsy especially on the earlier versions of this model where the drum or rebound board is two pieces the latest versions of this model use a single piece drum If you become moderately proficient at the speed bag in any amount of time you ll outgrow this aspect of the unit Part of the problem is that the single vertical pole to which the speedbag drum attaches will flex when you get the bag moving really fast and that can throw off your timing Use the smallest size speed bag possible to minimize this inertia Lastly the speed bag platform doesn t really adjust high enough for people over 6 2 in height and if you re over 6 1 or so you re going to need to use a small or xtra small speed bag to have it hang at the correct height i e belly of bag at mouth chin level 
4 0 A little too long and light I m 6 1 and this jump rope was too long for me to use It was easily shortened by popping off the end cap on one handle removing a few beads then cutting and re knotting the rope My only complaint is that it s a little too light for me If the beads were a little heavier it would be perfect It does seem well made and well worth the price 
5 0 Great Size Great Work Out I use stability ball training on a daily basis but I m rather petite so finding a stability ball that is small enough to be comfortable is kind of hard sometimes The GoFit Exercise ball comes in the size I need and it is strong enough that it won t wear out after six months of use like previous stability balls have I love it 
5 0 Great product I ve been using this product for nearly 1 month now and I absolutely love it Along with healthful eating this DVD is great for losing weight I have already lost about 7 lbs I recommend this product to everyone 
5 0 Koosh Fun I love my Koosh ball I use it as stress relief at work This is a must have for the office I got 2 of them in fact but my GF stoll the other one 
5 0 Perfect Toy for all Ages Recommend for all kind of ages Really buy it and enjoy i 
5 0 Batter UP After going through a number of cheaply made batting Ts I stumbled across this one This is the one sanctioned version by the T ball Assn of American and it s sturdy and well built Our T ball team uses this version it games It may cost a few pennies more than cheep WalMart versions but it is well worth the price You ll be handing this down to cousins and friends that s how well it s built The friction fit rubber pipes are perfect for adjusting to different little batters swings Go ahead and swing at this pitch you won t regret it 
4 0 Spider Man Skate Board This is a good find for 15 and free shipping Also got the helmet and pads for the same price Will make a great birthday present for my 7 yr old grandson in March 
4 0 Good product Doesn t break the bank I have bought three over the years and they are all from Wai Lana Her workout is a different thing 
4 0 Great Mat I ve had this mat for about 6 months and I m very pleased with it As soon as I got the mat I washed it with cold water and soap and dried it out by rolling a towel in it to soak up the extra moisture then hanging it on a towel rack for a day Because my palms tend to get sweaty during practice I used this mat under another mat the first few times After a week or so I used this mat by itself The grip was great the mat stayed firmly to my palms and to the floor Make sure that the label side is up After about 6 months the mat has only gotten better it makes that sticking sound when I walk on it a sign that it s doing its job The dimensions of this mat are pretty standard 68 x 24 x 1 8 Unless you re much taller than the average person or feel that you need more support this should be fine for most people The mat also comes in a lot of great bright colors I have a light blue one that I love I highly recommend this mat to start off with for anyone who practices yoga Even if you don t go regularly it s nice to have a mat at home And it s also a good idea to bring your own mat to class even if they provide ones for you and tell you that they clean them regularly I mean come on you ve seen some of those people in your yoga class do you really want your face to be where their sweaty feet were yesterday 
4 0 Great Mat I love this mat It is very portable and easy to carry while walking between classes or travelling because it rolls up so compactly Just the right amount of padding and offers excellent grip 
5 0 A great product I really enjoy my new yoga mat and the price was so very economical I recommend this seller and the mat 
5 0 Good Mat First I will admit I am not all that knowledgeable about yoga mats This is the first one I have bought but it seems to be really good for the price It is comfortable and you won t have to worry about slipping while using this mat No complaints here 
5 0 Two Sides to All Yoga Mats Know Which Side is Up Yoga mats come in three basic thicknesses At 1 8 this mat is of average thickness At 24 x 68 it is also the standard width and length Mats that are about half a thick as this one are good for travel or placing under a thicker mat to provide more traction The thick mats 3 16 are about 50 thicker than this one and are designed for those who need or want extra cushion There are two sides to this and nearly all yoga mats Look carefully at the bumps on each side of the mat The larger bumps are designed to face upwards to cushion your hands feet and knees during poses while keeping your body from dangerously slipping out of alignment The smaller bumps are designed to face downwards to grip the floor and keep the yoga mat from sliding Many mats have a label on one end with the name of the brand This is typically but not always located on the up side The bumps will tell you for sure This yoga mat will increase in softness and stickiness with use So do most mats They start out mildly sticky and increase in stickiness the more they are used You will want to wash your mat when it first arrives so as to remove the thin film they get on their surface during the manufacturing process Instructions for washing the mat are included Once you ve washed and dried your mat you re ready to begin After using it for a while if you find the mat decreasing in stickiness each time you pull it out this is the typical sign that a light coating of dust or too much body sweat has accumulated on your mat and it needs a light hand washing with very diluted soap and water After washing roll your mat in a thick towel to squeeze out the excess water otherwise it will take forever to dry in the air Then air dry your mat unrolled inside and away from sunlight Hanging over the shower bar works nicely When you first unroll your mat you will find one end to be a bit curled Simply alternate the direction you roll your mat top outside once then bottom outside next or the end you start from curled end once flat end next time and you ll find it straightening out more or less over time I recommend buying your own yoga mat even if your yoga studio or gym provides them for you I ve worked in many studios and gyms over the years Sometimes management has mats cleaned often sometimes not If you bring your own mat you always know where it s been o Plus owning your own mat may encourage you to begin valuable practice at home For my students who have trouble with their knees in some of the poses requiring the body weight to rest on a knee I recommend temporarily folding over one end of the mat to get double cushion under the knee while still leaving one layer under the rest of the body This saves you having to haul more than one mat out each time you practice which can be discouraging especially to the beginner 
4 0 Scion xB Perfect Fit This fits my Scion xB perfectly it is a very challenging vehicle design think box and I didn t want to go with a roof rack Putting a dirty mountain bike on the roof of my nice paint job car just hurts The only con for this rack is that there is really no way to lock it to your car If someone unhooks the straps they can take your rack and bike with the bike locked to the rack 
4 0 Haven t used much but that s not the rack s fault Works great and is easy to put on and take off Exactly what is needed 
4 0 Good value Not a ton of features like higher priced models but gets the job done As easy to set up as others and not too loud either A good trainer for those starting out or looking to save a few bucks No problems to speak of 
5 0 What a workout I gotta tell ya I was a little hesitant about buying the bike trainer Would I actualy use it or would it end up in the closet Would it be TOO loud like everyone is saying Well I threw caution to the wind and bought it it didn t hurt that it was under a 100 bucks too I received the Bike Trainer in about four days had it out of the box and assembled in 8 minutes and was working up a sweat 15 minutes later I LOVE THIS THING The reviews were correct if you ve got a mountain bike with knobby tread tires it IS loud I had my Ipod maxed out and could still hear the tire spinning I was determined though I put a street tire on and it s like a whole different machine quiet and smooth and what a workout This Trainer is awesome Money well spent 
4 0 Super for the price I bought this trainer to use indoors during the San Francisco rainy winter season I thought it might be nice to just mount my own bike rather than driving to a gym somewhere and paying membership fees waiting for an available spincycle etc I am most impressed with the quality of construction and ease of use It even comes with it s own skewer so I don t have to scuff up my expensive skewer during the mounting process It s very attractive very well made and seems to work great after the first one hour test ride at least I bought a front tire leveling block as well and the combination makes a very stable platform on which to ride my own bike in my own room while watching a movie reading or listening to music What could be better and all for a measly 80 bucks I have a regular rear road tire that contacts the resistance roller and the noise factor is quite low nothing that should disturb anyone in my opinion The only improvement I could suggest would be one or two more levels of resistance this unit set at the highest level doesn t really give resistance close to what you would get climbing a hill but I got a good heart rate going and was dripping sweat It certainly will get me through those rainy days where I simply wouldn t get my bike out on the road For 80 bucks I am highly pleased 
5 0 Excellent Product I was concerned that I would regret spending less for Ascent s model as the only other bike trainer I d seen was a cheap flimsy thing that belonged to a friend My fears were misplaced The device is very solid and the noise level is less than I expected I have to raise the TV volume only a click or two above its usual level when exercising I can see no reason why one should want a more expensive trainer 
5 0 Pretty darn good This thing was pretty inexpensive for what I got It s easy to put together and every piece was included Wow I thought when I saw that they didn t forget a couple screws or bolts This often happens to me when I buy things I need to put together Anyways after doing everything I could on this thing for the past couple weeks it is still completely intact It doesn t mind when I do pull ups chin ups leg lifts push ups or when I hold onto the bottom legs when I do leg lifts on the floor It does move slightly when I do dips but it s not going anywhere I weigh 155 lbs so this thing can take some weight I think the limit is 250 lbs Other than the product being tip top I want to mention Amazon s shipping I ordered this early in April around the 3rd if I remember correctly I was supposed to get it tomorrow the 16th I got it two days after I ordered it My dog started barking and I was thinking What s wrong with her The last thing I expected to see when I looked out the window was my Ironman Power Tower Thanks Amazon for ruling 
5 0 Sturdy and reliable We recently ordered this product for the price I wasn t sure if it would be sturdy or not but it is very heavy and stable the instructions were some of the best we have seen clear and understandable for putting it together correctly A great buy for the reliability and versatility of this product 
5 0 Don t waste money on higher priced models This is it Easy to assemble and sturdy Don t waste your money on any of the higher priced models This is all you need 
4 0 Make Room For This One The Power Tower is a pretty straight forward piece of equipment There are so many variations on the activities you can do on it that it s fairly easy to keep it interesting and challenging It s a pretty light weight piece I can move it around on my own with ease I am also over 220 and though the unit does flex when I use the pull up bar it only does so ever so slightly and after the initial experience and checking the unit out it is obvious the maker designed it this way The bracing is strategically placed to allow for this instead of using much heavier materials I appreciate this concept since it allows me to move the unit at will when necessary and still gives me complete confidence in the integrity of the piece Just check your bolts periodically as with any piece of fitness equipment The push up handles are the only drawback on this and the sole reason I give it 4 instead 5 stars The only usable position for me is at the bend where there is no padding This places you at a fairly extreme angle and although it is still a functional position it is obvious these were not well thought out Any attempt to even remotely place your hands where the padding is or in any normal position and you are banging your head on the lower center brace Separate push up bars are better anyway Check out the perfect push up by BodyRev here on Amazon if you re looking All said this is an infinitely usable piece of equipment bringing some big exercises to your home in a very reasonably sized package It is easy to incorporate into your work out routine and even my wife has taken a liking to it She uses it to work out her lower back and loves the strength relief it gives her Bottom line 100 for this highly functional piece is an absolute bargain and pretty much a no brainer GET IT 
5 0 Ironman wannabe Very well constructed and solid realtively easy and straight forward assembly Comfortable to use ONLY criticism is the mild imbalance of Tower when using chair assisted pull ups Just watch for it tilting forward and there is no threat 
4 0 Nice piece of equipment This came promptly in a large and heavy box The instructions could have been better as there were a few things that were not clear but I was able to assemble it without much problem in about an hour In general everything was in good shape but as another reviewer noted there were small tears on the arm pads It is very sturdy but after a few weeks of use I need to go back and retighten some of the bolts in the base I mostly use it for the dips and pullups and have had no problems The handbars for doing pushups are a good idea but not very useful if you are not careful about your position you will hit your head on the cross beam some other reviewers have noted this Even when I am positioned correctly my hair brushes against the bar so I rarely use it for pushups 
5 0 Great product for the price I checked out a few similar items at sporting goods stores and decided that a model around 100 150 would suit me This was the best looking tower for the price and luckily I kept checking in and out and actually got this thing when the price was lowered to 80 for a few days So with shipping this thing cost me about 115 I don t have time for a gym membership and had room in my garage for this between it and my elliptical machine I can do pretty well The packaging was fine and I m sorry to hear that others had received it torn up But mine was fine all the parts were there and assembly took about an hour A socket wrench is a must The directions are slightly confusing but I can t fathom what the one reviewer is talking about where they say the holes were drilled on the wrong side Study the directions look at the pics on the box and you should be able to figure it out I weigh 170 pounds For me this tower is very sturdy very solid I use it for chin ups dips and leg lifts it performs extremely well There is no rocking and it is SOLID I figured the push up bars would be useless given the other reviews so I ve never bothered I just do push ups on the floor anyway As far as chin ups go yes you can bang your legs on the support bars if you have awful form Properly executed chin ups work great I am VERY happy with this purchase it was just what I was looking for and the price was right Even at its current price it is still a great item I love it

5 0 Bleach fans will be pleased Just got my sword today and it s very nice No damage or problems with the sword and it feels very well made This is one huge sword though so don t expect to be swinging it around one handed But in short if you re a fan of Bleach you ll be happy with this purchase and it s sure to provoke some questions from anyone you show it to P S I was really surprised to see how fast it showed up only 4 business days 
5 0 awesome whole sword is very nice if your a bleach fan you will love it even if you arnt this sword is awesome the sheeth has this little dot design on it though that you cant see in the picture though 
5 0 Well made sword Though I can not say I am an avid sword collector I can say this sword not only met but surpassed my expectations especially for the price The shipping was top notch and expedient One question I had was if the hand guard was also metal and it is The blade is standard steel and painted black It s weight is 4 5 lbs and the handle is well wrapped as playing around with it has not affected the wrapping in the slightest The chain in the back also does not feel like a cheap imitation If you re a fan of bleach as I am and you re even contemplating this sword you really should give it a shot It s a great buy for the money and it s guaranteed to wow your friends especially if they are under 5 8 the length of the sword Hope this review helps 
4 0 Too long to ship I assume the item is fine but why would it take more than a month to arrive 
5 0 Very Good Read Below Its a good scope dont buy the 6 or 10 scopes your better off buying this scope NOTE If you are buying an airsoft sniper off this site amazon none of the scopes will work or attach on the sniper rifile you buy accept this one I highly recommend it 
5 0 Super Fun Personal Accessory and Water Bottle This is an upscale designer water bottle top of the line and so much fun The designs Of Sigg s water bottles are gorgeous from the plain solid color bottles to the ones with intricate designs They are simply beautiful I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns thinking it would take more work to maintain These do necessitate regular cleaning I clean mine every day but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun Sort of like my rings glasses and watch I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory reminding me to drink more water making a statement about my values and expressing myself with a special design Yes all in a water bottle Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality made of light aluminum on the outside slightly insulated and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles They are light durable and perfect for any activity Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles just like from the tap Sigg bottles come with several different types of tops I bought the screw top because I don t like sports tops and I don t mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink It is totally leakproof which is important to me The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner I get comments on it all the time What s that I love it The sports top version is ok I just am not a fan as I don t feel like I can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top However for convenience you might prefer it For children there is a cap type top All are leak proof If you are ever unsatisfied with the top you can buy a screw top separately to fit your Sigg bottle Sigg makes their personal water bottle in 6L and 1L in this style I have both I use the 6L for sports activities because they are smaller When I won t have to carry the container I like the larger bottle Sigg also makes a smaller 3L bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people You can buy Siggs in alternative sizes too such as 75L 4L for kids 6L 5L You can occasionally find this bottle in the 1 5L size also Search Amazon for the perfect size Pick a style and pattern you like as this bottle is a personal accessory and should reflect your style The colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on Amazon They are expensive but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health so they are well worth it value wise for me Highly recommended 
4 0 does what it s supposed to Not much variation with these things It s sturdy and durable and does what it s supposed to well 
4 0 does what it says Compact device Easy to use You can feel your muscles respond 
5 0 Very Good Value This wheel was very easy to assemble It is important to use some type of lubricant to slide the hand grips on At first I tried to slide one on without it because I was afraid the lubricant would make the hand grips slide around during use after I put it together The hand grip would only go part of the way on and I had difficulty getting it back off So I followed the advice of another reviewer and used a tiny bit of petroleum jelly The hand grips slid right on and the wheel has worked great The wheel is very stable and works as it should What more could you ask for This is a very well made exercise wheel for a great price 
5 0 Great for upper body exercise I just got this nifty device and I am very pleased It really works all your upper body in just one moves I have feel the exercise on my arms back and especially the abs No complaints 
5 0 great great workout does exactly what it claims to do easy to put together and sturdy because it has two wheels 
5 0 Great Product Highly recommmend This stuff is really good for the upper abs At first it was unbearably hard but with time i got used to it and now do it every morning Its cheap and easy to use anywhere All you need is a floor One more thing my gf was unable to do more than one because of lack of upper body strength Other than that its awesome 
5 0 Amazingly simple amazingly hard If you have never tried this little wheel and you feel like you have strong core try it but be ready for some surprise It s very hard After 3 months of daily training I still could not do standing version but I m improving o So if there is no other exercise that could give your core a workout give Evil Wheel a try 
4 0 Excercise wheel works great I ve used this product for 4 months Very cheap price good quality no problems and it does the job well I don t have any complaints 
5 0 Good product This product is great I love it It s easy to put together initially and it really targets the areas that I wanted to work out A+ from me 
5 0 AWSOME I purchased a ripstik and let me tell you THE BEST THING TO RIDE Whenever I go down the street everyone stares and ask what is it They all say they want one too The best thing of all is riding hills I can even go up them but when you go down its like snowboarding I recommend this 100 
5 0 RazorX Ripstick Rocks Owning 2 ripsticks for the kids in our household is not enough My husband and I are also hooked Looks like we ll need 2 more Fun fun fun Best on a smooth surface indoor tile or concrete not black asphault Highly recommended for ages 10 100 
5 0 Ski Grip Excellent Product I ordered the Ski Grip and it exceeded my expectations The design is simple but very functional and attaches in seconds Go for it 
5 0 Head Liquidmetal Tennis racquet WOW This racquet really improved my swing Great product for a great price It is head heavy and it does the work Also greatly improved my tennis elbow 
5 0 loving it I bought this pack to use on the MS 150 bike ride It did not let me down Comfortable roomy for all my stuff and durable I even used it to ride to work and had a change of clothes in it as well as toiletries No complaints from me Thought the price might be too low initially but turned out to be a good buy 
5 0 Love it My daughter loves her Dora Skootskate and the non marking wheels are great since it s winter time and she s riding the skootskate in my house o 
4 0 Good Value This is a great first scooter Non skid surface makes it hard for little ones to slip while they are scooting but if they do it will surely scrape knees as it is very rough It is very quick and easy to assemble It comes with some stickers on it that don t stick very well but still an unbeatable value at 7 99 
4 0 Good for the reduced price Pretty sturdy scooter doesn t turn but great for both indoors and outdoors nonskid board surface great for the reduced price of 7 99 
5 0 My kids love this Since it has been opened my kids have played on it daily They love to scoot through the kitchen bathroom on it Even my 3 year old enjoys it It doesn t roll too fast so it is very unlikely to slip out from underneath a child As far as skateboards go this is a great safe route to go to teach balance 
4 0 Cute scoot Bought this on Amazon for our two girls Got it at a great price with free shipping I don t believe there s actually any bearings in the wheels but they do turn The style is very cute nice built in grip The girls got our money s worth the first day riding it 
5 0 Cute scooter Great scooter for the price Gave it to my angel for Christmas and she seems to really enjoy Appeared to be good quality and sturdy 
5 0 Sweetwater does the job Bought two Sweetwater filter pumps to take on a 4 day float trip one as a backup I didn t need the backup but the filter I did use was obviously getting close to stopped up by the end of the float I probably could have gotten more use from it by using the enclosed brush to clean it I didn t because the float ended before I quite needed to Summary I d recommend this product I d also recommend carrying a backup 
4 0 Light easy to use and pretty dependable I ve been using this water filter system for three years now It s light and easy to use Including setup I can fill 4 5 Nalgene bottles in 10 minutes or so without my arms getting fed up with the repetitive motion of pumping It attaches easily to a wide mouth Nalgene bottle so I d recommend a couple of those if you don t have them already Like any other filter it gets slower with use so take care of it Do get the silt stopper and be sure to carry a replacement filter for any extended trip I have found that in some locations Isle Royale for example I spent a lot more time backwashing the silt stopper and the filter took a beating Our camp neighbors were having even more trouble with their filters different brand so I didn t feel too bad about my minor troubles Replacement filters aren t cheap but then neither are any of the alternative filters out there The cleaning brush is easy to use but doesn t seem to help that much in improving flow speed as the filter slows down The unit responds well to being cleaned up when you get home and stored broken down 
5 0 At last Something with Jasmine on it My daughter is a fanatic Princess Jasmine lover Unfortunately Jasmine is one of the less frequently featured princesses My daughter was very specific about wanting a bike with Jasmine on it Since they don t seem to make one I am hoping that she will be just thrilled that she can at least have knee pads elbow pads gloves and a back pack with her favorite princess on it I am going to find a nice Jasmine sticker to put on her new little princess bike and hope between this and the sticker my Jasmine fan will be happy Come On Disney Mix it up a little Enough with Cinderella already 
4 0 it works and is flexible for various bikes The main advantage of this over other units that work with Suunto is that this is the only one that will actually work with all bicycles because it simply zip ties to the front fork The other two units that work with Suunto are more elegant but do not work with all bike set ups The only concern is that the plastic looks brittle but I have it on a mountain bike and have not had a problem with durability yet 
4 0 purchased as gift I purchased this wheeled duffle bag as a gift for a friend So I personally cannot review its use However I did have a chance to look at it before wrapping it This appears to be quality made The bag is defintely heavier than it appears Not to the point that it would be difficult to use but rather to last longer The bottom of the bag is not collapsible which would give it more strength to carry soda cans I bought this item on sale and I felt that I got a really good bargain It was well worth the money My friend has not given any complaints about its use so far 
5 0 great bike My son will be so excited he loves the Power Rangers and this bike is the coolest The graphics are spectacular and it seems very sturdy I can t wait to give it to him 
4 0 Great but no sounds as described The bike is really cool well built Too bad we had to assemble it though There are no sounds as indicated in the description I believe But my son loved it b c he is a Power Ranger freak Overall good purchase

5 0 Power Ranger Bike for Christmas My Christmas shopping was done early My Grandson said he wanted a Power Ranger Bike Couldn t find any in stores Found one at Amazon ordered it and recieved it within 3 days The bike looked great sturdy easy to assemble It doesn t look like your ordinary bike The fenders seat emblem on the handlbars make s it a bike like no other 
5 0 Loved by a 5 year old This bike is well built easy to ride and a hugh hit with all the Power Ranger kids in the neighborhood Would recomend highly 
5 0 Two Sides to All Yoga Mats Know Which Side is Up Yoga mats come in three basic thicknesses At 3 16 this mat is one of the thicker ones designed for those who need or want extra cushion Mats that are about one third as thick as this one 1 16 are good for travel or placing under a thicker mat to provide more traction The average mats are about 1 8 At 24 x 68 it s of standard width and length There are two sides to this and nearly all yoga mats Look carefully at the bumps on each side of the mat The larger bumps are designed to face upwards to cushion your hands feet and knees during poses while keeping your body from dangerously slipping out of alignment The smaller bumps are designed to face downwards to grip the floor and keep the yoga mat from sliding Many mats have a label on one end with the name of the brand This is typically but not always located on the up side The bumps will tell you for sure This yoga mat will increase in softness and stickiness with use So do most mats They start out mildly sticky and increase in stickiness the more they are used You will want to wash your mat when it first arrives so as to remove the thin film they get on their surface during the manufacturing process Instructions for washing the mat are included Once you ve washed and dried your mat you re ready to begin After using it for a while if you find the mat decreasing in stickiness each time you pull it out this is the typical sign that a light coating of dust or too much body sweat has accumulated on your mat and it needs a light hand washing with very diluted soap and water After washing roll your mat in a thick towel to squeeze out the excess water otherwise it will take forever to dry in the air Then air dry your mat unrolled inside and away from sunlight Hanging over the shower bar works nicely When you first unroll your mat you will find one end to be a bit curled Simply alternate the direction you roll your mat top outside once then bottom outside next or the end you start from curled end once flat end next time and you ll find it straightening out more or less over time I recommend buying your own yoga mat even if your yoga studio or gym provides them for you I ve worked in many studios and gyms over the years Sometimes management has mats cleaned often sometimes not If you bring your own mat you always know where it s been o Plus owning your own mat may encourage you to begin valuable practice at home For my students who have trouble with their knees in some of the poses requiring the body weight to rest on a knee I recommend temporarily folding over one end of the mat to get double cushion under the knee while still leaving one layer under the rest of the body This saves you having to haul more than one mat out each time you practice which can be discouraging especially to the beginner 
5 0 emergency storage is important I got this on a Friday sale and it s nice to know that it is there in case something happens 
2 0 Only if you aren t really hungry Although the food quality is decent and the packages should last for a while it s a bit deceptive to say that a TOTAL of about 2500 calories is adequate for a person for three days Unless you re on a really tight diet For a short term like 72 hours simply keep some canned food around or some MRE s and you d do much better If you insist on camping dehydrated food simply buy a few of the real meals from this company At least you ll be eating enough to keep the stomach rumbles down 
5 0 Fun Easy Way To Get Your Arms In Shape I spend a lot of time in front of the computer doing this that and I ll just grab this up every so often and toss it back between my hands or do the exercises that come in the box I ve had this a little over a week and I can definitely tell it s working already It s weighted just right and it doesn t even feel like I m actually exercising at all which makes it more fun 
5 0 Some detailed impressions Ahhh the ridicule I get for writing a few pogo stick reviews but these things really are fun I find that the best pogo stick reviews and discussions can be found at the xpogo website forum You ll find comments from people who have tested all the pogo sticks and provided honest critical feedback So take a look at recent reviews at xpogo before buying any pogo stick I own a Flybar 1200 which I love See my review If I was in the market for another pogo stick I d check out Vurtego Motostik and Power Pogo products among others At xpogo there s a long thread on the Flybar 800 with reasonable reviews starting around Sept 20 2006 The 800 seems to be great if you are under 120 135 Lbs I m a bit over that which means that it isn t for me unfortunately The 800 is smaller and lighter than the Flybar 1200 which reportedly makes it more controllable There was a problem with surgical tubing like bands thrusters breaking which may be under control Flybar SBI offers remarkably good customer service so they are likely to address any problems you have Keep in mind that pogo sticks have changed since the old days The new technologies are actually kind ve interesting The Motostik has a spring and is reminiscent of the Master and GG sticks of the old days It is pretty quiet which might be a plus The FB 1200 and 800 use elastomere thrusters that provide a sling shot like bounce The Vurtego and Power Pogo products feel a bit like a rubber ball bouncing You adjust them as if you were inflating a ball So if you want to drop big on a pogo stick take a look at what is out there There s a very very good chance you ll choose a Flybar but be aware of your options I think that a pogo stick renaissance is just around the corner And I think it might be good for kids to bounce around on these things because all those heel strikes might affect calcium levels and actually strengthen bones There s research linking heel strikes to calcium levels and bone strength If these results hold up then the pogo sticking as a child and teen may offer lifelong health benefits 
5 0 jump high Great pogo stick bought for child that is 14 Lots of fun and great workout Goes about 4 feet so need to be careful they will get hurt at times but no more than bike or skateboard company customer service is great Called up because rubber cap on pogo stick was coming apart They sent me overnight new cap and nice t shirt for the trouble Cannot beat that Most warranty places put you through the ringer Great stick and a lot of fun By the way it looks good to 
5 0 an awsome smoothe ride i just got the flybar 800 for christmas yesterday and let me tell you it is amazing i aminto xpogo and i learned almost all of my tricks on it the first day i just jumped over a trashcan and over a 7 foot gap i would reccomend this pogo stick to anyone people into xpogo and not into xpogo because if you are still learning to jump you can set the piston to be smaller so its easier to bottem out and regain control 
5 0 Simply Amazing I recently purchased the flybar 800 and was blown away by its durability and its strength I ll admit that i handle products very roughly however i haven t had a single problem I am a skateboarder so naturally i want to do tricks on it From backflips to barspins you name it The flybar 800 can do it all In fact i like the flybar 800 even more than it s companion the flybar 1200 The flybar 800 is lighter smaller and quieter But dont get me wrong i reccomend both Do not get this product for children under the age of 10 because it can be quite dangerous SO use it respectfully and responsibly 
5 0 Flybar 800 Preview State of the art technology and years of research have led to the Flybar 800 an ultra high performance pogo stick trampoline hybrid Having managed the Flybar Demo Team for the past year I thought I would give you a preview of the newly released Flybar 800 Our team has gotten to know the product line and its potential very well as we have been bouncing on the Flybar 1200 for almost two years now and have had the opportunity to test the Flybar 800 over the past few months The team loves the 1200 for its smooth bounce and big air potential so we were excited to see the same technology made available for our smaller younger team members When Flybar handed us the first product sample of the Flybar 800 we were blown away Not only did the Flybar 800 bring the smooth bounce and durability we loved in the Flybar 1200 its reduced form factor allowed younger and smaller riders to enjoy the view The flagship Flybar 1200 will still be the preferred stick for adults and advanced jumpers with a suggested weight range of 120 250 lbs But the Flybar 800 is smaller than the 1200 and has the same adjustability features of its predecessor the spring tension and the pedal height are easily adjustable to accommodate rider weight and skill level This makes it the ideal entry level high performance pogo for younger male riders and women of all ages We have had 12 year old kids and their parents bouncing side by side on the Flybar 800 which has a weight capacity of 80 180 pounds Ever since the release of the Flybar 1200 the most common request was for a Flybar that would be better suited for riders that weighed less than 120 lbs which is exactly what the 800 delivers It has been great to see the Flybar 800 reach new people Grinds drops and backflips are becoming routine for our most advanced jumpers but even novices are taking to the 800 The fitness arena has embraced the Flybar 800 as a novel way of getting in shape The approachability and low impact jump make the Flybar 800 an addictive cardio or aerobic workout available now for the first time to women who were too small to effectively operate the Flybar 1200 What impresses me is that the Flybar 800 exceeds all expectations and abuse from our demo team yet is so user friendly that a 12 year old and their parent can pick it up and be bouncing together in minutes The Flybar 800 lives up to the high standard set by the Flybar 1200 packing innovative technology into a smaller unit A versatile toy that the whole family can enjoy you won t be disappointed 
5 0 I love it This is the perfect tackle bag This thing is awesome I was concerned about it being big enough and it is perfect I thought about using a duffle bag for my tackle but i thought a duffle bag would be too big in the boat but this is more vertical so it is perfect I absolutely love it I don t know why Plano has stopped producing them The only reason I can think of is that it costs them too much money to produce I m tempted to buy another one The only complaint I have is the wraps really arent wraps they are side pockets with rings attached to the bottom of the pockets but thats a small price to pay for such a nice tackle bag Plus the 8 3700 series boxes are worth half the value themselves 
5 0 Father in law loves his mat This was purchased as a birthday gift for my father in law We were very happy with the quality and size of the mat We feel we got quite a bargain to be honest My father in law seemed quite pleased and genuinely surprised upon receiving the mat for his birthday it was on his Amazon wish list Our order was filled and shipped very quickly I have no problem recomending this mat to others 
5 0 Great Bike until it was stolen We searched for days for a birthday bike to fit my 9 yr old daughter and this was the only one that would give her room to grow She adored it and we had it for all of 18 days before it was stolen off our back deck It broke her heart but when I save up the money again I will buy this same bike It is well made and comfortable and fits the in between kids who are too big for the Baby ish decals of the 20 inch bikes I only wish the person who stole it would have a change of heart before I buy it again 
5 0 Understand what you need This bike is great for pleasure riding My wife is around 5 2 and this is a great fit She loves it and put streamers on the handgrips right away A lot of non rusting aluminum and alloys for low maintenance Lots of gears We are very impressed by the quality for the relatively low price If you are just riding the neighborhood for fun try a cruiser movel this is more of a fun bike for young young at heart 
4 0 Great Bike I purchased this bike for my 9 year daughter who was ready for something a little more mature than the pink bike with the wicker basket on the front She loves this bike She and her dad ride long distances and this bike makes the ride very enjoyable Recommend 
5 0 Great skates I bought these skates for my four year old son Good skates for the price He absolutely loves them 
5 0 Awesomeness So I own a few Cathe s workouts and she is my favorite instructor and her workouts are my favorite because they are always advanced and I know I always get a GOOD workout when I do them This workout had so many of the things I love DRILLS No dancey moves very basic step segments but mostly plyo drills and lunges high intensity for sure so be sure to leave a few days in between this workout The weight segments were good but if you are wanting a full body weight routine I suggest Jari Love But this is good for cardio and weights mixed and using the ball my first time I have to say it is pretty fun Wall squats are pretty challenging for me since I have not done them before but I love a challenge This is a hard core workout and you will be pleased But if you are a beginner I do not recommend this workout This is definately for the advanced 
5 0 Incredible Workout This is my first Cathe Friedrich dvd and I love it It provides a great boost to my workout schedule and is very challenging If you re feeling overly energetic you can run the workout straight through over 60 mins or choose one of the shorter premixed workouts for different areas of concentration Great workout for intermediates who are looking for a push up to advanced 
5 0 A Calorie Burner I loved it however keep in mind this workout is for someone who wants High intensity workouts and does not like alot of breaks She does give ample recovery for the muscle by switching back in forth non stop 
5 0 Wow A tough one This DVD is awesome It tests my endurance like no other I m in better shape because of this workout and many other Cathe s DVDs This is workout is definitely for advance exercisers It s very athletic and not dancy at all be ready to sweat This DVD is like no other Cathe DVD she includes lots of functional exercises Great Job Cathe 
5 0 The best of her latest series I really like this workout If you are a Cathe fan it is pretty different from any other workout that she had done The closest thing to it is Boot Camp Both videos are good in separate ways Boot Camp is only one hour and seems to concentrate more on strength work Drill Max has a lot more cardio in it And I found it to be a pretty tough go but mixed up enough where it was enjoyable I intend to do this one regularly I would say however that this is a pretty advanced workout 
4 0 Tough l I usually love Cathe s workouts I like this but not as much as her others This is quite effective if you can make it through to the end but usually with interval training you pick up the intensity and lower it only to pick it up again Here you are pretty much going full tilt the entire way I don t really classify this as interval training Having said that you will get a great workout from this In the six circuits that each have three segments you will work on balance agility and functional fitness You will need to be somewhat fit already in order to do this because otherwise you will find it very discouraging and may quit Each of the segments within the circuits do step aerobics floorwork and standing toning Even she will tell you that if you don t have a lot of space to work in cause you ll do football drills then take it higher So she is one tough cookie but she will give you results if you do this consistantly You are looking at a workout well over an hour But while it s tough and makes you sweat I just wouldn t call it interval training Her instruction and cuing are as good as ever and I think that if you are fit or somewhat fit already you will have lot s to gain from this I really like it 
5 0 Awesome this is great to get if your not old enough to buy ammo in stores and it lasts you forever 
2 0 Bad Balls Got them thinnking there were plentiful and cheap Pros Alot of Balls hurt pretty bad Cons Jam in Barrel of all of my guns my friend has one gun they work in the seems stick out a bit Not for me I reccommend buying them at your local store 
4 0 good bb s I dont care whatever any of you guys say but these bb s are awesome If you want to solve the problem of them spilling everywhere you can just put them in a zip lock bag you knuckle heads and if you want to pour them put them in a speed loader you you guys would probably have laying around your house anyway All in all these are good high quality bb s that you should buy and if you dont your just dumb 
5 0 very good On opening this bag my initial impression was Dear lord no burrs this is because there were no burrs on any of the BBs this was a huge change from my last bag which could only be better then a melted blob of plastic For all that say you can t reclose the bag PUT THEM ALL IN A ZIP LOCK BAG PROBLEM SOLVED I will accept my Nobel Prize after i pwn my freinds 
4 0 Lots for less n_n They re nice seamless and yes you can use them in AEGs I have and nothing bad has happened The only reason why i didnt give it a 5 is because the picture shows blue BBs and I got yellow WTF o well it is a good but will last you a long And also I am not Michelle thats my mom i am Joe 
5 0 WARNING Do not use these bb s with AEG s Only use them with spring pistols 
5 0 bike rack wall mount item is great as advertised easy to mount to wall shipping was fast also thank 
4 0 Blackburn Fluid Trainer This is a good product when you use it you can fell it working in your legs It is good to be able to ride your bike in the comfort of your living room when you can t ride outside The only bad points of the trainer would be it is a bit noisy and the instructions are hard to understand It is good value for money and has a strong support stand 
4 0 Excellent Product It is Very good Product to maintain all cold like meals and drinks and very easy to clean really he is too useful 
5 0 quality snowshoes and a bargain price Comparing these snowshoes to much more expensive ones in local stores leaves my very pleased Also all else with the purchase was very professional including shipment info and delivery 
5 0 Can t ask for much more for 8 Or anything else really I have a few hundred miles on the tires They roll and handle just fine Much better than the knobbies that came on the bike If you have a MTB and find yourself riding it on the street all of the time these tires will serve you well 
5 0 Windup LED Flashlight Very cool So far so good have not used it long will see how it holds up to use in a mountain cabin where the power goes out all the time 
5 0 Very good Quality We have found this light to be of very good quality When purchasing we also considered a similar light by Black Decker This light seemed to have sturdier and tighter construction We bought locally so we have the option of testing these in the store before we bought they all come in packages which allow the crank to be free so you can try them For both models we discovered that some work better than others What I mean is some B D work better than other B D and some Iluminators work better than others This may be due to the way they are treated in the store some being used over and over again before purchase It took a while but we found one that held a charge for a long time In fact when I charged it at home it lasted with bright light three leds for about 1 5 hours and kept emitting dim light for 12 hours One B D we purchased and returned stayed on for only 10 seconds after being charged for two munutes not useful Advice These as internet ordered are probably more likely to be free from in store over use repeat probably However you also can t try them before buying So like many things you ll need to weigh those pros and cons If you get a good one you ll probably agree that it is a very good little flashlight 
5 0 Excellent quality will last for year worth the price My son has had this trike since last summer It is a heavy study bike that he rides every day We have to keep it in the house all winter so he can ride around the house It doesn t tip over easily but it does tip over if my son is messing around I put it together myself and it was pretty easy to assemble I recommend this trike for bigger toddlers age 2 and up since it s pretty heavy and even at the most compact setting most kids under 2 won t be able to reach the pedals My son is almost 3 and still doesn t pedal consistently because of the weight of the bike 
5 0 sturdy trike My 19 month old boy can t reach the pedals yet but loves to ride it anyway My 5 year old boy always wants to ride the trike around the house They both love riding the trike 
5 0 Great bike So far so good My son is only 15months but loves to sit and play on this bike It seems really well made and it was easy to put together Well worth the price 
5 0 Great deck lighting We enjoyed using this lantern red one on our deck during the summer We d use it on the patio table at meals and set it on the deck for ambient light Very enjoyable and you get lots of mileage on a set of batteries 
5 0 Get fit and THRIVE Love it I use it when I am at the stop light to get a few quick reps in Great for travel too 
5 0 Feel Like a Pirate Awesome sword Looks and feels like the real thing but at a cost anyone can afford Great converstaion piece 
5 0 Amazing for the price If you can find a better scope for 14 dollars let me know This scope is amazing and super easy to fine tune If you re on a tight budget or if you just want a good scope this is it WARNING you need to buy scope rings to mount it 
4 0 Great scope with great price This is a well built scope Pretty good past 100 yards and a nice reticle to measure distance with I dont think anyone can find a 4x30 scope for less than 20 bucks haha I recommend this product 
5 0 Good choise Good package and the Air travel includes a soft to login and access to information 
5 0 Brilliant piece of kit If you are into your outdoor lifestyle and enjoy getting away for a few days into the bush the IGLOO cooler box is a much needed necessity I have used them in the Zambezi Valley Zimbabwe and they have performed brilliantly keeping ice intact for several days despite temperatures in the shade of over 40 deg cent Work very well with dry ice recommend putting a wet towel over the coolerbox and wetting this regularly can assist with keeping the temp down At the end of the day you cant go wrong with good kit well worth every cent paid 
5 0 COOLER REVIEW THIS COOLER WORKED VERY VERY WELL IT WAS TAKEN ON A HUNTING TRIP TO KEEP THE MEAT COLD AND IT DID A GOOD JOB HOURS LATER THE ICE HADN T EVEN MELTED IN 80 90 DEGREE HEAT SIZE WAS VERY IMPORTANT TOO EXCELLENT COOLER 
5 0 Lotsa water This was perfect for our 4 day 8 person hike No pumping required just someplace to hang it We took turns holding it up in some cases The filter lasts for a long time the water tasted great it was light and compact I love this product 
5 0 Fashionable backpack This backpack in khaki dark pink has been perfect for my young middleschooler She wanted something hip trendy and got that but also got a pack with several pockets well constructed of great quality 
5 0 Atrix Backpack Love my black backpack I m only 5 1 and I wanted a backpack that doesn t look bulky on my small frame I found it The pouch in front pouch is just big enough to fit my Ipod and pencils I carry my binder and two text books around all the time and I still have room for my laptop if I wanted 
5 0 It Works If you want to impress others have more money than you know what to do with or are skilled enough that you know for a fact that you will play better with a racquet that has specific characteristics that this one lacks buy another racquet If you just want a decent racquet that reliably does what a raquet should do you don t need to pay more than this Because of advances in technology this plays better than most of the racquets that were available regardless of price ten years ago so if you re not happy with your game you won t be able to blame this racquet 
5 0 Window Shopper I bought this recently and already I think this racquet is great The main reason I bought this is because this is light and oversized great for beginners like me plus this racquet isn t so expensive But I think this racquet is good any level player Highly recommend it 
5 0 Great Racquet Great Price I bought this at Wal Mart today for 16 and this my first real tennis raquet before I was playing with a badmitten raquet I am very satified with it It s lightweight big head and also has soft shock absorbers which is really nice not to mention a great deal As being a person who hasn t played on a real tennis court yet I am quite hapy with it 
2 0 it all right I could not get the sound to stop just wanted the ligh 
5 0 My ears are still ringing This is my first review so you know this product is great I own my own business and park my 14 foot box truck in my driveway I recently orderded this product and recieved it but it took me a couple of days to find the time to install it Meanwhile someone broke in my truck and stole all my tools So I decided to install my new motion sensor and it works great It has about a 7 second delay to allow you to shut it off once it detects motion and i have no use for the strobe light but for the money im sure this product will stop the next would be theives 
5 0 One of the Better Stand Alone Home Alarms This alarm is higher quality but more expensive than most other small battery operated apartment home burglary alarms and can sense movement quite well To me it was a big plus that not only does it have a loud audible alarm when tripped but also a small strobe like pulsing light as well as the ability to turn the unit on and off with the single included remote control FYI In fact the remote is the only way the unit can be turned on or off It also looks somewhat imposing as if it were part of a real hard core wired alarm system The only slightly negative issue is that the remote control only works from a range of about five feet the alarm s motion sensing capability however is far longer than that but this is not a problem because the alarm is delayed for about 12 seconds to allow you to get close enough to turn the unit off before the alarm strobe activates You may also want to purchase another remote which Amazon also sells if you have a spouse or a child 
5 0 Good for apartments I had this for about a month now The Good Its nice and loud My ears will ring all day if I set it off Also it can stand of a table or you could mount it on a wall It is very easy to arm and disarm I have had it not go off wrongly once Cheap but works good The Bad There is no off button on the unit but that might be for protection You know so a bad guy can not turn it off It will turn itself off after a few minutes with nothing moving They could have put a push button code on it though to protect it The biggest problem with it is you have to get up close to arm and disarm it However you have plenty of time to do so before the alarm goes off All in all a good product Main use would be to protect smaller rooms You don t want this if you have pets or kids that walk around all hours of the night 
5 0 sturdier than the picture makes it appear The picture makes this cover look transparent but it is actually very heavy duty I recommend this cover especially if your bike is exposed to wind and dust where it is stored as mine is 
5 0 Reliable after years It s a common scenario You haven t taken your raft out in a year or more because you ve just been too busy to be bothered with it Finally you re camping at a lake for the weekend and you excitedly bring your raft out It was great last time you inflated it so there should be no problems right You get to the lake bring out your boat and pump it up real tight You place it on the water and go Ten minutes out your raft isn t quite as solid but you dismiss it as the cold water causing the air inside to slow down lower pressure Another ten minutes and your raft is practically bending in half The Seahawk 200 will not give you this problem The PVC is clearly sturdier than a typical cheap raft 25 is a cheap two person raft I don t get the raft out that often but in five years it has always been reliable You won t fit two large people in it but my wife and I fit okay The only downside is the pump It sucks It is too little and will take a while to fill up Get either a big foot pump or an electric one and you ll be much happier 
5 0 Great Umbrella Perfect for 1 2 people Excellent build quality Wood handle feels very comfortable Even an umbrella this large holds up well in windy conditions 62 is a bit deceptive since it measures the circumference I was told by Gustbuster this is the standard for measurement in the industry Actual size is 51 across from the tip of the ribs and 47 across from the fabric between ribs 
4 0 Love this umbrella I live on the stormy coast of northern California and bought this umbrella to keep me dry during my 1 25 mile walk to and from my bus stop I am very happy with this product The only quibble I have is that it s a tad too big sometimes to squeeze between the power poles and some overgrown bushes But that says more about peoples ability to control their shrubery than it does about the umbrella I m glad I chose the GustBuster model with the curved handle instead of the straight one The handle fits my hand perfectly and is easy to control in sudden wind gusts The center support is long enough so my arms can maintain a relaxed and natural position I wholeheartedly recommend this umbrella 
4 0 Nice Umbrella Umbrella is great minus the fact that there was a small plastic cap that gets glued nailed into the top portion of the umbrella The small nail seemed to split the plastic cap and it fell off Cant say I think this is the best method to secure the top but I dont make umbrellas Doesnt seem to affect the umbrella and I didnt feel like dealing with shipping etc again so I just kept it 
5 0 Best Gift Yet I bought this umbrella for my mom for christmas a couple of years ago We live in Los Angeles and don t get much rain but when it does rain it pours and is windy Every time I go over to her house and rain or umbrellas are brought up she says that this is the best umbrella she has ever had She loves it and it is sturdy and holds up I am very happy with my purchase and so is she 
5 0 Great Excelent product keeps wrists protected and makes grip comfortable for lifting defenetly a must have item for those ho work ou 
5 0 Why settle for second best I am very pleased with my purchase of the Valeo Wrist Wrap Lifting gloves though I do not use them for lifting Rather I am in a manual wheelchair and these gloves with the full 3 4 length on the fingers and the incredible soft sticky leather helps me to move my wheelchair with ease and comfort and the double thick leather in the palm and thumb cradle makes for long lasting performance I have and still do recommend these gloves to other wheelchair bound people who use manual chairs Furthermore the service I recieved from Amazon was first rate Fair pricing quick shipping and on time delivery made this a most enjoyable experience 
5 0 so easy to use this pot is perfect for cooking hot meals I can use it when going to sports games or just for soup at home the keep cool handles acctually always keep cool which is so important for someone who is always on the go this is an easy to clean pot which is great for someone like me who hates to wash dishes 
5 0 Approved by a yoga teacher I m a yoga teacher and I love these bolsters I ordered both the round and rectangular bolsters for my home practice They are both exactly what I wanted the perfect size dimensions and firmness Excellent price too I would definitely recommend them 
5 0 Excellent bike I bought this bike from Target about a year ago and I ride it almost every day It rides very smoothly the gears are easy to change the seat easy to adjust etc It s just an all around good quality bike I wouldn t trade it for anything and would highly recommend it to anyone out there I m not too sure about buying bikes online because you have to assemble them but I recommend going to your local Target to pick this bike up and give it a little test ride You won t be disappointed Also my fiance has the men s Ranger bike which we purchased about a month ago and he loves it too The Ranger s are great bikes if you are looking at riding around your neighborhood or on paved streets They do quite well on slightly rough terrain but they slide a good bit if you are on soft sand They are definitely road bikes No complaints here 
5 0 the best bike ever this bike is the best I ride it every day and have never had a proble 
5 0 Bike is great even for out of shape inexperienced people After many pounds and many years of not riding I decided to get a bike so I could ride with my kids I have had back surgery so I was a little concerned but this bike seemed to allow me to sit up a bit straighter and put less strain on my back so it has been perfect I ride in town on the road or sidewalks and it is great I would highly reccomend 
5 0 Pleased as punch I went to the local bike shop looking for a bike for my wife no not a trade When I explaned that I wanted a middle of the road multi speed bike for recreational use he recommended the Schwinn Ranger at Target he also recommended Target for the trunk bike rack which I purchased 60 br 62 He also recommended that I bring the bike in to him for reassembly His recommendation for the additional service made sense to me because once the bikes are assembled even if they are assmbled properly they are out on the floor for anyone to adjust however the might choose Having a professional assemble the bike is the reason I went to a bike shop anyway 60 br 62 My wife is pleased as punch with her new bike 60 br 62 60 br 62 
4 0 Great Bike Now that I have this bike I love biking I bought it for a few reasons so that I could have a fast way to get to my classes at my college so that I could learn more about biking and relearn essentially while getting some exercise and so I would have a chance to give mountain and trail biking a try So far I ve really enjoyed this bike and had very little problems with it A few downsides and tips 1 It s not lightweight actually it s fairly heavy I m told in comparison to other mountain bikes But I guess the upside is that you get a better workout 2 The handlebar grip covers keep sliding off This can be very dangerous If you buy it you should figure out a way to secure them so they don t slide off while you re biking 3 The paint job is very nice I ve gotten lots of compliments from other people soley on how pretty the bike is but since it s light colored scratch marks from bike racks may show more easily 4 The brakes were loose when I first got it but they were easy to tighten as soon as I learned how to do it So don t make a judgment on the brakes unless you ve learned how to adjust them A few great things and upsides 1 The bike seems versatile for both trail and roads 2 The gears are easy to change I like this feature a lot 3 The bike seat that comes with it is very comfortable and is easily adjustable 4 The front wheel is also a quick release and easy to remove This makes it easier for me to put the bike in the back of my car and take the bike to a trail or elsewhere i e I don t need to buy a bike rack for my car 5 The PRICE is very reasonable when you compare it to other mountain bikes and I feel it s a really good deal Since I m just getting started in the sport of biking I didn t want to spend 600 bucks or so Anyways good luck with it if you decide to get it 
5 0 Great buy great product It s a great product whith this you have the necessary equipment to play flag football enjoy it 
4 0 Good for larger dude Tried out the set today at the pool works well The fins fit good even though I wear size 15 shoe Snug but not painful The snorkel could be longer but works suffieciently I ve never snorkeled before and I think I have it down in a hour to clear it of water you have to put one hand over the end near your mouth while you blow Works well enough you can go down come up clear water and keep you head down The mask is the part of the set that needs help while trying to adjust the strap it broke So I took off the plastic adjustment piece and fed the strap though the hole where the strap was mounted and it stays better I think it works better after I broke it and improvised I think I ll do that to the other side too Fogged up a bit too but I bet there s a secret about that too overall Fins A+ not too big snug fit for larger feet Snorkel B easy to use once you get the hang of it Mask C+ strap adjustment lock sucks better once you break it Improvise Price Value A Best deal I found for lt 3 
4 0 Just what we needed We spent a week on Isla Mujeres in Mexico during late March we purchased this dive set so we wouldn t have to rent and the gear we purchased was far superior than what was offered The value was expectional and i found the whole process easy i encourage other consumers to purchase this set 
4 0 Nice Set For a beginners set this is a very nice one The materials are of a good quality and the price was very reasonable Shipping was super speedy 
4 0 Great snorkel set I have only used this a few times but so far it is great One word of caution is to label your set if you are in a group We went snorkeling and almost everyone had blue U S Divers equipment and we found it challenging to determine what equipment was ours Would give it 5 stars but have only used it twice so cannot comment on durability 
4 0 Liked this so much I had to buy another I bought this last year for a trip to the Carribean I only bought one set for my husband to use I used it while we were there also and liked it so much I decided to buy another set for myself The mask fits well the fins are great the snorkel works well and it s easy to get any water out of it 
5 0 AWESOME AWESOME ITEM GOOD PRICE EXCELLENT QUALITY FOR THE PRICE I LOVE IT 5 STARS PRODUCT 
4 0 Snorkel Gear I loved the mask and snorkel gear it worked great for me I loved having the fins with a fitied heel not just a strap 
5 0 A great set for a great price I bought this set in order to go snorkeling in the pool to practice for snorkeling in the Mediterranean The mask is great with easy to adjust straps while you re wearing it too The snorkel works really well and hsa several cool features to keep water out The mouthpiece is soooo comfortable I have a piercing in my frenulum the thing that connects your gums to your upper lip and the mouthpiece does not bother it at all like cheap others have in the past The fins work well but are wider than I m used to which is old crappy gym fins I recommend this set for everyone I use the mask with waterproof earphones and ipod case and the mask straps don t bother my ears at all 
5 0 wonderful item this is just what we were looking for very nice product fins fit great the sizes are accurate masks are comfortable with good viewing area 
5 0 kjones this item has really done some damage on my fat it only works if you use it watch your ddiet and excercise regular with thighmaster it works i am pleased 
5 0 Unbeatable for the money and play It was hard to pass these golfballs for the price I normally play the Callaway HX Hot Reds Thought I would give these a try and glad I did The Nitro Maximum Distance hit has far if not farther then the Callaways with a much better feel They are not as firm as the Callaways for better control For the money they can t be beat Its your mistake if you don t give them a try Plus you get two free hats 
5 0 Excellent Product I have used the Sky Caddie on several different courses and found it to be exactly as advertised Its great for knowing exactly where you are on the course as well as situational awareness of fairway boundaries and obstacles My game continues to improve as I depend my Sky Caddie Wish I had bought it sooner 
5 0 Great Product I own this and the love it Works great and is more accurate then the Bushnell although costs a little more I have not found a course that it does not have and I don t know if I could play without it now Easy to use and worth the price 
5 0 This unit is amazing I have had this unit for a few months The first thing that you notice is that it is not a heavy peice of equipment and the controls look fairly complex However once you get used to the system the controls are fairly intuitive Despite the fact that SkyGolf had some problems over the holidays ei Server issue which I learned of while sitting on the phone with one of their customer service guys named Carl they did manage to get back up and running friday night when I was able to start downloading my information again As for the bad press so far some people are just too impatient for their own good 
5 0 Essential Training Tool This one is the best Tough for intense ab training and conditioning 
5 0 Great addition to your training These Everlast leather balls are good ones sturdy and tough There are several good books avaiible now on medicine ball training and you can search online for medicine ball workouts too I have found that the 8 9 lbs balls are a bit heavy for most of my female students that are new to medicine ball training They do better with a 4 5 lbs or 6 8 lbs ball The 8 9 will suit most men of average strength The 12 or the 15 lbs are about as big as you need to go for a superior workot as you progress With these Everlast balls I carefully remove the synthetic name tag which makes for a more comfortable catching surface all the way around 
5 0 Good for workouts As the other reviewer said don t expect this to be perfectly round if you want one of those get one that is balanced and not leather I prefer this over the plastic or rubber because it doesn t slip when you are sweating The only downfall I would note is the stitching is not leather it is a rigid plastic Not a big deal but I have caught it just right before and it can scratch Overall it is great for workouts and working muscles hard to get with typical free weights Most places have this for much more money or really unreasonable shipping 
4 0 Leather Medicine Ball 8 9 lbs I like this product It is not perfectly round like a basketball so expect to see a little lop sidedness I think they re all like this because the one at my gym is like that too It can be a pretty good workout if you have an idea of what exercises to use it with My wife and I just started making it part of our workout routine This seems to be a good weight as I don t think I d like anything lighter The one at my gym is heavier and I think it s too heavy We chose the leather medicine ball because we like the feel on the hands I have not used any other type but I like this one 
4 0 Good first bike When I decided to try bicycling I had no idea where to start After looking at hundreds of bikes I ordered the Pacific Shorewood It arrived in good shape and time and I put it together in about an hour I have rode several hundred miles now and had a flat tire once I have had no problems with this bike and would recommend it to anyone getting into bicycling for the first time and not wanting to invest too much into it at first 
5 0 Sturdy number Very sturdy umbrella Large footprint so you can have friends family join you under the umbrella to stay out of the rain I like it lots As good of a price as you will find 
5 0 Skateboard safety These knee pads do a good job of saving your child from getting hurt Fit well I also purchased the elbow pads and my 10 year old grandson is much safer 
4 0 Cutest Thing This was a cute sturdy horn Holding up nicely The only reason why I am giving it a 4 is because it won t fit tightly on my son s handbars There are two different size bars One is too big and one too small I put it on the one that is too small so it doesn t want to stand up and stay put Otherwise it is great 
5 0 Motorcycle The battery keeps the charge very long It is very cute and great quality Thanks 
5 0 motorcycle This very affordable motorcycle has provided hours upon hours of fun for my son I d buy it again 
5 0 chipwell My husband has the metal version of these that are a bit higher and thinner He got them from a sports store in the weight dept I have also used regular dumbells which work fine because they are a bit thicker to hold so I find them more comfortable When I got these I was very impressed They are more stable so if you go real wide or real close they don t roll on their sides The grip is also soft and thick making it LOTS more comfortable I don t have near as much pain in my wrist doing push ups of any type I highly recommend them especially for women 
4 0 Do u wanna sth for training at home Everlast family training set is so usefull But there is sth which i dont like the boxing gloves are so small anyway I like it 
4 0 Simple Strap Simple stress free strap for the minimalist The water bottle holder is hard to use and a bit clunky but detaches easily 
4 0 Bulky but Comfortable Even after reading several reviews on this product on how it is bigger than it looks I still purchased the pack Well they are correct it is bulky but I found that wearing this pack on the hip worked out nicely In addition this pack is well made I was looking for a pack that I did not have to wear as a backpack but could still carry many items If this is what you are looking for This is the pack for you I was able to stuff a camera gloves hat snacks and many miscellaneous items I purchase during the day in this pack Even with all these items the pack was still comfortable 
4 0 Too Big but ok I got this for an upcoming trip to Disney since the heat is acting up the 2 water bottles come in handy Only drawback I see is that it is too big you can t get a feeling from the pictures of how big it actually is but aside from that it is exactly what I needed Lot s of room and pocket and it can be adjusted in a lot of different ways to match our size 
5 0 Great Bike This is a nice bike my daughter is having so much fun I guess we are lucky that this winter have been kind of warm We miss the snow thoug Overall great product and fast shipping 
4 0 coaster brakes don t come with transmission I understand the disappointment of the other reviewers but coaster brakes makes use of the reverse tantion on the chain which is impossible for transmission using derailleur mechanism This is the first one in my list for the planned purchase for my daughter turninig 8 Don t have it so ca t really rate it but looks like a good choice 20 inch model rarely comes with transmission I will re rate it when I get it 
5 0 Amazing Stove I have the Coleman 533 and have used it for 3 years It is great to have the option of running white gas or unleaded gas through it This stove works great in the wind and really puts out some heat I use it for all camping and fishing Would not trade it for the world Great Product 
5 0 Excellent flag football flags Just like the ones used in college intra murals excellent stitching and look to be very durable Fast shipping and great deal 
5 0 Excellent Price This is an excellent yoga mat I had one of my own and bought this for my mom on Amazon Cant beat the price 
5 0 Best Yoga Mat I ve ever had I should have bought this mat in the beginning of my yoga journey But no in my never ending quest to save money I bought enough other cheap mats to have paid for this one Each and every one of them was unsatisfactory and too thin This is one great mat It is so comfortable to use and I do not find it that heavy to tote around I have a pretty good case of arthritis and this Manduka has made all of the difference in my practice If you are at all serious about yoga do make the investment and get this mat It is heads above all of the other 12 and up mats out there 
5 0 Yoga licious I have been practicing power yoga 4 5 times per week for over a year After mats repeatedly wore out on me my instructor recommended the Manduka mat She has been using hers for over 2 years and it still looks like new It took a few weeks for the coating makes it a little slippery at first and the scent to dissipate but after the initial break in period this mat has stood up to lots of wear I love it so much that I bought one for my husband and one for my mom The Manduka mat provides great traction I am able to hold balance poses easily on my mat something I have found to be more difficult on softer mats It is amazingly durable no nicks or scratches after a few months of use As for the size I love it I am 5 9 and I like a deep Warrior pose with this mat I don t have to worry about going over the edge My 6 husband agrees Caution this mat is a little larger and heavier than most found at the gym or sporting goods store so if looking for a mat bag test out the size and strength of the bag with the mat before purchasing one 
5 0 Best Yoga Mat Ever A yoga instructor I work with raves about Manduka and after two years of ignoring her I finally bought one She was right Great for daily practice and to take to the gym It s heavy but it s worth the extra weight 
5 0 The mat that Rocks Absolutly the best Finally I have found the mat that feels right for my yoga To break it before I used it I washed it with a semi hard brush and a solution of hot water and white vinegar rinsed it with hot water and then let it dry under the sun This way I had no problem with it being slippery I am enjoying it everyday for the new dimension it is bringing to my yoga practice and the feeling that I have made a wise purchase 
4 0 Excellent Perfect yoga mat Some cushioning but not too much But on the heavy side if you are wanting to take it somewhere 
5 0 Manduka Mat This is a great mat After two months 40 yoga hours and at least 1 000 Sun Salutations the mat shows zero wear Out of the box it was slippery However once the release compound has worn off or been washed off the mat has great grip even when wet In my opinion this mat makes practice on the old imperfect hard wood floor at the studio much more comfortable If someone can wear out this mat then they are probably doing way too much yoga 
5 0 So glad I got these I got these on a whim I didn t really think I would need them but I splurged and I m glad I did They really make it so much easier to use the Therabands Plus I ve found that I have a latex allergy but I can still use the Therabands as long as I m using these handles It took me a minute to figure out how to tighten the bands in but once I did I found that they were very secure These handles are light and feel very comfortable I highly recommend them if you are going to exercise with the Therabands 
5 0 I like them I like these They are purposely lightweight so if the band breaks you don t have some heavy handle coming down on you I like how light they are and cheap 
5 0 The most for your money Ironman Deluxe Flooring I feel real fortunate to have purchased this product I have seem various interlocking flooring and the Ironman Deluxe is quite durable I do my 45 minutes of exercising on it over my new laminate wooden flooring So easy to set up and put away and the interlocking stays in place I was going to purchase another product that had thin plastic covering etc to save on some monies I am glad I went for quality it was worth every penny THANK YOU 
5 0 Very Pleased I am very pleased with this floor although suprised how light it was I was expecting more of a rubber material but this has much more cushion It seems very durable though 
5 0 EXCELLENT My whole family does martial arts so I turned my whole garage into a dojang dojo This product is perfect It is stiff enough to do spin kicks yet soft enough to absorb the impact of falling tumbling techniques 
5 0 Nice mats Quality construction I m very pleased Cheaper than at the sporting goods store too 
5 0 Perfect flooring system I put this flooring in my home gym total of nearly 500 sq ft It has performed absolutly perfectly very thick good cushion durable very easy to install Plus Ironman is one of the best companies in terms of customer service I had a question on the product and rather than try to get a reply from Amazon I e mailed Ironman Not only did they reply they actually called me within 30 min of my sending them an e mail Answered all my questions one of the rare companies that actually provides good customer service I looked at several flooring options from many Internet dealers but the Ironman product was the best choice by far 
5 0 Pricey but worth it I purchased the Ironman floor system to expand my current workout space What I did not realize was that the Ironman flooring would be so thick It is fully twice as thick as my previous system The floor is sturdy bounces right back from impact and provides an excellent surface for aerobic workouts or use of the stability ball This system cost twice what my old flooring cost but I wound up ordering more to replace all the old stuff The quality is far superior 
4 0 Shag Pro Ball Shagger Dispenser The product works as anticipated I was disappointed that the packaging was missing golf tips that were advertised as being included This advertising was imprinted on the product s box so it was not just a stick on label afterthought I think someone tampered with the box before shipping 
5 0 Shall we shag now or shall we shag later Now if they could figure out how to tee the ball up for me I wouldn t have to bend over at all But seriously I find this product to be a vast improvement over the old shag stick that I was using I haven t used it on real grass though just on the practice mat and net I have set up in my garage Given the consistent way the Shag Pro serves em up I think it would also work fine out back 
4 0 Quality all purpose multi tool Before I got the Cybertool Swiss Army Knife for Christmas I already owned two other Swiss Army pocket knives one that s now sold as the Wenger Canyon Genuine Swiss Army Knife and the other which was essentially the same but from the late 80s with the BSA logo from my early days as a scout both of which are small and simple knives I ve used that last knife for almost 20 years now and with proper care it has maintained practically a perfect edge and smooth opening and closure I love it and it s the reason I still go back to Swiss Army knives with proven quality I don t have any real need to try out other brands I ve never been one for the big multi tool knives however but I must say that I love the Cybertool Of course it has all of the standards but the real attraction is in the addition of the screwdriver with 7 interchangeable bits 1 regular and 3 double sided I do a lot of pc hardware work and honestly don t usually need more than one of the phillips head screwdriver bits but the rest even the star bits come in handy if you ve ever encountered security screws which seems to happen more and more frequently For both the screwdriver and the pliers the construction is solid and the alignment is perfect All of the tools open and close solidly and the removable items tweezers toothpick and ballpoint pen are held firmly in place It was always the size of the larger multi tool knives that turned me off but this one is just right Big enough to house everything I need but not so large that it feels heavy and cumbersome in my pocket I gave the knife a rating of 4 for three simple reasons The first one is the translucent body Maybe I m just a traditionalist here but I would have preferred the choice of solid red or bare metal I just don t like the translucent plastic But that alone wouldn t have been enough to warrant a lower rating A bigger issue is the wire snip on the pliers a smart addition to the knife but so small it can be difficult to use The leverage is there to make the cut but the depth isn t I have to do two cuts even with 18 gauge wire And I only bring this up because there is room to make it slightly deeper and wider The other problem is the placement of the hook Instead of opening from the end of the knife on the top it opens from the bottom with the hinge in the middle Placement on the top of the knife would have allowed it to be twice as long as it is while giving greater mobility and hence functionality Had its placement been swapped with the can and bottle openers I could see myself using it more often Overall a great knife and one I d not hesitate to recommend to other hobbyists While it s specifically marketed as a cyber tool it would also be helpful as general tool for anyone working with small parts 
5 0 Excelent product Very useful The product came fast Excelent material of tools Many tools for many uses It s not very heavy The traslucent make the knife a little more cool Every tool get outs easily the blades have enough edge 
5 0 Great Value for the Price My boyfriend and I bought the matching mens and womens bikes and were able to assemble both of them in under an hour The directions made it seem more difficult than it was and since the bike only has pedal brakes you skip the long and difficult section for installing the hand brakes I preferred the look of the bike without the front fenders so chose to leave them off giving it more of a beach cruiser appearance We use the bikes to ride around town and for strolls along the boardwalk It is perfect for us and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive mid quality bicycle that will be ridden mainly for pleasure 
4 0 assembly of bike is a challenge I am a 60 years old lady with probably average technical understanding The advertisement for the bike said minor assembly is required But it turned out that the assembly was somewhat of a challenge not only to me but also to my husband We only learned from the Owner s Manual that the following tools were required Philips head screw driver 4mm 5mm 6mm 8mm Allen keys Adjustable wrench or a 9mm 10mm 14mm 15mm open and box end wrenches a pair of pliers with cable cutting ability We did not have all those tools at the house and I had to go out and borrow from friends It would have been v e r y helpful if the required tools had already been included in the package In addition the Owner s Manual covers many different types of bikes and it was not always easy to find the paragraphs relevant to the assembly of this particular bike It took me two days to finally get everything together Other than that this China made bike with coaster brakes is comfortable and sturdy and I now ride it happily around the neigborhood 
5 0 GREAT BIKE I FEEL LIKE A KID AGAIN THIS IS A GREAT BASIC NO FUSS BIKE IF YOU READ THE DESCRIPTION IT DOES SAY IT IS A SINGLE SPEED HOW UNFAIR THAT THESE RATINGS WHICH WERE THE BUYER S ERROR SHOULD BE POSTED I M GLAD I DIDN T LISTEN TO THEM I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT IT S JUST WHAT I WANTED A GOOD OLD FASHIONED BIKE LIKE THE ONE I HAD AS A KID IT SHIPPED FAST AND ARRIVED SAFELY 
5 0 I love my bike For years I have tried to find a bike like the ones we had when I was a kid I want to ride a bike for the enjoyment of the trip no hand brakes no gears to worry about no leaning forward and holding my neck at an uncomfortable angle so I can reach the handle bars This bike is exactly what I have been looking for I love it I wouldn t trade it for a dozen of those fancy bikes I did not have a problem with shipping it arrived when I was told it would One fender is slightly bent but it is not very noticeable I recommend it for anyone who wants to ride for pleasure instead of for sport 
5 0 Harbinger wristwrap gloves Love these gloves Use them for mountain biking for wrist support and palm padding Also use them for floor workouts for support when bearing weight on hands Of course always use them for weight lifting easy to adjust stiffness I bought two sets for birthday gifts Very well made Had very good experience with vendor 
5 0 Long Lasting Gloves Recommended The rubber grip on the palm and fingers helps a lot and these gloves don t get ripped to shreds in a few months like some others I ve used in the past The built in wristwraps are great If you don t like wristwraps there s another slightly cheaper version without them 
5 0 Excellent I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them Works very well for working out hard heavy lifting And fast delivery 
4 0 Only marginally better than the cheaper gel padded Harbinger 130 Harbinger makes a great weight lifting glove My last pair Harbinger 130 endured three years of 5 day a week heavy lifting ok heavy is subjective but a 315lb shrug is a good glove test I replaced the black gel padded harbingers with these and am ambivalent about the improvements First I do not see a whole lot of merit to encasing the back of the hand in leather especially since the back is only single stitched The flexible fabric on the cheaper gloves worked fine and wasn t subject to loose threads Secondly the rubber pads are never going to be as flexible as the gel pads Perhaps if I was pressing 450 instead of half that then it might make a big difference but then I have seen guys get that weight barehanded as well One serious advantage these gloves do have over the less expensive ones is that the finger tip leather goes all the way to the end and is triple stitched for reinforcement My fingers eventually cut crescents out of the unreinforced finger ends on the 130s 
5 0 Best quality lifting gloves available These are hard to find locally for me Denver and are usually priced higher than here on Amazon by at least five to ten bucks I use the XL gloves and have rather large hands in general so I can t comment on the other reviewers complaints about decreased grip problems I find these help my grip tremendously as the standard 45lb 2 olympic bars are just too skinny for my hands and rip them up considerably The extra padding on these gloves allows me to have the entire bar circumference touching only the glove material namely the rubber pads When I wear my XL gloves and curl my fingers around the bar the leather fingers essentially go all the way to the tip After using these for about 4 6weeks 3 5sessions per week I put them through a wash and dry cycle with regular clothes cause they do get stinky kinda like neoprene stinky but a bit more sour They never bleed always come out perfect almost like new and any slack or looseness that developed during use comes out and they re tight again I ve had about 7 pairs of these now going back at least six years They last usually about a year or more with hard use Typically a stitch line gives out or the velcro gives out I frequently loosen and tighten throughout a workout but I ve also worn down the rubber patches and loosened them enough from the leather surround that the glove isn t comfortable although usually still usable I suppose if I wanted to go until they were destroyed they d last about two years By far the best wrist wrap heavy lifting glove I ve ever used and a relative bargain 
5 0 Great gloves once broken in I lift about 3 times a week This is my second pair of Harbinger gloves The last pair I had lasted me about 5 years and so I was sold on Harbinger quality Harbinger also fits me better than some gloves Basically I don t have fat hands but I do have fairly long fingers In addition to fit and quality I was looking for additional finger protection and wrist wrap protection which these glove have The gloves are a washable leather I have not washed this pair yet but my previous pair were washed several times with no ill effects to the gloves or to other items in the laundry Everything about these gloves is great I especially like the extended finger coverage which goes past the lowest knuckle on me up to the midpoint before the next knuckle I used to tape there but no longer have to The only minor downside is the Big Grip feature which are imbedded rubber pads in the palm and fingers The rubber takes a few sessions to break in and so in the meantime it s not very flexible It is most noticeable on curls where the additional bulk of the rubber prevented me from closing my fist as much around the bar One of the rubber pads was also digging into my finger for a few sessions but I adjusted my grip and that has since subsided If this is a big issue then I would recommend going for the gel padded Harbinger gloves rather than the rubber padded ones I would definitely buy these again and definitely have some loyalty to Harbinger gloves 
5 0 Great Fun I recently got an Anakin Skywalker and a Darth Vader FX saber They are both great They light up great and look even better on camera Highly recommended 
5 0 THIS IS SOOOO COOL i hily reccomend this to anyone who loves starwars when i hold it its just like the real thing and it reacts to every single time you move it IT IS SO MUCH FUN Please get it so you can share my joy And remember IT IS SOOOO FUN = 
5 0 My son says it shreds Jake my son is over the moon with this board Thank yo 
5 0 Nice Board I have been using this board for 4 months now Solid construction No complaints 
4 0 Nice float No problems with fit My son got this as a gift when he was an infant He didn t care for it much then When my daughter was old enough to use it we put her in it and she didn t like it either The problem was my childre who were afraid of water to begin with and only wanted to go in hold us tight When my daughter was old enough to use it my son decided he wanted to try it out and he loved it Works well doesn t tip My kids are skinny and it fit both of them 
4 0 Not a Babysitter For those who wrote this item is unsafe it is not meant to be a babysitter for your infant It is designed as a fun toy to place your infant in while under constant parental supervision I have had no problem with it and my six month old loves it She hated being held in the pool and this gives her just enough freedom to have fun while still being safe 
5 0 we had good luck with this one too My son loved it and has gotten good use out of it and now we plan on using it with our newest son too 
4 0 Review on deluxe baby boat I bought this item and only used 2 times My baby dont like the stand holes too small and cause she is not feel comfortable when swim in the pool Anyway this product is good but just dont fit for my baby only 
5 0 A very cute boat My daughter used this boat when she was about 6 months old It was the first time she went swimming We had a little trouble getting her legs in it but she had a lot of fun I think the holes for the legs should be a little bigger She really liked when her daddy pulled her around the pool Except for the small leg holes I think this was a good buy 
4 0 A Great Gift for the Summer I am an expectant mom and look forward to using this boat a gift next summer with my daughter In the meantime my friend brought her 9 mo old son to swim with me last week and he LOVED the boat He had a great time and supervised as suggested it worked great for him when we wanted to float around and not hold him in both arms He s hit the teething stage and tried chewing on the rings balls at the front but his sharp little chompers didn t damage the boat at all He did try to lean into the water from the sides but with mom or me holding onto the boat handy little handles and keeping an eye on him as all should in a pool with a kiddo he didn t get very far Very effective for getting past the initial introduction to a pool 
5 0 Nice lock This lock is real nice and seems very strong the thick frame on my bike required me to mount the lock vertically below the seat post which worked out pretty good The key with the built in light is a nice added feature I recommend it 
5 0 neck warmer This is a wonderful product if you have a cold neck or trouble holding it up I heat it in the microwave and put it on my neck It s a little heavy but it s also longer than others I ve had The price is I think very reasonable I love it klutzy 
4 0 Nice Scooter This was a Christmas gift for my daughter Only complaint it should come with a kick stand But other than that she loves it 
4 0 Smooth ride This is a smooth ride I chose this model based on an Amazon review which noted that the larger wheels make for a smoother ride The customer service at Razor is terrible though They take weeks to respond to e mails and they don t know about the products other than what is on their website I had a difficult time researching which Razor to purchase 
4 0 My teen daughter loves her scooter I m not exactly sure why it was a bit more expensive but she swears it s so much nicer than her old one I ll take her word for it The blue is very pretty and neutral enough that she loved the color My only complaint is my 3 year old son pulled on the handle and actually broke it Seems like it should be a bit more sturdy than that since he s 3 Anyhow it s a great scooter 
5 0 A parent s dream scooter This scooter rocks It was delivered quickly and it required no assembly It is very sturdy and can be easily folded to store My 8yr old loves it He has been riding it everywhere 
5 0 better than old razor I bought this for my year old son to replace his old razor scooter My son isn t the most coordinated of children and wasn t able to glide much on his old scooter This one looks very close to the old scooter but it is much easier for him to glide and keep his balance The wheels are bigger and there are some other minor adjustments that help and it doesn t look like a toddler razor at all Hope this help 
4 0 Very Good Kid s Scooter The Razor A3 is a very good kid s scooter It s pretty well built see below solid easy to use easy to learn Our son loves it It s a little bit hard to close but that s not a bad thing really Almost immediately a piece of plastic that wraps around the front of the bed has come loose It doesn t seem to have much function other than cosmetic but still shouldn t happen and gives the impression of less than excellent craftsmanship At 44 for the scooter I can t complain too much I d recommend this scooter we d buy it again and would recommend to others 
5 0 After recall an excellent multifunction HRM The first X6HRM I purchased was very flaky with the screen blanking out after a button was pushed I was about to return it but found out there was a recall The new unit functions flawlessly and is great if you have regular workouts you do With altimeter HRM and timer saving data you can download workout profiles to your PC average software but functional and overlay curves to check progress during the season or year to year The only minor complaint is that the unit sucks down batteries They re easy to replace though so buy a few spares 
4 0 smooth ride results These skates provide great comfort and support a very smooth ride and a great workout I have only been using them for a week and can already feel a difference in my midsection The quality and price are outstanding Unlike other brands these skates are true to size so you can order the same size as your shoes no crazy math involved 
5 0 Da Top Bike The only bad thing about it is the seat is uncomfortable but other than that the shocks work perfectly and the brakes are so good that you stop instantly and almost fly over the handlebars And the gears shift perfectly It s an awesome stylish one of a kind bike I am eleven years old and I am 5 feet tall Even so this bike is easy for me to ride 
5 0 Awesome Bike for the Price This bike is smooth riding and packs great features Shifting is easier than any other bike I have ridden Only downside I can think of is the seat is a bit hard but an upgrade takes care of that 
4 0 Good bike Assembly is quite easy The bike was in fact mostly assembled The frame fits moderate to taller riders best Everything is quite smooth The front disc brake is worth the extra few ounces if you are heavy and needed the extra stopping power The most disappointing thing about this bike is its rather heavy weight at 37 pounds Otherwise it is a fairly good bike with good looks Okay if you paid no more than 150 to 200 for it 
5 0 Easy to Use These great free weights are covered neoprene to make them easier to hold You won t mind working out with these weights at all 
5 0 Get a Great Torso Workout Work your abdominal muscles without doing sit ups Its compact size and ease of assembly makes this a great purchase 
5 0 Great for abs and back I really like this piece of equipment The instructions for setup were easy to follow and assembly was simple There were no damaged pieces It is very sturdy and looks like it will last for years I get a great workout of my abdominal muscles I think its easier than doing situps because your legs are held in place by the supports plus you are working out more muscles by hyperextending the abdominals I don t use it as much for extending the back but is similarly easy to use The first time I used it my torso was sore for a few days now I am using it almost every day and seeing results in just a few weeks Its not too big and have room to leave it in a corner of my bedroom so I can use it quickly in the morning or evening 
5 0 Great value great product I ve had back problems for years due to spurs on my spine When I used a Roman Chair years ago my back always felt great I love this piece of equipment It s comfortable to use it was easy to assemble feels stable when I use it and really gives me a strength building workout for my back I haven t tried all of the adjustments yet but I m sure I ll be able to vary my workout quite a bit with them Value comfort adjustable and durable an overall a great value for the price I got the Ironman 3 Station Power Tower with the Apex Roman Hyperextension Bench together the price cannot be beat 
4 0 Roman Chair I have had experience with this type of product for many years and it is very useful in maintaining a healthy back This particular Roman Chair works well but could be easier to use if the handles extended out further The abbreviated style handles make it somewhat more challenging to get into and out of the bent over position 
4 0 Good Value for the money Good quality roman chair that was easy to assemble It is pretty comfortable and stable when being used 
5 0 great product great company I chose the 35 mm version of these fenders to put on my commuter which I ride on 28 mm tires I was looking for full coverage fenders to keep me and my frame from getting mucked up riding through the rainy Seattle winter The support bar attachment points are very sturdy on the fender end made entirely of metal not plastic and riveted to the fender Some older Mt Zefal fenders I had before had plastic clips that broke after a few too many bumps to the fender The Nyloc nuts that secure the support bars to the fender attachment points can be readjusted as you get the fenders centered over your tires but I imagine their built in locking effect will wear off in the unlikely event you need to fuss with them more than several times nothing some Loctite wouldn t fix though The mudflaps are flexible rubber and are very securely riveted to the ends of the fenders Your pant legs and the folks riding behind you will thank you for the extra coverage I hate catching up to rainy day cyclists with partial or no fenders I try to be careful about my bike but the fenders get bumped occasionally and these hold up wonderfully to the abuse flexing and springing back into place I ve put the bus bike rack arm over the front fender without any problem though I don t do that often The fender surface is smooth and accepts stickers well in case you re into reflective tape or other safety decorative measures Finally I really dig Planet Bike for devoting 25 of their profits to bike advocacy 
5 0 Good Service The product arrived on time and was exactly what was described I would buy from this vendor again without hesitation 
5 0 Bought this as a gift for my 15 year old nephew he loves it He is always into air time snowboarding or skateboarding He loves this toy 
5 0 Cool product i used this product last weekend and thought it worked well steve and i were able to compare our jump time to each other though i wish we didnt have to share the air pod meant loaning it to him after every run a lot of people on the mountain liked it and had never seen anything like it 
5 0 This thing is SICK I tried out the AIR POD last weekend on my first trip to the mountain this season I never heard of Tech4O before but they have a nice site with some other really cool watches and stuff on it I m still not sure how it works but it is so cool AIR POD can tell the exact second you leave the top of the kicker and measure your airtime until you land Me and a friend of mine had a little comp to see who was going bigger off the same kicker and the most air I was able to get was 3 45 seconds Even when we didn t totally stomp the landing or washed out a little bit the AIR POD still recorded our air time perfectly The strap was a lot more comfortable than I thought it would be and the light made it easy to check my air even when it started to get dark The last couple of seasons all I did was hit the rails and boxes in the park but those got old Getting an AIR POD really makes getting bombing the mountain for huge airs fun again I m defintely gonna keep it my bag with the rest of the stuff I always bring to the mountain 
4 0 Handles well nice product We have really liked it One of the attachments for the cover was broken in the box but InStep shipped us one out without a problem I would recommend this stroller 
4 0 PERFECT IN EVERY WAY except for The lower compartment could be easier to access and could include a parent console I went online and found that InStep does indeed sell the console but only for the single stroller Other than that it is GREAT Even better is the price beats that BOB anyday Would definitely recommend for all moms who need to restrain those active kids and go for long walks jogs My 2 and 3 yr old heavy boys sit in it for 2 hours almost every day and I barely have to push it with my finger 
5 0 Great Stroller for Walks in the Neighborhood I bought this stroller recently and am compelled to write a review because I love it so much It is such a wonderful stroller It glides easily even with one hand It is also very easy to open and close and is relatively lightweight as far as double strollers go It stores nicely when collapsed too It has great rubber wheels that make the ride very smooth for the passengers and extremely easy to steer for the adult I did a lot of research on double strollers and this one seemed like the best to me And it is the best I did read a lot of complaints regarding the seats especially that they don t sit upright which is true But I have found that my daughter enjoys sitting up and holding on the bar She leans back when she wants to rest She hasn t had any issues with the seat luckily I was worried about that But it turned out to be no problem I must say however that while the stroller is FANTASTIC for walks runs trips to the park etc it may be too large for using in stores I have a tandem stroller that I keep in the car for shopping I use this stroller solely for outside trips 
5 0 Instep customer for life After hours of searching for the right stroller it only took me a few minutes after finding Instep and talking to their excellent customer service to know that I had found the perfect one for my family We were so excited once it arrived little assembly was required and we were on our way Transporting it is effortless because it folds easily and fits right in the trunk I use it everyday whether at the mall walking around the block or jogging My children are very comfortable and love the smooth ride It s a very attractive stroller and I get compliments from people all the time It was worth every dollar spent and we will use it for years to come It also provides peace of mind to know that if we ever did have a problem or more questions Instep will be there to give us superior customer service 
4 0 A great stroller I bought this stroller for my twin girls who are almost 2 They had out grown their front back duo glider so they love the side by side stroller It pushes so easy and light and w the swivel front wheel option it is perfect for going shopping or walking I do like that the wheel will lock in the event I do want to use it as a jogger The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the storage basket underneath is WAY under the seats and is small I have to get on my knees to reach under there to put things in and get things out and the diaper bag will not fit because there is not enough height room between the basket and bottom of the seats I would also like a stroller caddy to go across the top bar a place w a cup holder and storage for keys phone etc I do not think you can purchase one for the double stroller Other than that it is a great stroller and a good price I definitely recommend it for moms that need a side by side stroller but need to be able to cruise the mall or take walks because it is easy to handle It also folds and un folds very easy 
4 0 good value Nice little 3 AAA light for the price not sure of the runtime though I would guess its about 2 hours near 75 100 percent and then run for about 2 3 hours at a steady decline this is my best guess dont hold me to it though The 8 LED s are bright its pretty compact about as wide as your palm and roughly 1 25 in diameter I like it has an octangular shape and will sit without rolling in or on a nightstand Its a good light at home but not sure of its weather proofing I m not sure how well it would do or how reliable in wet weather therefor i I would not use it on the road and surely not in military police lighting 4 stars for for it neat design and brightnes 
5 0 Wedjat I was given a Sona 8 LED for Christmas and I now plan to replace all my other flashlights with this wonderful little flashlight cars basement garage and other emergency areas The light from this flashlight really incredible These are the type the lights that you would want to carry in your vehicles 
5 0 GREAT WORKOUT I purchased this product after I saw a commercial on TV The first day I used it I was sore The next day wasn t any better I ve been using it for three weeks combined with a healthy diet and I ve lost 7lbs and my clothes fit a lot looser I am not a person who sticks to diets and exercises but this I am able to do The instructor is not annoying at all She moves very quickly through the entire exercise before you know it the 20 minutes are up When I first got this I honestly expected something completely different When I was about to use it for the first time I honestly was going to send it back because I thought what real difference can a little machine make But it makes a lot of difference It makes the workout a little more difficult and you don t have to exercise as much as you would just by regular exercise I ve read some other reviews on this product that claim that bruising occurs however I ve been using this product and I do not have any bruises from it If you are looking to lose weight gain energy or just tone up purchase this product 
4 0 Just got it and I can FEEL it working Just got this product a week ago have used it every other night and can feel the difference already Mind you I am eating healthy and doing cardio rollerblading You can feel it working when you use it The video after the first couple times watching it gets pretty boring I just do the routine myself adding a couple reps to each set without the video Good buy 
4 0 The Zone I ve had the Zone Pilates for about 5 months and just started using it 3 weeks ago I have noticed a difference in my clothes fitting although I ve only lost 1 pound The commercial claims you only need to use it 20 minutes 3x a week which is all I have been doing it The excercises are very beginner but the tape includes an advanced section The instructor is not annoying and she moves quickly through the routine THe first day after I first used it I could barely walk Everything was so sore but now I have no problems Its getting over the initial soreness I would recommend this to anyone who is out of shape and wants to start out slow I usually hate excercise but I have had no problem staying motivated to do this 
5 0 Beautiful high quality yoga mat Yes I am still airing the mat because of the strong smell and it s getting better But it s also very sturdy and supportive and it s going to be the prettiest mat in the studio by far It doesn t curl at the ends like my other mat either I would recommend this mat because of the durability and nice color especially for the price 
5 0 waves of calm At first glance I was very excited the product looks really pretty very much like caribbean blue running water Once the chemical smell hit my nose I was horrified I would never have taken this into a yoga studio much less used it in my home My yoga teacher gave me a tip on getting rid of the horrid stench I simply tossed it in my regular washer not recommended in instructions on gentle cycle with a very small amount of Tide detergent Once finished I rolled it in a towel to dry it and then let it air dry for a a couple of days It was good to go and now I love it Every time I use it I feel like I am floating on water going somewhere thats not stressful I definetly recommend the product but wash it first 
5 0 Nice Scooter My 14 year old just loves his scooter he 5 9 and he has a blast on it it is WELL MADE Nice product glad we got it 
5 0 scooter this was a huge hit my girl loved it and it s hot pink perfect she can t wait to get it outside to ride around this is perfect for the summer and for providing hours of entertainment 
5 0 Screamer for that little one I bought this for my six year old She was up and running on it in about 20 minutes There is really no assembly aside from putting the handlebar on out of the box Very sturdy design with easy adjustable handlebar height Worth every penny and better than a bike 
5 0 Twins We have two Kick Scooters and we like them very much We are 7 years old We learned to ride them and glide in two days They are nice and light and fold up neatly One is pink and one is blue and we bought helmets also 
4 0 razor mania My kids recieved them for christmas before they could get outside They were able to ride them on our hardwood floors without making marks and in a small area Once outside they have held up to everyday use in wet and dry conditions Well worth the money spent on these Great way to keep the kida active 
5 0 Perfect for snorkling My husband and I went on a snorkling vaction to the USVI I got persription lenses for my mask but was faced with delimma of how to carry my eyeglasses with me so I could see when finished I didn t want to leave them on the beach neither did I wish to leave the rental jeep keys and my DL unattended I used this wonderful folding wallet It had room for my glasses my Driver s license money CCs and the Jeep key I m sure a thin cell phone would have also fit Very versatile and COMPLETELY air tight This item is lightweight it floats so position it to avoid a square sunless patch on your back I wore mine over one shoulder Excellent product 
4 0 Disney trip We used these on a recent trip to Disney World to over come the FL water They helped us save over 20 person because we did not buy bottled water 
4 0 Good Starter AEG This is a good gun overall Solid construction The most I can get in the magazine is 38 It may hold more but given the resistance I m meeting at 38 I don t want to force it The loading tube makes it easy to reload The velocity is significantly slower than advertised It says 240 FPS but I would estimate that it is less than half that This is my fourth airsoft gun and the slowest Although it has a hop up even with it off the pellets still rise considerably From 30 feet to hit the waist aim at the feet It is a good starter gun for a first AEG and will work well in close combat Airsoft Central provided really fast shipment Amazon estimated delivery date was anywhere from 31 March to 5 April Recieved it on 29 March 
5 0 Favourite Many U14 players on our team are biased towards this racquet because of its sweet sweet spot It s simply a racquet that allows you to FEEL tennis while you play 
5 0 Liquidmetal Instinct The HEAD Liquidmetal Instinct Racquet is a wonderful racquet for intermediate and advanced players as said above It gives the player more control which is needed for a child or adult who isn t the best at tennis Later on you can add more power but this is a very nice racquet to help your form The colors are orange and silver which is different than most racquets Overall I like this racquet very much 
5 0 Best Pump Ever I ve been looking for a pump with a gauge on it for a long time With this pump I no longer have to guess how much air is in the ball Now I can tell exactly how much air is in the ball before and after I pump it up 
4 0 Beaded Ropes 7 foot This is definately what I was looking for but I chose the wrong size A 7 foot jump rope is probably better for kids 
2 0 Raider helmets I have this raider helmet and I d have to say the same thing as the last review I needed a helmet and went for a cheap one It felt like it If you aren t going to use it that much then you can probably get away with it But I would go for an HJC or a shoei helmet I just purchased an HJC helmet and it feels so much better You get what you pay for 
5 0 Awesome Product I just received the GOfit six pound toning ball tested it out and it is great It has the weight you need to tone your arms and abs but is nice and soft and you get a good grip on it when you are holding it or doing leg exercises I highly recommend it 
4 0 Weight capacity is 275 pounds not 300 This is a nice exercise bicycle that is very sturdy and super quiet My complaints are the bike comes very poorly packaged and my rear stabilizer bar was shattered and I had to order a replacement Also you can not adjust the resistance levels when using one of the 6 preset programs Overall this is a great bicycle and I m very pleased with it 
4 0 good to go received this product in good time but it looked like it had gone through a tornado The bike went together fast but had a bolt missing and the plastic end cap at the rear was smashed Still waiting for replacements after about 3 weeks Soon discovered the pulse didn t work and called cust serv Long story short they were very helpful and friendly sent me two handle bars a new computer and finally a new cord that proved to be the correction needed All in all the bike is is a good buy for the money 
5 0 Very very pleased I received this bike last week and I couldn t be more pleased with it It was easy to assemble seems well built and works exactly as expected The fit and finish is better than I expected and it is probably the quietest mechanical device I ve ever not heard That being said as others have noted the box came pretty beat up but nothing was damaged in mine and all the parts were there I did have a lot of problems with DHL shipping it on time but that is not the bike s fault I had one small problem in that one of the pedal straps seemed a little kinked and would rub against the pedal arm but I was able to adjust that away Nautilus that s who owns the Schwinn exercise equipment name customer service was incredibly helpful and is sending me new straps even though I m not sure I still need them They were really a pleasure to deal with and no hold times All in all I highly recommend this product 
4 0 sloppy but Package delivered with holes dents and dings but all in all all parts were there Easy to assemble This is the 2nd one purchased The first came with a broken water bottle and the second had a cracked plastic rear stabilizer other than that it was fine Thank yo 
5 0 This bike is awesome This is by far the best purchase I have made in years Although the box was beat up on arrival inside all the pieces were fine My teenage daughter and I had it put together in about 30 45 minutes with no problems The choice of resistance is great and it s size is perfect for a small living room There is virtually no sound you can EASILY watch TV while doing an intense workout and hear every word The bike adjusts to fit almost every height and it even comes with it s own tools so it takes seconds to do You can t go wrong with a Schwinn Great quality and a big bang for your buck 
4 0 A Great Deal If you are looking for an inexpensive yet well made basic exercise bike I highly recommend this As other reviewers have noted for whatever reason I received the box in poor condition including multiple large holes yet ultimately the only problem turned out to be a single missing bolt which I bought for 1 at the local bike shop I put the bike together by myself in about half an hour and it fits snugly into my living room Very sleek and it s a Schwinn which has a great reputation I have been using the bike for about a month and have had no problems with it The seat is relatively comfortable computer works fine etc Oh and the most important thing this is a steal compared to the sticker price you really can t find this bike for under 300 anywhere but Amazon 
5 0 Smart Purchase Once we finally got the bike together working properly we found it very easy to use Very Friendly User Which we both my husband myself believe is a great advantage to help us get on it to use it daily We like it s sleek size fits just right our small living room I must admit in the beginning getting all the pieces here unbroken was challenging Much of a headache but every one we worked with was very friendly and helpful We eventually got it all put together and now we love our bike 
5 0 my favorite for power outages Just went through a one week power outage in Buffalo and here s what helped 1 Crank LED Flashlights are great I had one from Gander Mountain with 3 leds and you could select either one or three leds to light I also used two Lightwave led flashlights the 7 led model and the 3 led model Both are great and lasted all week My favorite was the Freeplay Indigo led lamp Worked great and I carried it everywhere Candles are ok but you can t walk with them they re dangerous and they melt faster than you think 2 Get a led headlamp for hands free up close work I used a Princeton Headlamp but got the most use from a PantherVision ballcap that has 2 leds embedded in the visor Put it on in the morning and it was there whenever I needed it 3 Radios are a must The Freeplay crank radios are great and a must I also grabbed the Safety Cross 6 in 1 crank radio flashlight when I went somewhere I wish it had AM but it s just FM Two other great radios to have are the GE Superadio and even better the Grundig S350 I like the Grundig best because you can forget to leave it on and run out of batteries a great feature The GE Superradio sounds much better and I used it when I needed a break from Emergency Radio to listen to real music The GE uses 6 D batteries and the Grundig uses 5 buy they last forever 4 Check out the Basepump It s a sump pump that operates off your house s water pressure no power required It can be your primary sump pump or added as a power out backup What a great product 5 Didn t have a generator would have been nice not sure I ll get one If you do read the directions and know them cold Start the generator once every 3 months Have an electrician rewire your box so that you can shut your box off and power your entire house from the generator If you are not moving for a long time consider a natural gas backup generator If you want something cheaper and portable everyone raved about the newer Honda generators with the automatic cut back low oil shutoff etc I think it s the Honda EU3000is 6 We had trees down everywhere I had a Fiskars axe the lighter head and a Fiskars hatchet both outstanding tools Didn t have a chain saw but I do now bought the smallest sthil model You really don t need much more than a 12 14 bar 7 Keep some canned in your pantry Fruit Cocktail soup beans tough to eat them cold but they work 
5 0 An excellent base support system to mount your choice of gear I have owned this base support rack system for a long time and loved it s versatility and simplicity Available with locks at each foot that work with a single key you have the satisfaction of knowing your roof rack is secure The Thule 300 system works with cars equipped with rain gutters and is one of the most universal roof rack systems available The load bars are also available in different lengths to accommodate the width of your particular vehicle s roof Thule manufactures a large number of carriers that can be attached to the LB50 load bars including bike trays ski racks boat carriers etc If your car has rain gutters and you are looking for a good sturdy versatile base support system look no further Thule 300 is the best 
4 0 My real name is Shay Don t get me worng I know what im talking about I recived this 8 days ago and this gun CAN compete with those M14 you see on this site the rate of fire IS higher than the 14 s but these gun s have a tendencey because they are shooting so fast to spit out a BB that only goes a few feet but other wise prepared to get blasted by what must be like a a shotgun amount of bullets My daad and I shot at one of our shovels outside our house and we hit it QUITE a few times Only use the iron sight the scope is flimsy and worthless I have even played with this gun during paintball i loaded some 6mm paintballs into it and and snuck behind one of my friend from 15 feet away and unloadded the whole clip on him 
4 0 OK This gun is an okay gun It shoots fast on auto and goes far I have two complaints about this gun 1 The saftey is allways falling out and hard to put back in 2 The trigger is sortof hard to use Some times when i want to go auto it dosent insted it just burst or single shoots Also my battery last really long so i dont know what so other people where talking about This is a all around good gun 
4 0 Overall good rack I got this rack about a month ago it fits right over my spare and the great thing is it can be adjusted if you have an off center spare mine s a CRV Very easy assembly It can also be swicthed from car to car easily The only drawback here is that it is not actually locked onto the car so it could be stolen right off the tire when it isn t in use and the bike with it What I did was to buy a small chain and lock and I just locked the rack to the car The bike locks to the rack to insure security when I m in places I don t know well Overall a good rack for the price The other off center spare rack is the Thule a minimum of 160 00 even from EBay and the assembly is harder 
4 0 The best way to begin a baseball cards collection As I stated in the main title this is the best way I know from Italy to begin a collection of baseball trading cards Everytime I purchase it it is a surprise mostly a good one and only one or two times I was a little little disappointed A must have for the beginner 
5 0 Very nice Its just what we were looking for in a air bed thank you very muc 
5 0 Great for the Breast Cancer 3 Day I purchased this rather last minute before the Breast Cancer 3 Day Walk It was definitely worth the money It fit great in our two person tent and there was still room for my tentmate to have one also The pump was so easy to work Since there s no electricity on the walk I had to have a battery operated pump but didn t want to have a mattress and then buy the pump separately The built in pump made it so easy 
5 0 Great Product I actually took my Insta Bed camping It was wonderful Very comfortable in my tent 
5 0 Best wraps I found a pair of these at a fight in california They are longer more stretchy and form fitting than any other wrap I have used all kinds these protect and support the best 
5 0 Super shoes I bought these shoes for my Granddaughter s Christmas present and she loves them Very pleased 
5 0 Heeles are great I bought one of these in Poland in I loved them from the first ride It is a lot different than rollerblades but after few minutes you can do superb tricks I started to like shopping it is perfect for riding on the flat floors 
5 0 very cute note shoes are listed in womens size kids sizes are 1 from the size listed example listed size 3= womens size 3 kids size 2 in the tongue but fits more like a kids size 1 hope this helps future shoppers 
5 0 Wow at last the perfect HRM for me Hi I ve used a lot of training devices in the past Polar HRM of several models the garmin X01 GPS models stopwatches even the new Nike iPod combo and this one really takes the cake for me I have a scientific background and work in the tech industry but even though I understand math and engineering it s not what I want when I am working out I want simplicity reliability and features that sit there until I ask for them I don t want to get a degree in deviceology to make it work each and every time I m out for a run hike or bike Sometimes I am training for a marathon or triathlon so I d prefer my unit be capable to help me reach those goals but it has to be intuitive and stay out of the way when I just want to work out This model can expand with GPS or two different bike modules or a foor pod if desired It also can be used with the SmartBelt which will work with the T3 during exercise but the belt stores advanced workout metrics so you could geek out with PC coach and truly train like the pros if you wish The unit is well designed thin utilitarian yet not overly geeky I would take it off for a black tie event but that s about all The batteries in the watch and transmitter are consumer servicable and the built in training software is a joy to use Yes there are five overall modes to the watch and the unit looks good so there are no tiny text to help remind you what buttons do which so you do need to read the manual or get help from someone else at the Suuntu discussion boards that are free online Once you master the basics of how the buttons affect the software you will feel comfortable focusing on your workout and not operating a device I am really impressed how well the unit works and the intelligence and design that went into the interface the training software that is built in as well as how well the display works The built in logs also are great with a 15 most recent workout plus last week last month and the last 6 months cumulative data 
5 0 Cheapest personal trainer around I was impressed with this watch the first day I received and used it It is very accurate and has enabled me to increase my training effect very easily I encourage anyone who works out to buy it Only thing is it came very scratched from Amazon but I was too impatient to use it so I overlooked that 
4 0 Heart Rate Zones Good interface require time to know how it works Display very easy to scratch Training Efect gives you a very good idea the level of your workout Here it s my concern According to Suunto T3 user s guide It calculates the percentages for the Heart Rate Zones without the use of the resting heart rate variable Which method is more accurate Is possible to change the way how my T3 calculate the heart rate percentage I mean including the resting heart rate variable Karvonen method 
5 0 Excellent Heart Rate Monitor I use to have a Polar F5 but once I saw that Suunto had come with a new line of fitness monitors I had to try them Given Suunto s reputation for making excellent quality wristop computers I new they were onto something good and the product lived up to my expectations Althow It s not as easy to use as Polar products It is whithout a doubt a far superior piece of equippment whith a large array of functions a much larger memmory for saving trainig sessions and a beautiful overall design Two thumbs up for Suunto 
4 0 Not for everybody but you will warm up to it The heater element is a slightly different design from traditional heaters like this that haven t changed in thirty years It s flat and lights easier The burner is a friction fit like all the others and can come loose if you shake the unit hard You must use care in handling the liquid fuel for these things This heater is smaller than the big Jon E and it would make more sense to have one of these in each pocket One big Jon E in an inner breast pocket will warm your whole body My tip for lighting the heater is to run hot water over the base of the heater to preheat and volatize the fuel Once running these heaters rely on heat feedback through the case to stay lit 
5 0 Awesome This thing is great be sure to get some heavy bag training gloves with it I m able to punch as hard as I possibly can without killing my hands so it does its job Although kicking is another story its much harder towards the bottom and my foot regrets that hah 
5 0 Everlast 70 lb Heavy Bag Everlast has been around since 1910 They are a brand you can trust and the bags are very durable If you want to get started in boxing or just purchase a bag for exercising this bag is the ideal purchase Buy Everlast they make good boxing equipment classic stuff 
4 0 Great Idea Well Executed Some Nits I ve had my SolLight bottle for about a month now and I m impressed The light is bright enough to be useful and the cap construction panel battery switch is top notch Here are a couple of my nits and or observations 1 The bottle is a polycarbonate but is not the same thickness as the Lexan used in a more trendy Nalgene bottle The sidewalls of this plastic do flex a bit I haven t run into any durablity issues per se but I wouldn t toss this bottle around like my narrow mouth Nalgene s either 2 The battery in the cap is bulky um it s a battery which can take some getting used to when drinking from this bottle You really have to hold the cap from flopping back into your face 3 The light output from the cap isn t as bright as some other LED lights I have but the runtime can t be beat 10+ hours The light is a good lantern for task lighting situations such as rummaging through a bag or reading a book Not so great for lighting a room although the output is adequate to see what you re doing if the power goes out On more positive notes the bottle design has a super wide mouth for easy ice insertion and wash access Also this thing is an awsome conversation starter and is my constant companion booklight too 
5 0 Just what you need I bought this so I could have some light in my tent while hiking It gave off more light than I expected I don t know if I could read by it but it s pretty bright Perfect for those who are trying to cut wt on there hikes and have things pull double duty 
4 0 Cool water bottle light I purchased this for camping canoe trips as a safe inside the tent light When empty it s a bit top heavy but full of water it s fairly stable The white light won t blind anyone but it provides barely adequate light for reading Either light color red or white is fine for a night light The light switch is a bit stiff but it probably won t turn on by accident The top diameter is larger than a wide mouth liter Nalgene bottle So far no complaints 
5 0 Great design and function This utensil is nearly perfect in both form and function Who would have thought a spork could be so aesthetically pleasing I bring this to work with me everyday and I can t imagine a better utensil 
5 0 Best Spork Design Out There More functional and stylish than any other utensil The serrated edge is like a mini knife handy when you need to cut something in the wild or at work 
5 0 Excellent racket real light and loaded with power This is my second Tennis racket i have the Wilson US Open as a beginner and played with it for a year I have been playing with the Head LiquidMetal 8 for a week now and i have to say it is amazing Extremely light on the UPS scale stringed it weighed 60 lbs and packed with a punch this racket has increased my confidence level tremendously i can t blame anything on the racket anymore so i try extra hard and have definitely improved a lot in just a week Look and feel of the racket is definitely a plus it has the integrated vibration dampers so you can t lose it while playing Comes with a full cover in Black and Silver Gray to match the racket I got this with Free Shipping through Amazon MidWest Sports with no tax even the stores can t beat that Got the Racket and 2 cans of Balls delivered at my door for what other stores are selling only the racket for Amazon is the best i am completely satisfied with the whole experience 
4 0 Good product ok video The ball itself functioned as advertised although as others have mentioned it smelled for the first few days after I got it The video was good btu too easy I m a 27 year old guy in ok shape 
4 0 Still a little up in the air on this The ball that comes in the kit seems pretty sturdy thick outer shell should hold up well I ordered the 65cm because I already have a good quality 55cm FitBall but it seems small to me it isn t any bigger than my FitBall to be honest I note another poster said it took over three days for her ball to relax enough to fill it to full size so maybe that is the problem although I got this on a Friday and it is now Sunday The workout starts with alot of lunges which I absolutely detest I don t mind squats but Iunges bother my knees even though I do use proper form Once you get past the lunges the rest of the workout seems pretty good The music was kind of bland and boring something livelier would have been nice 
5 0 Good quality product The product is just as described The video is a bit limited if you want variety but I bought the product mostly for the ball and the video was just an addition to my collection The ball is good quality stays inflated more than I expected 
5 0 Excellent Product This is a great exercise ball It was the exact size I needed It was easy to blow up and the DVD is really great 
4 0 Quite good Actually quite a well rounded and good hard video It really works all your body parts including arms legs back and stomach The people in the video smile a bit too much but the instructor is not too peppy which is good 
5 0 Awesome Ball Workout Worth Every Penny This short ball workout works not only your core but also your lower and upper body using fun unique moves I am an intermediate advanced exerciser and my abs are so sore it hurts to laugh The included ball is good quality not thin like other balls I have used Keep in mind it takes about 3 days to reach full size You will need to pump it up and let the rubber relax before continuing to add air I really enjoyed this workout and the time flew by 
4 0 Have a ball I got this workout loving the FIRM workouts but wanting something a tad easier then the weighted workouts something for variety I got it and figured I d play a bit on the ball it d be fun Well Allie isn t playing She really incorporates a lot of moves and works various body parts in this short 30 minute workout And I felt it in my core all day long This workout will stay in my routine and while it s not as easy as I thought it was still fun 
5 0 Great Customer Service My sons both have a fly bar We have an issue with both When calling customer service I received the best service ever They are replacing one and sending new parts for the other at no charge GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE 
4 0 So glad we got it We were glad we went with this pogo stick It is very durable The boys love having contsts to see who can do the most bounces My husband even joined in on the contest However he just couldnt keep up I will say it was a good call on buying this item 
4 0 This is a very useful addition for any commuter bicycle When I started biking to work I immediately bought a pair of these They were well worth it Rather than trying to balance everything on my person or stuff everything into a backpack I can just throw it into the pannier It s large enough to fit an entire bag of groceries yet it collapses to keep it out of the way if you don t need it The snaps that create a rigid border are a little finicky but otherwise it works as expected 
5 0 Best Help Ever I love this product I didn t realize how dehydrated I was until I purchased this I love knowing where I am all the time with my hydration It s an amazing product So good I bought another for my husband You won t be sorry with this 
4 0 Good with a few reservations My daughter and I have each been using a hydracoach for about 2 weeks They are well constructed and are pleasing to the eye Before I mention a few problems I should state that they achieved their purpose of causing us to drink more water so we continue to use them Now some problems When the bottle is first filled the first few ounces require extra effort to sip The measuring device is not accurate The bottle is 22 ounces but you refill with about 2 ounces left We both found that drinking those 20 ounces registered between 12 16 ounces on the display We compensated for this by reducing our goals e g 100 ounces of drinking equals approximately 75 ounces on the display I found that the ounces on my display will occasionally jump while the bottle is just sitting One time it jumped over 500 ounces Two other times it jumped 5 10 ounces My daughter has not experienced these jumps 
5 0 works for me I m fit and athletic and I don t mind a little blood rush to the head if you are too than you ll like these boots It takes about one minute of hanging to get comfortable on the ankles then after that it s almost like meditation I hang about every other day for 10 20 minutes at a time I usually do it with only socks on for a bit of extra cushion Feels great good stretch very relaxing And if your strong enough just hang from a pull up bar as they are cheaper than special bars and just as strong And it s fun to get the ladies into the boots 
5 0 Excellent product Teeter delivered exactly what they promised I have been very happy with the hang ups and have used them for the last month I have not had any issues and they look to be built very well 
4 0 good quality boots they not the easiest boots to put on but once they on they are secure and comfortable to wear 
5 0 These boots are made for hangin I got these along with the Teeter Hang Ups door rack The boots are sturdy and comfortable Feel confident in getting them They work 
5 0 A must for every home I wanted one of these for a long time I just didn t know it I always loved the Hangup Boots but never bought them because I didn t want the big inversion table Then I woke up one morning with a drive to get the boots and just find something a jungle gym perhaps to hang from And then I saw this rack that hangs in your door It was perfect It installed easily in my studio doorway It can be used for pullups or just something to stretch out with everytime I walk in and out of the room Our daughter is constantly climbing on it and inadvertantly getting great exersise I did get the inversion boots as well and try to find ten minutes a day to hang upside down It gets blood to the brain and takes pressure off the spine You can get a totally different work out being inverted I highly recommend this to everyone but especially fellow yogis Yoga is great for working out back problems and this rack paired with the Hangup boots really helps with strengthening and lengthening the back Cobra pose without a floor I am glad I didn t hessitate in getting this I use it everyday 
5 0 No complaints seem solid haven t used much yet Seem to the best value on the market I didn t research too much but found them to be the apparent best value 
5 0 These boots are great I got a pair of these boots for Christmas and even though I m not sure what all they can be used for they are great The construction is top notch they re easy to use comfortable etc I seen cheaper boots on the market but when I m buying a product to let me hang upside down a few feet above the concrete tile floor in my house I want the best product for the job 
5 0 Works as designed Very simple installation and then you are done until it is time to replace the batteries Remember to install sensors in a manner easy to get to 
5 0 Easy installation My original goal was a replacement rearview mirror with Compass and Temperature but installation would have been very complicated involving major disassembly of the vehicle This unit performs as well if not better and installation was a breeze The compass actually reads out in degrees and appears to be very sensitive The wireless remote temerature sensor was easy to install many choices of location and works perfectly The new mirror that I was considering would have cost more than twice as much as this unit I am very very pleased 
4 0 Very good product It took me approx 30 mins to set this up It was easy to install the temp sensor in the grill under the license plate on my Toyota Sienna I used the included plastic straps I put the unit on my windsheild plugged it in to my lighter drove around in a circle easy to follow instructions It has worked flawlessly since Accurate temp and compass readings Backlight automatically goes on when it gets dark My only complaint is the size of the temp reading it is hard to read from the drivers seat This unit is highly recommended 
5 0 Fantastic tent for 2 ppl Fantastic for 2 ppl much spare space for putting your backpacks or other stuffs next to you Fast building ligh weight and cheap at Amazon 
5 0 Passed initial test Just got back from our first trip with this tent and it performed admirably Set up was quick and easy as was take down We had high winds and rain but the tent felt solid and not a single drop of moisture collected or leaked inside Overall a great product for the price we paid bought it on sale The 5 of 5 rating indicates that the tent is as described and performs all the functions it claims Was very roomy for two and lightweight for its size though it might be a tad heavy for extended backpacking treks still light enough to hike with for a few miles Recommende 
5 0 Why I love this tent First I need to share that I am an avid backpacker Though fatherhood has taken away many opportunities from legit overnight trips I still try to get to the mountains on a regular basis Second I need to share that I work at Amazon and am biased towards this product I was involved in working with Eureka on the tent s design and functionality We designed a tent that was lightweight yet enough room for 3 people There is also a ton of ventilation with 2 doors for easy access both of which can open from top or bottom again more ventilation I am using the tent personally with 2 adults and a small child It s plenty large and certainly reasonable for 3 adults I love the vestibule where I can store our packs if it s raining or even use the area to boil water if there s an intense rain I must admit that I have not personally used this tent in the rain but Eureka builds high quality tents that are seam sealed to prevent leakage Also we wanted a tent where the stitching from the tub floor wasn t near the ground to prevent any water from seeping in via the floor Lastly I like the color Unique but crisp and attractive I think most people will like it particularly University of Michigan fans Hope you enjoy the tents as much as I do If it s not obvious the price of the tent is supposed to be incredibly aggressive to introduce backpackers to Eureka s high quality performance 
5 0 Great bike Wonderful bike for the price My 8 year old daughter LOVES it Easy to assemble and seems very sturdy 
5 0 this works the people who write negative comments about this unit surprise me I ve used many ab machines and none isolate the abdominal region as good as this My gym had one of these and i used it all the time untill someone stole it so i went ahead and forked over the 180 bucks to have it delivered I mean Oprah Winfrey gives it her endorsement what more do you need 
5 0 A New Bowflex Machine Do all your exercises in an upright position with this version of the Bowflex machine It has a smaller footprint than the standard version 
5 0 Good value I bought the Bowflex Xtreme for my wife and now we both use and love it My son and I put it together in about 3 hours with no trouble just follow the instructions carefully After only a few weeks it has made a big improvement in my physique I highly recommend this product It s well made and has a small footprint 
5 0 An underappreciated gem I assume the Extreme is underappreciated because I can t find reviews on it I ve wanted a Bowflex for a decade but have been too cheap and too busy to seriously consider buying one I finally pitched all the cheap substitutes and got the real thing I chose the Extreme because of it s smaller footprint and the ability to do all my exercises upright lying down on a bench at 5 00 a m doesn t do much for my motivation Putting it together was tedious and the instructions were a bit hard to follow because the pictures didn t always fit the process but basic reading and mechanical skills will get you through it The training video is pretty good Tom Purvis knows his stuff I was surprised that some exercises included in the basic program on the poster were not included in the DVD Lame but not an issue with my personal trainer background What I like most about the Extreme is that I can remove the seat and do several exercises sitting on a large exercise ball to add a stabilization challenge to my workout I have also found that I can use the Extreme like a rowing machine when I use an exercise ball It looks like the Extreme 2 which is set up so you don t have to and thus cannot if you want to change cable settings probably wouldn t work with an exercise ball Not sure about that but that s my guess LONG STORY SHORT Excellent construction and design great if your workout space is limited pretty fast switching between exercises leg attachment is worth the extra bucks but watch for specials because you can sometimes get it added for free Great overall deal DOWNSIDES Short term tedious assembly dvd doesn t cover all exercises Long term 210 lbs resistance isn t going to cut it if you re a serious strength trainer which means an extra 100 for two more 50lb rods 
5 0 Great update to a great system I purchased a power pro in 1995 began working with it consistently in 2001 and felt saw immediate results I outgrew the 210 level last year and found they d stopped upgrading bows for the old machine It cost less than 100 per year but I was indignant mostly because I had used it as an expensive clothes hanger for half a decade With the XTLU2 I ve lowered resistance because the bows are new and stiffer I ve also used the lat tower and leg attachment past the point of gosh this is fun to where I feel a nice ache if I neglect those exercises I am upgrading the bows now so they ll be ready when I am I m trying to decide what to do with the old machine They say there were recalls but I didn t experience any problems I can t sell it without the improvements and I shouldn t give it to the Goodwill if there s a danger I need to make friends with fat people who just want to try the machine out Actually this is a pretty cool problem to have at this point Oh the machine is silent so you can work out whenever you have time I get a great sweat within forty minutes and the buzz lasts all day It s like nature slipped me a little Valium 5 that makes dealing with grouchy people easy It is compact so you really can put it in your studio apartment and pretend it s art when people come over Remember that your bowflex is like a toothbrush you don t share it with other people because that would be nasty for both parties Stick to your guns on this one 
5 0 cheap but good I bought this for my 8 year old when it went on sale for just before Christmas I figured I didn t have much to lose he mentioned he would like a skateboard but had never really used one and if it only held up for a short time at least he would be able to try it out Was I wrong This skateboard is very durable my 12 year old and his friends have been using it more than my 8 year old It has had no problem supporting their weight and it glides smoothly all over my house as well as outdoors We have had no problems whatsoever with it and I wouldn t hesitate to tell people to save your and buy this instead if your kid thinks he she wants a skateboard 
5 0 Safe Sturdy Durable I purchased 8 of these child carriers for my bicycle rental shop I have absolutely no complaints about these carriers Most likely it will be difficult for most people to put the carriers together and install it onto their bike but once it is mounted properly it is well worth it I have had the child carriers working for about a year and they have withstood the use and abuse by my customers remarkably well I would recommend this product to anyone searching for a safe sturdy and durable product that any family with little ones can enjoy And I have eight carriers to prove it 
4 0 Really Works The product came quickly was reasonably priced and was easy to figure out no instructions came with it Some assembly was required regarding the belts and their clips I started at 12 lbs and have worked my way up to 20 lbs so far Only drawback I anticipate is that it will be too hot to use in the summer 
5 0 Awesome These are great to use and light weight I use everytime I go camping or hiking 
5 0 A great mobile Our baby loves this mobile It plays music for a long time and we have never had to change the batteries in the 8 months we have been using it unlike our first baby s mobile which needed new batteries monthly We like the feature that allows us to remove the arm and toys but keep the base attached to the crib so the baby can fall asleep to the music even after she has outgrown the mobile pulls the toys off etc 
4 0 Nice Mug for Camping We bought these mugs for camping trips and they are excellent Just right for early morning cups of coffee and hot chocolate while breathing the cool mountain air We like to warm the cups on the grill while heating the water for hot beverages We also use the mugs for water while brushing teeth and I use them for rinsing the dishes The quality is top notch The only reason I didn t rate the mugs with five stars is that I wish they were slightly larger say 12 oz 
4 0 Great little coffee cups This is a great little lightweight coffee cup with a very solid hard enamel coating over metal The only problem was that Amazon just wrapped these in a very thin sheet of parchment paper so two got chipped in shipment Amazon was awesome though and got the replacements to me in two days and paid for return postage The replacements came and were in excellent condition when they arrived 
5 0 essential fitness tool I don t own one of these but I use them at the gym every chance I get I m a big fan of trying new things to stay in shape and the BOSU trainer is amazing balance is crucial to many different things and the BOSU is a great way to prep for the snowboarding season work on surfing technique and simply train your core muscles in ways that you never knew possible This should be a part of everyone s routine 
5 0 David Dodge This knife is of the very highest quality I had bought one some years ago as a gift and always wanted one for myself The price was very good Shipping was fast I would highly recommend this product and company to any who are serious about fine knifes 
5 0 Jansport TX56831 Air Vital Street Tech Daypack It is the best backpack I have ever seen 
4 0 Illuminator Brand name crank flashlight I have two Illuminators One has a radio I use one every night when I walk my dog It gives great light on one and very bright on three LEDs I know there is another brand that doesn t work this well The one with the radio works well also I have been using them for several months 
5 0 Big enough and small enough I bought this pack for my Trek 6000 mountain bike It is just big enough for a spare tube and the Blackburn Airfix inflator multitool It is small enough to fit perfectly under the back of my saddle without any protrusion and small enough not to add too much weight I chose the velcro version because they can be tightened up closer to the bottom of the saddle and more securely The other version seems to hang from the saddle and bounce freely under it As a side note I have the small aero wedge pack with velcro for my Trek road bike because the tube takes much less space A tight fit with both and carrying what I really need in case of a flat chain problem or necessary tweak 
4 0 great skate we bought this skate for our 6 year old i love that it adjusts sizes it is very sturdy and rolls smoothly the only thing that would have made it better if i had known was the brake system for someone so young i would have picked the ABS system the braking is somewhat difficult for someone so young she loves the look though great colors for a gir 
5 0 Pull up bar I purchased this bar for my kids few months ago It was easy to assemble and I fixed that on my porch door My kids like the pull up bar so much that I ended up buying another one and I fixed that in the basement I am highly impressed with the strength of the product Highly recommended MK Pennsyvania 
2 0 Can t remove it The bar worked great and held really well for the first set of brackets but held a little too well for the second set I can t get the bar off anymore The telescoping mechanism stopped working If anyone has any suggestions 
5 0 Chin up bar for your home This bar is great It was easy to put up and the pad on the bar is soft on the hands The only problem with the bar was that we couldn t get the pad to move so it is centered on the bar This is a minor complaint 
4 0 Great This chin up bar works perfectly as described The padding on the bar is a nice addition and wont hurt too much if you run your head into it The only problems I had with it is that while installing the instructions didnt suggest pre drilling holes into the door frame This helps the wood not crack during installation Otherwise instructions are very easy to follow and the frame is very sturdy Im about 180lbs and have had no problems with it It also comes with two extra frame mounts to allow you to move the bar from a chin up bar to a bar to hold your feet down for sit ups Overall a great product 
4 0 Good Doorway Bar I read the reviews about this bar falling down and even though I weigh 220 lbs I bought it anyway As long as you install the brackets it will hold up anyone The main thing I like about this bar is that the brackets will hold the bar for any direction of pulling There are only two downsides to this bar The brackets stick out into the doorway a good 1 1 2 inches on each side Also only one side of the bar has the foam grip 
5 0 Great Item Ever since I started using the chin up bar my upper and lower body strength have improved Thank you 
5 0 solid equipment I ve worn mine since Decemeber of 1999 it s still running strong and accurate Gone through a few Heart Rate Chest straps batteries and also replaced the bezel and strap Would love to by my next Suunto but not ready to pack this one away 
4 0 Exactly what I was expecting Product is very good in comparison with competitors much softer and after 10 minutes of workout you forget that they are on your wrists only negative point a bit too short around the wrist but as I understand they are designed for women anyway 
5 0 Cheap Looking But Great Quality Although these plastic bars may seem a bit flimsy at first the thick quality of the material won t let you down 
5 0 Good This product is made of plastic I thought it was made of steel but it works fine 
5 0 As stated My son has no problems doing push ups with this bar he is happy with this item 
4 0 surprisingly decent I bought these a year ago at Oshman s now Sports Authority because they are remarkably light and easy to take apart and reassemble during trips Even though they are all plastic I never had any problems with them not being strong enough 
4 0 My review I sat in the chair I m 5 4 I bought the chair for someone who is 6 2 and 250lbs I think it ll fit him a lot better I liked the material the chair was made of and the fact that the pillow was detachable It was well made for a larger perso 
5 0 Bicycle fenders Great fenders for bicycle Made for a bike with standard brakes though my bike has disc brakes had to use a litlle of my McGuiver skills to make it work Again this is made for regular brakes so if you buy this product be prepared for a little extra work on installation 
4 0 Nice Fender Set These are tough plastic fenders that won t rust and have pre mounted stainless steel support rods Since these are a universal mount it took a little thought to mount them on my bike One of the mounting tabs did not work on my bike so I had to drill out the rivet that held the tab and drill a hole in the rear fender to mount it Had to remove the rear wheel to mount the rear fender so some tools are required and I had to supply the mounting screws 
5 0 Excellent Foot Product Despite its awkward size it was comfortable to wear and did what it was supposed to do 
5 0 very versatile trainer As a personal trainer I have yet to find a more versatile piece of equipment It s a great ab and core workout but I also use it for upper and lower body exercises with and without weight as well I highly recommend this for beginners as well as veterans to exercise You ll love it 
5 0 Love it I just received my treadmill and I absolutely love it It arrived much earlier than expected and was a snap to put together My husband had it working in less than an hour He s a big guy and the deck is the perfect size It also has a cushioned deck which prevents jarring of knees and back It is very sturdy and should last the distance I would highly recommend this treadmill 
5 0 A WORKHORSE FOR A HORSE OF A WORKOUT Needed a treadmill and saw this was top rated in Consumer Reports Though it s pricey I m tall and big and saw this could handle my size and stride I ve never had a treadmill and knew some baby model wouldn t do the job BOWFLEX has one of those pricey but good quality names I thought much like BOSE for sound systems They both are B s also It was a snowy Friday in Wolfeboro NH when it was to arrive only a week from ordering and EAGLE USA delivering it Was going to order from one of those sports outlets but look at the delivery reviews they are terrible So I flew with the EAGLE Called them to make sure it was going to arrive during the big snowstorm storm that day in the 12 5pm slot they said it may be a bit late and even called to say it would be there at 5 30PM and we all waited for it longingly looking out the picture window Yes they arrived at 5 30pm and manhandled the truck into the driveway backwards to my open garage while his sidekick surfed on the loading lift of the truck almost falling off I slipped them a 20 he barked Give it to the kid so they would deliver it over the threshhold into my basement which they did I went up to watch tv and my wife had it assembled in 2 hours without me she said it would have taken longer had I been there helping I did help actually with one piece fitting it in a bit not sure why it was a bit tight but we got it together This thing is a monster as it weighs well close to my weight It is not junk as it feels top flight and looks it I don t plan to move it at all Use it every day now and already can feel and see the difference after 2 months The programs are a but much for me so far so I just set lift and speed as I need to in the 20 minute general program Eventually I hope to use the programs as there are a lot of them I like how it tells you miles and calories burned I like to watch the display changing beats watching an EKG in a hospital bed The fan at highest setting is too weak for me and you can t aim the direction so only benefits me much as I m tall if I m slumped over gasping for air which is a lot of the time If I could get the heart monitor around me my wife says Don t even try I would use it Maybe in a few more months Well this is a great unit especially here in central NH where 8 months of the year are inhospitable unless you re Yukon Cornelius Jack Don t know why I m up here but I know I ll live long with my BOWFLEX SERIES 7 Thank you and happy treading SHAMBO from Wolfeboro NH 
5 0 Great quality I have no regrets I was reluctant to spend the money on this treadmill at first However after reading independent professional reviews on treadmills I decided to try it I m glad I did I have no complaints about this treadmill in terms of it s functionality and appearance It works wonderfully It feels sturdy I can run on it b c it has plenty of room I keep it folded up when not in use so it really doesn t take up an enormous amount of space it is big though don t get me wrong The only thing to keep in mind is that it s HEAVY It really does require two people to get it in your home and set it up 
4 0 Nice Treadmill but absolutely terrible shipping The treadmill is high quality and runs fine although it is a bit on the loud side when running on it The features and settings were exactly what we were looking for However be warned about the free shipping Amazon contracts local shipping companies to deliver the product I thought everything was going to be good when the shipping company called me to set up a delivery window But when they arrived they laughed when I said that I cleared the way down the steps to the back basement entrance where the treadmill would be placed The main delivery guy said Man what are you trying to do break my back He then proceeded to tell me that the delivery was for threshold delivery and that meant that they would carry it to the threshold of the front door He then said that if I wanted it brought somewhere else I needed to pay extra and make those arrangements ahead of time It got a little ugly at that point and told them that their delivery slip said nothing about which threshold to bring it to So I gave them the choice of bringing it to the threshold of my back door or loading it back up on the truck They reluctantly agreed to bring it to the back door After they left I realized how heavy this thing really is I estimated over 300 lbs It took all I could muster to get the box over the sliding door track and inside the house Even if you broke down the box and carried the pieces in one by one the treadmill motor portion of the device is all one piece and is easily 200 lbs The only other pieces are the console and support arms which weigh very little by themselves I ended up straining my back in the process of bringing it in I am most angry at Amazon for not making it clear that the delivery was only to the door not inside Also Amazon did not offer any other shipping options at the time of the order I will definitely think twice about ordering a large item from Amazon again 
5 0 great treadmill Our family is enjoying the Bowflex series 7 treadmill as part of our exercise routine It is great because it is so easy to use and fairly quiet We set it up in front of the television and the time goes by fast 
5 0 Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill Works as advertised Heavy industrial strength At around 300 pounds had to dis assemble the box before moving individual components to the second floor Need at least two people to move the shipping box from home entry to workout area in the home Using it everyday Easy to fold up and down Easy to program and use Nice safety cord feature will stop the treadmill Heart beat sensor in hand rails does not work consistently Heart beat monitor chest strap works great Some assembly required but not too difficult On board three speed fan is a nice touch The treadmill runs relatively quiet in relation to running on it We love it 
4 0 Come on a penny I got 20 of these for a project and just for the hell of it I loaded em all up and shot through a clip in each One had so little power I couldn t actually feel the impact from 2 away Another seemed to want to shoot at 90 degrees from where you were actually pointing the remaining 18 were actually pretty spry And hell at this amount with shipping I was paying a buck a gun A buck for a toy gun with a removable clip and a working slide is good enough right there the fact that they shoot is a bonus 
2 0 Not The Best Gun When i got the gun i took it outside to shoot it and it went about 2 or 3 yards It is still a good gun for 00 01 
5 0 great gun for one penny even though the total price ends up being about 6 dollars it s still a great gun for that much money 
5 0 Great gun a must buy for all starters Buy 2 I did and the first one was broken but the other one has been working great now must have gone through 150 bb s already Great gun Must Bu 
5 0 Way worth it thumbs up Fun little guns i shoot my little brothers with them when they get out of line they only sting a little probably clock in at around 100 150fps Way worth the 7 02 Loved them 
5 0 EXCELLENT PRODUCT WELL WORTH THE MONEY I bought this Scuttle Bug for my 2 year old son he loves it Everything about this product is wonderful I would highly recommend buying this If you are limited on space it is not a problem just fold it up stick it in the closet I definitely give this 5 STARS 
4 0 Too small I thought this trike would be perfect for my toddler who is 22 months and still a little too short for the 10inch trikes Unfortunately he is way too big for this item It isn t adjustable at all and is really more suited towards a one year old I wish it was just a little taller because it is a great design and seems very durable 
5 0 Thera band balance trainer Excellent product Using it for knee rehab but it also work well for my wife with foot and heel problems Much more difficult than the blue or green foam models Very well constructed I weight almost 200 pounds and it handles my weight well adds a lot of challenge to balancing exercises 
5 0 its good this gun is good but my friend got one that shot like shiz he couldnt hit me from 5 feet away with a shot right at my body idk what was up with his but airsplat took it back and gave him a refund airsplat always has excelent service 
5 0 Wow this gun is very nice ive had it for about a mounth now and i use 25 grams i can hit a stopsign 200ft away withease especially when you get a scope and tune it in DOESNT COME WITH SCOPE overall it is a great gun and shoots really hard too 
5 0 Third times the charm So I m onto my third bike Not that I wanted to be on my third bike it just turns out that normal chain cable locks just do not stop people from stealing bikes Of course it says volumes about a person that would steal a piece o crap bike but I digress So this time I got a real bike Hey I commute to work on a bike and I thought What the heck and I really want to keep this one So it stays in the house or in my office But you say what does this have to do with the OnGuard Beast 5017 Bicycle Chain Lock Well like I ve already said I want to keep this bike So I got one based on the reviews of this lock Know what It s great Most people look at it and think it would suffice for a Motor Cycle If that s what they think all the better This thing looks intimidating And talk about a conversation starter There are some caveats to this thing though It s heavy almost 10 lbs so this is not for the bike racer Carrying it does cause some challenges like where do I put this thing I now hook it around my rear bike rack It could be 1 or 2 links longer but I can still lock it to almost anything And it requires at least two hands to lock But if want peace of mind this is your lock 
4 0 Great Design But Quite Heavy As an experienced cyclist who relocated to Manhattan in the summer of 04 I wanted to purchase the most theft resistant chain available My ambition was to use my Trek 3900 for both exercise and transportation while not having to constantly worry about it having it stolen Having experienced several bicycle and bicycle part thefts in Boston and Chicago I decided to thoroughly research bicycle chains and locks Stories about the vulnerability of U locks and the clearly stated Kryptonite null and void in New York warranty steered me towards a hex chain made by OnGuard As a previous owner of Kryptonite and Master U locks I initially wanted to stick with a tested brand However lessening the appeal of Kryptonite locks was a widely publicized story in 2004 explaining how a design flaw in certain models allowed them to be compromised with a Bic pen causing a recall In Chicago I had a frame destroyed when one thief attempted to break a Master U lock with a long pipe While this failed attempt slightly bent the U lock it collapsed the main tube of the bicycle Hence I thought using a chain manufactured slightly lesser known brand without publicized vulnerabilities would be a good idea much like purchasing a Mac would protect against Windows viruses After one year of use I have been very happy with the 12mm Beast Chain At 9 5 pounds this chain is at the upper limit of what one can affix to the bicycle and still be able to ride it In my case I am able to rap it around the seat post and have enough clearance for my legs For a typical bicycle the chain adds about 40 to the overall weight When I purchased this lock I was unaware that a 14mm 15 pound version existed Even so I would not have purchased this model which is more appropriate for a motorcycle or piece of construction equipment The design of the Beast chain is exemplary In addition to having very long thin keys and complementary keyhole there is a sliding keyhole cover making the mechanism very corrosion and pick resistant The thick polyethylene coating may serve a similar purpose while preventing freezing which has been used by savvy thieves to make the lock more brittle For the record I used commonly available electronics freezing spray to embrittle an earlier generation Kryptonite lock when I lost the key With five hits with an over sized hammer the protruding barrel lock and supporting metal cracked right off Pretty scary While no chain can eliminate the possibility of bicycle theft I still have my Trek It is impossible to tell what tactics thieves will employ next It seems unlikely that a conventional pair of bolt cutters could cut this chain When I emailed OnGuard customer service they had no straight answer on its cut resistance My impression is that only an oxyacetylene torch or hydraulic cutter could break the links Both techniques would attract a great deal of attention Hence secured with the Beast chain your bicycle will be about as safe as one can get in a public area 
4 0 Very secure I hope but heavy and inconvenient This seems to me a very high security lock I bought it to protect my new bike after my previous bike was stolen by thieves who cut through an OnGuard Rottweiler armored cable lock I don t think the OnGuard Beast could be cut with hand tools The shackle of the lock is such a tight fit with the chain that it leaves no room for pry bars to pull it apart However this is the heaviest bike lock I ve every seen A typical U lock weighs less than three pounds Kryptonite s New York U lock is just under four The Beast 5017 weighs almost ten more than even the Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit chain which it resembles You ll have to have some way of carrying it I don t think you can simply wrap such a bulky heavy chain around your seat post though I ride a recumbent and say for sure If you expect to put it in a messenger bag or backpack put ten pounds of rocks in your bag and ride around a bit before purchasing this lock I suspect the only good way to carry it is to strap it down to a rack Also the Beast s two piece padlock is inconvenient When you unlock it the shackle pulls all the way out and separates Usually it falls onto the ground When locking it you have to assemble the chain shackle and lock and hold them together all the while keeping the bike in place while you turn the key OnGuard could have made this more convenient by having the padlock automatically lock when you pushed the shackle in OnGuard supposedly offers an anti theft warranty with the lock though the warranty that came with mine said that is void out of state of New York Like most lock warranties you can t make a claim without evidence the damaged lock that someone cut through it with hand tools Pros Extremely secure More flexible than U lock Cons Very heavy Difficult to carry on bike A bit clumsy to use Recommendation I would recommend a good U lock to riders with bikes that can use one Get the OnGuard Beast only if you need super high security or have a bike that won t work with a standard u lock 
4 0 We love all things Super Hero My four year old loves all things Super Hero especially the Power Rangers This was a huge treat He slept inside of it on the top of his bed for a week after receiving it and now uses it as his area rug or a mat from which he watches videos It s definitely a junior sleeping bag though Doesn t provide much cushion support but at this price and this age definitely worth it 
5 0 Great sleeping bag My 5 year old nephew loves this sleeping bag It is comfortable and the pictures on it are of good quality He thought it was very cool and uses it all the time 
4 0 Small I bought this for my 7 year old son and he just fits in it and hes a small guy But he loves the power rangers so he was happy and thats all that matters 
5 0 Excellent solution The only place I could hang my 80 lb bag is in my garage however my ceiling is so high that it is unrealistic to hang it from there I got this and using the mounting method suggested by C H below it s working perfectly I got in a few good workouts this weekend that included kicking and it seems to be very sturdy When I m done I just swing it to the side and it s out of the way I don t forsee any problems but I ll update if something should happen 
5 0 Wow Umm you spelled intelligence wrong Which is always most amusing when someone is mocking the intellect of another person Way to go brainiac Less punching more schooling 
5 0 Nothing like it in this price range I have been looking for a convienient way to hang my 100lb heavy bag This mount is very sturdy I used concrete anchors and hung it on my basement wall I would bet that it could hold well over 100lbs I think that limitation is based on hanging it on normal 2x4 wall studs Overall great product but caution it doesn t come with bolts screws to hang it you have to visit your local hardware store for that stuff Then when your all done hitting the bag you can just swing it out of the way 
5 0 Excellent pot of coffee I bought this to replace another one that had a plastic dome and was not seamless like this one While the lid is a little difficult to remove it seals in the coffee flavor and is a breeze to clean all parts in the dishwasher We use it 2 3 times daily This is the best one that I have found and would unquestionably buy this again even to just have an extra pot when the family all gets together Will never go back to the automatic coffeemakers 
4 0 well made The coffee pot is simple and well made I still managed to break the glass dome after one week I contacted Coleman by email to see if I could buy a replacement dome I received 2 domes no charge 3 days later 
5 0 Great Bike Bag This bag is awesome I can put my laptop in it and still ride my bike My laptop is 17 apple laptop My favorite program is Painter because I can make cool pictures on my laptop on it I wish that I had another one so that I could have two computers I would sell one for over one thousand dollars 
4 0 Sharp and handy questionable steel nice scabbard Revised 22 Feb 2007 I was looking for a high end machete when I ran across this little sword by United Cutlery UC in Cabela s catalog where it is sold as a slimline machete not a ninja sword It s ground from a single piece of 420 J2 stainless steel with nylon cord wrapped around the hilt This choice of steel is questionable for any blade over 12 inches If it is heat treated to a hardness adequate for edge retention it tends to be brittle resulting in chipping of the edge or even catastrophic failure If it is not heat treated it tends to be too soft to really hold a sharp edge Still I have heard of this piece being put to hard use and have never heard of one breaking It may be that it s just short enough to get away with using 420 stainless I suppose it s all in the heat treat and without Rockwell testing followed by torture testing I ll never know what this thing can and can t do It s reasonably sharp out of the box and can be tuned up with a few swipes from a carbide V sharpener The Tang stamp says hand made and the finish is very good I ve heard complaints about loose handle wraps but I haven t had that problem despite handling the sword quite a bit But is it a machete or a ninja sword Well it sure isn t a machete It really does resemble a short Japanese sword more than anything Rather it resembles a longer version of the Americanized tanto style knives that have become so popular in the tactical market Granted I have heard of people going into the woods and clearing brush with this thing but I think it would be tiring and when it comes to swinging a sharp metal object tiring equals dangerous If you want a brush clearing tool for fifty bucks or less there are many choices the ubiquitous Ontario and Meyerco machetes the Woodsman s Pal the Crocodile Knives no 227 various machetes and field knives from Condor and a pile of inexpensive offerings from Cold Steel to name a few Then there are dedicated gardening tools like ditch banks and weed knives There s no reason to clear brush with an Americanized Japanese short sword unless you really want to As a sword however it handles nicely It s solid and lively in the hand nimble for thrusting cutting and chopping I ve made a mess of many cardboard boxes with it Again I don t know how it would hold up if bashed repeatedly into masonry or body armor but otherwise it makes for an expedient weapon in close quarters So a short sword is what it is The sword clicks positively into the included Kydex scabbard which is light and flat and allows for several different modes of carry I wish I could find a machete at this price that came with such a nice sheath I have numerous clubs axes knives swords and sword like objects around the house some of high quality and commensurate price but it is this el cheapo sword that leans against the headboard of my bed and it s the first thing my right hand will touch in an emergency I d much rather grab the Paul Chen Practical Wakizashi but that belongs to my wife That I suppose is testimony to its design and execution which is just about as well suited to fighting in tight spaces as anything out there The grip could fill the hand better and along those lines I m thinking of wrapping the handle with some leather grip tape The remaining question is Can a blade this size made of stainless steel both hold an edge and stay in one piece Come spring I m taking this thing into the woods to find out 
5 0 Elegant Simplicity in a Blade _I have collected swords both eastern and western for over 30 years now and I finally bought this model out of curiosity It is far better in both quality and design than I expected This is a good quality blade The steel is a good rigid stainless variety that seems to hold its edge You could chop through a fence pole with it and it would not fold up on you _While this is not a full length katana it is of a good useable length for use in tight quarters it is also easily drawable from your back without hanging up on the sheath The hilt is covered with wrapped nylon over plastic and of course since the tang is one piece with the blade there is nothing to separate I find the overall look to be clean and modern not cheap The flat black finish will not catch light There is an elegant simplicity to this tool _The sheath is especially nice it will mount on your back or your hip It is of solid constuction and will not pierce or pull off the first time it snags on a branch or fence Being nylon it will not rot or rust like the sword itself _There are some cheaper knock offs of this blade on the market for even less but you are much better off to stick with the proven quality of United Cutlery _A sword can be either a tool of ill omen or a spiritual symbol depending on the inner development of its wielder 
4 0 cover for foam roller Nice item to keep your foam roller from breaking down or getting flattened 
5 0 Buy this machine This machine is a great price and a great piece of equipment It arrived fast and was very easy to put together even though it looked intimidating at first It s very quiet and great for using while watching TV The foot rests are definately too big so you have to be sure you have shoes on and tighten the velcro as much as possible It is sort of annoying to have to stop and adjust when my feet slip sometimes but that is my only complaint and you can find ways to deal with it Overall a great value I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good workout 
4 0 Great value for your money It is a great value I have used it for 2 months 3 times a week 30 min each and I can start seeing the results not spectacular but you can tell there is a difference Only downsides are the pieces There do not last long The good thing is that it comes with a 3 months warranty and the Co shipped the replacements VERY fast I really recommend it if you want to excercise without spending lots of money I am very VERY happy with it 
5 0 Body Trac Glider easy to set up and easy to use I based my purchase on reviews I read on Amazon They were overwhelmingly positive and I can add my own good review to this My husband who isn t handy set this up in no time and both of us have been enjoying a good combination of aerobic and strength training with our Body Trac Glider As a person with CFS Chronic Fatigue Syndrome I can recommend this to people with the condition who have the capability and want something they can handle that doesn t take up alot of space and that they can do in their home 
4 0 Fine excercise machine Easy to assemble and solidly built a good value for the money The main complaint I have had after months of operation is the comfort of the seat it s a bit stiff for long sessions Beyond that I ve noticed that the central piston gets extremely hot during extended use 60 minutes or more sometimes this seems to cause it to slip or lose resistance In my experience this can be fixed by merely letting the piston cool and checking the resistance setting I ve taken to using the unit in half hour increments to avoid these issues 
5 0 good buy excellent rig for the money great customer service I was sent a new arm after my brother broke it when he was on the highest setting It seems to have been just a fluke a weak weld 
5 0 Great machine for the Money I didn t think the rower would be as solid as it is It is well made and went together in no time The foot pads take a little trial and error but are not the impossible task others make it out to be just don t pull your heel up during the stroke keep your heel against the lower lip and put the toe straps on firmly It sits in the space above my garage in freezing cold and blistering heat and has never failed to work for me The machine simply does what it is made to do and it does it at a reasonable price 
4 0 Worth the money a great machine I was a little worried when I got this machine becvause of the low price but it is an excellent piece of equipment The machine is very easy to put together and you can keep track of how many calories you burn It is easy to change your resistance level and the machine timer will stop if your form is not correct The oar design versus the one bar design on most machines works more muscles in your arms and chest I also find it to be a great stress reliever It may sound cheesy but sometimes I like to put on music close my eyes and imagine I am rowing in a lake It is very relaxing I do wish there was a way to track distance by mile however and if you start going at it really fast you start to hear strange sounds so I think moderate exercise is best on this machine Also for someone who is very overweight or tall it may be akward to get into the feet stirrups or seat I am a 155lb woman and my butt covers the whole seat so the seat may not be wide enough for someone much heavier All in all it is a great machine for the light or moderate exerciser 
4 0 Great little machine I purchased this about a month ago and it s been great so far It came out of the box mostly assembled and only took about 10 minutes to finish the assembly It really doesn t come with any instructions for use but if you go online and look for rowing machine instructions there are 4 or 5 sites that have instructions to help with that The foot pedals take a little getting used to I experimented and found that the best thing to do is wear shoes and strap your feet in tight otherwise feet tend to slip off pedal I am trying to come up with a way to make the back lip of the pedal higher so my feet won t slide off so easily but haven t really come up with anything yet It s not a huge problem just an annoyance After the first or second session using the machine you learn little tricks to keep your feet in place and they seem to make me work harder too since I am gripping more with my toes as well as using my toes and feet to help my pull myself back to the start point This is definitely a full body workout it can be made more difficult if you prefer as the shock has an adjustable ring to increase resistance I feel it the most in my legs butt back and stomach believe it or not One thing I did find is that you have to watch your posture with this and all other rowing machines or you will end up with a very bad backache by the end of the session For the money it s a good sturdy piece of equipment and is well worth the money 
5 0 Throw out your cheap speed bag this is the one Wore out one of the cheapo bags in about three months This one has gotten heavy use for six months and is still like new Holds proper psi for months at a time Shape is perfect well balanced seams are easy on the hands 
5 0 Really cool backpack I was pleasantly surprised when I got this backpack Nicely made and well thought out Tons of pockets and you can make the two large compartments into one big one Can t beat it for the price 
5 0 It s all I use I have been swimming for 21 years and this is the best goggle out there I have had at least 4 pairs and I love them I do agree with the anti fog coating wearing off quickly but it isn t like other goggles where you can t see anything when they are fogged 
4 0 One of the best goggles on the market I purchased this set of goggles because they are one of the best that I have used They do NOT leak This is my second set of vanquisher goggles and I will likely purchase additional sets as needed The only drawback I see is that the anti fog coating wears off very quickly However I think that you will find this on every set of goggles Speedo makes premium products and these goggles live up to that speedo tradition 
5 0 Vanquisher This is the only style my son will wear for competition They stay put with comfort 
5 0 Best Goggle Ever I ve been swimming for 20 years and this is the best goggle I ve ever used 
4 0 Very good This was my third buy of a swin google and think this is the best Good quality very adjustable and with a very good look in the water Perfect for swimming 
4 0 Satisfied Customer I find this pair of google good They provide good seal from water The nose adjustements that come with it may not be perfect for your nose bridge but still they dont hamper their performance Overall a good product and much better than other cheap stuff available online 
4 0 Fits well lasts long great price I ve been using these goggles for a while now I ve tried several other goggles and the fit with the silicone is just right and very comfortable I thought that the silcone would wear out but it s lasted me many swimming sessions and is still airtight although I have to adjust the straps tigther because the silicone straps are loosening with use Vision is good but I ve had a better view with other goggles It will also fog up slightly with extended use Anti fog drops or spit will fix that up I ve used them to swim in lakes triathlon for extended periods with no issues I ve also noticed that Speedo s quality in all of products I ve tried silicone swim caps swim jammers is above par I guess that s why they re the industry leaders It s a great pair of goggles and Amazon s got a great price on them with free shipping to boot 
5 0 Very nice I purchased this for my nephew and he loves it It is great quality and a very good bargain for the price 
5 0 Great material for a great deal Excellent value and fast shipping Cover is lightweight but perfect for covering two bikes instead of one Highly recommended 
5 0 Kept stuff dry as a bone Per a suggestion in Maui Revealed I bought the fanny pack for water excursions The author suggested not leaving anything in the car and he was right there was broken glass at many parking areas Nothing got wet It is a great product 
4 0 Wet Wild I received this fanny pack then promply took it sailing to Blizzard Beach and through 7 hours of boogie boarding Everything glasses money phone stayed dry The only complaint was the stitching for one strap came unsewn It was easy enough to fix but would have been a disaster if it had happened on a water slide 
5 0 Great value excellent product This compass is very well made very good workmanship all of these together with a very good price make for a very good purchase 
5 0 Mess Kit Exactly what I ordered and it was delivered sooner than what the seller had estimated There is nothing like a used East German Mess Kit to cook with if you have to run off into the woods because of the black helicopters 
4 0 Bulky but Comfortable Even after reading several reviews on this product on how it is bigger than it looks I still purchased the pack Well they are correct it is bulky but I found that wearing this pack on the hip worked out nicely In addition this pack is well made I was looking for a pack that I did not have to wear as a backpack but could still carry many items If this is what you are looking for This is the pack for you I was able to stuff a camera gloves hat snacks and many miscellaneous items I purchase during the day in this pack Even with all these items the pack was still comfortable 
4 0 Too Big but ok I got this for an upcoming trip to Disney since the heat is acting up the 2 water bottles come in handy Only drawback I see is that it is too big you can t get a feeling from the pictures of how big it actually is but aside from that it is exactly what I needed Lot s of room and pocket and it can be adjusted in a lot of different ways to match our size 
5 0 A little treat An eye pillow doesn t seem like much or to some it may even seem silly but they are actually pretty cool I never used one until my yoga teacher placed one gently upon my eyes during our last pose Savasana or Resting Pose in class The soft scent was nice not overpowering and the light pressure it put on my face felt good It also is very effective in blocking out light and this helps you to completely relax From a more practical standpoint my daughter uses my eyepillow when she is suffering from a migraine I rub her forehead with peppermint lotion and then place the eyepillow on her eyes It doesn t always chase the pain away completely but it offers some relief 
4 0 Works for me Good heavy duty nylon netting but the hooks are plastic and I m not sure how they will hold up So far so good They are fairly thick The net itself seems a bit big for using with a rear rack alone My wife has the wald metal folding baskets on her bike and uses the cargo nets for those and they work great 
5 0 Better than Heely s I found this product when I was in search for a pair of Heely s for my six year old daughter I couldn t find the Heely s in her size because they start sizing them at a 13 1 plus the shoe was too expensive I ran across the Bratz skate shoes and thought I d give them a try because almost every little girl I know loves Bratz I could purchase them in my child s size and they were much more affordable They came in the mail fairly quick and my daughter LOVES them She wears them all the time they are worth the money Now I hate that I bought my 9 year old a pair of 87 dollar Heely s from the mall I could have bought her a pair of these 
5 0 lmsq Very good works well I am very happy with it and I am glad I found it 
5 0 Fast Delivery I was very pleased with the expedient delivery of my daughter s Bratz Girl s Skate Shoes She will be receiving them on her birthday she will be pleased as I was I received my order within 3 days now that s fast Way to go Amazon 
5 0 Good for learners These are not roller skates as one would assume hese are wheeled shoes in the same vein as the Heelys line But they have 4 wheels with the option of using one They are also less then half the cost of the Heelys so when your kid out grows them they will not cost you an arm and a leg to replace I like anything that encourages outdoor play although I must admit I want to shove every kid that rolls in front of me at the grocery store My Sophie will not be wearing hers to the store schoole or anyother place that doesn t have a flat surface outdoors 
5 0 Easy to use for my 5 yr old Great skate shoes Well made and easy for my 5 yr old to operate to pop the skates down or retract them The great thing about them having skates in front and back is she can choose to either drop only the back skates like the Healey s or drop all four They were a third of the cost of the healey s so I would definitely recommend these over them 
5 0 Great shoe skates My 7 year old daughter loves these I don t know how they compare to regular roller skates but she is getting around in them pretty well They are fairly heavy but she likes to wear them as shoes as well They seem to be very well made she s used them at least 50 times and they still look brand new Note that these skates have four wheels not just the heel wheels though you the front and back pop out separately so if you just wanted to use the heel wheels you could 
4 0 its me from to tight this great toy isnt just for little kids my bff Kelly has these she 12 Imight write back so be afraid be very afraid 
5 0 Kendo Shinai Traditional Japanese Bamboo Practice Sword SET Very nice Much better than I expected Thinking of hanging them on the wall 
4 0 As represented If you are looking for a Mexican style handwrap these are hard to beat for the price 
5 0 It really does feel great I have been using this dampener for about 4 years now It isn t too big or too small It fits in the racquet perfectly and the look of it is great Overall I have been very impressed with this product 
4 0 Old model was better Although I like my new locker bag my old one was 17 years old it isn t as usful as my 17 year old model My original model had a full length gatorade bottle holder in the front of the bag This enabled me to remove the bottle after the bag was in the locker Now I have to remove the bottle first or wrench my shoulder trying to reach up and over the top of the bag within the locker I also fear that the new bag is deeper and will not fit in the rather shallow lockers at the university The old bag fit perfectly I only replaced my bag of 17 years because the zipper was finally getting stuck sometimes 
5 0 Great locker bag I actually purchased this locker gym bag for my husband for a Xmas present We had looked at several stores in our area and no one carried them so I ordered this one The colors are great very bright and vibrant and the size is great for doing what it says fitting into a gym locker Matter of fact another guy at the gym commented to my husband that he was looking for a bag like that and asked where he got it 
5 0 A Must Have bag for active folks and travelers too This bag is simply amazing I go to the gym 4 times per week and often go directly from work so I needed a bag that would hold everything I needed to workout and clean up afterwards The Ogio Locker Bag does it all it s got a special compartment for my gym shoes and a shelf to separate them from my towel and workout gear It fits perfectly in just about any gym s locker I go to Bally s and with its front opening door you can access everything you need while your bag is IN the locker I love the fact that it comes with containers for my toiletries shampoo conditioner soap and also with a comb brush and mirror To top it off it s light weight sturdy and even comes with a built in vent so that your wet sweaty clothes don t get too ripe LOL I couldn t be happier with my purchase GET THIS BAG You won t be disappointed 
5 0 Ogio Locker Bag I was so excited to find this item on line We had a very used Ogio Locker Bag we had been using for approximately 19 years that needed replacing I love this locker bag for carrying my shampoo conditioner make up blow dryer curling iron etc while traveling 
5 0 good bands good for exercising wish it were supplied in smaller packaging units

4 0 The exercise Stepper Machine A very good exercise machine to help keep in shape Like it very much although haven t had it very long to go more in dept 
5 0 GREAT BACK PACK A MUST BUY Two thumbs up This is the best back pack I ve ever tried I m an emergency rescuer and I commonly participate on campings and stuff like that and I can say this back pack is a must have It s so big you can get anything you ll need on a whole week camping It s very confortable and you almost don t feel its weight I love the sleeping bag compartment since I can even use it both for the sleeping bag and the tent keeping the sticks on the outside of course If you are looking for a complete back pack with a lot of space and very confortable buy this one garanteed 
4 0 Nice backpack with many features I actually had to send this back however While it had great features and a great price it was a little too small for me in 2 ways I think the volume was a little small for the week of backpacking I was planning But more specifically it only came in one size and I couldn t adjust it adequately for my height 6 2 I was sad to send it back however because it seemed very nice otherwise 
5 0 A knife for a lifetime The only time you will regret having bought it is when u lose it This is an amazing tool that everyone should have If not exactly this model there are 100 others to choose from depending on ur profession and way you want to use it I found one of the cheapest prices for this knife on Amazon 
5 0 Great pocket knife This is a great tool I m very happy with this purchase The space pen and the mini screwdriver are very cool The first pocketknife shipped to me had a crack in the plastic but I went to amazon com and submitted the return info and I got a perfect one the next day 
5 0 I feel like MAC GIVER IT S GREAT ALL THE TIME IT IS VERY CONFORTABLE IN MY POCKET AS IT IS THE PERFECT SIZE VERY GOOD FOR USE IN ALL YHE DAY DUTY AS OPENING BOXES ET 
5 0 Table Top Air Hockey from Buck A Ball The Table Top Air Hockey game was shipped in a very timely manner and the packaging was excellent The game came to us in very good condition which is important to us because we are giving it to one of our grandchildren for a Christmas present The game is exactly what we were looking for We also appreciated all of the communication we received from Buck A Ball about the status of our order Buck A Ball also sent us an e mail thanking us for our business We won t hesitate to do business with Buck A Ball in the future We have five grandchildren who are all involved in various sports so we will be looking at Buck A Ball when we need anything sports related 
5 0 Nothing beats it I bought 2 and took them on vacation to the Caribbean They close small enough to pack inflate and deflate with little effort and were eay to repack in their handy carrying case as well They are so comfortable and easy to get into I was the envy of all as I floated cooly through the Caribbean 
4 0 Good cushions to reduce plantar faciitis pain but not a miracle cure These cushions were recommended to me by a physician but one from a medical specialty that doesn t involve treating feet or orthopedic problems This product is well designed and manufactured and I like the support and comfort it provides substantially better than the four or five different types of so called orthotic cushioning support products e g from Dr Scholl s that I bought over the counter at pharmacies and grocery stores Gellin may be fine for most folks but slightly squishy insoles just don t cut the mustard nor do ordinary rubbery plastic inserts My subjective anecdotal impression however is that the ViscoSpot cushions have indeed lessened the pain and inflammation I otherwise would likely have suffered while walking or on my feet for long periods Anyone with this condition knows that a hard step down can result in a searing stumble inducing pain These cushions do significantly lessen the shock as compared either to using no device or the other cushions devices I ve tried But these cushions have not yet cured or substantially improved my plantar faciitis despite about a month of use now My symptoms date back about four months I don t know how these may compare with prescription orthotic devices that are custom fitted by foot doctors I ve been trying to cure my problem on the cheap but I ve ended up spending about 200 so far on various stretching and exercise products along with various cushions Maybe I should have bitten the bullet and seen a specialist doc to begin with I dunno

5 0 LOVE this bento Well I have had this Nissan bento for over 5 years now And as an adult I have to say that I have no problems with it keeping food hot I find that it is VERY COMPARABLE even BETTER than the Zojirushi Mr Bento I like my food HOT and being entirely stainless steel it keeps all 4 containers hotter than the Mr Bento The top 2 containers in Mr Bento tend to be cool room temperature after 4 hours or more while in the Nissan they are usually more than warm but not steaming To make sure I am comparing correctly I preheat the 4 containers with hot water before I pack just like Mr Bento Also the construction of this bento is much more sturdier than Mr Bento which has a lot of plastic Like the other reviewer yes it will dent if it gets banged around As an adult I don t have any problem with it Also the Mr Bento I got from Amazon in Xmas 2006 was made in Thailand not Japan Apparently it is too expensive to get it from Japan now or something like that My girl friend s Mr Bento was made in Japan and it was much sturdier and kept food hotter I think the new Mr Bentos have a plastic lid which allows heat to escape Anyway I just sold the Mr Bento on ebay and kept the lunch bag which fits the Nissan Thermos really well I love this Nissan Thermos lunch tote It really is worth the money 
5 0 great sword pros this sword is a very good quality sword for its price it makes an excellent fantasy piece and it is very well crafted and detailed the blade is well connected to the hilt and the sword fits perfectly in the sheath cons some of the metal skulls decorating the hilt are loose and wiggle around sometimes the blade gets dirty easily and is hard to clea 
5 0 Best pad ever I use this pad everywhere I go This pad will help keep you warm and get a good night sleep while you are on the trail Very durable 
5 0 fantastic I believe in spending the extra dough for great equipement you will love them 
5 0 Great gloves excellent protection I purchased these gloves to replace the gloves that game with my heavy bag I should have replaced when I first got my blister I have a few blisters from the other bag gloves These are pretty well made and look good compared to other gloves like century The bar in the palm can be a little problematic if you want to do some grappling I removed it since I do little grappling plus it feels better to punch without it I have no blisters now Great glove for beginner or advanced 
5 0 Much better than it looks on the picture I use it to punch the bag The thing is awesome Natural leather durably built The only thing I was worried about could it protect my hand enougth without boxing wrist belts before I had bag gloves with no fingers separation Yes it is solid enough for that Totally deserves 5 stars 
5 0 mma gloves I have been fighting in mixed martial arts now for a few years And have used different types of gloves But these gloves cover the entire knuckle area Promoting a flater fist Which will give a harder punch And the durability as never been a question 
2 0 Takes time I gave this product 2 stars because the assembly is a mess However when you do eventually get it put together it does look pretty good and is very functional for the money It has the worst assembly directions I have ever seen for any product The parts are not clearly labeled at all and you are left guessing which screw is supposed to go where For the last step I dont know if parts were missing or not but they were talking about screws D and E when you only had 3 screws to choose from A B C which as I said were not clearly labeled at all and you need to figure out which screw is which letter I fancy myself fairly handy around the house and this was not easy to put together at all Very frustrating If you are able to decipher the instructions and you will need to stray from them if you want to put it together it does look pretty good It can hold 2 bags with 4 shelves for shoes or equipment but not sure if it would hold extra large pro style bags Not sure if the money saved is worth the hassle of putting it together 
5 0 Great Rack for the Money I bought this rack to try and organize my golf supplies and I couldn t be happier Shipping was fast and well packaged The instructions were great and assembly was easy and quick This thing really looks great and has plenty of room to hold two golf bags and all my accessories 
5 0 Excellent This is an excellent bag for anyone regardless of rather you are training for boxing martial arts or just want to punch and kick something and will take whatever you can give it I ve tried a couple bags and this one was by far the best in the 80lb range Another review mentioned a couple of problems that they felt were signs of a return but are not This bag does not ship with a plastic covering the zipper top is intentially missing and Everlast includes a sheet explaining why unzipping it voids the warrenty and all the hanging chains do come wrapped in a pink ribbon Most of the reviews comments are just how Everlast packs every bag Mine arrived with with well done packing tape in a box that was a little beaten from shipping but the contents were not harmed or dusty I train mostly bar hand so my only complaint is that the Everlast logo stitched on to both sides of the bag can do some extra damage to your knuckles but if you are using wraps and bag gloves than it is not a problem Regardless the quality of the bag and the beating it takes compared to many other bags on the market makes up for the stitching on the logo 
5 0 flexible flyer my second granddaughter loves this flyer now all she needs is snow 
5 0 Great Haul These things are wonderful go ahead and buy a set of them because they fold up so they dont get in the way like other rear mount baskets might and they can hold quite a bit and still leave room for a bag or something to be put on top of the rack Only problem I had was with the hardware that comes with it I have a delta bike mount and had to go buy some longer screws and some zip ties to put them on but that was worth it for these baskets not every rack is the same afterall LOVE EM GET EM 
4 0 From play chair to sleeping bag We have 2 inflatable convertible chair sleeping bags for our girls ages 5 7 1 nemo 1 tinkerbell We use them regularly They are light so the girls can move them around take them to friends or relatives houses for sleep overs The nemo bag is easy to inflate the cover is removable so you can toss it into the washing machine It s a bit of a struggle to get an already inflated bag back into the cover once it has been washed since it takes about 5 10 minutes to inflate the bag we don t deflate it after each use Our girls have twin beds so we slide the inflated sleeping bag under the bed until we need it This storage spot also helps keep all sorts of other toys from hiding under little girls beds too Most of the time they convert the bed into a chair leave it infated in their rooms Our girls love to play video games use their chairs all the time it is a great feature They carry them down to the playroom or the living room if I let them Even the 5 year old can convert it from a bed into a chair in about 1 minute We are very pleased with these inflatable chair beds but the reason for only 4 out of 5 stars is that the first Tinkerbell bed had a bad seam would not inflate The nemo tinkerbell are basically identical in design We returned it without any problems the company sent a new replacement right away which has worked fine In the box you do receive the sleeping bag inflatable bed pump a 1 time mini repair kit vinyl patch glue If you plan to buy an inflatable sleeping bad then purchase one like this with the convertible chair feature It is certainly worth it 
5 0 This item is really cool We bought this for our 3 year old For those overnite stays Most of our family are with out a toddler bed for him so this works out nicely My only problem was that the pump that it comes with is horrible so I used a pump we already had and it worked just fine 
4 0 Granddaughter s Bed What a life saver I needed sleep space for my granddaughter age 3 when she came for one of her infrequent visits It had to be compact and easily stored This solved my problem plus she was ecstatic to be sleeping with Nemo 
4 0 so far so good I got this bed for my daughter for going away trips it pumped up quickly and my daughter played on it for a little while the next day her cousin spent the night she is 3 and she liked the bed I did put a comforter underneath just for extra cushion 3 yr olds are very honest and if they don t like it they tell you so and she liked it 
5 0 Step for Health I already had the Step with only one riser and really enjoyed it I had reached a point were I really didn t feel challenged any more I purchased the double because now my kids can workout with me on the lower step thus eliminating one of my excuses This workout done 3 4 times per week takes only 30 min for cardio step and 15 min for abs Just saw my doctor and he said he had never seen anyone raise good chol lower bad chol and improve lipids tryg without medication in his career like I have done he s a semi retired older dr I m 39 and hope to continue this regimine for many many years to come 
5 0 The Circuit Step Review I found this product to be PERFECT Being able to adjust the step with 2 sets of risers makes working out with step videos much easier These are very easy to handle and lightweight but very supportive and sturdy You just have to make sure you put the top step over the groove for it to lock it into place when using the additional risers I totally love it and found a new way of working out 
5 0 It s AWESOME I got a box set and when I looked at the Derek Jeter card I saw George W Bush and Mickey Mantle I thought it was so AWESOME 
5 0 EXTREMELY HOT CARD The Derek Jeter George W Bush Mickey Mantle card 40 in Topps 2007 series 1 was not supposed to be released None more will be released making this the hottest card in 2007 I got one in a Topps 2007 Box and the card is amazing 
4 0 Great quality for the price I was shocked when I found this skateboard for 3 00 as I had seen the same exact skateboard at K Mart for 10 00 Upon receipt of the item I was happy with the packaging and look of the skateboard It was a great gift idea for my kids ages 7 and 9 The only thing about the skateboard that I didnt like was that the wheels are not as fluid in movement as I had hoped They stick a little from time to time Other than that the product is great 
5 0 Totally Satisfied This stuff is great Better than I expected Light but stable Moreover this vendor delivers my stuff ON TIME I do recommend this vendo 
1 0 not worth the money i actually bought this because i thought the price was pretty cheap but turns out the songs and graphics are horrible and not worth the shipping rates this will probably collect dust in my closet 
1 0 Not the real Dance Dance Revolution pad This is a TV dance pad not the authentic DDR pad as we ordered My children were disappointed in the music graphics and the lack of challenging levels of difficulty They said it was cheesy 
4 0 Good for young kids I bought this product for my little sister so that she could exercise in the house and she loves it The rest of the family enjoys it too If you ve never seen the XBOX or Playstation version of DDR then this game is fine I gave it four stars because some of the graphics in the background are a little annoying and make it more difficult to see the arrows 
5 0 Solid rack for disk brake bikes This is a lightweight solidly constructed rack for hardtail ATBs with rear disk brakes There don t seem to be many racks made for this application and this one works well 
4 0 Good at now It seems to me a very good choice Hard good paint You can atach the painners at the sides of the rack and in the top the sleeping bag a mattress or something else It also hace a special atach point for your RED BACK LIGHT A very very helpfull accesory for your bike when you travel PAY ATENTION if you need it For DISC BRAKES BIKE or NOT there is a diference in the way you atach it to the bike and also in the PRICE There are two models almost exactly the same Be carefull 
2 0 there is such a thing as too sticky This mat may have a design flow or perhaps it was rolled up before paint on the cute paisley pattern dried up Layers were stuck together and it was hard to unroll In the process the paisly design ripped bits of the bottom side of the mat I suppose it s still functional but my brand new mat looks pretty awful 
4 0 Nice mat The mat is really cute and does not slip at all The only thing I don t like is that it is a little too long and it would be nice if it was slightly thicker 
4 0 Looks Beautiful but a little thin I love the look of this mat Love the pattern and colors but it is a bit thin I just layer it on top of my old mat 
5 0 a great buy I m SO happy I bought this mat I love the color design and the energy of it I also got a matching bag for it from ebay I m not only using my mat for youga but also practice meditation on it and everytime I m having troubles in my yoga practice I look at my mat and smile 
4 0 What you see is what you get What you see is what you get Pretty straight forward I thought I would have a problem with it staying on but it hasn t budged 
4 0 Additional information There was no size information included in Amazon s description so I went looking for it Measures 191 x 48 x 46 h constructed of 2 steel tubing two large plated S hooks Fits up to 14 ft hammocks hammock not included Easy to set up Assembly information sheet Weighs 56 1 2 lbs 
5 0 GREAT Inversion Table My husband got this for me for Christmas I LOVE IT He asked me to do the review since I m the one who uses it the most I have a chronic back problem and since I ve been using the table the pain that I ve had has eased up from using the Inversion Table 
5 0 GREAT PRODUCT GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE I am very happy with my inversion table It is good quality at 1 4 the cost It s just what I was looking for And the customer service Dept was great Thank you 
5 0 great product The inversion table is just as described It is easy to put together and is durable Quick shipping also 
4 0 Great inversion table Box was fairly damaged when received and was missing 1 washer but was not worth the hassle to replace Everything else about the table is great It gets used quite frequently 
4 0 Great price for a whole lot of cards These are quality CASINO cards that have actually been played in the casinos I am a card collector and am very happy with this set 
4 0 It is what it is After reading the other review I almost backed out of ordering I m glad I didn t Maybe the other reviewer doesn t understand the word used and a deck for under a dollar what do you expect The cards were fine used but fine If you want a deck for a serious game then get a new deck otherwise these will do I am very happy with my purchase and with the speed in which my order was handled 
4 0 The pro s and con of this particular pedometer I feel that this pedometer works well enough for any amateur walkers use The step counting is acurate enough and when it is off it is usually not off by that much The main problem I have with this product is that it tends to fall off quite easily After a number of falls this product will most likely be rendered unusable The falling may also have something to do with the different gaits of different people I give it a 4 5 
5 0 accurate simple NOt much to this little gizmo but it is accurate it is easy to use and I loved it i did have problems with keeping it attached to my pants because the clip seems too small but i took a baby safetypin and was able to clip it through the hole in the beltclip something I couldn t say with other peds that i have owned all in all a very good deal 
5 0 very pleased I was pleased with the item and time frame of delivery thank yo 
4 0 Power Resistance Gym The gym is great Its pretty light so when you do certain exercises the machine wants to move with you but luckily they included the little tabs of metal that you can step on to prevent the machine from moving For the money you can t beat it 
4 0 Body Sculpture Review This is an interesting item that I bought + It is very easy to assemble with tools included It says that it s 170LBs of resistance but it feels a little lighter The workout takes a little getting used to because the tension is a little rough Also when doing stand up exercises you ll probably have to stand on the frame because the machine will move + All in all I feel like this machine is a bargain for what I paid for it including shipping + You can get a quality workout from it and it doesn t take up much space + It also has a ton of exercises for you to do with How To s in the manual if you need assistance configuring the machine 
5 0 Solid Working Compass This compass does a fine job of indicating North South East and West 
5 0 Back to Basics with this Great Toy My 8 month old son loves this toy He is learning cause and effect concepts It s simple enough for him to understand how to press down the top to get the cute butterflies and lady bugs to spin around and land in the holes It s entertaining and easy to carry along with all parts safely enclosed nothing to lose I love this toy because no batteries are required just kid power It s just back to basics for an entertaining simple spinning top type toy 
5 0 Great toy My 8 month old loves this toy He is just starting to learn how to make it spin by himself but has enjoyed watching other people make it spin pushing it around on the floor chewing on the handle It also distracts him well when he is fussy 
5 0 Great Supersized thick yoga mat with carry bag I just got the blue colored mat I love it 1 Im 6 feet tall and I fit completely on the mat with some space left 2 There is plenty of cushion for me not to feel the hard wood floor 3 It comes with a carry bag which broke immediately but a needle and thread and its back together now 4 There also isnt much of a smell 
5 0 NICE This is a hella sweet product It stores more water than I could ever need and even has a place for me to put my keys Oh and the ladies love it 
5 0 Good price great product Well made and so easy to use a monkey could do it Filled mine with liquor and went to the city for St Patty s day It did the job needless to say 
5 0 Great product I used this product to support my rapier sword at the Texas Ren Fest for 5 weekends It s sturdy good quality leather and accomodated my sword perfectly 
5 0 This is a Kickin Flippin Sweet Bike I love this bike the reason I am giving it 5 Stars first of all of because the look of it and second of all the handling of it This Bike rides like a dream I love it The flame fenders I took off right away because I didn t like the look of those but everything else on the bike is rad 
5 0 GREAT CRUISER BIKE One of the BEST A++A++A++ I bought this bike for my boyfriend He was excited to say the least I already had a mountain bike and he wanted a bike so we could ride together So as a surprise I ordered the one that he had been eyeing the PT Cruiser Turbo 7 He put it together the day after it was delivered He had to do a little adjusting on the gears but other than that it went together perfectly Couldn t ask for better And he said it rides like a dream GREAT CHOICE WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND just need someone that knows how to put bikes together and he knows just that 
5 0 Superb Bike First off let me start by saying that anyone who remembers fixing bikes as a kid will have NO Problems assembling and adjusting this bike when it arrives If you have never done this before I recommend using the local bike shop to do it The bike is SUPERB and rides like a dream The bearings are top notch and you can stop pedaling and coast a good block PLUS on just the inertia alone try that with a mountain bike Shifting is smooth once you get the gear s adjusted The braking at first will cause a bit of squeal noise until the pads seat then you wont hear a thing I used them sparingly and not harshly the first ten miles until they wore in This bike is BEAUTIFUL to look at and in just this past week I have been stopped at LEAST 10 times and asked questions about it I even had a group of mountain bikers stop me and tell me it was a SWEET bike Pedaling is smooth and the frame is very strong I weigh 285 the seat is VERY comfortable all the time I have tried over a dozen bikes and This one tops them all I am also 6 1 tall so alot of the other so called Cruisers dont cut it against this bike You wont be dissapointed 
5 0 EXCELLENT little toy carrier I love this toy carrier and we use it all the time We keep our daughters living room toys in it at home and we pack it full for traveling We take it with us whenever we know we will be visiting someone for more than a few hours and have received tons of compliments on how cute it is the design is bright and cheery and how smart it is to travel with our daughters favorite toys She is entertained and we can have a nice visit Our daughter is only 9 months and we ve been using it for about 3 months now At this point it holds quite a few of her toys but as she gets older we will need to get something bigger for at home but I think we will be able to use this for traveling for quite some time 
4 0 Well Thought out Cyclometer I have had my Blackburn Delphi 6 0 for six months and have put on thousands of miles and tens of thousands of feet in vertical gain I upgraded from an older Vetta model Since I do a lot of climbing the vertical gain and percent grade features were a major attraction for me The operations of all Delphi computers are simulated in detail by an excellent interactive program on Blackburn s website This was a major selling point I could use the computer before I bought it It eliminated unexpected surprises I knew exactly what I was getting The ability to utilize customer service if needed was also important to me VDO for example is a German company with no U S offices They have a Germany customer service telephone number you can call but they only speak German This might change in the future but this was the case at the time I made the purchase I am 45 years old I raced when I was in college but now ride for fitness and enjoyment I don t ride fast but regularly climb 3 000 to 4 000 feet in a single ride each weekend I was not looking for a performance computer rather just something to keep track of the basics that are important to me speed vertical gain distance grade To that end I do not use some of the advanced features such as laps and heart rate I found the computer relatively easy to set up and learn It is fairly easy to navigate while riding I won t spend too much time on navigation because every one has their own like and dislikes Go to the Blackburn website and navigate the interactive program for yourself Suffice to say that in general I am satisfied with the operation of the unit The wireless transmitter and the cadence sensor attach with zip ties I found this unsightly The clamps that I have used on Vetta and Cateye products are much nicer However I suppose it is difficult to provide a clamp to accomodate such a large variety of tube diameters But this could be accomplished with shims as it is for the handlebar mounting bracket However this is not a reason to not buy this product I did not have a problem mounting the cadence magnet Although it is toward the end of the crankarm it is not near the pedal spindle Every bike will be different The cadence wire is indeed long better than too short but I just bundled up the extra and zip tied it to the little chainstay brace located between the tire and the bottom bracket Speaking of the wireless transmitter Coming from a wired system I wasn t sure I d like the wireless transmitter but I do Reception at the computer has been excellent even though I have it on the right side of the handlebars and the transmitter on the left fork The altimeter feature is great It is why I bought this model It works by measuring barometric pressure and has a resolution of 3 feet However the barometric pressure changes from day to day and so did the home altitude as measured on the computer Calibrating the home altitude each time became annoying But as I thought about it I realized I really don t care about the altitude I just wanted to know the CHANGE in altitude as expressed in total vertical gain So now I just zero the vertical gain and go The vertical gain and grade feature are wonderful for knowing more about the road you are on I am training for a century ride that has almost 10 000 feet of climbing and grades as much as 20 These features help me to know if I am training properly In my experience the vertical gain measurement has an accuracy of + 5 Occasionally I ll see measurements as much as + 10 This is definitely within the tolerance of most electronic instruments and I m sure that slight variations in barometric pressure between the start and finish of your ride contibute to the difference My point is that this device will give you a very close vertical gain measurement but it won t be exact The current technology has limitations but it is FAR better than not having this measurement at all Another important point is that this device measures ALL vertical gain There are units on the market that will not measure gains less than 30 feet I think that is a bad idea For example if you were riding a century that had a rolling topography and within each mile there were two 25 foot rises a reasonable scenario there would be 5 000 feet of unrecorded vertical gain I appreciate that the Blackburn unit records all vertical gain The computer calculates gradient by measuring distance traveled and altitude gained By necessity there is a lag in the display of the grade it is updated every 5 seconds using data measured over the prior 20 seconds This is annoying but necessary because you want to know what the grade is right at that instant as you feel your legs strain This feature is finicky You will find that the reading fluctuates noticably as you climb the more grade the more fluctuation I speculate that this is because of two reasons First roads never rise in a straight line they are wavy Second the steeper the grade the more riders tend to not ride in a straight line They wiggle off to the left and then to the right This will affect distance traveled and hence affect the grade measurement The main point is that this device will give you a good ballpark measurement Don t expect it to be exact But again it is far better than not having the measurement at all On a small side note the grade pegs out at 20 There are a small number of riders out there that ride roads with gradients exceeding 20 and it would be nice if it could be measured The distance measurement when programmed with the correct wheel size seems to be accurate within a few hundreths of a mile verified with a gps unit I have not used the heart rate moniter but my wife has It s operation is straightforward and seems to work fine She comfirmed the presence of the spikes mentioned in an earlier review The computer seems to be durable I have accidentally dropped it onto the garage floor a couple of times and it still works fine During one ride I was caught in rainstorm for about two hours Toward the end of the ride I noticed that the display would not respond to commands Closer inspection at home revealed that water had gotten into the unit This was not a surprise as the rain was heavy and water had once gotten into my old Vetta unit which eventually dried out and recovered Although I figured that the unit would eventually recover it is still unnerving because you can t be so sure The owner s manual says that if this happens to contact customer support I emailed them my story and in three days I wish it had been more quicky I received a reply The remedy was to remove the battery cover and let it dry out Blackburn wouldn t say whether or not water would ruin the computer but as it turns out the unit did recover only needing a new battery If you ride in the rain on a regular basis you might want to consider protecting the computer from water This story also reinforces the need to consider customer service when deciding on a product While waiting for my Delphi to dry out I had to consider that the unit was ruined and I might have to buy another one I actually looked at other companies and their different models again to see if I might be more satisfied with something else I came to the conclusion that I would buy another Delphi 6 0 This is the greatest compliment I can give this product 
5 0 Entertaining Table Tennis is the fastest sport in the world Unfortunately it is very rarely on television For anyone who has played a few years at this game which requires lightening fast action and re action Volume 1 is definitely worth buying The players are the world s best The filming is excellent with consistent re plays to highlite the best shots and points I recommend this DVD to anyone who plays table tennis seriously I guarantee you will get a good feeling just watching it 
5 0 Lightweight and great My 2 5 year old daughter loves it I bought this bike for my 2 5 year old for Xmas I needed a lightweight tricycle that was easy to carry to and from the park and one she could actually pedal It is a joy to see her enjoying her trike at the park pedaling for long distances I m close behind in case she topples over since most trikes by nature are not stable I have an older Kettler built for stability but I hate it because it s so heavy to lift and my daughter could never pedal it So that s in the garage and she ll use it when she s older We tried other tricycles at the toy store but I didn t like any of them for a variety of reasons Even the Dora counterpart I did not want a darn Dora trike was not as well designed as this one This trike has thick cushioned wheels and a comfortable wide seat Graphics I hate the Cars graphics I hate that my daughter is a walking advertisement for a product I don t care if the graphics are for Play doh Sesame St or Dora They should be paying me to advertise not the other way around Visit the Campaign for A Commercial Free Childhood online for more information Assembly Assembling bikes is such a headache I took the unopened box to the bike shop and let the pros assemble it for 15 20 
5 0 Perfect for my 2 year old My son has been wanting a big boy bike for a while now He sees all the other children in the neighborhood with one and it is now his turn The bike is the perfect size for him He struggles a little bit with the pedals but I am sure that would be the case for him with any tricycle The only issue I had was that the tires are plastic But what more can you really ask for for the price you pay The bike looks great and he loves it 
5 0 Training in progress For a two year old who is learning this is perfect He tries to use the pedals but it is not an easy concept for him yet So he uses his feet to move most of the time The best feature for him is the nook below the seat He loves putting different things in the small space to take with him when he tries to ride 
4 0 My son enjoys this The stickers that come on this don t stay for very long However the trike itself is a hit with my two year old 
5 0 Big Jammer Door Brace saves the day It makes my family sleep easier and more secure at night We re in a two unit apartment building and there is an entry door and hall before our units The last person in at night places the brace under the knob so we all know we ve eliminated the threat of someone coming in though the front door If someone were to try to force the door I don t think theres a chance of them getting through the jammer the worst thing that would happen is that the knob would tighten making it difficult to turn We solved this problem after a trial run and found that if you unscrew the knob and reassemble it in the door it works fine We think it s due to the stress of the knob against the door I still can t see any part of the door failing either Good Luck 
4 0 Elmo Sleeper My son absolutely enjoys the sleeping bag I can t get him out of it

5 0 Best Kickboard I first discovered this kickboard when my family decided to stay at the Sheraton Hotel in Seattle I have never seen a design like this before My 2 year old loved holding on the the board and would not let go This unique design is better than any standard board 
5 0 Nice Poker Night Accessory Rack up buy in chips in these attractive trays before everyone arrives then wait for the compliments An inexpensive way to add a classy touch to home games 
4 0 Indoor golfing I am seven years old and I like golfing I can golf indoors during winter now It is challenging because it does not have guard rails it will roll off the green if you miss the cup It does not take batteries and the ball rolls out by itself 
5 0 Excellent I got my fit band within days of purchasing it It really works my arms and I m very very satisfied with my purchase and with the seller

5 0 Essential Exercise Tubing Accessory If you use exercise tubing to workout you need this door anchor It s sturdy but not so thick that you can t shut the door Very well constructed so it doesn t feely cheap or flimsy 
4 0 Strong This stretching rope does not stretch on it s own but is extremely well designed and strong During my physical therapy I used another device that broke so I am glad I found this to replace it the strap is wide enough so it does not cut into your foot and the beads on the side give you a firm grip and gives you a guide as to how well you are progressing An excellent tool for therapy or just stretching 
5 0 Same as the step most gyms use Good stable step Can also be used as a weight bench for some weight training 
5 0 The Step Sturdy Dependable I ordered The Step F1011W hoping it would be identical to the sturdy Step s used at the health club It was all I hoped it would be The 4 included risers give me plenty of adjustments to vary the intensity of the workout The Step is solid under foot on all parts of the stepping surface with no wiggle or shake making me feel confident as I hop jump and step through my program I tried a mini version of The Step made by the same company I think but in this case bigger is better The larger size enables The Step to double as a flat style workout bench as well When not in use it slides under my furniture 
5 0 Just what I expected It is working well and taking a beating And so is the Original Health Club Step I have been looking for an exercise program that will fit my lifestyle and at home exercising is the way to go for me so when I decided to buy a step I wanted it to look like and behave like the ones I d seen at the gym This one is exactly like those takes a licking and keeps on ticking Its life will be long and hard 
5 0 First class step of the highest quality This is one GREAT product A very stable supportive step for any basic or advanced moves A serious illness kept me from stepping for almost three years I have since regained my health and am stepping with confidence thanks to this quality product Worth every penny of the price 
5 0 Sturdy Step Platform I truly like this platform I owned a Rebok Step platform for years that I thought highly of but I gave it to a friend and bought The Firm Fanny Lifter the blue and purple one to save space While the Fanny Lifter was great and is I still use it for leg presses lunges and other strength building exercises it was not stable enough for the step workouts I like to do I have some Cathe Friedrich and Christi Taylor workouts that you need to be able to do some travelling to get the most out of the routines Also it is more stable on my less than level 100 year old wood floors than my Rebok platform was I would recommend investing in this platform to anyone that will use it If you are new to stepping perhaps try a class a few times before spending the money or try the less expensive shorter version I have seen it for 20 25 at discount chains Personally I have been step training for 20 years I m 41 at different impact levels and have no problems For higher impact I train on the 6 level and lower impact on the 8 My 9 year old cocker spaniel also uses it to get on and off the bed 
5 0 BEST home exercise equipment hands down To the reviewer who said you can make something like this for 20 or less well clearly they don t do step aerobics This step is designed to absorb a lot of the shock of the moves making it safer on your joints than wood There is a nonskid mat on top It is also sturdy and rated for up to 300 pounds The step can be used for cardio or double as a weight bench Additional risers can be purchased to build it up higher Yes it is expensive but so very much worth it for the design and technology that went into making this safe for any level exerciser I have been using my step for 10 years and it s still going strong It s made to last 
5 0 Excellent Step This is the exact same size and type of original health club Step as used by Cathe and other instructors in the majority of thier home workout dvds I had the home size Step first and didn t like how unstable it was due to the smaller size so I purchased this one from Amazon It is more stable and safe to use if directions for use are followed correctly Hard sturdy plastic with rubber traction came with 4 risers Besides stepping its great to use for a weight bench Amazon shipped it fast too 
5 0 A Quality Product This step is a quality piece of equiptment It is sturdy and strong and can manage a large amount of weight Also when you are doing aerobic moves on it it does not topple over and come apart like other steps that I have used It also stores easily under a bed or in a closet and thus does not clutter up your space In addition to all of this it is easy on the eyes as it is black and grey in colour 
4 0 S W Galaxy 13 LED Flashlight Solid design no complaints I was a little leary of the red only having 3 led s But it did its job and then some 
5 0 Great Camp Light Small size is a big plus More than ample light to use at night on pathways Red LED s are handy for use at night for reading maps directions or just finding your way around without waking others who might be sleeping 
5 0 blinding light There are flashlights and then there are FLASHLIGHTS The S W Galaxy is a real must have Powered by 3 AAA Batteries it beams a bright white light out that can be seen for hundrets of yards and the red light function is perfect at night The price is hardly beatable unless someone wants to spend 300 bucks for a flashlight vortex luxeon I hve been a fan of Mag Lights for years which cost the same as this one but I had to alter my opinion After I bought one for myself and tested it I gave one to my wife have one at work and tell everybody who s looking for a Flashlight about this one If Amazon would allow more than five stars to give I would always give the max 
5 0 Great Timer We use timers many times a day for processes at work This timer is great can be attached to clothing takes abuse 
5 0 every you neeed This compass tells all the information you need so you won t get lost You want to know the lay of the land This compass is all you need Excellent instructions and just large enough so you don t have to squint to see what you are looking at Great compass

5 0 Hyperextend Assembly of this hyperextension bench is a breeze and you ll be on your way to a better body in no time 
4 0 great exercise machine excellent colour Xodus 45 Degree Hyperextension Bench is a nice exercise machine by mercantila looks great and is surely cheaper than similar other benches I assembled the entire machine in less than 20 minutes I would have given it 5 stars otherwise but I am not very comfortable with the bend angle I would have rather preferred between 55 to 65 degrees hyperextension bench but I guess there is non like this in the market as I searched it on internet Anyway if you are looking for hyperextention machine you can trust try this machine 
5 0 Excellent This is exactly what I was looking for I own my own reformer and I wanted something else to do on it besides the tapes that came with it This is an excellent workout and very user friendly 
5 0 Wonderful compact large towel Amazingly small to pack but absorbs water well and dries quickly 
5 0 Exceeded expectations I bought this towel for a two week trip back packing through France and Switzerland The towel is very absorbant including towel drying my long hair and dries very fast in maybe an hour or so Definitely buy the XL if it is your primary towel for showering it is not very big It also resists smelling if you do have to pack it away right after showering I had to leave it wet in my suitcase for 2 days and it did not have a musty odor when I took it out It feels kind of like paper but is soft and better than some of the more felt like material travel towels that do not absorb as well like the one my boyfriend bought for this same trip I will recommend this towel to any of my friends and family on traveling excurions 
5 0 Good bike for a new BIG BOY bike My son got this bike for his 4th birthday on March 14th 2007 I chose this type due to liking Schwinn bikes for a long time always had this type of bike for myself and my older children Also it may be a little large for a 4 year old but I would like him to have it for some time not just grow past it Which is why I also liked that it came with training wheels Good sturdy bike that I think my son wil enjoy for a long time to come 
5 0 Great for home arobics I luv all the firm workouts I use the fannylifter with other firm workout DVDs that I own My clothes are baggy after 2 weeks of using the DVD s 
4 0 Not for beginners at all unless you are willing to tough it out I have been doing gentle aerobic exercise twice a week now for about three months for an hour each time mostly on the stationary bike I could only do ten minutes of the lower body workout in this set and that was without weights I can only do about five minutes of the abs workout I honestly thought I was in better shape than this This has one DVD that has separate workouts for upper body lower body and abs or it also has a workout that combines all three I was torn about getting either this or The Transfirmer set which is more than double the price of this I decided on this since I was not sure I would like these workouts although the very old set I have called The Firm Parts is excellent I decided on this because I have wanted a six inch step for years since I remember how effective it was at firming up my rear and thighs when I used to take a step class I also could not after much thought figure out how having the slanted step in The Transfimer would be of any benefit It seemed like a gimmick to sell more stuff to me I can always buy more DVD s if I want and use these steps with them without having to have a special slanted step If you ve been exercising for a while and getting your heart rate up several times a week for at least six months you might be able to get through an entire workout the first time If you are over 45 like I am unless you are in exceptionaly good condition you might feel discouraged when you watch this The steps that come with this are nice but they really are only for the lower body even though they try to incorporate them into the other routines like having you rest your heels on them when you lie on your back for the ab work I know from past experience that nothing will tone your lower body like step workouts except for running and this one is pretty good although they go fast and are constantly changing up the moves which is confusing when you start out It will take me about ten sessions until I am able to keep up with the continuous changes they do but this is normal for any step class This helps to keep it from being too boring It might be at least fifteen sessions for each workout until I will be able to get through an entire workout By that time I should be looking good though I intend to try to tough this out until I can get through an entire workout It is killer stuff People are addicted to The Firm workouts They have a loyal following I have the earliest Firm VHS tapes that I found in a second hand store That set is called The Firm Parts and I like it better than this since it is more beginner friendly I also get a kick out of how they tried to make it look sexy like they did when this was released in the early seventies Those girls are incredible looking I ve seen if for sale on eBay This is more for intermediate and advanced exercisers and for them it should be perfect But if you are a determined sort like me you might be able to just do a few minutes at a time of each workout until you are in good enough shape to get through the whole thing By that time you will most definitely see very visable results 
5 0 Indeed a great workout Be aware though that this is the same as the FIRM original Body Sculpting System out a few years back with Jen Carmen Body Sculpt Lisa Kay Ab Sculpt and Allie DelRio Now Pointer Cardio Sculpt Very effective workouts all on one nifty DVD now 
5 0 No more tackle football needed The kids in the nighborhood love to play tackle football I was worried someone was going to get hurt so we bought this for the friend age 10 who s yard is the field The flags are sturdy and work very well The boys used them not only for football but other chase games too Unfortunately 6 months later I see they are back to tackle Don t know if the flags have been lost or if boys just like to tackle

5 0 Dora skates for toddlers I thought this product was very good my child has celeral palsy and the phyicaltherapist was able to use them right away thought that they were durable and safe which is the main thing 
4 0 Loves these skates So far so good Skates and pads appear sturdy My 3 5 year old fits them but they are fully extended She didn t take the skates off for 2 days I d recommend these but not sure about the sizing as my little girl is small for her age 
5 0 Great gift at a great value My nieces loved these roller skates And they can use them for awhile because they are adjustabl 
4 0 What a bargain I bought these skates when they were on sale for just 3 99 and I m so glad I did My daughter will be 4 in April and she loves these skates They fit right over her shoes and I was amazed at how well she did on her first try 
5 0 My three year old is too young The skates are great the pads are great the bag is worthless My three year old is still too young for this but she ll love it next year 
5 0 great skates w bonus knee and elbow pads I actually ordered 3 sets one day because they were only 3 99 that day The price at Walmart was 16 99 so it was a great deal The knee and elbow pads are great because my daughter can wear them with her bikes and scooters too I would recommend them 
5 0 Dad and kids both love it It all fits in a box that is not crazy big or crazy heavy so shipping is not too bad It took about 1 hour to put together with kids helping It is very sturdy I like the padding on the handle bars and the good bumper below the seats The hinge bearings move very smoothly Just well designed and engineered device Highly recommend it 
5 0 Great product Wow this is some seesaw It is well built has no place to pinch hurt little fingers limbs and it holds half the neighborhood at once a big child can sit with a toddler on one side comfortably The lock feature is great because our 3 year old can sit on it without hurting herself if no one is around to totter with her My only regret is that we did not buy it soon 
5 0 Kids love it Very sturdy Kids love it Looks great too I also like the lock feature 
4 0 This blender is cool I bought this blender to take on the road with me and ended up using it mostly at home It blends up my fruits and veges when I feel like making raw vegan soups or sauces I love that I don t have to plug it in and find it easy to clean and use There are 2 different crank options one for heavy duty blending and one for mild Obviously you provide the muscle but not much is needed You will need to keep it steady it does come with a mediocre clamp and it takes a little getting used to but I m quite happy with this unit 
4 0 Black Rapier My son ordered the sward He likes it and the ordering process went smothly 
5 0 Pure Excellence The 4X32mm Range Estimating A O Full Size Master Sniper Scope is by far the best scope that you can mount to an airsoft rifle or even submachine gun Lets face facts most airsoft guns have no purpose to have a scope on them they don t go as far or as accurate as a hunting rifle or other rifle But with this in mind this scope is the best because with airsoft why spend 50 dollars or more on a scope The really cheap scopes they break or don t even fit on the gun the expensive ones they are the same as this scope This scope is easy to mount and easy to use If you have never used a scope before dialing it in or zeroing with come really easy no tool or anything is needed to dial except for mounting the scope to the gun and it is actually easy to mount without the tool The scope is designed to capture light through it when it is pitch dark outside when you look thought the scope it looks like it s beginning to get dark outside There is also a sun cap that allows less sun to block your view All and all this is a perfect scope for airsoft Guns that I would recommend and have mounted scope too 1 The UTG M40A1 Master Sniper Rifle 2 The UTG AK 47 Tactical WarHawk assault rifle 3 The UTG Desert camo and or Olive green M324S Sniper rifle 4 The CQB Navy SEALs UTG MP5 A4 A5 submachine gun 
5 0 don t know much abought scopes i realy like this scope it is a bit excessive for most airsofts a round bullet doesn t go very strait no matter what gun you are useing it has very fine adjustments like the scope on my 232 hunting rifle it is of real rifle quality 44 with shiping was very worth it i can peg squirls from 50 easly with it 
5 0 Amazing This board is one you can tell diffrent bettween the cheap boards like a mongoose and world industries so much lighter wheels and truck are so much smoother But world industries has been making these boards since 1989 they are the best skateboard company around Ill definitely buy again 
4 0 A good step up from the department store boards If you re looking for something for a beginning rider this is a nice compromise between the 15 00 department store board and a custom board selling for 80 100 bucks The wheels roll well the trucks are decent and the graphics are cool 
5 0 Great Deal This was a great deal My son has been very happy with this akateboard Thanks Amazon for such great products at great prices 
4 0 First skateboard ever for a thirty something old Ok just made a friend who was a skateboarder so I wanted to have something that I could try to learn on I couldn t believe the great deal on this board compared to other boards that were identical except the graphics on the bottom it s WAY more now than what I paid Anyway I couldn t be happier It s a decent quality board and I m having fun and so are my kids We ll never be skaters but it s still fun to have a solid quality skateboard around just for kicks 
4 0 very cool My son has been wanting a new skateboard He actually saw this one before I got it wrapped He is very anxious to use it A few of his friends have similar ones and he thinks this is VERY COOL 12 23 He just opened it up and he and his brother are in the garage trying it out They both love it 
4 0 Better than expected Well I ordered this ball in anticipation of a men s indoor flag league that I compete in I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box and found that they had sent me the wrong ball The pleasant part is the fact that they sent me an all leather NFL The Duke football Hey who am I to argue with an upgrade to a ball about 3x s the price 
5 0 Lives Up to Its Promises This is a solid piece of equipment and using it for a few minutes daily does seem to help with back and shoulder pain not to mention clears out your sinuses The table has to be assembled but the process is not too difficult The tools you need are provided maybe I had to supply my own flathead screwdriver can t recall it took me about an hour and a half to complete the job and I mostly just followed the pictures Everything about the table is sturdy and the inversion mechanism works smoothly so you feel safe not only hanging upside down like a bat but also getting into and out of position unlike with gravity boots and an inversion bar which are kind of scary The ankle cuffs are well padded but the pressure on the tops of the feet which take all your weight while you are suspended tends to get to me wearing athletic shoes with heavy sox helps I can do only a few minutes at a time but am working up to longer One caveat about having this table in your home it needs space You can fold it a bit to reduce its footprint but it will still need room to swing while you are in it Nevertheless I love my table feel better for using it and am content to give it all the space it requires 
5 0 New way to use Great machine with easy assembly I would nt suggest using the super saver shipping though My first one came damaged and they only deliver from 9 5 weekdays My second one was ok but the box took a lot of beating After a week of use I have found I get better results using the machine on my belly instead of on my back Good sturdy machine if you have the space for it 
5 0 Simply awewome This is definitely one of the best purchases i ve ever made Not only did amazon get me a good deal on the equipment but the machine does what it advertises it will do I m 6 3 tall and weigh in at 350lbs I m a big boy But this machine handles me know problem After inverting the very first time I saw positive results in my health After inverting for two weeks using the Lifegear Heavy duty inversion table I can tell you that I can walk without pain for twice the distance that I could travel before I am not in constant pain all the time anymore and if it arises I go invert for a while and it subsides Thanks Amazon for making this affordable to me because i m on a fixed income and was getting no help with my back injury until I was able to afford this Thanks again 
5 0 LifeGear 75177 Inversion Table This is a very solid comfortable piece of equipment I am very impressed I am 6 7 and this table fits to 6 9 The only thing I do not like is the ankle braces are non adjustable height wise they swing out for access so if you have large feet they are difficult to slide in easily I like the padded back and the price is outstanding for such a durable strong table I have only owned for a week and already notice improvement in back pains and general flexibility 
4 0 High quality product I ordered this product the Wednesday before Christmas and to my amazement Amazon got it to me by Friday The box is heavy so best to find a friend to help with dragging it inside The set up is easy though the instructions are awful I like the mechanism that secures my feet but my wife hates it Before you buy make sure the particular way this table holds your ankles is acceptable There are other alternatives out there Other than that it is high quality very stable and easy to use 
5 0 Very sturdy A very sturdy piece of equipment My only 2 complaints are 1 Very poorly written assembly directions and 2 uncomfortable foot ankle holders 
5 0 Excellent product I bought the LG HD Deluxe Table as a gift for my husband and he is very pleased It is very sturdy easy to assemble with smooth operation I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inversion table I also received this item much sooner than expected 
5 0 Back Life Saver This is an excellently built product There are six members in my immeadiate family all between 200 340lbs also my son is 6 7 the LifeGear Heavy Duty Table handles everyone with no problems with only a few seconds of adjustment between users We liked it so much we bought another one and had it shipped to my wife s parents for Christmas 
5 0 Rock Solid But NOT easily moved or stored This is a very heavy duty solid piece of equipment I have no complaints about how it works It works fabulously in fact But here are some things you should be aware of before you buy One it takes up quite a bit of space Not only from the frame itself but also the amount of room that is necessary to invert goes beyond the footprint of the frame So it s not something you can just tuck in a corner someplace it takes some room to operate Two it s very heavy Note the shipping weight is over 80 pounds Removing the table from the frame is ackward and difficult to say the least You could easily strain your back removing it which kind of goes contrary to the benefits of the machine So don t think you re just going to remove the table fold the frame and store this under the bed easily I mean it can be done But by the time you do all that you will be exhausted and may have a strained back So plan to have this thing set up and ready to go full time because it s just WAY too much trouble to break down for storage Again please understand that I very much like this machine thus the five star rating But these are just things that might not be readily apparent to someone shopping online and I just wanted to make sure you understand what you re getting If you don t have the room to leave this thing set up all the time it may not be what you re looking for 
5 0 Life Gear HD Deluxe Inversion Table My wife has problems with her back and after much review and research on different inversion tables we decided on the Life Gear HD table The ordering process from Amazon was simple and quick The table arrived within 6 days After opening the box I read the instructions clear and consise and had the table up for use within 30 minutes This is definitely a quality heavy duty built to last table I would definitely recommend this table for anyone who has back problems The best part however was the value pricing for this product from Amazon The free shipping made this a great buy You can order this product with the confidence and knowledge that you will be very pleased and satisfied with it 
4 0 Happy customer We are very satisfied with this product It works as advertised It is really nice not to have to worry about batteries 
5 0 Light to your path I found this light to be one of the best buys I have made in a long time It is very easy to use it always shines where you are looking and has a bright enough light to see for a long way It is lite and compact and is not prone to moving around like other clip on lights This is a must for anyone who goes out at night 
5 0 It s great This product is well designed and sturdy Looks sharp too It s designed to use plastic grocery bags as liners so you don t have to worry about getting it all sticky and dirty It even has a convenient storage compartment for spare grocery bags Makes a great gift for yourself or maybe for someone you know who just got a new car 
5 0 Cool looking skates for my little boy My kid received these for Christmas yesterday He loves them and they seem a great pair of skates for the price The shoe strings are too long but they look so cool I will just go buy a shorter pair for them and then they will be perfect It s important to make sure the shoe strings don t hang down and get knotted up in a wheel this happened to my son and I caught it before he stumbled So make sure you get a shorter pair of strings to go with these skates I initially thought I would just tuck them inside the skates but they dont stay tucked in 
5 0 adidas 2006 World Cup Finals Replica I purchased this for a friend as a Christmas gift He was very very pleased I think for the price through whichever company I found through Amazon it was a great deal It is now very well used 
4 0 good standard but this one is better I feel the kickballs are of similar quality and composition but this is the one you really want 
4 0 Kickball The item was as expected and arrived in a timely manner I was satisfied with this transaction 
5 0 Great use I was a little apprehensive about getting this bag because it looked like it could only fit a mat and maybe a wallet in the pocket But I was amazed at how roomy it is I can fit two blocks in the bag with my mat along with clothes and a dvd The pocket can hold quite a bit I have mine stuffed with an ace bandage athletic tape a wallet and deodorant plus there s an extra pocket for a cell phone It s very strong well made and after dragging myself through the pouring rain I found that nothing in the bag was wet Highly satisfied 
5 0 Big hit as gift I bought this as a gift for my grandson for Christmas It is a very good product and what a deal He loves it I m sure he will use it for years to come 
4 0 Great for younger kids Backboard smaller than I thought it would be but great item for the price Our kids are small so it is sufficient for them 
5 0 awesome I absolutely love this bag The adjustable handle is so convenient It can be worn over the shoulder or across the chest or even in your hand The mesh allows the bag to breathe in between sessions and the zipper is nice and sturdy The fact that it s made out of recycled soda bottles makes it even better 
5 0 Skepticism turn into soreness Perfect Pushup along with the tips on the Power 10 workout DVD provide an efficient and safe workout without injury to wrists or elbows The circular base with the under padding allows you to safely push and dip lower with more intensity normally experience only when doing dips Actually you will feel as if your doing parallel dips The benefit of the circular motion and proper form is gained from the DVD The creator of the product and the fitness model instruct and demonstrate various workout routines but most importantly on how to involve the circular motion that is truly the 5 star benefit It relives the pressure off elbows and wrist while ripping your chest arms and upper back Include the handles with your upper body weightlifting routine The only negative is the DVD is overprice and should have been included with the handles however the benefit outweigh the cost 
5 0 Impressive Product I recieved this product about 3 weeks ago and am impressed with how it works I used to be an above average wrestler in the highly competitive state of Iowa so over the years I learned many pushup and workout techniques to keep the body fit and strong I used to treat my body as a hobby using pushups and dumbbells as my main source of lifting and staying in shape Over the past year I ve put on a little weight and lost some tone just like quite a few people do once the final years of school careers and family consume the majority of your time Recently I am looking to get back to old form I saw the Perfect Pushup on television and was intrigued by the equipment I also did a little research via the internet to see what information I could find on the product I wondered how doing pushups with the Perfect Pushup compared to doing pushups normally and wondered whether I could get into shape faster with them and whether they worked I can tell the difference between the results from the Perfect Pushup and that of doing normal flat on the floor pushups So far I am pleased Getting acclimated to the twisting motion of the Perfect Pushup is probably the hardest part especially if you are used to doing pushups flat on the floor But after a couple sets the twisting motion becomes a natural movement Doing pushups on the Perfect Pushup tends to be a little difficult for the first week because the twisting movement really targets the whole upper body and some of your abs I felt a little soreness a few hours after doing a set of twenty For the first week fight through the soreness and realize the pushups using the Perfect Pushup are a little tougher Try going back to normal flat on the floor pushups and you ll be amazed on how many you can do You feel like you have to do 100 before getting a burn I haven t done a vigorous workout with the Perfect Pushup yet because of a busy schedule but I try to use them for about 5 10 minutes a night So far everyone else and I can see I look thinner and more toned I think I look more toned in my chest and upper abs so I am excited to develop a more routine workout that lasts 30 to 45 minutes much like I used to do as a wrestler to see how fast I see results I m so impressed with this product that I recommend it to everyone including friends and family Some friends have stopped by the house and saw them lying on the floor Of course like a lot of people they think it is another workout fad until they try it I have a few friends that live and die in the weight room They teased me a bit then became pretty impressed once they decided to do a set of pushups The burn and muscle fatigue comes quicker than most expect meaning the Perfect Pushup works even with those accustomed to working out on a regular basis One thing that really impresses me is how easy the Perfect Pushup allows you to isolate arms and chest muscles with ease doing one handed pushups 
5 0 Great product It is great with the regular and wide pushups not so great with the close because your wrists will still get some angular stress but that is a minor quibble The product is very well made light but solid nice rotation and very sturdy while in use I hadnt done pushups in well over a year and so this was my reintroduction to them I felt my core got a nice workout too especially the obliques I didnt realize it at the time but using the proper form does work the core quite a bit It is harder than the normal pushup because you dip down much lower but that makes it much more effective and you work more muscles At 39 95 this is a great investment Consider all the home exercise machines that are a thousand dollars and more and not as effective as Perfect Pushups Make no mistake you still have to put in the work and sweat to get results but so far this has been exceptional It took about two weeks to get mine because the demand was greater than the supply but the wait was worth it The earlier you order it the sooner you will get it 
5 0 Creative Workouts If you re tired of the same old workouts and sore muscles afterward this great product will change up your workouts without the strain on your wrists 
5 0 Push Up Madnes I would rate this much higher if there were more stars to pick from like 20 Before using the perfect pushup bars I could hardly do 6 girly push ups and I am a girl Now that my husband and I have been using these I can now do Manly leggs straight push ups I can see the difference in my arms back shoulders and abs I know most think it is just for Men but women you can gain strength in your upper body where we as women tend to be weaker Oh did I say you gain in your chest muscle too Well you do This is the best 50 dollars I spent on work out epuipment I love that you can break the workout down throughout the day and it only takes 2 minutes to do each set It is ideal for those persons who stay home or work the time that it takes you can be in shape in 21 days That my friends is no lie 
5 0 Great Product I was a little hesitant about the order s arrival after reading some of the feedback but the product arrived on time after 9 days as is stated and the quality surpasses my expectations The materials and construction are very sturdy right down to the workout poster being made of heavy grade glossed paper that accompanies the Perfect Pushup The Perfect Pushup itself is great While regular pushups put a strain on the wrists due to the angle this product eliminates that problem and allows your arms to rotate naturally reducing stress from muscles being forced to work in an unnatural motion They are more difficult than regular pushups because of the factor of stabilization involved and allow you to extend the motion beyond your chest touching the floor in regular pushups The workout poster is pretty basic so if you want more creative workouts beyond narrow wide and regular pushups pickup the available DVD The construction seems able to last a lifetime I m very happy with this product 
4 0 I have to be honest I ordered the product by expedited shipping The order arrived in about a week In the seller feedback I said I was disappointed in the time it took to deliver Well today I received a courteous phone call and even an offer to refund the shipping I did nt take it So I change my opinion Great product I used it every other day and am getting results The best part is it does n t make me sore or hurt my joints like lifting weights but I did try to bench press today and I am stronger Great service which is so rare nowadays I would buy from the vendor again with confidence Oh and the workout is great because from just following the instructions I can hit the arms shoulders back and chest from just one exercise 
5 0 D Durette AWESOME I m in the military so I ve done my share of push ups You can feel the difference the first time you use this product I can t wait to see and feel the results Must have for anyone looking to maintain or build muscle strength 
5 0 this product is great I ll make it short and sweet The product is simple and truly great If you are willing to put in the time and sweat then you will get results This will be the best 40 you ever spend on fitness 
5 0 Good value I am very happy with my purchase The treadmill runs smoothly and the controls are easy to use The preset programs make my workout easy Readouts are easy to see This has taken the drudgery out of my workout progra 
4 0 A good mat great padding a bit slick for yoga I ve never done pilates but I do yoga and I chose a pilates mat because they are generally a bit thicker and this one because I ve had good luck with the Hugger Mugger brand in the past and because I like the color Yes some people shop for things based on color Sue me Anyway the mat is great I really do like the extra thickness because I often have joint problems so some poses can get uncomfortable awful quick if using a regular thickness yoga mat The only problem I have with it is that it is a bit slick I was told by my yoga instructor that this is common with pilates mats Yoga mats are generally just a bit sticky and this one has a bit of that but not NEAR as much of a gripping feel I have also been told that you can use window cleaner or surface cleaner on your mat to make it a bit more sticky I would recommend NOT using Mrs Meyers Clean Day Surface Cleaner I did It left a residue that took quite a bit of rinsing to get off It didn t hurt the mat irrevocably however so I m willing to bet window cleaner or another surface cleaner wouldn t hurt your mat either I will probably try window cleaner eventually but only when I have time to rinse it for a while if things go awry 
5 0 This stuff REALLY works I m a size 24 woman and my thighs are HUGE They rub together and can get quite painful Exercise was an ordeal But I have to exercise to get the weight off Talk about a catch 22 situation I read somewhere that this product which is used by hard core hikers and triatholon ers is also great for us lesser mortals with excess adipose Now I workout and have NO issues with the chub rub 
5 0 It works and you don t even know it s there This product is one of the few that really does what it says After experiencing some painful chafing from my sports bra following running I started looking online for something to prevent the problem from recurring This fit the bill perfectly It is easy to apply not greasy or pore clogging and works on feet to prevent painful blistering and rough calouses You should try it before you spend a lot of money for new workout clothes etc trying to fix the problem 
5 0 slidin and glidin This stuff may seem pricey but it works Not something you normally share with anyone but inner thighs are thanking me daily Ofcourse now that I can exercise without pain of chafing I have lost 90 pounds and need this product less and less 
5 0 Fast acting This is the BEST product ever made for chafing Had been to Doctor many times and gotten 3 different creams that made manners worse Saw an add for BodyGlide tried out as my last hope Cured my chafing in 2 days 
5 0 Works great for EB Simplex This product allowed my son to run Cross Country with fewer blisters and me to work consecutive 12 hour shifts on my feet the whole time with little to no blisters I highly reccomend this product for anyone with EB 
5 0 Great stuff This stuff is great I use it almost everyday at work where I tend to get hot and sweaty throughout the day I would recommend it to anyone 
5 0 For Perfect Abs If you want to have six pack abs this wheel and the right diet will get you there Your arms may also benefit from the workout you ll get using this product 
4 0 Good Product The Ab Wheel is very simple to put together just attach the wheel to the hand grips Delivery was quick Some instructions or use examples would ve been nice But all in all it works for me 
5 0 A Must Buy For anyone in search of a 6 pack I just bought one of these used it a little bit and it works amazingly well Seems like the easiest way to develop a 6 pack is using this and proper diet A good piece of exercise equipment and very affordable It isolates abs better than anything To all the doubters when used properly this product does work Note Don t use if you have back problems because it puts a great deal of stress on the back 
5 0 Quick and Easy The Abwheel is a quick easy way to get a good ab work out Plain and simple 
4 0 the ab wheel works better than cross crunch i had a baby nearly 7 months ago so i have been buying ab workout equipment left and right most of the time i end up returning the equipment because it does not work as promised the cross crunch sauna belt pro the ab wheel was very in expensive and really works you begin to feel it working immediately after my first night of using it i was sore the next day a good sore i knew i got a great workout the only suggestion i have is that you buy a thick pad to put under your knees because using it on the floor really hurt my knees 
5 0 Pretty Impressive I don t know about building six pack I mean personally half of that relies on you genes so if you did not choose your parents well then ^ But this device is cheap and very very effective Before my body got used to the routine I felt the burn Well worth it and extremely portabl 
4 0 very nice Very nice stuff Its perfect for abs But if you dont have balance and are not strong its not perfect I just loved it 
5 0 sometimes Sometimes the simplest thing can be the best thing in the world Gee I wish I came up with this gadget I would be a millionaire by now If you want to work your arms abs back just use this EVIL WHEEL everyday Forget about Sit Ups and wasting money on BIG HEAVY machine This Wheel can be used for ANYONE ANY age ANY sex and of course at ANY place Do not worry I will come up with some gadget next time and be a millionaire We all be glad I did it 
5 0 Amazing Yea i just received mine yesterday i used to use a barbell for this method and it worked wonders when i heard there was an actual machine for this i bought it right away since i received it yesterday i ve been using the heck out of it and it is making me hurt already a good hurt for less than 15 bucks you can t go wrong and its not like you have to pull out some big machine its just a real portable easy to use wheel you ll feel the burn the first time you use it awesome 
5 0 Great computer After some set up issues got resolved the computer worked better than I d hoped It s important that the sending units are on different sides of the bike 
5 0 My FAVORITE Cathe workout to date To give a little background on how I m comparing this workout I have the following other Cathe workouts Power Hour CTX Kickbox Rhythmic Step the entire Intensity Series the Terminator Kick Punch Crunch Timesaver Low Max Kick Max Muscle Max and Low Impact Circuit Hands down this is my absolute favorite workout I think what takes the cake for me is the music It s not just 80 s music either it s remixed techno versions of it and since I m a huge fan of techno and going out clubbing and dancing my heart out to techno it s a small wonder I find this workout so enjoyable The step routines are a total kick I m not sure exactly how to recommend this workout as far as those new to Cathe s workouts goes I think the choreography is easy to follow but then I ve been doing Cathe workouts now for around four years so I ve had a lot of practice I used to not be able to make it through even the warmup of Rhythmic Step once upon a time ago Basically my recommendation is if you can t figure out the step routines just take your time and keep trying I can t comment too much on the weighted portion of this workout I tend to pop this one in and utilize all the cardio segments including the bonus cardio track at the end for my cardio days I plan this workout occasionally on my weights days on a weekend when I know I can dedicate a whole hour and a half to a workout and I can tell you I am WIPED OUT by the end when I do the entire thing BEST BEST BEST Cathe workout so far though LOVE it I hope Cathe can put together more jewels like this I think it also helps that she s definitely in a very happy mood when she s doing any of the workouts in the series this DVD came out with In her Hardcore series she just doesn t seem quite so happy more like she s worn out so it puts a completely different mood on the workout Get this DVD It s fantastic 
4 0 Excellent Video First of all I never did Body Max 1 So I don t have a way of comparing this to what Cathe has already done in that area Secondly I didn t do the entire video at once because it s just too damn long I skipped the step section at the beginning and the cardio blasts and then went back and did them later as a premix However this is a fun workout that gets the job done as far as weights and cardio Honestly my favorite part of this video was the warmup I really had a good time with the step portions of the warm up Yet all of the cardio moves are fairly simple and can be picked up pretty easily on your first or second try especially if you know Cathe s usual moves Hard enough to make advanced exercisers sweat but easily modified for those that aren t there yet The best part of any Cathe video are the premixes her videos are shockingly long for me but I always can find a mix that gets me what I want to do in the amount of time that I want to do it I definitely recommend checking this video out 
4 0 A long and little bit of everything workout This is a 96 minute workout so you do get a lot of bang for your buck with this one There are also about 6 premixes for shorter workout options including only cardio upper body circuits etc I would recommend this to people already used to Cathe s choreography as the step workout is fairly intermediate There are 4 power circuits which are quite good The part that I found the toughest was the upper body workout using the stability ball The music is fun using 80s hits like Don t You Forget About Me and Jessie s Girl etc I wouldn t say this workout is as high intensity as Cathe s IMAX workouts but it is good for circuit or intermediate step etc 
5 0 Affordable and Useful I ve been very happy with this strap It s not as thick as the ones used in class it s perfectly adequate for home use Love it 
5 0 The best ear warmers I tried a friends and loved them I live in California but it has been colder than normal and windy I was at the beach painting without these ear warmers I would not have been able to stay They are wonderful and they adjust for big heads They arrived quickly 
4 0 Good Value Street Tire If you do not need any type of extra special tire this is a good tire for the price I bought it to use on my rear wheel b c I bought a bike trainer also and my mountain bike tire is too knobby I also did not want to cause excessive wear on my mountain bike tire I did not realize until I changed the tire but my original tires are also Cheng Shin I haven t had any problems with them and from what I can tell I likely will not have any problems with this one 
5 0 Bicycle mirror When I got my bicycle I bought one of those little velcro on mirrors and it was terrible I wasted my money So I started looking for a replacement This one works great You get a wonderful view of what s behind you And for the price it can t be beaten If you need a bicycle mirror this is a great one to consider 
5 0 Great Left Hand Mirror I love this mirror swivels very good and does not get loose so far about 2 month use Was able to install it by using provided instructions 
5 0 Excellent stove grill I bought this stove grill on sale at a Target store to replace my old liquid fuel stove in time for camping season this past summer It came with the instastart ignition although it doesn t say so in the Amazon product description The product picture shows the little red igniter button near the center of the stove front The grill is an excellent design option allowing for grilling steaks hot dogs burgers sausages etc which I do frequently now The Instastart ignition has worked flawlessly so far Propane bottles win hands down over liquid fuel tanks no more having to pump the darn thing all the time The bottles are cheap and with normal use last through a three meal day no problem I usually get a meal or two the next day since lunches are typically cold sandwiches salads etc Most of the time we are away from the camp site at lunch time anyway I always bring a bottle a day plus one to be on the safe side and usually bring a bottle or two home for the next trip depending on the length of the outting and how much cooking I can usually find the bottles on sale through the year for just over a buck in the big department stores and load up on them As far as I can tell the claim of an even continuous gas flow is true high or low just like using a gas range at home Clean up is easy and the grease trap underneath the unit catches all that fat dripping from those New York strip steaks Two or three strip steaks will fill that grease trap reservoir to the brim so don t forget to empty it before grilling again The long grill burner also heats that 10 or 12 inch fry pan across the bottom quickly for bacon eggs etc The grill itself will take some scrubbing when you get home if you have been grilling steaks If you re looking to replace that old liquid fuel stove do yourself a favor and get this unit you won t be sorry 
5 0 Very nice cushion for meditation I love this zafu and use it in many ways Its number one use is obviously for my daily meditation practice It is just the right height and I can scoot the buckwheat hulls inside the cushion around underneath my sitting bones in order to find the perfect supportive position I sit on this cushion for an hour every morning and it feels comfortable to me for the entire session I also keep the cushion in my living room and sit on it when I read at my low coffee table and when I watch TV Much better than couch sitting and much better than sitting on a normal pillow on the ground This zafu is dense and supportive 
4 0 Easy to install light weight decent construction good lookin This is a very nice black all aluminum welded rear rack for mountain bikes Came with everything I needed to fit onto my 21 frame w 26 tires Giant Rincon It is pannier basket ready and some nice features include a built in plate that acts as a splash guard and an included bracket for mounting a rear light This thing is nice n light at less than 1 5 lbs is load rated at around 30 lbs It carries a life time warranty 
5 0 Speedo Silicone swim cap Excellent quality much easier to put on than the cap I used before 
5 0 COMFORTABLE AND DURABLE I have used this cap almost daily for over a year It still fits snugly and is very comfortable Writing this review has made me think to order another one now for the inevitable day my old one wears out I have a rather large head and found many caps didn t fit comfortably This one is very elastic and is great 
2 0 package missing Package missing It s never be received So I cannot rate it 
5 0 works for me This swim cap is easy to use and thick enough that I can t imagine it ever ripping or tearing 
5 0 Good for not pulling your hair I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother in law but after he opened it we all tried it on I have very fragile long hair and normally swim caps rip the hair out when I m trying to put the swim cap on or take it off This one came on and off so easily without any hair pulling 
5 0 This is a great cap I m on my 5th cap now I think Silicone is great and lasts forever Unlike rubber which can snag hair and latex which some people are allergic to silicone fits smoothly over wet hair has a glossy finish so it looks great and doesn t lose elasticity I have a some advice if you want to try this product that I ve learned overt the years 1 Always rinse and hang dry I ve left wet caps in my gym bag and after a month of two of neglect it develops black spots I don t know if it s mold it doesn t wash off and you ll have to buy a new cap if you don t like the spotted look 2 Pull it on gently I ve ripped one when I was trying to stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it It s not cloth so you have to be careful This goes for latex and rubber too 3 Wet your hair first If your hair is dry when you put it on you will trap air under the cap And since it s not a permeable material the cap will start to come off while you swim because of the air trying to escape inside 4 Pick a fun color That s it Have a great swim 
5 0 Great Swim Cap I had trouble getting water in my ears before wearing this cap Now no problem It keeps my hair fairly dry or at least drier than with other caps I ve tried It s easy to put on and take off no hair pulling It s lasted well so far Much better than wearing a cap with a chin strap 
5 0 Thermos Stainless Steel 61oz Vacuum insulated bottle My husband is a truck driver and has this 61oz thermos for work This thermos is wonderful It keeps the coffee hot all night I am replaceing it after many years because the handle broke Other then that it still works I am so glad we found this stainless steel thermos because we went through so many glass lined ones before finding it My husband won t leave to work without it It takes a beating and is well worth the money 
4 0 Ok Gun This gun was my second gun i purchased via online It s good that it comes with extra little add ons but the laser sight scope doesn t work and you really have no use for them What i like about it is that it is an M4 design Other then that its pretty accurate for about 20 feet and starts to drop or curve The adjustable hop up is nice I use that feature to shoot around corners if you face your gun sideways and put the hop up on it will curve like crazy 
5 0 Exactly like your fathers pellet gun As a U S Army soldier who recently came home from a year in Iraq I was excited to see a M4 rifle which looked exactly like my rifle I had by my side everyday in Baghdad Once this arrived I was blown away by just how lifelike this weapon is Every detail is exact and the weapon functions much like the real thing I wanted to teach my son about weapon safety and you can do no better than to start with this model It fires at a high pace with a good amount of accuracy and I was surprised to find that one is able to Zero the scope again much like the real thing As this weapon is INCREDIBLY lifelike I would recommended a parent take into consideration where this weapon will be used If the two orange segments of the weapon are painted black no one soldiers included would be able to tell if this is real or not All in all a great product at a great price 
1 0 loser gun 2 of my friends own this gun I cream them in airsoft battles all the time i have yet to be defeated by this gun with only 200fps this gun has a 20 ft range I own the MK1 carbine that fires at 500fps goes strait through a bird feeder and can nail any target up to 200 feet away dont waist your money on this drop it once and it will break the mk1 carbine is full metal spend the extra money and get a quality gun 
4 0 good gun I got this gun yesterday and well im very happy this assault rifle looks beautiful I was very disappointed to find that my model didn t come with a laser instead it came with a mountable mini flash light witch in my case never turned on yeah The rifle has 3 settings safe single and full automatic the electronic sight works is actually a small aiming guide created with a red ligth the only problem that i found is that after you installed it u will friend quite difficult to look throught it b of where is located at for this tipe of guns i strongly suggest to buy a full face mask b this bb hurt and it will live a mark if u buy this gun i also advise to reed the instructions carefully if you are a parent pleace take your time and reed everything Mine the M83a2 model came with 4 0 12g bottle of bbs=8000bb s and an extra magazine in conclution a wonderful product i palyed with the gun for about 12 hours and so far so good but time will tell as i sed before TAKE GOOD KARE OF YOUR GUN because they are made mostly of plastic and if you push them to far they will brake so be responsable safe and have fun 
1 0 Don t buy this gun I bought this gun for my son for Christmas It stopped working about 5 days later The manufacturer would not work with me concerning an exchange or refund because it was past 30 days ordered in Nov for Christmas My son is very disappointed 
5 0 Hopefully I will never have to use it Well they say that this IS THE PLAN if anything happenes to the machine in 2 years they wil fix and or replace Hopefully I never have to use it 
4 0 works well and is sturdy I really hate to exercize But I like this stepper I suggest you place it near a wall to help your balance but it s a pretty good bargain and sturdy piece of equipment for a light to moderate fitness person it won t work for those of you who use a stairmaster on level 23 or anything but for those of us who NEED to exercize but rarely do this is a godsen 
4 0 It broke but they replaced it and I love it My mini stepper broke the cable snapped after 3 months of pretty hard use I e mailed the company and sent them the original order information and they had a new unit in the mail that day They didn t send me a replacement part but a replacement stepper It s a bummer that it broke but the quick resolution was great I ve been using the new one for a few weeks now and no problems yet 
5 0 Finishes the job I got this to help keep the water and dirt from shooting up and landing on my new Topeak rack and what ever I have on it It does the job and adds good looks It comes with 2 screews and had it on in seconds I have 26 inch wheels and with the rack and fender no more wet back or packages It sticks out 5 inches past the rack 
5 0 BUY this umbrella I have owned a full size auto open Gustbuster umbrella for six years It has exceeded all my expectations and works perfectly even in the strongest of winds and heavy rain The auto open has never been a problem and I like the larger size because it keeps more of me dry not just my head shoulders Well worth the extra money I know people who buy 10 umbrellas and have to replace them when they turn inside out Won t happen with this umbrella 
5 0 wonderful I was told by a co worker about the umbrella and how great it was especially when it is raining and windy So I decided to order one it has lived up to what my friend told me When the wind in blowing no worry that your umbrella will turn inside out and break 
4 0 Proactive Sports Golf Organizer Wood Clubs and other items fit well not to hard to put togathe 
5 0 Great tee s Very good Some tee s even withstood more than 6 holes What I like about these tee s is that you can use them short or long as well 
5 0 Great Squeeze Horn I first saw the Sumo Wrestler squeeze horn on a friend s bike and thought it was a crack up It is not only fun it is also easy to attach to your handle bar Every time I ride my bike and honk at passerby s I get a good laugh as well as a laugh back I have even had a bike storeowner ask me where I bought the Sumo Wrestler so he could sell it in his store If you have a great sense of humor and want to make other people laugh this is the squeeze horn for you 
5 0 good product bright beams I like this product personally not only for its good quality and less energy consumption but the cool outlook 
5 0 Comfortable Sleep While Camping I took this cot to a 5 day music festival recently and was amazed with how well I slept on it It made all the difference to get deep restful sleep every night The low profile made it easy to fit in my small tent and while others may find it too narrow I appreciated that it did not take up all of the floor space of my tent It takes a bit of muscle to get the aluminum legs into the frame but once it is put together it is very sturdy I preferred using this to an air mattress because of its compact carrying size weight and ease of use and lack of deflation A wonderful addition to my camping arsenal I look forward to bringing it with me on future camping endeavors 
5 0 Good value Great for the traveling softball team If you are responsible to bring your own bases these are a good value and light weight 
4 0 Nice assembly problems Not much experience yet 1 day Bought for toddler assembly took about 30 minutes Fender not mentioned in instructions need to put in place first before bolting forks to frame Had to snap frame caps in place better to slide into forks and bracket still not lined up real well Includes 2 allen wrench nut wrenches but need 2 allen wrenches of a different size that is 2 that are the same size but different from the included in order to attach suspension and can t use without doing this Smooth rounded bolt heads so don t think you can use a wrench or pliers Better have 2 allen wrench sets handy or borrow from someone Still looks good and the toddler seems happy with it 
5 0 Makes a GREAT gift Not only are kids surprised about this toy but parents love how durable this trike is You can take this anywhere it is easy to move and relocate Wether you are camping or going on a family bike ride Girls and boys love this because the tires don t burst or go flat after riding in the alley You can take this bike through gravel in an instant and the tires are fine 
5 0 had one for years and am buying another for a friend We absolutely love this table and use it for everything from tailgating to family car camping It can be mildly and I stress mildly annoying to set up but the benefits WAY outweigh the costs once it s set up it s sturdy even in dirt and extremely helpful We do alot of camping at spots that don t have picnic tables but even at the ones that do it s nice to have an extra place to put things or assemble meals We re going to buy one for the people that we camp with after watching them try to prepare a meal on top of their cooler and flat rocks And whenever we go tailgating my dad always asks us to bring it since it fits nicely into the trunk and is sturdy enough to entrust bottles of liquor 
5 0 Just what I thought it would be Very light weight Convenient Sturdy Easy to setup breakdown and carry Exactly what I was expecting and will use it again and again for outdoors events and maybe even inside if we need an extra table top at the holidays 
5 0 A solid toy that looks great This Tricycle has an original design it seems that is going to last because of its construction and it catches everyones atentio 
5 0 Stanley 2 0Qt Classic Vacuum Bottle It s the best thing since sliced bread I really like the way that it keeps my coffee hot all day The last cup was just as hot as the first 
5 0 Wow I m 43 and this is nothing like the weak pogo stick my little brother had when I was a kid I surprised everyone in the family even myself when I ordered it When it arrived I discovered I had the Gravity Games version which I think looks better because it isn t red It was fully assembled too The spring was so stiff I was afraid to get on it at first but I took it to my little brother s house and we had a blast with it You won t catch me doing any extreme tricks at my age but it s plenty fun just to bounce around and try to stay bouncing Indoors I use it as an exerciser by just trying to balance on it It s quite a workout Don t let the stiff spring intimidate you once you start bouncing you will appreciate it I ve already had so much fun with this pogo stick it paid for itself on the first day The looks on people s faces when they see a grown man bouncing on a pogo stick make it even more fun It is well constructed and I expect it to last a long time But like I said I won t be doing any extreme tricks with it If you try hard enough you can break just about anything If you get too crazy with it or don t pay attention to what you are doing you can hurt yourself too I get enough of a rush just taking it easy 
5 0 you get used to the bruises The stick will bruise up the insides of you knees but after a while you get used to it and not even notice them this stick is NOT ment for children NOR anyone under 120lbs The stick is ment for tricks If you are only buying this stick to bounce on don t write a bad review when you find out the spring is insanely stiff Only buy if you re into tricks For that purpose it s awesome 
5 0 Wowzers Holy cow amazing Though the stick has been modified the knee banging is still there Once you bounce on it for a while it wont hurt any more But beware dont buy this for some one under like 13 or 14 the spring is so hard you need weight or leg muscle or both to use it im 156 pounds and just standing on it the spring wouldnt sink if you get this and dont plan to do like extreme pogo you prolly wont like it The stiff spring is good for getting some big air though Its a bit heavey and tall but you can still so all sorts of technical stuff on it I love this stick and is the best for extreme pogo stuff Oh and one more thing this beast is durable Once you just pick it up you can feel the power Its also a plus its anti rust I left my baby out not a real baby my stick in the rain over night and she still shines and nothing was damaged If you dont believe me go to xpogo com and watch some videos Have fun 
5 0 New design no more bruised legs Just a brief note to our customers The Super Pogo clamp the piece above the spring is now shaved down on the sides This modification is not shown in the photo The sides of the clamp are now even with the square chrome plated tubes no more knee bumping Because of your feedback the Super Pogo is better then ever Enjoy Bruce Turk General Manager SBI Enterprises 
5 0 hardcore pogo Tis a great pogo if you re a little older or a little bigger try to be over 150 lbs if you want to get some serious air This pogo is very strong probably the strongest on the market But I have seen a couple of these break It just depends what you are going to do with them Mine broke because of the tricks I was trying to do But If you just want to have fun bouncing and you re too big for those bite size pogos get this one 
5 0 1 Pogo This is the best pogo available for the extreme pogo enthuisiasts Since I bought it I have been able to go up about 10 stairs and jump off about 4 5 stairs I ve also jumped over garbage cans and bar stools It s been a lot of fun I ve been trying to do a 360 barspin but I haven t gotten that yet It s been a big hit at college especially at 146 Easton in NB Except for banging up your knees alittle I think this is the best pogo available for the adult child I highly recommend it 
4 0 Review This pogo stick gets great air Ive been kickin some crazy jumps Its very durable so you dont gotta worry about it breakin If your gonna get a pogo stick i recommend this one 
5 0 It really hurts I bought this pogo stick for my 13 yr old son for Christmas and he was very excited to get it He had a hard time jumping on it even though he is in the weight range He is having a major problem with it bruising the inside of his knees I think the design of it needs some work even though it seems extremely durable The spring and bars around it are too wide and they are rubbing against his legs I wanted to take it back but he insisted on keeping it Just need to solve the bruised knee prolem 
4 0 Bright and light I bought the Eos to replace a small Cateye light that I had used as a helmet light until it unexpectedly died on me I commute by bike and I got over 3 000 miles of solid on or flashing light from the Cateye but I expected more The Eos costs about the same as the Cateye unit and uses the same AAA batteries I prefer AA for runtime I ll put up with the weight this is the only reason I didn t give the Eos 5 stars However the Eos light is bright nearly as bright as my 10 watt halogen main light The runtime is quite good I got over a week of commuting from the provided alkaline batteries before switching to rechargables The light doesn t seem dimmer on the rechargables unlike some other LED lights The Cateye required some ingenuity to mount on my helment the Eos comes with a proper helmet mount in addition to the handlebar mount It s clear that the light was originally designed to be mounted on a headband which is fine for me The battery compartment is secured by a small screw with a knurled edge for grip and seems reasonably waterproof I ve used it light rain with no problems and I don t expect the eventual downpour will cause any trouble either Bottom line I d buy it again This one s a winner 
5 0 An Inexpensive and Versatile See Light Cyclists recognize that headlights can be roughly placed into two categories 1 See lights that provide sufficient illumination to actually see where you are going and avoid obstacles and 2 See me lights that are really only about being seen from the front I commute with an HID light that is much brighter than this one but I like having a backup light and also like having a flashing helmet mounted light that I can point in any direction to get the attention of motorists particularly those approaching me from the side The Princeton Tec light is one of the few LED lights I ve enountered that truly qualifies albiet barely as a see light On the highest setting it produces a very well collimated beam that is just the right intensity and width to make it suitable for night riding at reasonable speeds The light is less suitable at the medium setting and unsuitable for that purpose at the lowest setting I have the same gripes as Kent about this light 1 It should have been designed to use AA batteries If it were made to use AA batteries instead of AAA batteries the light would be only marginally larger and heavier but the burn time would be greatly extended enough to make it suitable for ultra cycling events 2 The duty cycle of the flash mode is too low The light would be far more visible if the flash rate were increased by at least a factor of two or three Those complaints aren t a knock on the effectiveness of the light itself Just suggestions for improvments that could make a great light even better 
5 0 My New Helmet Light LED headlights are getting better all the time This little guy is a one Watt Luxeon LED with very good power regulation Regulation means that the light gets the most from a set of batteries and keeps the light at a given brightness instead of dimming as the batteries weaken The Princeton Tec EOS has three brightness settings and a flash mode I actually find the flash mode to be too slow to be useful on the bike and it flashes at full power but these are minor nits I d also prefer if the light used AA instead of AAA cells So I guess there are two things I don t like about this light But the positives far outweigh the negatives The light is small and is supposed to be waterproof to one meter I don t ride under water so I haven t tested that feature It s easy to operate and the batteries are easy to change The light pattern seems to be just right for my riding I use this light on my helmet but it also comes with a handlebar mount I run the light at the lowest power setting most of the time and that s fine for reading my bike computer or cue sheets The middle setting is better for general riding spotting road signs and potholes and things like that At the highest setting you get the brightest beam but of course that eats through the batteries quicker I m pretty sure the circuit in this light was designed by Willie Hunt a real guru in bike lighting circles And yes I m enough of a nerd that I actually keep track of things like that Anyhow the Princeton Tec EOS is my latest favorite bike toy 
4 0 This is fun I actually like this bench I have to be honest that it is slighty poorly constructed and holds only 300lbs but it works as a bench for me I am currently piecing together a home work out gym This is a great addition but it will need to be replaced in the future If you are looking for a bench that you can prop up in your living room instead of playing video games this is a nice purchase It s a weak in certain areas such as the leg curls and the preacher curl but it has 2 inclines level and I can decline it too Short and sweet essay Cheap mans bench Functional but you will need to replace it later 
5 0 Bang for the buck I ordered this bike for my little cousin as his Christmas gift He absolutely loves it He rides it around in his house all the time since it s too cold to ride it outside right now My boyfriend who assembled it put it together in about 10 minutes using very few tools He said that it was really to assemble I d have to say that you really do get bang for your buck 
5 0 toddler bike we gave this gift to our granson age 21 2 we were very pleased that this bike was such a good quality for the price our granson loves it and its the perfect size for a 2 or 3yr old 
5 0 very good The bike and the delivery service were excellent the only disappointment I had was when I looked at it a week later on line it was 10 00 cheape 
4 0 Good for beginners it s OK if you are buying it for small kid Easy assembly good look Kid loves it but This is for very small kid and may not last for 2 to 3 years for growing kid Although it has adjustable seat but not very balanced after much height I would rather have little bigger than this one 
5 0 Works for me If you have to lug 40 plus pounds of gear around get a decent pack This one fills the bill nicely 
5 0 Great product I ve been using this product for nearly 1 month now and I absolutely love it Along with healthful eating this DVD is great for losing weight I have already lost about 7 lbs I recommend this product to everyone 
4 0 Good but not big enough The bag was nice and as described except it was way too small for my 5 8 thick yoga mat The description should have included a note that it only fits 1 8 or 1 4 yoga mats and is not suitable for thicker mats 
5 0 Great Yoga Mat Bag This is a great bag easily accomodates my extra thick and long yoga mat The fabric is durable and the breathable mesh section is key for those hot sweaty yoga classes 
5 0 Great Ski Bag The SportTube has met all of my expectations I needed one that would hold 2 pairs of skis and poles which it does beautifully Add to that the wheels for easy rolling and best of all the fact that the tube s length can be adjusted so that it will accommodate whatever length skie one has This is especially great as now that ski lengths are sized so much smaller than in the past a typical ski bag would have over 12 of wasted bag at the end of my 163cm skis After 2 ski trips with it it shows no damage and appears to be pretty bullet proof The SkiTube really consists of two pvc plastic tubes one slightly smaller in diameter than the other that slide one inside the other It has a built in handle that is quite long to facilitate easy gripping for lifting pulling It has a TSA acceptable closure lock and will also accommodate various keyed or combination locks not included The SkiTube comes with a shoulder strap that attached to the handle but I found the SkiTube a bit cumbersome to carry although no moreso than a regular ski bag An optional handle to attach to the end of the tube to facilitate pulling is offered as an option but I did not get this and so far have not wanted for it either The only drawback to the SkiTube is that since it is rigid it can t be folded up like a regular ski bag and so takes up quite a bit of space However dealing with the storage issue is insignificant compared to the security protection and ease of transport that it offers 
4 0 pretty good ski hard case Just did two road trips with this case carrying 5 pair of Nordic race skis and 5 pair of poles The longest skis were 207cm the wheels are recessed into the bottom of case and do take out some space so 5 pair of 207 s wouldn t fit Also at that length the case is extended very close to it s maximum so it starts to act like a hinge in the center which is unfortunate when your packing light weight nordic racing equipment that needs more support The case comes with one clevis pin to connect the two telescoping halves and the alignment of the holes doesn t allow for a second I stiffened up the center by drilling and adding a second pin On our last trip I saw several of these cases and mine was the only one that got munched in the airport conveyor belt two out of four corners were caved in a bit but no broken equipment The wheels and center handle both worked fine Bottom line This case will be great as is for typical alpine equipment For long classic racing skis I would buy it again but it would be nice to see it evolve a little by stiffening up the center connection and reinforcing the corners 
4 0 Very Pleased Setup time around 45 minutes Because i had to drive down the road to my uncles shop to drill two new holes in the butterfly arm The only thing that stopped me from putting 5 stars as a rating is i had to drill two holes in one of the butterfly arms Cause the two holes that were there were on the wrong side It was a FACTORY error There was a washer that was missing just one it was allright though Besides that this thing is mega awesome You can work out every muscle in your body with this thing I am very pleased and for the price You will NOT find a better deal On this weight bench it can only hold 350 pounds of weight that includes the weight of the person I weigh 235 pounds so i can only put 115 extra pounds on it If you don t want it to rust like me use this tip everywhere the metal rubs on metal like the bench press bar hitting on the rest i wrapped a little Duct tape on it where the leg press is at i wrapped more duct tape to stop it from rubbing it there To get weights for it it is good to goto a local store to buy some weights It is 70 and more to mail weights to your house as you may have figured allready it does not come with weights I caught a sale at Sear s and got 160 Lbs of weight for around 80 I m also a big fellow 6 3 when im benching i have to push the butterfly bars out so my elbows dont hit it but besides that for the price this is a steal Enjoy it is well worth it Ciao 
4 0 Very Good Value I received this weight bench today PROS Had it put together in 2 3 hours No parts missing I m very happy with my purchase At the price I paid it s an very good bargain Very sturdy Lat bar and side butterfly attachments a nice plus Plus it folds up CONS All minor The bar catches at the top of the main beams do protrude out a tad too far into the lift trajectory while doing bench presses for my 6 2 frame I ll replace em with shorter versions Must remove Lat Bar Frame to do fully exended leg lifts 
4 0 Good product Packed poorly The machine itself is of decent quality a bargain for the price The company however has basicly no internal packing material in the box and the box itself is thin cardboard which is not appropriate for such a heavy item The box was destroyed by the time it reached my house and I can t blame the shipping company The machine itself suffered damage on 5 parts in shipping I have yet to call the company for replacement parts 
4 0 Space saving home gym I am very very happy with this item However I only gave it five stars not because of the product but because of how the package came The box was tattered and looked like it would have fallen apart any second Also I had to run to Lowe s to pick up additional nuts and bolts in order to finish setting up the bench because they were not in the package Still for such a heavy piece of equipment it came in record time really really fast I use the bench three days a week for my strenght training sessions A really really good buy for the price Trust me I researched tons of other benches before deciding on this one You are not going to find another bench with all this equipment for this price Like another reviewer wrote you would end up having to pay around 250 400 for all that comes with this bench If you are looking for a good home gym to start out with this is it Not to mention it really doesn t take up that much space and as it states in its description it can be folded Also it is of good quality Very sturdy something that I am sure should last me for years HIGHLY RECOMMEND DON T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT FOR ANOTHER SECOND BUY THIS BENCH YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED 
4 0 It works but The Valeo Neoprene Waist Trimmer does help slim your waist While using it with exercise and sensible diet will help improve your outcome as it does help you sweat more but exercise is not necessary if you just want a slimmer waist Why The neoprene waist trimmer works on the concept of training you to suck in your gutt Wear the neoprene waist trimmer for just a few hours and you will notice immediate results The longer you wear it it takes 21 days to form a habit the easier it will become to suck in that gutt giving you the look of a slimmer waist I do not recommend wearing this 24 7 or while you sleep give your body a chance to adjust to sucking it in by itself and each day you put it on that you try and pull it just a little tighter 
4 0 Great Product This is a great product to use if you already or are going to start exercising It helps with posture during workout and after a week of continuous use I lost 5 inches around my belly It is a great product if used while exercising but not for little chores here and there 
4 0 definitely works This product definitely works You still have to workout eat right but using it in conjunction will definitely help you see results I started wearing the trimmer at the gym I have noticed a significant change in my stomach I measured my waist before I started using the product two weeks after and I had lost an inch I just bought one for my boyfriend 
4 0 Not a MIRACLE but effective First off these belts do not melt fat from your waist If you notice your love handles are often times cool to the touch which means that there will be limited bloodflow to the area A belt such as this will do ONE THING Help stimulate bloodflow to the area which will INCREASE the CHANCES of burning fat from the love handles They like everything else are totally useless if you do not exercise and maintain a proper diet Also a loss in inches does not equal a loss in fat To measure the fat loss of the area you need a caliper not a tape These belts are by no means miracle workers but can be of some benefit to those who are having problems with the love handles 
4 0 gator gloves I ENJOY KNOWING MY GLOVED HAND WILL STAY ON THE CLUB AND NOT SLIP THANKS IN PART OF THE TECHNOLOGY BUILT INTO THE GLOVE THEY ARE ALSO COMFORTABLE AS WELL 
5 0 great buy Price 7 Great buy for the price Even if you did pay full price Tried others like Nike Footjoy etc Didnt like the material These however dont feel like plastic very airy hands hardly ever sweat and grip like a well a reptile Dont hesitate to buy 
4 0 Works Great only 1 mod I d make It s bright mounts real easy and lasts quite a while The only modification I would make is to give it different levels of brightness Other LED lights I have come with 3 levels and a flash cycle That s it Otherwise it s a great inexpensive bike ligh 
4 0 Quick delivery minor problem The seller of this product made a quick delivery However when putting the product together one of the holddown brackets broke because it was make out of plastic Product still able to maintain its purpose and is used often Thanks for th4 product 
4 0 Not bad This is a good product it works well easy to use Im just lazy LO 
5 0 Easy to use There were no installation instructions for the Ab Roller and one of the screws became stripped during installation but the price was excellent and the product is easy to use I have never used an Ab Roller before but I found it to be a great assistence for sit ups This is a simple yet useful product 
4 0 Fun For Everyone This item is fun and durable I could do all sorts of things on it in the water and nothing happened to it It held up to 300 pounds which is crazy The double valve makes it so the mattress can t really leak This mattress gets wet very easily so if you want to stay completely dry do not buy this item If you want it to support about 3 people make sure you blow it up a lot I recommend it for everyone of all ages espeially kids Its just like any other water mattress out there but it doesn t pop My only concern was that when I got to the pool and sat on it in the water it seemed kinda flat So make sure you blow it up A LOT It may seem blown up but it might not be 
5 0 Good Stuff All the BSN products have above average taste my fave is the chocolate coconut This stuff is the perfect in between meals snack or a hedge against those cravings that knock you of your food plan 
5 0 good stuff I agree with the above post concering the above par flavors of these protein mixes My favorite is the Banana Cream Pudding Regarding the chocolate fudge pudding CFP flavor I am currently using this flavor and I would definitely recommend using milk instead of water Usually with protein mixes you can decide whether to use milk or water except with a fruit punch ish flavor i suppose because that would be weird but when I take the CFP with water it just doesnt seem to blend as well I also don t get the full pudding experience as I did with milk but i guess that s to be expected Like the previous review pointed out they do blend well with a spoon Stirring at an insane rate to make sure clumps don t develop isn t necessary with any of BSN s protein mix lines syntha 6 true mass and LDP 
1 0 the pump sucks well i think the stuff needs to be tested better i got the bell pump and it was broke and i don t have the money to send it back so im stuck with it im realy not happy about this bell pum 
5 0 Awesome Sword I ordered the product on Saturday and received it promply on Thursday with standard shipping Everything was in excellent condition There were no scratches or anything and the blade is of extremely good quality with kanji symbols engraved into it The metal accents on both the sheath and the handle are nicely made DEFINITELY worth the small 12 price tag and easily exceeds the quality of many other swords The point is also sharp and is capable of being handled which makes this sword good for both using and displaying 
5 0 Sharp and comfortable The sword is very good and I received it in good conditions The sheath got some scratches but the sword itself is strong 
4 0 BALANCE CONTROL I have been practicing with this for about a year I wanted to improve my snowboarding and surfing well I went snowboarding yesterday for the first time this year and did notice some difference I wanted to improve on my control of speed and turning so I mainly stayed to the practice area Last year I would just go straight down the hill and usually wipe out to stop I have since learned this is not proper I would say I was more aware and confident on the snowboard than last year and I think my practice on the bongo board is the reason why I still would like to try out my surfing to see if there is any improvement Overall this is a valuable training aid if you use it regularly and wisely 
4 0 Great balance trainer I ve had the Bongo board for a few days now and am very happy so far Very solid construction One great feature is that the axis of the roller stays connected to the board by a stretchy cord that runs along the length of the bottom of the board This prevents the roller from dangerously flying off across the room if you lose your balance I have seen other balance boards where the roller is not connected and this could be very dangerous since it could fly off and break something inside your home The roller is stopped on either end of the board by two trucks so it won t roll completely out from under you It is very difficult to do at first Beginners definitely need some chairs or something to hang onto or a spotter My friend who is a long time skateboarder tried it and thought it was also pretty tricky to balance it is a different feeling from skateboarding It comes with a booklet describing the right form and suggested ways to use the board and some tricks to learn once you get advanced 
5 0 Very cool very useful I really enjoy using my Bongo Board It s a lot of fun and it really helps with strengthening lower muscles as well as developing balance and fine motor skills 
5 0 Best Balancing Tool Yet If you are a runner or cyclist and have not done much in the way of improving your lower body balance this Bongo Board will make a huge difference I had to stop running marathons 5 years ago due to an imbalance in my hip muscles If I had known about this board 5 years ago I would have saved myself many trips to physical therapy and my massage therapist Yes I have and use an exercise ball and balancing pillows but this Bongo Board really works the adductors abductors quadriceps hamstrings calves etc Using the board makes the muscles start working together It is a real good workout just trying to balance on the board After a couple of days my hip pain has disappeared My hip feels great I can t wait to start training for my next marathon Pros If you want to improve your lower body balance coordination and strength try the Bongo Board It worked for me Cons Be patient it takes a couple of days to actually be able to balance on the board Make sure that you start with something to hold onto like a wall or back of a couch 
5 0 extreme fun The Bongo board is extreme fun Be prepared to scare yourself until you get your footing but once you loose the fear the fun doesn t stop Careful not to break an arm or your head 
5 0 Very cool I purchased this February 2007 for my 6yo son 48inches high He is good with his hands and coordination Fully charges in about 6 hours Very fast and fun Quiet We haven t tested offroad as I don t want to break it This is leaps better than Barbie jeeps 6mph this goes 18mph As fast as a quick bicycle Very cool 
5 0 Minimoto Review Just got the minimoto dune buggy for the kids for Christmas 2005 The kart is very sturdy and well made Real heavy duty tires that will take a beating Has actual replaceable adjustable rod ends on the steering system just like more expensive gas powered karts Initial charge out of the box took a bit longer but I believe it is fully charged from dead after about 6 hours Ride time on a fully charged battery is about 45 minutes but considering the speed this kart runs at 18 miles an hour those 45 minutes are a blast Very quiet so the neighbors wont mind a bit about the hours and hours your kids will spend buzzing up and down your street Highly recommended 
5 0 plz sum1 review yeh um i have nt gotten this i m still waiting for a review so will sum1 reiview it plz so i can see if its worth i 
5 0 owner operator I have an 11 year ols son and it gives us much enjoyment together 
4 0 Good for the money It inflates easy is very stable and has reasonable storage space in the front under the net and behind the seat Some issues I had with it were that the hull and valves tear easily when cold under 40 F I ve had two places in the hull tear and two valves The good news is that super glue works amazingly well at repairing both of these when given enough time to cure This kayak has given me 20+ good trips since September and despite issues is still going strong If you have more money to spend I would get a higher quality kayak but if you re on a tight budget and or are a beginner you can t beat this kayak for under 100 
4 0 A lot of fun for the money This has proved to be a nice item for family recreation I have several of these for group outings The kids just love them The kayaks are quite stable easy to manuever and a novice can easily handle them Compared with canoes and hardshell kayaks they are more forgiving much easier to transport but quite slow You can plan on traveling about 1 mile per hour without current You will not be able to make much progress up stream or into a stiff wind They have done well on afternoon outings on tame rivers and lakes but definately not built for big water or whitewater The kayaks have proved reasonably durable but I have had to patch several pinholes 
5 0 What a Blast If you want to have a blast buy one of these kayaks immediately We have had our two years and have floated down over a dozen rivers ranging from the Merced high up in the High Sierras to the Deschutes in Sunriver Oregon Inflates with a portable pump in three minutes and is so stable you literally cannot tip it over If you don t want to get wet you won t The paddle is included and works perfectly Both my wife and I absolutely love these kayaks and she even gave up her ocean going one They deflate within a minute and fold up into a small space The inflatable compartments have a special valve that will not leak unless you pull it out and away from the boat It makes inflating and deflating a breeze One of the best bargins I have seen over the past couple of years 
5 0 I liked it I was very happy with my first trial use of this Kayak I was going along with no worries until I saw a 5 6 foot alligator about 20 yards away This made me think that maybe this wasn t the right place for an inflatable Other than that it was a breeze to inflate and use I m very happy with this purchase I just need to do some more research about my locations first Pretty crazy rookie mistake 
5 0 Coleman Kayak A high quality product I was not one bit disappointed in the ease of inflation light carrying weight and durable paddle I was in the water in minutes enjoying my ride Best handling on calm waters The back rest is really supportive Great buy for low cost investment introduction to kayaking 
5 0 Grrrrrrrreat Wonderful invention for the family summer vacation You WILL get wet because water drips from the paddles Not a REAL kayak but great for the money Excellent quality Extremely comfortable Gets up good speed to cover some distance Paddles are light but quite sturdy Cup holder snuggly holds that important bottle of water Cargo carriers work well 
5 0 Schwinn Free Wheeler I purchased this stroller for my husband to use but I am trying to take it back for my own use Folding is easy but takes two hands The brake sets and releases with ease and it stears like a dream My rather tall 2 year old is very comfortable when sitting in it however he would prefer sitting more upright I have tightened the seat adjustment strap as far as I can but he still is reclined a bit too much I think I can modify it if I just take the time The only negative I have found is that it won t fold flat enought to fit in the trunk of my Grand Prix It is light enough for me to lift it into the back of my husband s truck and would fit nicely in the rear of a SUV or mini van Overall we are extremely pleased with our purchase 
5 0 A Great Jogging Stroller We love this stroller I checked out a whole bunch on line along with ones that my friends already owned and ones that were available at one of our local and over priced baby stores I also spoke with the people at the Schwinn In Step company before buying and it had all the features that they promised The best thing about it is the swivel canopy You can unsnap it and drop it down in front of baby when the sun is coming in from the front so baby doesn t get it in his eyes The second best thing is the swivel wheel in front When walking you can unlatch it and the front wheel turns freely When running lock it into place for safety and control For the price this stroller can t be beat Easy assembly too 
5 0 Great Stroller After reading about the drawbacks to this stroller I was hesitant to order it without first testing it myself I received it a few days ago and was pleasantly surprised Many of the drawbacks listed in other comments were not that major 1 Re size of stroller when folded My car is a 2000 Honda Accord and the stoller fits fine in the trunk IF I TAKE OFF THE REAR WHEELS The other jogging stroller model I considered also required removal of the rear wheels 2 Re stroller reclining too much The angle of inclination can be adjusted by adjusting the straps at the back of the seat to almost any angle you want 3 Re difficulty of folding stoller Yes the stroller is hard to fold completely with only one hand but it mostly folds by itself I think most non umbrella type strollers will require both hands to fold Overall this is a great stroller For traveling though another stoller is definitely required 
4 0 Overall great stroller Good 1 Smooth ride for my little one 2 Well made good construction 3 Attractive 4 Light enough as far as jogging strollers under 200 go 5 Front and rear wheels locks quickly easily and securely 6 HUGE hood for shade Bad Folding portability is HORRIBLE If you have a small trunk you re counting on it fitting in dont It s very bulky even folded if thats what you want to call it I have a minivan with no 3rd row seat so I ll get by just fine I just dread the day I HAVE to fit into my wife s Toyota Corolla =\ Otherwise its a great stroller 
5 0 Basic Functional They are Foosballs As a novice they seem correct weighted just fine and roll normally I paid around 6 which was very reasonable Our table gets very heavy use and these seem to be holding up just fine The balls get marked up from my table quite a bit so the white isn t white for long I suppose the soccer like balls are nicer to look at but after heavy use on our table I m sure it would just be marked up from banging around on the surfaces as well 
5 0 PC POD Works great Just plug it in to your usb port and hold down a button on your suunto watch and it automatically downloads into your suunto software program That s it 
4 0 Very very useful If you have a T series suunto this is a very nice option You can really have useful piece of data to analyze after workout 
5 0 Pro Cargo Net Perfect fit on my rear basket Very versatile with or without a basket on rear rack 
5 0 Good quality coffee thermos with excellent heat retention Purchased this product last week Money well spent Good quality absolutely leak proof and held liquid at same temperature when poured into the thermos Easy to drink from at any angle no spills Very satisfied with this thermos and would highly recommend 
5 0 Best mobile mug I ve ever owned This thing keeps coffee hot for half a day at least Great no spill as well Perfect for mountaineering 
5 0 Thermos E5 The Thermos E5 travel mug is everything Thermos says it is It seals tight with zero leakage and is easy to open to get drink Unlike travel mugs with the access hole near the rim you can drink from any where on the rim It keeps coffee hot for hours It is very impact resistant Very good travel mug 
5 0 Best Travel Mug ever If you like to take your time with your morning cofe this mug will keep it hot all day 
5 0 Holy Hot Coffee This is the best travel mug I ve ever had Yesterday I poured coffee at 7am and around 3pm it was still luke warm This mug is totally worth it 
5 0 Outstanding Mug This mug is without question the best I ve ever used for my coffee while on the way to and at work I ve tried quite a few others and this is absolutely a fantastic product It keeps coffee hot for hours does not leak or dribble and the drink from any angle top shows that someone actually thought about it in the design process I can t speak highly enough about this mug I have the mug and will be ordering the 20oz E5 beverage bottle and also the tumbler in the very near future FANTASTIC product 
5 0 Great first bicycle My husband and I got this bike for our 3 1 2 year old daughter for Christmas and we re all very happy with it I was a little leary about purchasing a bike online but all of the parts were there and my daughter is riding like a pro as much of a pro as one can be with training wheels I would definitely recommend this bike especially for Dora lovers 
5 0 Good design Dora Bike is good nice easy to assemble Good price 40 My 3 yr old can already ride it better than 12 bike 
5 0 EXCELLENT My child loved the Dora Bike it was perfect in every way We are completely satisfied 
5 0 GREAT This bike is super cute and the look on my goddaughter s face was absolutely priceless when she opened it She rides it all the time and it is perfect 
5 0 Santa Did Good My daughter is a rough and tumble 4 yr old who was desperately in need of a bigger bike This was a great purchase for an even better price In spite of the crashes and miles she cycles while I jog already logged on this bike it has held up wonderfully to this point The only thing I have to do from time to time is retighten the nuts that hold the training wheels in place I didn t have to put the bike together my husband is a technical genius but he had it put together in no time at all 
4 0 Dora Bike The bike is very cute however it didn t come with any parts assembly for the seat so my daughter was very dissappointed on christmas day when she couldn t ride her bike 
5 0 really works A lot of parts to assemble with weak instructions but after you get passed that it is a very sturdy machine that works very smoothly not as heavy as i thought at about 50 pounds so u can move it around its clicks are very close to eachother and with a quick release latch gives u confidence in moving up a notch im kicking the pads higher than ever now 
5 0 great stretching machine Great stretching maching for the price Assists with stretching to 190 degrees Solid construction that will last for years 
5 0 Great investment I was a little sceptical at first but my first time on it I knew it was money well spen 
4 0 Great Stretch this is just what we were looking for we wanted to increase our kicking range and this has helped 
5 0 Great Goggles These are the best googles I have ever had I have tried many Very comfortable anti fog no water in Great buying more soon 
4 0 pretty good the product is good and the color is suitable for teenagers pretty good I like it And of course it make impervious to water 
5 0 Excellent My Daughter swims 2 hrs a day 6 days a week she loves these goggles I think she has 4 or 5 pair all the same model only the color is different 
5 0 I LOVE vanquishers When I needed a new pair of goggles my friends from swim team recommended that I get Speedo Vanquishers I assumed that they knew what they were talking about since the majority of them had been on swim team for years and WOW did they I LOVE my vanquishers They let in no water they don t fall off when I dive in and I never have to worry about the straps breaking Now I won t use any other kind 
5 0 Great googles They don t fog up and they don t let water in The length of the straps and the nose strip are very adjustable to fit anyone And they look cool 
5 0 Going Gonzo over Googles Great googles have used them for years Fit like no other Prompt shipping Great service Great communications 
4 0 Did a good job I m not used to wearing goggles as I just started swimming a lot this year But after trying several cheap ones these worked very well They definitely kept the water out and did not fog up and they fit pretty well also I had them on pretty tight but I may have been able to loosen them a little 
4 0 swim goggles These work well but leave marks around my eyes that last all day They fog fairly easily but at least I don t lose my contact lenses when I swim I didn t pay attention to the instructions when I used the first pair and I found that the coating on the lenses scratched easily They will last longer if you are careful cleaning them 
4 0 Works Great The mirrors are small and take a little getting used to but once a rider becomes accustomed to the viewing area they work great They are small and compact and are out of the way when you don t want to use them The bar ends are stable and are great to lean on I love these 
4 0 Nice little girls bike My 4 year old daughter loved the looks of the bike and the size was a good match for her She took to riding it fairly easy with the training wheels on The only trouble she had was the back peddle breaks but after a few days she seemed to have no more problems and is enjoying her bike 
5 0 Nana s Basement Amusement Park Wonderful my grandchildren LOVED them Purchased at daily Special price with Free shipping they were delivered the next day The only problem I only ordered two 
4 0 No compaints I use this for dumbbell bench press military press back extensions and a lot more It works well you can do incline decline as well as flat bench workouts I like the light weight of it and it folds so it can be stored away Even with it being light it is quite sturdy too It works for what it was designed for and I loved the cheap shipping 
5 0 Essential travel towel If you are looking for a light weight water absorbing and dependable towel this is the one I bought my first one years ago and have used it on all my backpacking trips so have some of my friends that have forgotten theirs I recommend washing it a couple of times before the first use to soften it up a bit Do not buy this product if you are looking for luxury this does it s job period 
5 0 Awesome Ball This ball is very good quality I like that I do not have to worry about it bursting on me I also like the material your skin does not stick to it and is easy to clean 
5 0 Make Sure Your e Tall Before You Buy This is a big and I mean big ball When I received the ball from Valeo I thought they sent me the wrong size I hadn t fully inflated it even though it looked full Valeo told me it should be 29 when fully inflated If I had inflated my 65cm ball to 26 I wouldn t have needed this size ball I m 6 2 and I think the 65 cm would have worked for me Regardless this is a quality ball and works quite well for ab exercises etc I am pleased with the product just make sure your e tall before you order this size 
5 0 Increase Your Arm Strength This gym quality roller comes with a weight attachment You ll enjoy the comfort grip handle and the ease you ll have switching the weights 
5 0 GoFit GF WFB Wrist Forearm Blaster Review I am very pleased with the product Changing weights is very easy and quick Accomplishes the goal I intended 
5 0 Great product I have to say i took a risk by buying this product after all the reviews but im glad i did cause i saved some money doing it I got everything on time actually sooner than expected I like the feel good grip really well built and the ease of putting the plates in it im overall really happy with it and would definitely recommend 
5 0 An Excellent and Complete Forearm Exerciser This excellent accessory is not only a Wrist exerciser but a complete Forearm Strengthener Simple to use with no spring or moving or breakable parts it looks like it will resist the hardest workouts and continuous use I bought one eight months ago and I loved it I use it at home and even at the gym since it is small and very light so it fits in my backpack taken about the same space than my gloves With simple rolling movements and as you gradually increase resistance by adding weight plates to it you strengthen hands wrist forearms and upper arms I have considerably improved wrist stability and holding power and also feel an Increased range of motion and flexibilit 
1 0 Missing a Part Device arrived w o the plate that enables a weight to be attached to the rope Don t bother trying to first get help from the manufacturer as Amazon Com advised when I reported the problem to them GoFit s website doesn t include an 800 number nor any way to contact them via the Internet The device arrived w o any manual parts list instructions or any information on how to contact them if you had a problem or question 
5 0 Schedule Workout Time If you don t have a full hour to work out each day this DVD gives you shorter workouts to help you fit them into your busy schedule 
5 0 Great DVD if I don t have a full hour to workout First of all I have to say that Cathe is the BEST instructor out there All of her workouts are great and they will definitely give you results I reach for this DVD often as I don t have much time on weekdays to do other Cathe s DVDs that are usually over 1 hour long This DVD is also perfect for beginners and intermediates I recommend Cathe 100 If you want results then don t look any further 
5 0 insane this gun is so crazy it hurts bad once i had my thumb on the barrel and pulled the trigger on accecident but i shot my thumb and it hurt for the rest of the day pros looks good hurts fun cons supresser does nothing hard to cock all in all great gun buy it NOW 
5 0 best gun out for price This gun is awesome for the price It has a very sturdy fell to it and shoots fairly hard The clip holds 26 rds and you get 2 of them so you ll never run out This gun is the greatest pistol our for under 25 and if you don t buy it you re stupid 
5 0 Great gun for price Wow this gun is amazing It is very accurate The gun itself is light It came with exactly 1 metal silencer made to improve accuracy and TWO Magazines This package did not come with BB s so of course you have to buy BB s There is one slight thing I don t like which is the release magazine button It is right under the trigger frame and you have to push down on it It s not really a button rather it s a lever Overall this gun is the gun to get for anything because it is cheap light accurate and holds 26 rounds each I would say this gun shoots about the same or more as a KWC Desert Eagle which I have too and for the price of this gun the KWC Desert Eagle is no match 
5 0 Great Gun This is a great gun with good power accuracy and clip size The extra clip and full metal silencer ia a great addition But be careful with the silencer my sister turned it on to tight and the gun broke 
5 0 MK23 This is a great gun Very powerful and durable It has a full metal silencer and is a HUGE gun And to answer ur question if u read the description not only can the gun use 12 bb s it strengthens the fps to 320 
5 0 One of the best spring gun deals EVER This gun not only is better than Marui but it s about 1 3rd of the price at least It comes with a full metal mock silencer the rest of the gun is hard plastic AND an extra clip UTG is easily one of the best Airsoft makers around And for the price you really can t beat this deal 
5 0 is it metal it kind looks like it is and i might buy it if it is let me know 
4 0 Good but the computer lacks a seconds feature This jump rope s grips are good and supple and nice on the hands The cord gets very tangled when not in use but gets untangled during jumping The jump rope has a nice adjustable length feature The computer lacks flash memory and it defaults to 130 pounds for the calorie calculation so you have to set it to your weight each time you turn it on Understandable for the price The computer lacks the ability to set the countdown timer to seconds it only does minutes I like to do 30 second high energy jumping and I can t keep that up for 1 minute so no seconds feature is not good It takes about 700 jumps for me at 180 pounds and 6 5 it only takes weight input though to get 100 calories to register I do sets of 100 not too tiring and then walk around the kitchen 4 times and then do another 100 
5 0 Love it I highly recommend this product Although I m new to the jumproping business I think that both beginners and avid jumpropers would enjoy this tool 
5 0 If you re looking for a perfect rope this is it I am a jump rope nut I knew a guy who had bad knees and lost 75lbs jumping rope every day instead of running It always lingered in my mind that jumping could be the best way to exercise It burns more calories per minute than running and has less yes less impact by far than running Most folks don t realize that After a bead rope and reading up more and going to boxing gyms I realized a speed rope was the trick However I also like gadgets So I got the Tanita digital jump rope It s ingenious counts calories and rotations But it wasn t fast enough It sells on Amazon and I recommend it as well So I got a Buddy Lee professional metal super fast rope I love it but it s 40 also from amazon I just got this one the discovery rope and LOVE it It takes a little setting up and then it s the fastest rope I have And I find it very motivating You see in addition to counting calories it also has a countdown timer You set how long you want to jump not counting the time spent huffing puffing and panting til you become more conditioned and it will keep track It also counts repetitions It is also half the price of the very reasonable Tanita model The timer is very sensible because you don t have to watch a clock or even be near one and of course when you re jumping you can t exactly look at your watch I highly recommend this I ve bought 10 of them to give to friends as well The only thing I wish they had although it would add a lot to the price is a pulse function built into the handle with a beep option so you could gauge your intensity without even looking Hint free idea Discovery But my heart rate strap and watch work ok for the task TOld you I love gadgets 
5 0 A good yawara stick is hard to find This is a hard nylon version of the yawara stick There used to be some impressive versions of these on the market but now there s this one and two others one aluminum and one wooden both functional but rather less inspired The more common pocket stick is the kubotan which is just a shorter skinnier yawara stick usually configured as a keyring Kubotans come in many shapes and materials As Don Rearic writes you can think of a pocket stick as a knife but with two differences You can thrust but not cut and you can target bony areas Also to the extent that poking holes in people is bad legal hygiene the stick is safer than the knife You can strike with the pommel of the yawara in a hammer blow or with the point in a reverse hammer blow or even a sort of rapier thrust bracing the tip with the thumb You can also use it to trap or lock joints if you know what you re doing Anything you hit even moderately hard is going to hurt This thing can break bone pulverize muscle and shock nerves all without skinning or fracturing your knuckles Yes the product description says it s non lethal but if you whack someone in the head with it you could kill him And just breaking someone s bones is no joke either Before you try it out on friend or foe do everyone a favor and take a few whacks at a piece of 3 4 plywood This should give you some respect for what this tool can do Unlike many weapons the yawara stick won t extend your striking range You have to get up close and personal with whatever you re hitting which usually means it can hit you If you re too timid to close range a pocket stick probably won t do you a lot of good This thing is like having big indestructible knuckles on each end of your hand Highly recommended Please use Google for more info as Amazon doesn t allow offsite hyperlinking 
1 0 not a good value for the money More of a toy than a bike Training wheels clearly say do not remove Returning this Fortunately Amazon s return policy is awesome Thank you Amazon Ordered a different item to replace this from you 
5 0 Great Gloves These are really great gloves I use them at least twice a week sometimes three times a week They are really comfortable easy to get on and off and have just enough padding A few other people in my kickboxing class also have these gloves and one of the ladies has been using her gloves for at least a year If you are into kickboxing and are looking for a good pair of gloves these are GREAT Note You should make sure that you get the right size for your hands I actually looked up the Harbinger website and they tell you what to measure and what size you should get 
4 0 Very durable decent French press I use this mug primarily so that I can have coffee at the office without having to depend on the gross communal pot that nobody ever cleans It is quite satisfactory for that purpose as it is convenient easy to clean and portable I always pour the coffee into another mug after steeping to stop it from continuing to steep It loses one star because it is only an okay French press The filter leaves a little more sludge than it ought even with a pretty coarse ground But it s certainly passable On a camping trip this thing would be heaven as it is very durable and easy to clean The bottom line If you need a portable French press this definitely will do the job 
5 0 I love this cup It is AWESOME This was originally purchased to solve how to solve the what is a light weight way to make GOOD coffee while backing problem I tried many things from taking the tea bag style single coffee bags to actually taking a lexan french press and even cowboy coffee I like good strong coffee but I am not a huge fan of 3 dimensional coffee which is what I get with cowboy coffee This cup press solves everything and it is multi purpose and light weight I now use it at home a lot also and at work Hot water is pretty easy to come by in most places All I need is a sample of my favorite coffee around At home it is the easiest way to make one cup of coffee Just scoop in my coffee dump in my hot water and take the cup with me Wait a couple of minutes and start drinking It is really great when leaving the house Since I am a bit of a coffee snob I never have to drink just whatever people have around or what they like All I need is hot water When backpacking I actually store a zip lock bag with my coffee inside of the cup to save space This cup is the only cup I take in my pack i e no extra drinking cup I drink water from my Nalgene or bladder If I need a cup I use this one On cold mornings this makes an insulated bowl for hot cereal before my cup of hot coffee The handle is strong I have hit the trail with coffee in hand and just clipped in on the outside of pack when empty It has never cracked or broken Also since this is a french press clean up is easy A couple of ounces of water a couple of swishes around and spread out result No garbage to pack out and no impact to the environment The best of both worlds Did I say I loved this cup 
5 0 Solid Training Glove I bought this in 14 ounce Great glove well built and was made with the hand and proper punching form in mind Can t say enough about this glove I spend about 6 8 hours a week in mine Huge difference in this and the 30 everlast training glove that I also have I was still getting sore hands with those after working the heavy bag but have no problems with the pro gloves If you re serious about boxing or care about your joints spend the money 
5 0 A Unique Pull Up Bar Work your arms chest shoulders and back and begin to see improvement almost right away Unlike many pull up bars this one doesn t need to be attached to the doorway 
5 0 Works great in the doorway This product will hold my weight 200lbs without any problem It has begun to leave surface marks on the doorway where it rests so it s probably a good idea for a user to place a thin towel or something in between the unit and the door 
4 0 Great exercise Finding the right door jam for the bar took a little time I have thick molding around most doors but once I got it properly mounted I have used it extensively The various grips allow for multiple levels of difficulty as well as different muscle concentration 
4 0 Nice for pull ups My main concern when buying this product was making sure I didn t have to permanently attach it to anything I simply wanted a pull up chin up bar that I didn t have to mount to the wall This did exactly that It feels a little light but holds my weight steadily I m 180lbs After using it for a while the assembly did get a little louse but I tightened it back up and everything was just fine I haven t used it to do any of the other exercises and probably won t It s a great purchase Also slips under the bed when not in use 
4 0 Sit up bar This works great for pullups and pushups but it says it can also be used as a sit up bar Can anyone explain to me how to do that I can t get it to hold my feet securely no matter how I place it in the door frame Directions were pretty vague but still easy to put together by looking at the picture They should include instructions on how to properly use the bar for the various exercises you can supposedly do No problem with parts 
5 0 Great product Instructions for assembly were easy Many different exercises to do besides the ones they show you in the manual Took maybe 5 minutes to put together and the instuctions were very easy to understand It clearly defined which different screws went where Great purchase 
5 0 Lose the Pain Without a lot of Time Relieve your back pain by spending only 3 or 4 minutes per day on this inversion table The machine is lightweight and stows away easily 
4 0 It s 84 degrees in my pocket My son gave me this for Christmas having picked it from my Amazon com wish list Like all Victorinox Swiss Army knives it s a brilliantly designed gentleman s multitool I wanted the altimeter and thermometer features for my occasional travels to Colorado and motorcycle camping Since my home state of Indiana is pretty flat especially the northern half where I live the altimeter s chief value is as a barometer if the altitude goes up the pressure is dropping and stormy weather is coming if the altitude goes down the pressure is rising and good weather will follow Likewise I haven t done any real outdoor stuff since Christmas so about the only temperature readings I ve seen have been straight out of my pants pocket which I can report is a pretty consistent 84 degrees Fahrenheit I love gadgets and this is a cool little gadget 
5 0 2nd Pair of Snowshoes I love snowshoeing I do it on regular basis and own multiple pairs of snowshoes including some more expensive products I bought these because I wanted to have a backup set for when guests come to our cabin This is perfect I love them I wouldn t use these to climb Denali but are perfect for recreational use And the price is right 
5 0 Excellent workmanship I was offered this item from my Gold Box and while I think the kit is well made and well thought out I m a little puzzled because I live in Southern California and there s no way in blazes that I would ever need these Some days the Gold Box is weird 
5 0 Wow I like this gun alot At first when i saw it i thought it wouldn t be so powerful and i would just use it as a secondary weapon It still is my secondary weapon but i still use it alot sometimes i will put awat my mp5 and use that instead It holds a dedcent sized clip for a pistol and shoots at about 200 fps and will go for about 75ft Its like a sniping pistol The only disadvantage is that when u try to take out the mag in a fire fight it dosn t drop u have to pull it out so that waste some time in a fight I also wouldn t use it as my primary weapon because u have 2 cock it every time but if it was a semi automatic i would defenatly use it Another bad thing about it is that sometimes the BB s jam and then u have to take the gun apart to fix it I think it s a good secondary weapon and that if someone is relatively far away 25 60ft u can snipe them with it It is defenatly a good buy 
5 0 I like it I like it a lot The title pretty much stands for my review When I first bought it I was thinking This is prolly some cheap piece of Chinese plastic that will break after 5 shots Well the plastic part was right but about 120 shots later and this thing is still firing like like a motha Larger er gun Not like a Desert Eagle or anything but a reasonable size Mag doesn t fall out when you press the butting but its not impossible to reach up and remove the mag Base line Buy it Even if you don t think you need it Resell it to some kid like myself for 10 bucks Or keep it and use it as a back up in warfare 
2 0 Cheap and made that way Bought this one for my son to plick around with It never did shoot Even if it did it wouldn t last long Looks good so I gave it a 2 Do not buy one if you expect BBs to exit the little hole in the end 
5 0 great for ankle rehabilitation This is the same stability trainer my physical therapist has in her office I bought my own so I could do the exercises at home I really like it 
5 0 Great value on a regulation set We bought this bocce set over a year ago and we ve been very happy with it The balls are a full 110mm and have the size and heft that the cheap sets lack After a year of heavy use and abuse in lots of different environments the balls show very little wear The carrying crate is well constructed and seems to be made to last It s a little awkward to carry any significant distance though so you might consider a nylon carrying bag if you travel with them very much All in all a wise purchase 
5 0 Excellent choice I recomend this jump rope to anybody who s serious about there health and looking to get in shape 
5 0 A Good Rope I am very pleased with the performance and quality of this rope It is exremely fast 
4 0 Good for a cheap jump rope I bought 20 of these for my girls high school tennis team that I coach Price was a major factor in my decision and I was pleased with the quality Two items first the end caps fall off and get lost Second adjusting the length of the rope is fairly easy but there are no instructions that tell you how to do it properly 
5 0 great jump rope great rope for a great price easy to adjust length smooth action with the ball bearings 
5 0 solid jump rope This is a good jump rope for people at pretty much any fitness level The only problem is that it is quite difficult to adjust If you are about 6 1 or 6 2 you won t have to adjust it at all Once that task is completed you will find that this rope offers a smooth and challenging workout It hurts a little bit when it hits you but that just offers more incentive for you to be perfect 
4 0 It s a Rope this rope is fine can t say that it is any better or any worse than any other jump rope 
4 0 It s worth the price It looks great but the sheath doesn t fit well with the sword so it s hard to pull it out The free stand is a little unstable but can t complain with it because it s free If you re not a Kenshin fan it might not be the best sword for you 
4 0 Nice I love this sword The blade is sharp and the sword itself is well taken care of Over all I love this sword 
5 0 Excellent product and service I received the item within 2 days Everything was accounted for and the blade was perfect I would definitely order again 
4 0 GREAT Im not gonna get into the details with yall so imma cut it short i bought 1 got it 2 day dec 11 and ne 1 who is thinkin about buyin 1 i say they should cuz i think its a great sword 4 the price u gettin it at THE END I APPROVE THIS SWOR 
5 0 Aoshi sama To the battojutsu master the sword by China is a better buy I purchases both and the one by China is better Don t expect to swing it around a lot though It is not a full tang sword so the blade doesnt go through the hilt It is a nice sword and as a fan of the manga and anime I had been looking for a sakabato for a while It is a wonderful replica and even though I prefer Aoshi s kodachi s are better To anyone who is a fan of the show or just a sword enthusiast this is a great buy for the price 
5 0 AWSOME THis is a great sword it is real cool it is very clean and shiny i love the detail i cut my brother s hand off heh heh heh just kidding 
5 0 Pleasently Surprised I love weapons and because of that i have bought many a katana I also happen to love anime so this was a great oppurtunity to combine those interests Most katans i buy basically just look good and begin to wobble after about a week of just display use the wraps around the handle have a tendancy to become on wraped and the hilt begins to just basically fall apart after a while but this weapon is extremely well crafter for being a production sword I cant say it looks alot like kenshins but the fact that it is a sakabatu is amazing and the blade its self impresses me just as much handle The scabbard is just as supurb as the sword and makes for an over all nice package well worth the money For a sword being bought over the internet for this price it is a great find and worth the money If you like ruroni kenshin i suggest buying this and if you just like katanas in general and would like a nice cheap well crafted one for display or for just the hell of swingin it around this is a great one to get = 
4 0 Great but not Amazing I ordered this Sword because I loved Rurouni Kenshin and I freaked out when it arrived cause it was so cool But for all those who are wondering the sword s edge is Not as sharp as i thought although you can just sharpen it yourself But it is nicely made and firm 
5 0 To the nay sayers you must have received a different product then I did Bought this for my daughter 20mo s for Christmas She absolutely loves it My 4 year old son is actually able ot use it as well Yes its a little small for him but for my daughter the products intended audience it s great To all the nay sayers I have no idea what you are talking about Is your child some kind of a gargantuan I wish I could scoot around on this thing 
5 0 Love this toy I purchased this for my 2 year old daughter She is small for her age and the bike scooter will work for a couple of years hopefully It would be too small for toddlers that are a lot taller For our purposes it s great She loves it and feels like a Big Girl on it She can easily scoot around safely on her own It has a wide base so it can t tip over and is very stable After opening many frustrating xmas boxes and toys I was extremely happy with the packaging of this toy I just had to open the box and slide it out No assembly We ll get lots of use out of this one 
5 0 Love the Scuttle Bug I got the Scuttle Bug for my 2 yr old daughter and she just loves it Anytime we have little ones over the Scuttle Bug is the first thing they go for It s perfect since she moves it with her own feet and can go at any speed she wants to and it s in her control It s safe for the floors which is even better Its a great way to get them started before riding a bike even a tricycle since her feet can t reach the pedals yet Friends of ours had one for their little one and our daughter liked it so much we had to go out and buy her one It is great 
5 0 my daughter loves this We got this for our 19 month old when her big brother got a regular razor scooter She loves it and is a speed demon on it I read the reviews and most said their child was too big but my daughter is 98 in height she is taller than most 2 year olds and has no problem using her legs to really go I m glad I ingnored the other reviews because it s my daughter s favorite toy 
5 0 Great for the price My wife and I couldn t believe how expensive bike trailers can get and since we are both college students our budget is limited We bought this becuase of the price and I have been suprisingly happy with it The setup is extremely easy and fast no tools needed and my daughter 16 months seems very comfortable in it One drawback is it doesn t work well with a helmet on her 
5 0 Good for leisure bikers Since we are not serious bikers we were not willing to pay big for the trailer This one fits our budget It is easy to toll and runs smoothly The only issue I had was that once I put the trailer on I cannot put the kickstand back This is somewhat troublesome because we cannot just stop anywhere we want 
5 0 Excellent Bike Trailer Recieved this item and it was very easy to put together It is very compact when folded and not in use I love it It is so easy to take the kids when biking it rides very nice and you can t even tell it s there 
5 0 Instep Take 2 Bike Trailer Very good price Easy to assemble and restore Run very smooth and steable 
5 0 Great Trailer I pulled this trailer on a 32 mile ride on a very remote part of the Great Allegheny Passage rail trail I had it loaded with camping gear no kids in the trailer and it worked very well The trailer is not designed for hauling gear but it did a fine job I was not on a paved path at all the tires were great no problems going through a few bumpy areas and muddy areas The trailer tracked well behind my bike no problems The trailer has a good sturdy welded frame 
5 0 Worth every penny I was a little hesitant to purchase the least expensive model but I m glad I did It s wonderful Installation was so easy I had it done when my husband got home from work The kids love riding in it We have 2 kids both around 30 lbs and they fit comfortably Plus there is a storage area in the back We pack towels snacks and juice and go t o the pool I highly reccommend this model rather than spending more money 
5 0 Best thing since Bowflex I love a good workout and have been in and out of gyms and various home programs since I was in high school This is the VERY BEST thing for people who find themselves strapped for time or who just really aren t the gym type but need a REAL workout I have to enjoy a workout to keep at it and I DO ENJOY THIS ONE Granted you won t get ripped using this system and I would recommend some additional form of cardio that helps target the lower body like an eliptical or stair climber but I actually get a little sore from the upper body portion of this workout which targets chest triceps biceps deltoids lats shoulders and mid back The bands are simple tools and after having used the likes of Nautilus equipment I admit I was skeptical but the bands deliver WHEN USED PROPERLY I have done a few other Pilates and Yoga home systems and this tops them The video cuts out all the mystical glitzy crap and gets straight to the workout which features only the instructor who explains very simply what to do Best of all no dance hall music Great price great product an all around winner Now be advised You will need a door that closes snug in which to secure the band ring Also I was a little disappointed to find that the video comes in VHS format only and I had to have a friend burn it to DVD before I could use it But it was worth it 
4 0 Excellent Value For the price this light is hard to beat Over the years I have used approximately twenty different bicycle lights by brands such as Cateye Cygolite and Planet Bike While some of these were significantly better than the Bell they were also three to ten times as expensive If you don t mind the large mass of four AA batteries on your handlebars and have under twenty dollars to spend the Bell Night Trail bicycle light is the way to go The real downside to having the batteries in the enclosure is the hazard created when the housing becomes dislodged during an impact While this has not happened with the Bell light it did occur with a Planet Bike light while riding through traffic in NYC The distraction was extremely dangerous Losing half of the batteries was not fun either Fortunately the Bell light has a sturdy enclosure where the top half slides backwards to open This makes it almost impervious to front and vertical impacts However the internal latches never quite give you a clear indication that it is closed Rather you must squeeze the top downward and push forward simultaneously until you can t move it further Much like the headlight the taillight compares well to more expensive lights Similar to competing products it has various blinking modes as a well as an always on setting Due to the design of the lens light escapes from the sides and top of the light Such side lighting is crucial for riding in urban areas The build quality is good but not on par with the 100+ lighting systems But again the selling point of this light is overall value Some of the nicer features include a bright Xenon bulb paired with miserly LED lights that can blink for hours Unlike some of the MR11 based bulbs parabolic track lighting bulbs the lens assembly has two ports on the right and left sides This spreads light perpendicularly to the path of travel which is a nice feature when in traffic These features combined with a very modest price make this light an excellent choice for the budget conscious Pros Value Brightness Combination of LED and Xenon modes Decent build quality Side lighting on headlight Cons Questionable design of battery compartment top half of headlight Bulky LEDs could be brighter 
4 0 Nice design poor documentatation I had no quality control problems reported by others Frame was clean and went together without problems I did have to think some to attach the net to the frame using bungee cords provided The instructions aren t much help The picture on Amazon is of a net attched with individual clips The new method is to use continuous elastic cords three for the top three for the bottom plus two more for the back panel Start at the middle of the frame where everything folds together and work up to the top threading cord every third hole in net use another to go across the top third to go down to the middle of the frame again Do same for bottom half of net Once I got it figured out went on quickly The pitchback works wonderfully Note it is very large 
5 0 COULDN T BE HAPPIER This is a great product all of the bells and whistles which are actually functional and improve security and ease of use Would recommend to all cyclists 
5 0 Therapy for Your Back Give your back the gift of a truly great stretch with this inversion table It s easy to use and simple to assemble Your back will thank you 
5 0 Easy to assemble great for a back stretch I love this inversion table It was easy to assemble gives me a great back stretch and the price was exceptional and it shipped for FREE This is a great value 
5 0 great purchase This is actually the first review I have ever left I highly recommend this bottle Water tastes very clean compared to plastic bottles It makes a big difference Every time I have taken it out someone always seems to complement on how cute the design is as well I m very happy with this product 
5 0 best water bottle out there yet I hesitated before buying this water bottle because it s so much more expensive than others out there But I do think that it s worth every penny 1 water tastes clean 2 the bottle does not smell 3 water is kept surprisingly cold for a long tim 
5 0 FUN Personal Water Bottle This is an upscale designer water bottle top of the line and so much fun The designs Of Sigg s water bottles are gorgeous from the plain solid color bottles to the ones with intricate designs They are simply beautiful I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns thinking it take more work to maintain These do necessitate regular cleaning I clean mine every day but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun Sort of like my rings glasses and watch I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory reminding me to drink more water making a statement about my values and expressing myself with a special design Yes all in a water bottle Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality made of light aluminum on the outside slightly insulated and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles They are light durable and perfect for any activity Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles just like from the tap I bought this particular top because I don t like sports tops and I don t mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink It is totally leakproof which is important to me The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner I like carrying mine though I get comments on it all the time What s that I love it Sigg makes their personal water bottle in 6L and 1L in this style I have both I use the 6L for sports activities because they are smaller When I won t have to carry the container I like the larger bottle They are expensive but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health so they are well worth it value wise for me Highly recommended 
4 0 Great ball My husband bought this ball for me as a mothers day present when I was 6 months pregnant It was the only thing I could sit on comfortably with my off balanced condition The oval shape is perfect for sitting on and bouncing After baby was born it was even better than a rocking chair for putting the little one to sleep he loves it and it was also a great workout tool for getting back that pre pregnancy figure My only complaint is that the hand air pump is a little difficult to use and it takes a while to get it aired up your hand will get tired and you will need to take a break from pumping 
5 0 Most useful item in my workout room I have a large home gym with around 30k of equipment This 400 set is my favorite and most used item I have one set for me and one for my wife and they fit neatly on the stand They are very easy to use and are the most comfortable dumbbells I ve ever used due to the padded grips I admit that I had my doubts at first I was worried they the grip wouldn t hold up the weight selection pins would bend or the weights would fall on my head After 4 years of regular use my fears were unfound The grip is intact and the weight stacks are absolutely stable I ve tried the newer adjustable dumbbells on the market but this is still my favorite The weight selection seem much more secure than the nautilus and the grip is more comfortable It s my opinion that these are still the best adjustable dumbbells out there 
5 0 Just Right Completely compatible with bb gun Holds enough bbs to practice for quite awhile Durable and sturdy 
4 0 It s Ok This product was not what I had expected It makes loading easier but not by much First of all the Speed Loaders hold around 100 instead of 120 Also it will take some getting used to before loading a pistol magazine right 
5 0 yeah it s great very convenient very fast just go slow when you re loading because if you go really fast you can end up jamming or it can end up not loading right so if you go slower you re actually going faster 
5 0 exteamly usefull THIS IS A MUST BUY Some airsoft guns take 3 5 minutes of painstaking work to load But with this it will only take around 15 seconds If you get an airsoft gun with a mag without a bb resavor this is a goodsent it s only 89 cents what do you have to loose 
5 0 Works Excellent having this speed loader is a god send i have an extra mag for my beretta m92 so i dont really need it for battle but for those whose have the same gun i do it is a real pain to load each pellet one by one this makes it much much easier 
5 0 A+ Sold gloves great price Everlast does not disappoint Great sparring gloves fit good for a 6 2 bloxer Delivered on time would recommend 
5 0 Awesome All I can say is that they are very comfortable There is nothing more to say 
5 0 Everlast Boxing Gloves These are great gloves There tight fitting and very comformtable Great for hitting my bag 
5 0 16oz are BIG Try for 10oz or 12oz Go to a sport store and try on some gloves to find your size Most people will fit a 10oz pair of gloves From wrist to top of middle finger 17cm From thumb outstretched to side of hand 15cm A 10oz will fit those dimensions Getting a Velcro type pair of training gloves is important With laces and you will not be able to tie up on your own With Velcro you put on one and the other you use your teeth It is easy just hold the Velcro in your mouth and twist the wrist and wham a pair of gloves in ten seconds flat With lace ups you will be all day getting ready for your workout Of course these are just training gloves you will probably want lace ups for the real deal You can learn various bandaging to strengthen your hand and wrist bones if you want but the gloves should be enough When you are finished you should leave them open to air The gloves come with the thumb attached to the knuckles as they should be with air pockets covering the palm area You can buy other martial arts gloves with the thumb area exposed and loose and also elasticated fist protectors for more lightweight punching that is especially good for the speedbag workout Get you 80lb bag and you will be learning some exercises that will keep you lean and mean Enjoy 
5 0 The Only Home Gym You Need This easy to assemble weight bench allows you to work both your back and abdominal muscles This piece of equipment is like several gyms in one 
4 0 quick and easy I was able to put this bench together by myself and was surprised how simple it was It is sturdy enough and easily adjusts The price is great for this home version I suffer from a lower back injury and mentioned this bench to my doctor and she agreed that starting off slowly but consistently will help anyone strengthen their lower back muscles 
5 0 Several machines in one but not gimmicky Great for lower back issues If you suffer from lower back pain this is the machine you ve been waiting for Before thee Ab Hyper Bench came along you had to use a roman chair in order to work your lower back But roman chairs aren t made for home use because they re too bulky considering that they really aren t good for much else but that one exercise unless you re a pro bodybuilder Personally I find it difficult to climb into position on a roman chair even at the gym The Ab Hyper Bench however is easy to use and has several purposes Back raises crunches curls leg lifts and you could even use it as your bench press This unit is not built like one of those crappy informercial workout widgets This is heavy gauge steel that was built to last The padding is pretty durable too and the moving parts feel solid and move smoothly The only draw back I can see is that people particularly men with short legs may have trouble leaning over against the flat pad I have a 28 inseam and when I lean over the hip knee pad well let s just say that it s a little close for comfort And that s at the lowest setting Aside from that one detail I ve got no complaints Invest in one of these to strengthen your lumbar region Between sets walk around to the other side to do some incline sit ups or dumbbell presses Cheers 
4 0 Simple assembly easy to use basic model This bench is simple to assemble I would like to see pins with spring loaded retainer pins because the pins that come with the model only slide in but can slide back out just as easy The use of this model is easy to perform The situps arrangement might be difficult for shorter legged users to comfortably use The bench is also a little short for situps for taller or larger framed individuals Overall though this is a nice basic bench for the price 
4 0 Surprisingly good quality for the price Delivery the item arrived promptly and was well packaged there was no damage Assembly uncomplicated and took under 30 minutes instructions were straightforward the bench can be easily folded and stored away Country of origin China Construction the steel frame is fairly light but sturdy no rickety parts every single joint is thoroughly welded the bench does not rock or tip during exercise paint job is A+ padding is a little on a flimsy side and I do not expect it to last as long as my previous bench the manufacturer specifies 250 lbs as a user weight limit Dimensions the seat is only 28 5 inches long so decide for yourself whether this is adequate for you I would estimate that anyone over 6 ft tall will have difficulty using this product for sit ups The vertical component of the bench tilted 40 degrees and used for back hyperextension exercises has adjustable height and will accommodate just about any sized human but do not forget the 250 lbs weight limit it does excellent job isolating the lower back muscles Overall appearance it looks like a quality product overall from stitching to glossy finish the design is certainly compact and clever for what this bench does Price 100 for a bench like this including delivery is a good value Rating 4 stars there are nicer products out there but they are all bulkier and more expensive 
4 0 Great ab bench I was very pleased with this purchase It was for my guy for Christmas He d been looking for an inverted bench but put off the purchase until after the holidays His 5 year old daughter helped me with assembly It did take a couple of tries on getting the foot plates and the actual bench in the right orientation but all in all it was very simple to assemble It is heavier read sturdier than I expected it to be so I was quite pleased about that If any complaints at all I do not like the lack of padding on the bar behind the knees if you are on the incline bench The ankle bar padding is great but additional padding on the knee bar would be more comfortable with extended repetitions It would be simple to add more padding or a towel if it is too hard on the back of your knees 
4 0 Good product for the price I was looking for a machine that can help with both my back and abe during my recovering from back surgery This is an excellent buy for around 100 does everything I am looking for without taking too much space or burn a hole in my wallet 
4 0 Good for practice Add some extra weight to the bottom if you re an extreme boxer Otherwise with a 70 or 100lb bag it s great 
4 0 Good Combo It is a convient stand that allows both the training of the heavy bag and the speed bag necessary for improving one s boxing or martial arts skill It has limits regarding the mobility of working the heavy bag in a 360 degree radius because of the platform and weights required to stablize the stand If you have the space I suggest two sperate training locations of the speed bag and heavy bag If not this product will serve its purpose 
4 0 Everlast Heavy Bag Stand This Heavy Bag stand is a pretty good piece of equipment The heavy bag part of it definitely requires add l weight hint bags of sand are much cheaper than the amount of barbell plates you ll need to keep this thing from moving I use 200 pounds of bags of sand to keep it in place Also be sure you get a double end heavy bag too i e one with a bottom D ring otherwise you ll get too much bag swing You can also put a true double end light bag on this portion of the unit which is a nice change of pace from the heavy bag The light double end bag is the small inflatable that has two bungees holding it at about chest level and reverberates like mad when you hit it The speed bag platform is a bit flimsy especially on the earlier models where the drum or rebound board is two pieces the latest versions of this model use a single piece drum If you become moderately proficient at the speed bag in any amount of time you ll outgrow this aspect of the unit Part of the problem is that the single vertical pole to which the speedbag drum attaches will flex when you get the bag moving really fast and that can throw off your timing Use the smallest size speed bag possible to minimize this inertia Lastly the speed bag platform doesn t really adjust high enough for people over 6 2 in height and if you re over 6 1 or so you re going to need to use a small or xtra small speed bag to have it hang at the correct height i e belly of bag at mouth chin level 
4 0 Good stand previous review is right about weights The previous review is absolultely correct about the weights If you don t have weights on the legs the stand it will in fact fly about your basement I d also recommend a double ended bag i e with a D ring on the bottom of the bag It decreases bag sway I m just using 2 bungee cords to tie it down to the stand but that seems to work out pretty well instead of a proper Shock Cord Very helpful for practicing kicks On top of the weights I ve also added 2 40 lb bags of water softening salt on the front legs for even more stability There s nothing special about that kind of salt I just happened to have them around It looks a little Rube Goldberg but for the price I m willing to live with it The speed bag stand is nice Loud but nice 
4 0 Good product but buy some weights if you re a heavyweight I ordered the 4790 heavy bag stand recently I have limited boxing experience but I m not brand new to the sport I m a 215 pound heavyweight and before I put weights on this stand to hold it down I was bouncing it all over my basement with an 80 pound bag attached Just add the weights and this is a great stand A REAL plus to this stand is that the legs are nice and wide and don t protrude too far out This allows for some great movement with the bag and gives a good chance to work on footwork and body movement in your bag workouts You won t go wrong with this one especially with free shipping 
5 0 RollerMom I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these skates at such a reasonable price I was an avid roller skater in my youth and it has been almost 20 years since I last donned skates It must be like riding a bike because within minutes I was whipping up and down my driveway My neighbors will probably forward the footage to You Tube Anyway the skates are smooth and quite sturdy They worked equally well on the pavement as well as inside on my hardwood floors Skating is so much fun and great exercise too fun to FEEL like exercise however My 10 year old son was amazed by my turns and backwards skating as was I Love Love Love these skates Makes me wonder why I waited so long to get a pair Happy skating 
5 0 Great product for the price I purchased these skates because my daughters wanted me to skate with them Since I wasn t sure how many times I was going to use them I wanted an inexpensive pair To my surprise these skates are of excellent quality even though the cost was under 40 00 I have used them a few times already and they are very comfortable and have good support Great Value 
5 0 Brings back the Youth in you I brought this for my wife as a stress reliever It is difficult now to find a normal roller skates and not those roller blade contraption This skates have somehow reverse the process of aging and rejuvinated her The last time she wore skates was almost 20 years ago The skates is strong and runs smoothly My wife wished she could have done this review personally but she is too busy skating outside 
5 0 Practical Durable and AWSOME I have a female softball team We train at a field that doesn t have bases And these throw down bases are just phenomenal You can just throw them down and they don t move Nice quality and when we are finish we just packed them back and go So I really recomend them 
5 0 Customer Service at Amazon sucks The product and the people at Midwest Sports were great However I brought this through Amazon and I had an issue with the shipping cost Their customer service sucks Ths customer service screen type is so small it can not be read plus they do not offer a direct phone line when I did get hold of them they refered me back to Midwest to slove the problem I felt like a ping pall ball being bounced from one company to another I could not get this problem resloved I would not recommend Amazon at all and will buy things directly from now on 
5 0 Great product Works absolutly GREAT Don t be confused about spray splash and let dry beacouse it s realy best way to keep your goggles clear Usualy I was not able to see anything after 12 15 laps Now after 35 laps I CAN SEE 100 CLEARLY 
5 0 Awesome This is by far the best anti fog spray I ve tried I use it for my paintball mask It used to fog up then I got shot This prevents any fogging in the mask and lasts for a long time A+++++++ 
4 0 A tip for using the anit fog spray 1 Apply the solution on the goggle inside and stay for 30 seconds 2 Quickly rinse it with water 3 Fully dry 4 Put on the goggle and swim However don t put off and dip your goggle in the pool until you finish swimming This really works 
5 0 See Where You Are Swimming Goggles are a great item to use while swimming in lakes and chlorinated pools They protect the eyes from polutants and chemicals in the water But as anyone knows who has worn goggles they tend to fog up rendering one s vision about as good as seeing through a dense fog I ve tried spit oil soap etc and nothing works as good as this product Simply spray in on the inside of the goggles and you will have nearly fog free seeing Use it each time you swim for maximum effectiveness JIm Konedog Koenig Lap Swimme 
5 0 Hold Your Own Feet Don t rely on someone to hold your feet anymore when you do sit ups This bar is much more effective and you ll get a much better workout 
4 0 Makes sit ups Easier I bought this because I don t like doing situps that much My feet tend to move around and then pretty soon I am flopping around the floor not really doing any good This solves all that You just slip it on the bottom of a door and do your sit ups with it Then you can fold it up after use and it s almost completely out of the way It holds your feet really well and allows you to do sit ups a lot easier well the sit ups are still hard It lost a star because when you are using it if you are putting a lot of pressure on the bar which you shouldn t but can if you get tired etc the door can be pulled out If you had a solid door this wouldn t be much of an issue Also when you fold it up the bolts touch the door and it s possibly after having it for awhile you could put little dents scratches in the door Overall it makes situps a pleasure to do again 
5 0 Part of my daily routine and my abs show it I m gettng a six pack I never thought that I could say that But having this wonderful sit up bar so conveniently located in my bedroom has made the difference It was so easy to install and is so easy to use that it practically became a part of my daily routine without my even realizing it I especially like the way the bar flips up and out of the way when I m done This is one of the best investments in myself that I have ever made and I recommend it highly 
5 0 I Love Bag Balm I first heard about Bag Balm from one of the girls on the MTV reality show Laguna Beach She said she uses it for her chapped lips I don t know how often one would get chapped lips in California but I live in Chicago and I definitely know what it feels like to have dry cracked lips to the point of bleeding Ever since I started using this daily I have not had to endure that kind of torture THANK GOODNESS This product is a miracle and I cannot believe more people have not discovered it Tried and true since 1899 I have a couple purse size tins to keep on me and other various places I m planning to get the 10oz tin to refill 
5 0 Great Beauty Item I have used this stuff ever since I found a mini tin of it in my mom s closet I don t use it on my pets though I use it as lip gloss It keeps my lips smooth and hydrated and isnt sticky I layer it over lipstick for a great shine Try it as a chapstick as well for dry chapped lips It works wonder 
5 0 Iglo Max Cold Cooler 50 Qt This cooler is excellent I ve got 4 of them now that I use when I go deer hunting They are just under the 62 maximum dimension for luggage almost every other cooler is just over an I can put frozen meat inside to within a couple inches of the lip and be just under the 50 limit for excess weight charges I put a few layers of bubble pack on the to take up the extra space I have had meat in these 48 hours and as long as they remain closed just opening for the TSA inspection the meat has stayed rock hard I ve traveled with them in the winter and summer with the same results 2 of the chests have traveled wth me for 4 years round trip to Indiana from Southern CA each round trip is 6 airline segments so that s 24 flights and all are still solid with no missing handles cracks or damage These are absolutely the best coolers for the traveling hunter I carried almost 4 deer home from Indiana this year and everything stayed perfect Last summer I carried home an antelope from Wyoming in late August across the dessert with just bagged ice with daytime temperatures near 110 and everything did fine And of course if I can trust my wild game meat in these coolers which is very hard to come by and to replace you can count on them for your regular cold or frozen neeeds 
5 0 Igloo Max Cold 50 qt cooler Best cooler I have ever seen Arrived promptly in excellent condition 
5 0 Great Bench for the money I looked several places to find the best bench for the money It is very sturdy and will adjust to 5 different positions Very happy with purchas 
4 0 Great for the money I just received it today and immediately assembled it It was quite simple to assemble and it seems to be very sturdy However the adjustment holes did not line up with the spring loaded adjustment pin I had to make some minor modifications Other than that no problems yet 
5 0 Marcy Weight Bench This is a great bench for the price It was fairly straightforward to put together took about an hour It is well padded and very well made I think most people would enjoy this bench men and women alike 
5 0 Marcy Work Out Bench This particular bench provides a lot of stability with its wide frame It s cushions are soft but durable This bench is useful in many ways including for the incline decline and flat bench press positions It s very easy to move from location to location based upon its wheels at one end and a handle at the other end to provide the best possible hand positioning during transport 
5 0 Marcy weight bench Very substantial bench I bought this for my son but everyone in the family can use it 
5 0 Perfect Pet Tag I ve always been a bit iffy dealing with sellers on Amazon as opposed to Amazon directly this this company did a great job It took a little while to get the tag but the quality was fabulous I got a medium purple star for my Morkie puppy and it s a perfect size perfect colour and perfect weight I was worried about getting a medium for my puppy since she s so tiny but it turned out to be just fine My only complaint is that the silver hoop that you attach in order to hook it onto the D ring of the collar is pretty tricky to get on I had to use pliers to get a good grip But best of all they didn t mess up the engraving I ll be buying from them again 
5 0 Girl s skates My 6 y o loves these roller skates Skates around the house almost all the time Boot is supportive but not stiff Feels like real leather True to size She wears a 13 in all her shoes Tried Roller Derby will stick with Chicago Girl 
5 0 great skate gave these to my little cousin and she loved them put them on had the wheels adjusted and she was off 
5 0 These Skates are Great I purchased these to teach my daughter to roller skate I loved the comfort and they are cute too 0 
5 0 Great for beginner Skaters We ordered these skates for my 5 year old daughter who has discovered roller skating These skates are great for kids who are just starting as well as kids who have mastered balance but are still learning the basics We will let her use them in a rink setting but I believe that they would be ok for regular outdoor use also The wheels do not turn freely so she can skate and not be all over the place I don t know if they can be adjusted to allow easier turning in the future The make of the skate is very well done seems to be a very sturdy product We ordered about 1 1 2 sizes too big to give her growing room and with a pair of thicker socks she has no problems Very reasonably priced especially since her feet are growing and won t be in this size for a great length of time 
5 0 Trying Not to Get Run Over I like to take exercise walks but on many occasions the only time I have to do that is after dark Some of our streets do not have sidewalks or good lighting so it concerns me that I could be hit by a car whose driver didn t see me As a driver I also know it can be very difficult to see pedestrians at night especially if they wear darker clothes I ve used reflecting safety belts but I wanted something that more surely grabbed driver attention so I attached a Bell Night Shield Light to a reflective belt using a short length of the universal guy tool duct tape The Bell Light gives intense red light flashes from about 7 LEDs 1 in each ear and 5 in the mid section A single control button combines both the on off function and the choice of six or seven flashing patterns some faster or slower some repeating and other rotating The result is much improved driver awareness of my presence I notice cars staying wide of my position My wife says they veer away because they think I m nuts but that works for me too = In addition to the belt clip built into the light s plastic body the product also comes with hardware to mount it to a bicycle tube This mounting has a quick disconnect so you can take the Bell Light with you if theft is a possibility I highly recommend this low cost Bell Light for night walking or riding safety After several months of usage that span dozens of hours use it s working flawlessly and I have not needed to change the 2 AAA alkaline batteries The one design change that would make this Light better for my purposes would be if it had two control buttons one solely for on off and the other to select the flash pattern Then I wouldn t have to cycle through all the flash patterns every time I wanted to turn it on and off But this is a minor annoyance 
5 0 Light Bright These little babys light up the night to ward off those pesky SUV s Good stuff The red shield does need to be taped on as hard landings can jolt it loose I use on front handlebar and back Will buy again 
5 0 Great Versatile light I bought this light because I was tired of the short life of AAA batteries Batteries LAST in this light The beam pattern is always good The only thing I would caution anyone about is being sure you like a battery pack on the back of your head It does not lend itself to reading while reclining and may not feel too comfortable for a person who is used to front battery headlamps 
5 0 Love it I m a runner and my schedule forces me to run mostly at night on work days A large part of my nightly run is on unlighted streets I needed a light to see and help be seen I tried carrying a small flashlight but found it to be a pain in the wrist I run hot and never wear a hat in the winter even though I live in Montana so I was hesitant to try it due to the increased sweat factor and the potential for fogging up my glasses I got one as a Christmas gift If I hated it I wouldn t be out the bucks It s wonderful It is so light that I don t notice it is there The stap is quite adjustable so a person can make it as tight or loose as one wants It can be easily adjusted for the bare head over a hat or even over a bike helmet Unlike many other brands this light is also adjustable up and down The 3 different light level settings each for the HyperBright and the SuperBright LED s make it quite adaptable for different needs I ve found that the HyperBright medium setting works best for me even in remote unlighted areas The colored light battery life indicator ensures that I don t run out of power in the middle of a run or change batteries prematurely The ability to see and avoid road hazards greatly improves the enjoyment of my night runs When I first started using it I planned on switching the light off on lighted streets to extend battery life I soon discovered the number of cars inadvertently or not swerving at me decreasing tremendously as well as the number of courteous drivers moving over for a safer distance increasing when I kept the light on in lighted areas I highly recommend the Zenix IQ Cons The on off button is impossible for me to use when wearing gloves Just like any other battery powered device I ve ever owned the batteries don t last nearly as long as the owner s manual suggests Low temperatures really zap battery life but that is to be expected Luckily AA batteries are inexpensive 
5 0 Gymnic Stability Balls I recieved my stability ball quickly The only thing I suggest having on hand is a pump this does come with the adaptor for the pump but no pump I did not expect it to come with a pump though so there was no disappointment there 
5 0 Speedo Silicone swim cap Excellent quality much easier to put on than the cap I used before 
5 0 Exquisite cap Just the perfect cap It fits like no other swimming cap It won t pull you hair when removing it neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning Very resistant material and a great finish Awesome colors 
5 0 COMFORTABLE AND DURABLE I have used this cap almost daily for over a year It still fits snugly and is very comfortable Writing this review has made me think to order another one now for the inevitable day my old one wears out I have a rather large head and found many caps didn t fit comfortably This one is very elastic and is great 
5 0 works for me This swim cap is easy to use and thick enough that I can t imagine it ever ripping or tearing 
5 0 Good for not pulling your hair I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother in law but after he opened it we all tried it on I have very fragile long hair and normally swim caps rip the hair out when I m trying to put the swim cap on or take it off This one came on and off so easily without any hair pulling 
5 0 This is a great cap I m on my 5th cap now I think Silicone is great and lasts forever Unlike rubber which can snag hair and latex which some people are allergic to silicone fits smoothly over wet hair has a glossy finish so it looks great and doesn t lose elasticity I have a some advice if you want to try this product that I ve learned overt the years 1 Always rinse and hang dry I ve left wet caps in my gym bag and after a month of two of neglect it develops black spots I don t know if it s mold it doesn t wash off and you ll have to buy a new cap if you don t like the spotted look 2 Pull it on gently I ve ripped one when I was trying to stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it It s not cloth so you have to be careful This goes for latex and rubber too 3 Wet your hair first If your hair is dry when you put it on you will trap air under the cap And since it s not a permeable material the cap will start to come off while you swim because of the air trying to escape inside 4 Pick a fun color That s it Have a great swim 
5 0 Speedo Silicone Swim Cap I bought this swim cap for my wife for Christmas and she loves it 
5 0 Great choice I m an experienced meditator and I have found the Drishti Meditation Bench to suit my needs wonderfully It is sturdy and it is just the perfect height for meditation I also appreciate the angled nature of the seat which keeps my posture in alignment I would definitely recommend it 
4 0 Good Good fiting the only reason I do not rate it with 5 stars is because I just got it and do not know how would be the wear with the time 
5 0 Nine Neoprene Golf Iron Covers Good quality and versatile I was using them on my clubs and then gave them to my husband for his clubs when I found a camo set for my clubs They fit my clubs and his nicer Nike clubs as well 
4 0 Basically I like it This bed is very confortable but holes developed within 3 months Order a second one hoping the first was just defected 
5 0 Instant Bed This bed was everything it said it was I have really enjoyed this bed and would tell all my friends how easy it is to set up and use 
5 0 Good sleeping I sleep on this bed every night It almost feels like my regular bed which is also an air mattress bed Easy to move around I put my foam mattress topper on top and I sleep like a baby Can t say I notice a large amount of air lose but all you have to do is turn the switch and add air simple 
5 0 Great alternative to Dumb bells I got this just to add to my strength training workout I was a little skeptical at first but my trainer added it to my program so I had to buy one I really enjoy using this for exercises where I was holding two dumbbells It made things a lot easier and it has also been easier to incorporate into my squats and lunges I would definately recommend this 
4 0 Good quality They are good gifts to my friends who love outdoor activities It s easy to handle and easy to use I love it very much 
5 0 Very happy w Yankees Cap Stationed at Ramstein AB Germany we needed to get a Yankees ballcap quickly for our son who got on the Yankees little league team towards the end of the season We got the cap in under a week and were very pleased with the price and product Thanks 
5 0 the Best baseball Team ain t nothing like rocking a Yankee Cap I have had so many over the years Rooting for another trip to the World Series Hopefully they can Win it all this year 
5 0 Basics and more I bought my juggling clubs 20+ years ago and now my daughter is learning the art Naturally she needs clubs too These are excellent clubs for beginners but they are good for the experienced juggler as well The clubs are well balanced solid as is a necessity for any juggling equipment resilient and brightly colored for performance The grips are firm and clean which is great for any juggler At some point my daughter might want some foam tape for the grips to give them a softer feel and to give her less bruises on her palms but that would be a luxury 
5 0 great product This is a great product Easy to set up and will take a lot of abuse My daughter uses it for pitching and batting practice and I use it to practice my golf swing It is very large so it can contain even the wildest pitches For the price I highly recomend it 
5 0 Works great for the price Despite the other reviews I found this net to be perfect for practicing in the back yard If you don t shank them you don t have to worry about the balls going through the net My six year old doesn t even hit them through it The net is not designed to keep balls in that s why they go through you are supposed to hit the balls into the HUGE black target area and they drop right to the ground If you re a 1 2 way decent golfer and can keep a ball on target for the 6 feet you are away from the net it s great And finally if you can set up a tent you can step up the net with ease 
5 0 Super compact with a multitude of uses get one today The Gerber folding shovel is really top notch Its quality construction is much like any other Gerber Fiskars equipment I ve owned it doesn t disappoint The shovel I have is actually a little more agressively pointed than in the pictures so I m not sure if Gerber has addressed this as an issue or if the pictures were off The top of the handle is high density polycarbonate plastic and has a horizontal design like a spade should have You can still use the verticle part of the steel handle if you wish but there isn t much of it The plastic will absorb some shock compared to steel only and it won t freeze to your hands etc The polycarb handle folds down on itself so that it actually has 3 segments instead of several designs which have 2 segments This means you can stow the shovel in the included cordura nylon belt pouch which is no bigger than the shovel head itself The handle pivot point locks and since it s square doesn t rotate or twist easily The steel which connects the blade to the handle fits nicely inside the A angle cutout of the handle so when collapsed it is really thin The blade is high quality steel with the hinged handle connected at the top This does limit the depth of the shovel a little but I don t believe it s much of a factor except maybe in really solid soil where you lose a little verticle travel when the ground butts up against the hinge It s very compact light comes with a solid belt sheath easily convertible to pack carry and stows away easily since it s so thin I can put it in the side pockets of my doors or in the very small space above my rear wheel well without any problems Trailblazer 4x4 I really can find no fault with this item it delivers on all fronts usability quality compact storage and rugged design I will almost certainly be keeping one in both cars and in my 72 Hour survival kit They are even reasonably priced 5 Stars 
5 0 Great deal Perfect for scout troop The mylar blankets were perfect for our scout troop They arrived well packed and two days early Great company to deal with 
4 0 mham this knife is very sharp thick and sturdy and is usefull in many ways ive seen lower quality knives sold for much more it should work for most practical and defencive situation 
5 0 Incredible quality for the price I couldn t believe the quality of this knife after reading one of the reviews I bought this as a gift for my husband thinking it would be an ok knife What a surprise I would reccomend this knife to anyone who likes hunting or any outdoor activity The handle is solid and sturdy and holds everything you would need to survive if you really needed food and fire for a few days I love it 
4 0 VERY good knife This knife is very strrong I didn t have the chance yet to try it out but it looks good The compass on it is pretty cheap compared to my cousins other one the handle is metal so the button on the sheath scratches the black paint a little bit luckily this doesn t affect the use of the handle Compared to other knives i saw like this one the sharpeningstone on it is cheap Even so this knife looks like it was worth 85 00 I gave the fire fighter to my bro it takes some getting used to to unlock the blade the handle was plastic Pretty good for a free knife good for widdling 
4 0 Solid pair of gloves I purchased the small medium pair and they fit really well but because of a manufacturing error there is a thick seam inside of the gloves that didn t get cut It chafes against my finger a lot They re a great pair of gloves Really smooth fit hard material on the knuckle and the strap keeps the gloves snug The under belly of the gloves are open this feels a little airy than what I m used to Nice though 
4 0 A solid pair of pads They re a bit bulky and tight around your knuckles but otherwise these gloves are great They have plenty of padding and can be tightened so they don t slip off 
5 0 One product that lives up to the claims It s hard to explain but this stuff does what it claims I am extremely focused when I take this and motivated and get great pumps This is one of those rare products that lives up to the claims 
5 0 First Day was freaking awesome I just started this stuff this morning and only took 1 scoop which is half of the reccomended does and OMG THis stuff makes you feel so Alert and Focused my workout that normally has sets like 12 10 8 ended up being reps of 15 15 15 I had intense focus to keep pushing harder Definitely worth the money 
5 0 Surprised and pleased Week 4 of use I never write reviews but this time it is worth it I am a 27 yr old male firefighter with several years of casual bodybuilding experience In september of 2006 I decided to intensify my regular weight training routine I combined cardio and weight training with protein supplementation At the end of October I decided to go full weight training with no cardio and add new supplementation to my diet I chose NO Xplode and TwinLabs AminoFuel 2000 tablets and liquid depending on my time needs Let me just say that I am a very skeptical person and I went into this being wary of a placebo effect I am stunned by the results I am already motivated to go to the gym but when I start pumping it is like I am on crack or something I used to feel drained halfway through my routine and sometimes I would feel that mental block halfway through a set on a heavy lift Not with this stuff I seriously feel like I can go all day I lift more and go through full sets that I would otherwise self defeat on I start lifting and I just fight to do more in the middle of a lift It s freaking bizarre I just get this boost and I get super aggressive in the lift In september I was putting up 185 bench Now I can set at 245 10 10 6 I don t look that much bigger to me but I guess that s cause I look in the mirror every day I do get comments like that big guy like you or you re pretty big so blah blah and my Captain calls me Mr Strongman which I think is retarded but flattering anyway I have to admit I have never lifted this much before and its pretty motivating Anyway I bought one bottle here and another from a friend who didn t have the discipline to keep up on the water demands a gallon a day After writing this I am going to buy four more 1 81lb bottles of this stuff I dosed as follows 215 lb 27 yr old male 2 scoops every morning on an empty stomach with a serving of amino fuel tablets or liquid On training days I take an additional 2 scoops one hour before workout along with amino fuel I do the amino fuel twice a day on non training days and three times a day on workout days add a serving one hour after workout I take in 300 grams of protein per day mostly from whey but I eat all other meals as normal Nitrotech after a work out and ON whey gold standard for other meals Oh by the way I am doing a straight mass building program for six months and then a cut muscularity program for the six months after My point is that I am going strictly for size right now so I am not discouraged by my remaining fat 13 BF My strength gains have been proof enough for me Next up is HMB supplementation Hopefully that will work as good as the research is screaming Good Luck And remember The mind is the limit Arnold Great spirits have always met violent opposition from medicore minds Albert Einstei 
5 0 Fantastic I ve been using NO Xplode for 5 weeks now and it has increased my performance in the gym noticably The mental focus you get from this is amazing all I can think is one word Gym My sister now takes it at the Gym for Cardio though that s not my cup of tea it s her choice I would think it fine to use for cardio The Nitric Oxide NO a crucial supplement to all bodybuilders weight lifters widens your blood vessels and accelerates blood to muscles This is extremely good for working out I would also suggest taking protein for your pre and post workout maybe even a little when you workout I first had the Blue Raspberry flavor and after about half the bottle was done it was very hard to drink because the taste just seemed gross Most people do not like the Blue Raspberry I ve read a lot of reviews before purchasing I am now taking the Fruit Punch which in my opinion is 10x better and tastes good If you have a very sensitive CNS Central Nervous System I would not take this product unless you only took 1 2 1 scoop I am very sensitive to anabolics so I limit myself just be careful with this as it can get you too hyped if you take too much If you are comfortable with a cup of coffee or two espresso shots then I wouldn t even be concerned about having a sensitive CNS The downside many people say is that this product makes you go to the restroom very badly Well it does usually make me take a trip to the restroom but it s not as extreme as people say I actually like it having a clean system before I hit the gym It s not like Ex Lax if you have to use the restroom it will probably be within 30 minutes I would recommend this product to anyone who is SERIOUS about weight lifting I would not suggest giving this to anyone under 18 but that s only my opinion it s up to you The Rival to NO Xplode is SizeOn I ve never tried SizeOn because I ve never been dissapointed with NO Xplode No wonder it was rated the 1 product of the year 
5 0 Very good stuff I picked this up after I have used all kinds of supplements Animal Pak Amino Acids Nitrix all kinds of protein and other stuff It helps to pump muscles very well and you can see yourself changing already after a first week of working out However you have to work hard to get most of it and also drink a lot water It says to consume around 120 oz for best results but if you can drink even more Do not stop drinking creatine on non training days drink a scoop and a half mixed with water Also do not forget that drinking creatine will not get you very far if you do not drink protein together with it Buy Ultra whey protein and brink 2 to 3 shakes a day mixed with milk I usually drink one shake in the morning one after practice and one before going to bed That said I think I gave you all best diretions how to use and good luck Work HARD if you wanna see results 
4 0 Good Stuff Me being a small guy just shy of 130 and wanting to bulk up a bit decided to head to the gym and try out some supplements NO was one of the first ones I picked up I consumed the max dosage of 3 scoops and within 20 minutes I had enough energry to do anything I did several more intensive exercises with little to no fatigue Its almost as if your body isnt under much strain at all I felt pumped up from begining to end and am quite pleased with the results However there were a couple of problems I didnt notice a dramatic mucsle gain and im not bulging with muscle for those of you wondering my diet is correct for muscle growth yet I did gain a meager amount And of course the taste is bad At first it seems bearable but once you get to the bottom of the glass you get the powdery residue of chemical gunk Almost made me want to puke Other then that though it was a great product I dont reccomend grape either 
4 0 worked pretty much as advertised ive been taking no xplode for about a week and a half no on an empty stomach an hour before workouts three scoop dose this product works as advertised and my workouts have been much more focused and intense i have also experienced signifactnly bigger pumps although they last only about an hour into my workout not the 5+ hours advertised but this is the only problem i have experienced no side effects the only flavour i have tried is lemondae and i think it tastes decent 
5 0 Very Good product VEry good product Has a lot of space easy to mount and keep the bags inside dry We drove 16 hrs in one day most ot the time it was rainning and nothing inside got wet I recommend it 
4 0 Nice bike for a good price My daughter loves the bike The only problem we had was with the shipping the wheel was bent I assume it was due to shipping We had to take it to a bike shop to get it straightened 
5 0 Awesome knife I had my knife for 10 years and would still have it if not for the 2nd instinct of putting it in my back pocket whenever I leave the house One night I was heading for a flight at the airport going thru security when I realized I had it on me I had no choice but to throw it out So had to get another one 
5 0 Excellent watch I ve had this watch for about a month and I love it So far the barometer has been right about the weather a few hours ahead I have not had the opportunity to take it to the mountains which is the main purpose for my purchase but the big screen is easily visible and the features are readily accessible If you are looking for a great outdoor watch give Highgear a chance 
1 0 HighGear Summit I hate being lied to On the Amazon website under product description it said that the watch could stand an altitude of 29 500 feet 9 000 meters and that was one of the key facts that made me buy it buy when I got the watch and reviewed the manual it said that it only endures 6 000 meters If it really was good up to 9 000 m you can go up to mount Everest and the watch would still work but in a couple of months I ll be at Chopicalqui summit 6 300m ant the Highgear Summit will not be able to accompany me because this summit will be too high 
5 0 Prompt service Strong compact easy to operate The stand did come with the scale broken I thought about returning it to Amazon but called the manufacturer instead They overnighted a new scale with no questions asked Have had three stands over the years This is the best so far 
5 0 Awesome Forget lugging a cooler out to the deck when you don t have the time energy or ice This product will get you through a dinner out on the deck with friends In Style I also have the two bottle wine carrier which is great for even indoor meals with white wine Check it out alot of bang for the buck 
4 0 OK Well it has been five days hasn t arrived but I will keep you updated so far well it s a cool product but the shipping isn t great thats my only complaint 
5 0 Excellent for work or school I carry my tea or other drink to school in this regularly It s also great for making drinks at home because you can forget about your tea or coffee for a half an hour even uncapped and it ll stay quite hot The size is a little large because of the dual layer insulation but that makes it work better so it s an acceptable tradeoff 
4 0 Another American Icon Another American icon now made in China I m sure it ll still work as well as the older made in America bottles Slightly disappointed this one doesn t have the pour through stopper the 2 quart bottle has These do everything they say keeps coffee hot all day and completely unbreakable I ll get over the China thing it s just one more thing 
5 0 I love this thermos I have this bottle in pink and can t say enough about it It is the best bottle I have ever had It won t break even though I drop it ALL the time And it keeps coffee piping hot forever Last week I took ice coffee in it to work and at 4PM there was still ice in my thermos Nobody who sits near my desk could believe it It is the perfect size too cause it fits in my bag and doesn t leak all over my stuff when I m on the bus I love it love it love it 
5 0 Thanks it was a good buy it also got here in time i would continue buying from this websit 
5 0 Easy to Store I wish they had a picture showing how this folds flat This makes it so easy to store We use it in our RV as it takes absolutely minimal space I find that my ankles don t swell if I put my feet up on a small stool like this on long trips The plastic is very strong making the step quite sturdy 
4 0 Xodus Folding Weight Bench Review I am very satisfied with this product It is sturdy and meets my needs in weight lifting It is very compact when stored All the parts were received in the package and the instructions for assembly were easy to follow The product was received ahead of the stated schedule for delivery 
5 0 Super Sturdy This trike is VERY sturdy even more so than some of the other Kettrikes our family has purchased which is saying something The tough part is already assembled for you when it arrives yippee but I should say that the remaining directions are kind of sketchy Not difficult but take some time to really study the pictures it s a German company so there are not detailed written English directions sometimes they toss a part on there and it s not easy to see what they just did or exactly how they did it Anyway so far it s beautiful and looks like a long lasting well made product I am very pleased 
5 0 Excellent quality good price I was a bit apprehensive purchasing this hat since the price was so low However it arrived in a very short time after order and the quality is excellent Looks just like a hat that would sell for 20 in the stadium store 
4 0 Inexpensive baseball caps The cap arrived in good order I have to admit it s of a better quality than I expected for the cost The 4 star rating represents the good value for the price A 5 star rating would go to a top quality wool cap at a much greater expense 
5 0 Very pleased Great Price and Great Product Jansport has always had quality products Can t go wrong Lots of space and compartments 
5 0 Great school backpack I got this for my 8 year old son It is just the perfect size to carry all of his work and whatever other things he needs The pockets help him organize things so he knows where they are He has had problems with the straps of other backpacks breaking but this one is very sturdy and has not had any problems 
5 0 Great Choice for the Money This is a good backpack It is very sturdy I got it for my high school son because he ripped through his first backpack for the year in less than a week We paid about the same for that backpack as we did for this JanSport backpack He has had it now for a couple of months and his holding together just fine When he first got the backpack he said the shoulder pads were very hard but now he says they don t bother him anymore Maybe he has broken them in or just gotten use to them If you are looking for a good and roomy no frills backpack for school this one has worked out great for my son I had a JanSport years ago when I was in college and I remember it being a good choice back then too This Big Student Backpack is a great choice for the money 
5 0 Jansport Big Student Backpack is terrific The Jansport Big Student Backpack we purchased has been utilized daily for 2 mths and is terrific It holds all of the books musical supplies and accessories any adult or teen would need on a daily basis 
5 0 Great backpack I am very happy with my purchase of this backpack The color is great and it has plenty of compartments but not so many that you don t know what to put in them I especially like the mesh holder on the side I put my water bottle in there so I don t have to carry it around I m a graduate student so I have a lot of materials I have to lug around and this backpack is perfect for it The straps are very sturdy and don t cut into my shoulders It is very comfortable to wear 
4 0 Big improvement over my last bike rack This bike rack is much easier to use than the last one I had I have 3 kids so loading and unloading was more of a workout than the actual bike rides This has made it much easier and is also more secure with the built in lock The only drawback is the need to buy bar adapters for children s and women s bikes but it is worth it 
2 0 needs work on design This product needs some work The buttons are too close together and no i don t have fat fingers it s very easy to push the wrong one Which might just take you into a complex menu that s not easy to get out of The pixels on the display are ridiculously large i had to purposefully blur my eyes to decipher the numbers It kind of seems like someone s invention prototype that they fashioned in their garage The stitching was partially unraveled is this what stitching may vary means It wasn t the colored stitching on the velcro strap used to hold the thumb sensor And yet I was still optimistic I glued the velcro strap got used to the buttons and the display and i actually loved it for the first dozen uses or so And then it stopped working Every time the main part that wraps around your hand was moved even in the minutest way the unit would somehow reset itself the display boldly announcing the product name and then informing me that all of its stored information had been reset I was so sad So much so that i bought another one thinking i d just ended up with a dud But the 2nd one also stopped working after only a few uses It just suddenly displayed 3 vertical lines and wouldn t turn off The only thing that ever worked well on this thing was the actual heart rate sensor which i found to be quite accurate Luckily Amazon is giving me a full refund for both one of which was a bit past their 30 day limit Thank you Amazon I m going to try the Mark of Fitness one It looks like an actual company made it instead of some incompetent electrical engineer wannabe 
4 0 ninja sword for the price i was pretty impressed with this item since the ninja almost always used a straight blade yes i m a real ninja seriously that is why i bought it even though it is not full tang the handle is not wooden it s very hard plastic so it can t be broken very easy 
5 0 It s a Plate Frame But it says the Steelers on it It s Plastic not metal Sorry for the cheesy review I gave it as a gift Hey he liked it 
4 0 sturdy and roomy hammock this is a strong and roomy hammock that is great for the yard or car camping it is well designed and can take the weight of a large person 250 lbs but note that the fabric will stretch accordingly it takes some practice to get off and avoid hitting the ground a good buy for the price 
5 0 Perfect for lazy summer afternoons I love my hammock It s very comfy and quite easy to put up and take down The first time I assembled it it was very difficult to get the hammock on the frame but since then the canvas has stretched a little or something and I haven t had any trouble I don t think I d want to take it on an all day hike but it s not too heavy to move around The book and drink holders are convenient and even the inflatable pillow which I expected to be dumb is shaped just right for comfortably supporting my neck and head 
4 0 Does the Job Okay I am a female and have been walking for more than 10 years now and needed to step it up without a gym or in home machine After my first try of this vest I realize it makes you hotter because of the material its made of which is vinyl like So be prepared to heat up much faster when wearing this vest My shoulders are what notice the weight the most I figured that They get sore within the first minute of wearing the vest But then again I also do not use a backpack to school for that same reason I have weak shoulders that get very sore very quickly But those are the ONLY negatives to this vest otherwise I wouldn t even notice I was wearing it at all I just hope it helps me to lose my extra weight 
5 0 20 lb vest Comfortable and really easy to use Weights are easily removed and put back in when ready Really good product for the money 
5 0 Camping with a great Grill and Rotisserie I am so very happy with this grill the adjustment for hieght is good and the Rotisserie works very well Only thing I think would be a little more helpful is heavier stands at the bottom But I won t give up this grill Love it 
4 0 A great old Western feel This is a great grill if you want to feel the old Western backwoods feeling of little house in the prairie days It keeps the meet high off the fire while keeping a tender and moist Multi use makes this a fun camping accessory While it is a little cumbersome to bring along you and your guests will enjoy the taste of your food as well as the feel of olden days camping 
4 0 Good gloves The problem with paddling gloves are seams these gloves have all the seamd in the right places where they don t bother yo 
5 0 kayaking gloves I am happy with the kayak gloves I have been using them everytime I go kayaking 
5 0 great buy These skewers are a very cost effective way to reduce weight and increase security By trading away quick release ability you cut the weight of the cam and lever By losing a little convenience you ll save 50 80 grams for only about 15 bucks One of the most favorable weight cost purchaces made You also gain a little security I might dispute the ads claim that it will PREVENT theft but I think it WILL help lower your odds of trouble Thieves who eye your wheelsets will look for easier targets than your bike I have always U locked my frame and cable locked my wheels to the frame and stationary object and I still had two fronts and one rear stolen before I bought these In the year since I haven t had any issues yet I still use the same precautions Possible objections to the use of these would be that you cannot change a wheel on the fly or that it will slow you down putting the bike onto a cartop bike carrier For me it is well worth the trade You can always carry your old QR skewers when weight is not a factor And the fact that you are slowed down means that any possible thief is also slowed down Just like a Club antitheft steering wheel lock on a car hopefully the thieve will just go for the easier target someone else s property 
5 0 Great Space Saving Workout Gym My wife and I both enjoy using the Home Door Gym I recommend this product to anyone who doesn t have time to commute to a remote workout facility or someone who doesn t have space for workout equipment 
5 0 Good diving computer This is my first diving computer I was pleased with its functions and ease of use It logs all your dives and you can transfer them to your computer It really simplified logging all my dives The computer will track your every aspect of your dive and you can set warning for depth and time It tracks your dive time surface time no flight time ascending speed recommended safety stop and mandatory stops Overall I am very happy with it and every diver should have one 
5 0 Great Product Great Customer Delivery Great Sale Experience Wonderfull watch Great sales experience I bought that for my wife and I called the vendor asked to expedite the shipping It was delivered ahead of schedule on time for her anniversary Excellent price and smooth purchase I definitely recommend and would return to purchase more The product itself has all the required features and functions that a professional diver would expect 
4 0 yoga chica i have to say that i LOVE this mat the combo jute and rubber make it nearly impossible to slip only thing is the jute and rubber are rubbing up against one another and kind of crumbling and flaking off where i often place my feet causing bald spots on my mat haha weird huh so now you know other than that the mat is visually very pleasing 
4 0 Gets the job done and it works I ordered these gloves in tandem with a Heavy Bag for my father on Father s Day He s had difficulty staying in shape and working out with different fitness programs I ve designed for him The Heavy Bag is right up his alley and with the gloves he can work out longer and more intensely and get a real cardiovascular experience while he relieves some stress I m not sure whether this is an endorsement for the gloves or the bag but he really seems to enjoy the fit fabric and force with which he can punch 
4 0 meets my needs I was looking for an elliptical to help me lose some of my extra baby weight yet could still fit in my budget and in my house This one is somewhat smaller than the other models I have seen It is very quiet and I can use it while the children are watching tv without distracting them or hear them play without noise from the machine There are a few programs to select from but there is no option to enter your age and weight in order to get a truly personalized workout This would not be for the diehard workout fanatic But for the SAHM who needs a good daily cardio workout while the kids are around it is perfect 
5 0 It is the best but not the only I bought this snorkel and used it and I must say that it is incredibly good No water gets into this thing However my friend bought the Aeris Barricuda The Cuda Dry and we put them next to each other and they are EXACTLY the same product with only the painted on brand name being the difference I mention this because the Cuda Dry is 10 cheaper Consider yourself in the know 
5 0 Exquisite cap Just the perfect cap It fits like no other swimming cap It won t pull you hair when removing it neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning Very resistant material and a great finish Awesome colors 
5 0 COMFORTABLE AND DURABLE I have used this cap almost daily for over a year It still fits snugly and is very comfortable Writing this review has made me think to order another one now for the inevitable day my old one wears out I have a rather large head and found many caps didn t fit comfortably This one is very elastic and is great 
5 0 Good for not pulling your hair I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother in law but after he opened it we all tried it on I have very fragile long hair and normally swim caps rip the hair out when I m trying to put the swim cap on or take it off This one came on and off so easily without any hair pulling 
5 0 This is a great cap I m on my 5th cap now I think Silicone is great and lasts forever Unlike rubber which can snag hair and latex which some people are allergic to silicone fits smoothly over wet hair has a glossy finish so it looks great and doesn t lose elasticity I have a some advice if you want to try this product that I ve learned overt the years 1 Always rinse and hang dry I ve left wet caps in my gym bag and after a month of two of neglect it develops black spots I don t know if it s mold it doesn t wash off and you ll have to buy a new cap if you don t like the spotted look 2 Pull it on gently I ve ripped one when I was trying to stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it It s not cloth so you have to be careful This goes for latex and rubber too 3 Wet your hair first If your hair is dry when you put it on you will trap air under the cap And since it s not a permeable material the cap will start to come off while you swim because of the air trying to escape inside 4 Pick a fun color That s it Have a great swim 
5 0 Speedo Silicone Swim Cap I bought this swim cap for my wife for Christmas and she loves it 
5 0 Great Swim Cap I had trouble getting water in my ears before wearing this cap Now no problem It keeps my hair fairly dry or at least drier than with other caps I ve tried It s easy to put on and take off no hair pulling It s lasted well so far Much better than wearing a cap with a chin strap 
5 0 First Rate Case A great little case for your cellphone wallet keys ect anything you might want to keep dry and secure or buried in your backyard I have the clear red one which is all clear with a dark red insert 
5 0 Worth It I bought to use when I run with my snowshoes instead of lugging around my ski poles They are compact sturdy and cheap Much better than paying 65+ for Atlas poles at a local ski shop 
5 0 good and cheap Gave it to my husband for xmas Works great Adjustable height allows my kids to use it too 
4 0 Swiss Gear SG66201 Hiking Pole aluminum alloy telescoping red black Great Pole for the price You can t turn off the Anti shock Also they only ship 1 per Big Box 
5 0 Excellent particularly at its low price I have a stabilty problem and the hiking poles help a lot in walking There was a recent article in the FMCA Family Motor Coach Association magazine singing the praises of all the additional health benefits these trakking poles have The only critcism I have from ordering via Amazon was there was no way I could select black rather than red so I have gregarious red 
5 0 Cheap and functional We bought a pair of these at WalMart on a whim since they were so darn cheap We used them on the Appalachian Trail and on a hiking trip through the Swiss Alps They work great and have held up fine under rather stressful conditions While they re a bit heavier than the fancy name brand poles they re no less rugged and only a fraction the cost What s not to like 
5 0 Excellent for Bush Whacking My primary use for this was to give me something to help me stay upright during geocaching and to have something for bushwhacking If you are into Geocaching you will understand After falling down the side of a hill and getting a bit scratched up getting this Hiking Pole has worked very well to keep me balanced in weird places Also it s handy for moving branches out of the way i e bushwhacking when necessary 
5 0 Thule 686 on 2006 Honda Odyssey Great product and very functional It fit just right with the Ody s factory rack and cross bars No need to buy extra hardware and the silver color matched very will with the Green Slate color of the Ody A little penalty on gas mileage but more aerodynamic than the other boxes on the road Very convenient as to you can open the box from either side and you cannot pull the key if it is not latched properly 
5 0 Everything I expected Great product very easy to install Holds a lot Wind noise not that bad Easily holds 4 or 5 pairs of skis as well as additional luggage Though you can not put very heavy stuff in it Weight capacity is stated at 110 lbs and needs to be spread out Other item to take note is my skis are 170cm and not much room for anything much longer 
4 0 Great Item for the Cost Bought this for my 9 year old grandson and was afraid that it wouldn t work well enough for him and his 8 year old brother to use I haven t had very good luck with toys lately and I thought a pitching machine for 29 was asking a lot However it worked just fine I had purchased an extra set of balls so there would be enough for two rounds before the gathering up process Seems the extra balls were a little heavier and fired better than the balls that came with the product so the boys chose to use only the one set and pick up after each round they have a lot more energy than I have They had a great time practicing their batting and I got credit for getting an awesome gift 
5 0 Looks great and works great With the recent birth of my new daughter I wanted to get back into shape so she wouldn t think of me as old fat Dad Well my loving wife got me this weight set and I am very pleased with it The kit consists of two dumbbell handles with collars about 3 5 lbs when put together eight 2 5 lb weights and four 1 5 lb weights The plates fit on the dumbbells quite easily and the nut like collars ensure that they won t fall off I am very happy with these weights It is quick and easy to change the weight of each dumbbell and when it is together it stays together rather than the plates rotating and threatening to unscrew the collars Also the plastic container holds the plates and handles nicely and when the pieces are stowed away it makes a nice small package for storage I have had these weights for a year now and am quite happy with them If you or someone you know wants to do some light weightlifting to get back into shape then I highly suggest that you get this set Looks great and works great 
2 0 nice concept but flimsy This table is very lightweight and easy to use but not very sturdy It would probably last longer for someone using it only a few times a year but for weekly use it only lasted me a few months before one of the hinges came apart I don t think I would buy it again for frequent use 
5 0 just received it yesterday I really like everlast slimmer belt because it feel so great on my tummy I hadn t wear for work out yet but I will try to later on when I have time Regardless I think it s a good product for the price plus the shipping is fast compare to other slimmer belt that I tried to order 
5 0 great product I use this product on the treadmill every morning and it has really helped me loose inches It s a fast and simple way to help you loose weight while supporting your lower back 
5 0 Toasty Warm We purchased these blankets to keep in the car for emergencies Thankfully we haven t had to use them We also used them to line our rescued black lab s dog house for added warmth in our N E PA home We then used it to make a shelter for some free range kitty s that took up residence on our porch We lined a box with the blankets The kitty s are nice and toastie This is a great product at a great price 
5 0 Mylar blanket We have not had a chance to use the blankets but they look very good 
5 0 Great style It s a durable rash guard thick fabric and the design is simple and at the same time original One of a kind 
4 0 nice looking functional pretty stable Bought this from The Rack Warehouse via Amazon and it was back ordered for 6 weeks When it finally got here it was missing a screw In spite of this assembly was pretty easy It has a wide four leg base which keeps it reasonably stable If you walk into one of the bikes it shakes quite a bit but doesn t fall over or drop bikes on you The four feet are threaded for height adjustment on uneven floors and are made of a hard rubber so they don t scratch our wood floors when we slide it around with the bikes still loaded The free standing rack is much easier to move than the kind you have to tether to the floor and ceiling The oak looks really nice Its as if our bikes are on display We ve got three bikes on it most of the time and are quite happy with the performance You can adjust each arm independently to set it for a level top tube road frame or a sloping MTB frame The bars are coated with a thick rubbery material and do not damage the bike The drawback to this system is that if the cables on your road bike run under the top tube they will be pinched against the bike the whole time it is stored I have some bumpers on my cables that I keep on either side of the rack arms to prevent it from smashing the cable against the frame 
5 0 Does what it needs to do This product works as needed I use it in the doorway of my dormroom quite effectively I easily holds my weight 180 lbs without using the supplied mounting bracket just used the friction pads 
5 0 Giro Nine Helmet I recently purchased a Giro Nine helmet from Amazon com They gave me an option to have free shipping as long as I did not mind waiting 7 14 days I picked that option and actually received my helmet in only 3 days The product itself is great The helmet is comfortable and light The strap is padded so it does not rub against your chin The helmet keeps you very warm There is no ventilation like some other helmets but that is fine for me I am always cold not hot I have not had any major wipe outs yet so I cannot comment on that aspect of the quality The pink smog and white color is cute but it can easily get scratched I store my helmet in a small case to protect it while traveling 
2 0 Problematic Treadmill Horrible Customer Service After reviewing this treadmill in Consumer Reports we decided to purchase this and it arrived on March 1st This treadmill has been making squeeking noises since the very start when it is on any incline higher than 1 5 I have contacted Customer Service my husband who is very mechanical worked on it for over two hours with no resolution and now I am waiting for them to have a service tech call me who is now two days past the date they told me I could expect a call If this squeek was not an issue I would be very happy with the treadmill It runs well and is easy to use and I would rate it highly However as it is defective and no one at Ironman seems to care to resolve the issue it is very frusterating 
5 0 love it Does everything I need it to do and then some would purchase it again 
5 0 Ironman 320t Heart Rate Interactive Programmable Treadmill I am very pleased with my treadmill which I recieved January 2007 It is a high end treadmill and was one of the ones recommended in a recent Consumers Reports The price was decent and weighed less than some of the other ones recommended You will need two strong people to lift and or slide the box It weighs approximately 232 pounds But once it is together it can be rolled to another area in the folded position The assembly instructions were pretty straight forward Everything went together nicely I am a fairly handy female I think it helps to lay out the parts so as not to put the wrong screws in place and then have to go back and change them One thing I would strongly recommend would be to go on the and download the Users Manual and read it before it arrives I did this and when it came I already knew what to expect Hopes this helps 
5 0 Excellent More than exceeds my expectations This is a fantastic unit Extremely heavy duty Only negative box is huge and extremely heavy Delivery went as far as my driveway Took me and my son to slide it into house and it wasn t easy If you re on a second floor make plans to get help Helpful tip I assembled in my den but wanted to put in my bedroom It has wheels and you can move it similar to a handtruck but I wanted to slide it sideways thru the door Too wide to fit the other way Went to Home Depot and bought a set of those magic mover type discs That did the trick Was extremely easy to maneuver thru bedroom doorway Suggestion when you order buy some walk n lube too Treadmills need to be lubricated every 30 days or so Very difficult to find locally The treadmill is great I m a big boy and it handles me with no problem 
5 0 Just was I was looking for I tried out a lot of different units and read up on what I should look for I need a unit that s not going to fall apart on me I had kept hearing about this model and read lots of good things about the company in places like Consumers Guide I thought it was great when I tried one but Amazon had the better deal and I didn t mind waiting to get it I ve used it now for about about 2 weeks and I can see why I kept hearing good things about it It s really built like a brick and there was a lot of attention in the details Everythings right where it needs to be it s nice n quiet and looks good Overall I m quite happy with it 
5 0 Thankful Mother I don t normally write reviews if something works the way it s supposed to why bother But something happened the other day that I needed to share I got the treadmill as a gift for my daughter who is on the track team at school She s been doing so well we felt she earned it She has been pushing herself hard for the last week due to an upcoming race A few days ago while she was running the safety key was pulled off because she got to far from the front She tried to just put it back on and start it up but it wouldn t She got off to go reset it but she slumped to the floor and passed out After we got her to a doctor he said she just over exerted herself But thank the Lord the unit didn t start back up when she put the key back on If she had passed out while it was still moving she would have broken her neck Sara uses it every day and loves it We ve never had any problems with it though we ve only had it for 6 months 
5 0 Pilates box and pole This product was in excellent condition when it arrived The company from which it was purchased Sports Outdoors delivered the product quickly and I m very sastified with both Amazon and the seller 
5 0 Really Delivers If you want to step up your workout slap on a waist trimmer They really make you sweat around the middle and this ultimately leads to a smaller waist Also this is a legitimate uni sex product I worried that the waist wouldn t be small enough for me as I am a petite woman but almost the entire length of it is the fuzzy velcro so it would probably work for even a 20 waist if there is such a thing Great product at a dirt cheap price Get one for yourself 
5 0 GREAT PRICE AND GOT HERE FAST This was my first introduction product to the world of nutritious flax seed This product from Now Foods arrived within a few days on a standard order The flax seed was very fresh and delicious I recommend this for other customers for quality and value 
5 0 MONUNSATURATED MOTHER LODE BUT THE GOLDEN FLAX MAY BE EVEN BETTER FOR JUST 20 CENTS MORE VERY HIGH IN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT MONOUNSATURATED FATS IN A NUTSHELL SUPER FOOD SUPPLEMENT LIKE BREWER S YEAST LECITHIN WHEAT GERM or COD LIVER OIL Over 5 times more Monounsaturated Fat than Polyunsaturated Fat And over 20 times more Monounsaturated Fat than Saturated Fat BUT THAT S NOT ALL Flax Seed is a nutritionally complex food Flax Seed contains a very a high concentration of alpha linoleic acid ALA an omega 3 essential fatty acid plus fiber lignan and many naturally occurring vitamins and minerals Increasingly recent studies have revealed that Flax Seed does help reduce serum cholesterol levels fights cancer and controls blood glucose levels IT IS IMPORTANT TO BUY WHOLE FLAX SEEDS THEN GRIND THEM Buying flax seed unground keeps it fresh and retains all the nutrients while on the shelf However it is important to grind the flax in a coffee grinder before using otherwise the flax seed will most likely pass through your digestive system intact and you will not have received the benefits of consuming them It is important to AVOID ground flax since no matter how wholesome and fresh the flax was when it was ground it loses its nutrient value and turns rancid very quickly even when purchased in a vacuum sealed container In essence a vacuum sealed container is only useful if you use all the flax as soon as the container is opened That of course assumes that it was sealed as soon as it was ground in the first place FYI Traditionally Golden Flax is higher in oil than the ordinary yellow flax which is traditionally higher in fiber BOTTOM LINE ONE OF SEVERAL BRANDS I CONSUME DAILY BUT I PICK GOLDEN WHEN I CAN GET IT This Now Flax is an organic food supplement which can enhance human health when used daily and a truly excellent value However given a choice I would spend the extra 20 cents and choose the Golden Flax product because Golden Flax is traditionally higher in the beneficial oils that are the reason for consuming flax in the first place 
4 0 Camp Table This table was what we needed It is wide enough and does the trick as a kitchen The only thing I had a problem with was that it was too thin for our kitchen gear pole it holds paper towels lantern cooking utensils garbage bag would not tighten down as thin as the table So it wobbled around a lot 
4 0 Cot It was what I expected Yes put in legs you must have strong muscles 
4 0 Liked it A little difficult to put together and the read out doesn t work but a good piece of workout equipment and not a bad price 
5 0 Review A little tough to put together in some aspects but well made easy to use and fairly easy to move 
5 0 Our Family Loves This Stepper We love this Twist Step Trainer because its lightweight and fits in a small space Its sturdy and gives a good workout Also its quiet so the one using it doesn t drive the rest of the family crazy The monitor is good too we like keeping track of how many steps we take as well as of minutes It wasn t hard to assemble either and was reasonably priced All in all we re very happy we bought it 
5 0 Cancelled order I ordered the wrong set of bands for my wife and had to cancell this order Their customer service was very understanding and helpful The lighter bands we purchased are being used daily by my wife 
5 0 Heavy Resistance Pack I have returned the package to the seller The reason was that I needed light resistance and I ordered the wrong one 
4 0 Good knife but too small I bought this knife on a whim and it worked out well for a little while but then I lost it This knife is a little to small to not have a clip or something to keep it attached to you 
5 0 What can you say about swiss army knives Swiss army knives are simply one of the best pen knives around I ended up shopping price and this was the best I could find 
5 0 The best buy a set These cards are awesome We use these in our poker club and they are great Every high end club that I have played in uses these cards and for good reason Although any brand can be marked or damaged you really would have to work hard to deface these They are also washable so dirt etc comes right off I play at least once a week for about 6 7 hours and we have been using the same cards for two years and they seem just as fresh as when we got them I will tell you that if you are not used to these cards you might not like the way the feel at first But then you will love them You should keep in mind that there are two different sizes One for poker and one for bridge The bridge cards are smaller to help you hold them all in your hand If you are used to poker cards make sure you get the right size or they will feel dwarfed in your hand If you play in a home game these cards are a must You won t have to buy another set unless someone burns them In the long run you will save by not having to replace your decks Also keep in mind that this cards glide very easily so go easy when you start dealing until you get used to them Best of luck at the tables 
5 0 Cool Loved its look and feel while I don t know much about using a compass this one has all the parts needed to be a top notch explorer GPS is for sissies 
1 0 Don t waste your money I ordered this originally from HSN and the product is made of plastic Flimsy not sturdy and having to pull out and rotate the handles can be difficult for someone with arthritis in their hands I used it and liked but then it got the point I would not adjust it to do the different exercises and I sent it back Don t waste your money and time on this 
4 0 Love Mia What could be better than a near life size image of Mia Hamm hanging on your door or wall 
5 0 The way to lose weight This is the best machine to use for losing weight You feel great look great and have a happier life It is so easy and fun to use I used to have the slimmer gazelle and have now switched to this one The pistons are a great addition and provides an extra workout But if you are just starting out I would start with the lowest level This machine is also easier on the joints The difference between this model and the other models is that it feels sturdier and has the power pistons The only flaw I found is the exercise video it came with It is this women who I dont even know doing the workout routine I want Tony Little I had to buy his workout video because Tony Little is the best in getting you motivated You can get the video at his website www tonylittle com Overall the Gazelle Power Plus earns an A plus in my book 
4 0 very good This is a very nice product it is very good if you need to lose a few extra pounds aerobic level A+ calorie counter B quietness B smooth glide A+ durability B+ overall A 
4 0 Tony Little Gazelle Power Plus Fitness System In May of 2005 I cut sodas and fried foods from my diet and greatly reduced sweets I began walking in June but I live in a high desert area and it becomes extremely hot during the summer My walking routine was at best erratic Weighing 230 lbs I found working out at the gym to be an uncomfortable experience I began looking into home equipment My husband was supportive but somewhat hesitant because at the time I already owned an elliptical trainer with powered incline that was serving as a very large clothing rack I had also recently donated a power treadmill to charity because it too was taking up space and not getting used While shopping one day I saw a Gazelle in a local retail store I was surprised by the range of motion and cardiovascular workout the machine offered I purchased the Gazelle in July of 2005 It is now October of 2005 I currently weigh 150 lbs Up until 1 month ago the Gazelle was the only piece of workout equipment I used to lose the weight I found the Gazelle gave me an excellent cardiovascular workout and I also liked the stretch from the range of motion this machine allows In addition I found the workout to feel extremely natural The only downside to the Gazelle is that since I purchased it 4 months ago I have had to repair it twice 2 weeks after I purchased the product one of the welds broke on the swing arm FitnessQuest was very helpful and sent a repair part with no hassle but delivery took 2 weeks One month later a bolt holding a foot pedal broke causing me to fall and slightly injure myself On examination the bolt had worn away due to friction Once again I called for a repair part and received it in 2 weeks Other than when I have had to wait for repair parts I have used this machine every day since its purchase In the event that the machine breaks again after the warranty expires I will most probably spend the money and purchase another one The workout is that enjoyable and the results have been that good 
4 0 Tony Me and a Great Gazelle When I first purchased the Gazelle my partner Jim was very skeptical But once I showed off my new nice tight buns courtesy of Tony Little he became an instant Tony fan Now we both have our very own Gazelle and we are having a blast yeee haaaaa I recommend this to all people little small fat or big Tony will get you pumped up So buy this thing and rock out LITTLE style oh yeah Thanks Tony Bill Jim in PA 
5 0 Know your power If you buy any trainer I would recommend this computer to train with It is easy to operate gives instant information not hard to setup and works well It is particularly useful if you track your workouts 
5 0 Very Practical Exercise System The kit arrived sooner than expected The included videotape demonstrates all practical exercise routines and many specialized exercises for more athletic people Even warm up exercises are demonstrated Door attachment instructions and basic exercise instructions are also included in printed form This exercise kit is especially good for women and for seniors of both genders Beyond that men and women who travel a lot will find the kit easy to take along Almost anyone can benefit from regular use of this kit 
5 0 Oil extractor For price it works great I use it for my boat but also found numerous other uses Such as draing the antifreeze out of the car overflow container Works for lawnmovers ATVs or anytime you have a fluid that needs to be sucked out 
5 0 Awesome What a difference to be able to lap swim and see the clock the wall for turns and or my kids when they re in the pool These fit well although I find there is some fogging that I need to rectify after every 10 laps I highly recommend to anyone who wears glasses and swims 
5 0 Excellent quality My little sister is an avid high school swimmer who always had difficulty seeing the clock for swim intervals The coach was always forced to put her in lane one and she still had to squint to see the clock Poor girl Eventually she decided to purchase a pair of prescription goggles and picked these They are of the same quality as discounted non perscription goggles you may find at big swim meets and I think Amazon has the best price I recommend these to anyone that wears glasses and enjoys swimming My dad recently purchased another pair as a recreational swimmer 
5 0 Fits well Doesn t fog The goggles fits great I can swim in it a whole hour I only have class for an hour and it doesn t fog It s great 
5 0 necessary equipment This product fit a desired need for fishing excursions and was exactly what was wanted 
5 0 Best Personal Thermos Bottle This bottle works extremely well It keeps coffee hot for hours and it s leakproof You won t be disappointed I ve had several personal thermos containers and not one has done as well as this one I plan to buy another one if the other colors become available 
5 0 hot coffee no leaks I had this vacuum bottle for two months now and my experience has been only positive I have experienced no leaks coffee remains hot enough to enjoy drinking 6 hours later and it is easy to use one handed It is approximately the size of a bicycle water bottle and will fit into many of the same holders including the bottle pockets on my messenger bag I ve been pleasantly surprised as how little the coffee has stained the interior of the bottle and cover especially since I haven t been meticulous about cleaning 
5 0 Decent quality I used it to mount my Delta Airzound Bike Horn on a recumbent bicycle 
5 0 This watch does it all Great watch This watch has many functions and it takes some time to learn them all I highly recommend this watch to any outdoor enthusiast or to any gadget guru 
4 0 Nice mat The mat is really cute and does not slip at all The only thing I don t like is that it is a little too long and it would be nice if it was slightly thicker 
5 0 a great buy I m SO happy I bought this mat I love the color design and the energy of it I also got a matching bag for it from ebay I m not only using my mat for youga but also practice meditation on it and everytime I m having troubles in my yoga practice I look at my mat and smile 
4 0 Pretty good I have used bycycle mirrors before most of the helmet mounted I recently purchased a new helmet and did not want to mount a mirror on it so I looked for a mirror that could mount on my glasses this one fits the bill with one small exception I would like it better if it were just about an inch longer it can be a real strain to see in it at times But it does do the trick and it has a lot of adjustments making it easy to aim Overall I would recommend this mirror 
5 0 Nice gloves for heavy bags training Very nice protection for heavy bags training Nice grip also There is one thing I have to say though these gloves tend to run small I mean my hands are medium amongst Americans and I had to squeeze them into these gloves every time I don t know what would happen to those who have bigger hands 
1 0 Dangerous Any sword that is only 15 is in fact very dangerous These swords are called wallhangers because they are only designed to by hung on a wall not swung The reason is that underneath the handle is a very small piece of metal that connects to the blade itself Called the Tang In a real martial arts sword the tang is normally a thick piece of metal that is almost the thickness of the sword itself If you swing a wallhanger too often or too hard it can break at the tang and fly off and hurt someone If you want to learn more about how dangerous these wallhangers are do a google search on the words anatomy of a wallhanger Any sword designed for real martial arts practice like Iaido starts at 250 not 15 and should be bought at a reputable Iaido store sorry I am not allowed to recommend web sites here So be smart either hang this sword back on the wall or throw it out before your baby brother sister hurts someone 
5 0 Hanzo sword This was a good sword I was expecting some plastic or paper sword for a price like this but instead you get this nice sword delivery took only 3 days and my package was brought in perfect condition and I now have a Hattori Hanzo swor 
5 0 Long live sword Demon Man at 24 99 this sword is an absolute STEAL It REALLY does sell for 60 on other sites around the net I mean you could pay that much for a REALLY authentic version of the sword which would include a leather handle and the lion symbol on the base of the sword But hey im a huge katana fan and a huge kill bill fan and I admit this is ENOUGH Only thing I wish came with it was a stand For a better display The sword is pretty sharp to I tossed a apple in the air and sliced it clean in two Awesome product awesome price I ll be back to get the last samurai sword from this same seller to Got it to me within 4 days 
4 0 Kill Bill Bride Sword I was looking for a reasonably priced sword and this one fit the bill perfectly I was curious to see what I could get for 20 and I was pleasantly surprised if you re looking for an inexpensive sword for display or practice I highly recommend this sword 
2 0 poor fit the goggles didnt fit me very well and a lot of wind went around them I they didnt fit anyone in my family either I think the material is a bit too stiff to allow it to comform to one s face Otherwise I would rate the goggles highly 
5 0 Versatile and very powerful folds small The same brass nozzel works with white gas or the primus butane fuel cylinder Included is the sturdy metal pressure pump for use with the liquid fuel bottle I recently swapped the brass burner jet using the Primus wrench both included and lit it using lamp oil similar to kerosene which also burned well A nice combo that can use local fuels The compressed Primus fuel is convenient for trips of a couple days and allows simmering and is availabile in major outdoors stores If you get the little Primus lantern it will also use these Primus compressed gas bottles The lantern provides a nice way to use every bit of the fuel 
5 0 GREAT Racket This Stiga T0070 Table Tennis Racket is really NICE I liked it so well I also purchased one for a FRIEND You can t beat it fot the MONEY 
4 0 Excellent Paddle for Players Good Thickness Ok on Tact I purchased this paddle for my wife while I purchased the EuroTech The EuroTech is great for me for strong spin Control and Playing deep off of the table My wife plays closer and is not as hard of a spinner but the control of this paddle and the balance of the weight is great for her In a matter of a week she loves using this paddle we play a few days a week vs a couple of other el cheapo paddles I give this a 5 star rating for entry players and players that play close and don t use alot of spin but if you are a spinner and a deeper player it is worth the extra few bucks to upgrade to the even better EuroTech 
5 0 Best system for the price This system is the best for your money It is great because if you set the safety bars right you don t need a spot all you need to complete this system is a bench that rolls in and out with leg attachment Like the one Powertec has Oh and of course the bar and weights 
4 0 Inexpensive and decent paint My friend got me this for my birthday It was good decent paint that you could rely on The only problem I had was they somtimes blew up in my barrel but that isn t a problem really It is also accurate and relyable If you want good inexpensive paint than I recomend getting this 
4 0 Shipped really fast I got this item days before I would have expected to What s contained is a basic sword cleaning kit The letters on the box look kinda faded and I m afraid to touch the box for fear of splinters I d recommend finishing it somehow Otherwise very nice 
5 0 15 Years And Counting I discovered Boeshield when I was a Marine Electronics editor for national magazines in the early 1990 s The folks at Boeshield gave me 2 4oz cans that I hoarded for years before the Internet came along I guarantee Boeshield out performs any lubricant for protection and freeing up frozen parts Buy with confidence 
5 0 All I can say is WOW I have a small garage shop with not a few cast iron tools sitting around During certain times of the year I have a problem with humidity and surface rust This Boeshield T 9 spray is a good solution Though I used to use a lot of WD40 and steel wool to keep the rust at bay this stuff is way better While the surface is rust free spray the T 9 on and let it sit a while and then rub it off with a clean rag The surface is then lubricated and coated to prevent further rust Wood GLIDES across the metal after a treatment of T 9 Buy some you will love it 
5 0 Best in class Rust will not form if you use this stuff Contains no silicon 
5 0 Best rust preventer ever invented If you are looking for a good rust preventer this is the best I use it on my shop tools and am totally rust free

5 0 Excellent light If you are looking at this light you are probably already familiar with the technology Basically HID is the top notch light Power consumption durability and light output etc This light is made for racing mountain bikes off road at night I personally use it for commuting over dark snowy bicycle trails through the Wisconsin winter I was a little reluctant to part with the money but I must say it is worth every cent I can also vouch for the crash resistant mounting design long story If you are a little wealthier than me and or if you are a weight queen you may be interested in the higher end models which pair the same light with lighter battery technology The smaller battery technology would also be a better option if you intend to helmet mount the light If you are night biking only infrequently and in areas that have street lights you can probably get away with a cheap LED light which will generally make you visible to others But if you need to light the path your biking on regularly this is definitely the way to go It s much cheaper than getting injured and you will get home faster with this awesome light on your bicycle One usage hint I found a little grease on the mount makes it easier to pop the light on and off 
5 0 outstanding outdoor tool I got my first Vector about three years ago from REI Yes it is large Not a problem for me as I am large I am on my third Vector the first two for some strange reason leaked water the first during an incredible monsoon rainstorm in the mountains of Arizona the second while taking a shower No I did not submerse the watch nor push any buttons while the water was on Fortunately REI accepts returns with no questions It is a testament to how nice this watch is that I continued to replace the watch Perhaps I had models from a bad production run as my present Vector has lasted for over two years with nary a leak The good I have found the digital compass to be very accurate and useful Remember that it must be calibrated from time to time and don t forget about declination The barometer is VERY useful The barometer function is constantly operating and accounts for a nice little symbol in the upper left of the display showing pressure trends over the past few hours This is very useful if you understand barometric pressure trends and their likely results If you do not look it up and learn as you will find it to be very useful if you spend a lot of time in the brush Remember that the barometric pressure must be calibrated against absolute sea level readings from time to time especially during rapidly changing weather conditions Once you understand the relationship between altitude changing weather you will master the complexities of both the barometer and the altimeter and understand just how simple they are and how reliable this device really is I have checked it against my high end GPS and other barometers many times and it is very accurate indeed The temp is useful if you need to know the temperature like all such devices it will have to be taken off of your body for about ten minutes before you will get an accurate reading The bad the lens is plastic If you have any experience with fine coated glass you will do fine with this DO NOT EVER wipe any dust or dirt off of the face Use a lens pen with a fine blower brush Or wait until you ve stepped under water with it Put simply it has been my experience that if you keep your grubby paws off of it and don t try to clean it with your cotton t shirt flannel shirt etc and instead use methods used for fine coated glass elements it will look like new forever Mine does and it has been in desert dust and swamp mud The battery does in fact eventually lose energy In normal use you can expect a year or more from the battery If you are one of those fellas that shows everyone that he meets his neat digital compass or actually rely on this as your primary compass in the brush it won t last nearly so long The digital compass is the primary energy sucker likely as much as the backlight Use the compass only when needed you should have a base plate compass anyway Suunto also makes some of the best of these as well As for the review stating the watchbands give out I find that remarkable as I have never had a problem with mine and I wear it constantly day in and day out All in all and in spite of the fact that I had to return my first two I heartily recommend the Vector Tough and useful 
4 0 Fun Watch I gave this watch to my fiance he has really enjoyed tracking our altitude gain on bike rides I ve appreciated knowing the temperature Can t wait for ski season 
4 0 It s HUGE But pretty darn cool This may be the outdoorsy ubergeek watch It s big it s ugly but has functions to make the fattest Swiss Army Knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy Overall I like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are The timepiece Outstanding It has HH MM SS DD MMM of course with a year setting to avoid leap year issues This should go without saying in a modern digital watch Stopwatch with lap function not that I ever use the lap function but I m sure someone is interested Countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown very easy to set Three daily alarms Special kudos for the alarms this is one of the loudest watch alarms I ve heard and I ve missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this The Altimeter largely eye candy but kind of neat Over four days my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level by the maps about 40m ASL Not surprising because it is driven by the barometer and I never recalibrated it but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want need it The Barometer Yup it s a barometer The part I like is the little display that shows the rising falling trend especially as this is always active even in normal time mode The Thermometer Take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist The compass Easily the best special feature Accurate precise enough for orienteering not for surveying easy to use It can be programmed for a declination but knowing me I d forget to reset it so I do declination the hard way The sighting notches are small but servicable The spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to Suunto and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass An outstanding wrist compass The package Big Really really big But the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing a problem for me with other watches The battery has a shortish 12 18 month life but has a hatch so you don t need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance The display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground and the display light is just right readible even and glare free but not an emergency flashlight Personally I m going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap but the stock strap isn t bad just not great Overall not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch compass and barometer and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter Well designed thought out and manufactured but really big 
5 0 Suunto Vector This is the second Suunto Vector watch i have owned Only because the first one was lost The only two draw backs of this watch is battery life and my band broke twice in two years Seems to me they could offer a much longer life battery and a band that would hold up alot better the battery lasts about 6 months only For the price of this watch 230 you think tehy could do alittle better Other than that i love the watc 
5 0 An amazingly tough watch and useful I m very hard on my gear and this watch has withstood it all It has all the features you could ask for in a watch plus a few you would never expect Large easy to read numbers for when your in difficult situations or akward positions and even while scuba diving note it says not to press buttons underwater but its still readable without the backlight usually are a great feature and although it s a large watch it has a certain style all its own I think the compass is my favorite feature great while orienting yourself with a trail map Also a great conversational piece while breaking the ice in the board room my watch helps me predict the weather D ok maybe not the best thing to tell your boss but still an amazing watch 
5 0 great for Tae Kwon Do at home practice Though it requires more space than we thought this is a great way to practice Tae Kwon Do at home Its adjustable to different heights and easy to move by rolling across the floor But it requires a good deal of space around it for someone to take a big step and swing their leg arm without hitting anything but the Kid Kick 
4 0 Good starter set for a good price I don t know anything about golf clubs but I ve been using these clubs for about 3 wks now and they are doing pretty well I am a new golfer and I m getting the fundamentals down These clubs are a good starter set without taking a hit in your checkbook I may come back a re review these clubs once I know a little more about the game That way I can tell how well they hit 
5 0 Lot s of fun and energising I like this low impact workout It s a switch in pace for Cathe but it s still a fun and challenging workout You will definately burn fat and calories here The step workout is about 29 30 minutes and then there is a toning segment too It is more geared toward a less advanced exerciser but everyone will get benefits from this The cardio features faster slower intervals and has lots of interesting but doable combos e g around the world rocking horse which aren t new It s mostly low impact but does have some higher impact bursts In the toning segment you will use a stability ball for almost all of the exercises You also need some weights too I enjoy doing this and as I said earlier it is fun and motivating Go get this and do it 4 times a week along with other dvds to keep up your interest 
5 0 Great transaction fast delivery and the sword looks GREAT I gave it as a gift to my friend that loves the Ninja Gaiden video game and he hit the roof it is very accurate to the one in the game which is very impressive 
4 0 Good and Light Good quality gloves light and easy to wear The only thing is that it gets crumbled towards the ends of the finger openings after a while But this does not affect the punching and grapping much The pads towards the front of the hand are soft and make it easy for your opponent when punching him her 
4 0 Good bat not too hard not too soft This is a great baseball bat for playing in a confined area It has a little weight but nothing significant enough to hit a homerun or break a neighbors window This bat will deteriorate if left outside through the elements The durability is the only reason this item did not receive five stars in this review Even with the bat being a bit weathered I can still find use for it It has been monumental in training both my dog and my 2 year old son When I pick up the old bat they know they have done something wrong so usually they hide Thanks EA my son has finally stopped playing with his food 
5 0 Izzo kick back putting mat The mat was exactly what we wanted It came promptly and was great I would not hesitate to order from this company again 
5 0 Extremely comfortable extremely functional I wear these shoes for pretty much everything but running As other reviewers have mentioned these are extremely comfortable with a wide base to provide plenty of traction and grip The rubber soles and canvass uppers make them very flexible while still providing some support These shoes are great for martial arts as well as normal everyday use I often just wear them around the house because they are so comfortable They do tend to show sweat stains very easily but it s understandable being that they re made from white canvass 
5 0 martial arts shoes I had them in days of the order They are as described I did have to add som e memory foam but other than that just great 
5 0 Best Wushu Shoes you can buy These shoes by far a worth every penny I paid for them 
4 0 Good martial arts shoes I have a pair in both black and white They are good shoes for doing martial arts when you might need to wear shoes The two earlier reviewers state in detail so I will not need to repeat that The one obvious thing is that they go well with a Gi Dobek The shoes are easy on and easy off so it is perfect for a trip to the dojo dojang Not just for kung fu anymore 
4 0 Wonderful shoe I doubt these shoes because of friends in shaolin who swore by these shoes and I wanted shoes to use for capoeira Well the grooves on the bottom of the shoes make it very difficult to slide your feet backwards or spin on the ball of your foot because of an insanely large amount of friction so it does no good for me in capoeira but obviously they weren t made for that There is an incrdibly large range for friction so if you need to keep your feet on the ground these shoes will definetly do that for you Also these shoes are INSANELY comfortable Since I ve bought these I wear them nearly every opportunity I have They re light the padding on the bottom is perfect for your feet from the first time you put them on to the last And stylish Only drawback to them would be if you have any need to slide your feet backwards or rotate your feet it may be difficult but other than that its a wonderful shoe 
5 0 Best Shoes for Wushu Martial Arts and Very Stylish I ve been using these shoes for Shaolin Kung Fu for over 10 years of course not the same ones I ve tried other shoes like the Pine Tree or the black slipper like ones Feiyu is the best for Wushu style training The Reasons Feiyus are wide at the bottom allowing for good balance when doing jump kicks kicks and stances They have rubber soles with lots of groves in them which keep you well grounded when doing low stance work You wont slip like with the taichi cloth shoes They are made with thick soles which give more cushioning and bounce Shoelaces allow you to adjust the shoe to your foot and wont fall off while you kick Very comfortable and light You can climb walls trees with these or just walk on the street Shaolin monks from the Shaolin Temple in China use the same exact ones Style magazines have rated these as being very stylish affordable shoe Many people are buying them just for fashion purposes I have absolutely no complaints about these shoes I never buy anything else I literally use these until they get holes at the bottoms and even then they still make a great shoe and provide me with the quality I need 
5 0 Thule Load Bars What can I say They are load bars for Thule Racks they work Amazon found the cheapest price around and the vendor shipped very promptly I would trust Rackbarn for future purchases of this type 
4 0 Great First Bench This is the first weight bench that I have bought and I have been pleased with it No it is not a commercial gym bench but it certainly does just fine for my home training The preacher curl pad is a little flimsy when you are curling a lot of weight but other than that I really like my purchase 
5 0 Great bench I got this about a week ago Assembly was pretty easy took less than an hour The only problem I had was that one of the pins that hold the uprights in place had some stripped threads I called the customer service number and they sent me two replacements which I received within a week Bench press The bench has four positions flat decline and two incline The uprights are adjustable to four different heights The bottom part of the seat is also adjustable to flat or two different incline positions While doing incline bench presses at the higher of the two incline positions it s nice to put the lower part of the seat up at it s highest incline position as it holds you in place so you don t slide downwards while doing your reps There are also a pair of extra barbell holders located lower down on the uprights if you can t finish a rep you can dump the bar in there The bar will come to rest about an inch above your chin so you don t have to lift it very far to get it in there That s a really nice safety feature Overall it s very comfortable and works great for any sort of bench press incline decline or flat There s nothing that gets in the way the uprights are adjustable to get the bar at the right height and the bench has a really solid feel to it I use a 6 standard bar which works fine Of course a 7 bar would work as well Squat rack You can use this bench for a squat rack The lower bar that holds the uprights together is curved so you can stand between them You just flip the bench forward It stays in the straight up position Then you raise the uprights as high as they go and turn them around backwards so they re facing the correct direction They re tubular so you just take the pins out and turn them around Ideally the uprights could go up a little higher as you have to squat down somewhat in order to get under the bar But you re doing squats anyway so what s the point in complaining that you have to do an extra 1 5th of a rep Besides it s infinitely better than picking the weight up off the floor Leg attachment This is removable which is nice because it s not in the way when you re not using it It has two different heights I found the lower one best for leg curls and the upper one better for leg extensions If you try using the leg curl attachment on the upper height the padded bar wants to roll up your legs as you do the exercise On the lower position there s no problem The padding on the bars is very thick and comfortable For leg extensions the bar goes right across the front of your ankles and stays there throughout the exercise Same with the leg curls once I got it at the right height it stays in the same place on your legs throughout the exercise with no rolling back and forth The bar that holds the barbell plates is 1 in diameter and there s an adapter sleeve included for Olympic plates 2 diameter Preacher curl bench This goes in the same place as the leg attachment I originally thought there was a problem with the barbell holder which sticks out from the front of this as it wouldn t allow me to get a full extension at the bottom of the movement But I found that if you move forward on the seat so that your legs are under the preacher bench and the middle of your biceps are about even with the top of the bench it works just fine There s no interference from the barbell holder at all Even though that barbell holder is only a few inches wide the bar balances just fine on it and it s a handy feature Overall I can t find anything to complain about with this bench After a little experimenting around to find the correct position to be in when using the preacher curl bench and which height the leg attachment needs to be at for the leg curl to work correctly everything works fine The bench is nice and solid and the padding on the seat is thick and firm The replacement part I needed was received quickly at no charge and with no questions asked I m really happy with this purchase 
5 0 Nice photo of the boys Nice to have a photo of the boys from Boston who broke the curse of the Bambino once and for all 
5 0 Golf Travel Bag w wheels Really like the look of the bag and all the storage space Unfortunately I haven t used it on an airplane yet 
4 0 An overall good product The gloves have a tight solid feel and are made of good materials The manufacturer describes a new feature Innovative curved finger design that offers a natural flexible and comfortable fit That sounds good but does not add any real comfort to the glove You still have the excess padding when making a fist that makes it more difficult to grab the bar Pros Solid feel good padding good materials overall design and craftsmanship the No Sweat wicking system seems to work and there is no dark residue left on the hands after the workout which is not the case with most manufacturers using cheaper materials Cons Excess inner padding affecting the grip no easy off feature offered by many other manufacturers a wrist wrap that takes some tweaking to be comfortable 
4 0 Superior Quality with Excessive Padding The suitability of these gloves depends on what type of lifting you enjoy With padding on the palm and fingers your entire gripping surface is cushioned Such padding is common on bicycling gloves where hours of continuous pressure and vibration can cause numbness and pain Yet most serious lifters would probably forgo comfort for better control provided by unpadded gloves Traditional weight lifting gloves are made from durable but supple leather to prevent calluses and improve grip The latter becomes critically important when perspiring In my experience having no padding is best especially when lifting heavier weight Basically the compliance of the padding reduces your level of control At the same time there is an undesirable absorption of energy albeit a miniscule amount The quality of the materials and construction of the Harbinger 1250 gloves is the best I have seen Clearly the expense in making these gloves is significantly higher than in other products I have owned by Nike and Gold s Unfortunately the generous use of thick split leather and padding provides insulation that causes excessive heat buildup With heat comes sweat I find myself taking these gloves off multiple times during my workout to let the sweat evaporate It would be nice if there were perforations or large vents on the back to mitigate this problem While these gloves might be ideal for certain lifters who prefer comfort over control I would counsel gym rats to purchase other gloves with less or no padding Kudos to Harbinger for making a quality product but these gloves aren t for everyone Pros Superior materials Excellent double stitching Comfortable wrist wrap Cons Expensive Excessive padding No perforations to dissipate heat and perspiration 
5 0 Comfortable and Secure I have been using Harbinger wrist wrap gloves for inline skating for over a decade The new gloves are more comfortable than the last pair They were a little snug out of the box but broke in within 3 uses 
5 0 Great gloves I am very satisfied with this product These are my first gloves with extended finger length which I find now as a big plus especially when doing wrist curls Wrist wrap works great for me with weak wrists Padding is very good as well without it interfering with normal hand fold I read some reviews commenting on how uncomfortably warm they would get when used I personally have not felt it what I do agree with is that taking gloves off is not easy I found that pulling fingers out first is the less difficult way I actually wanted to buy the newer model which allows for machine wash but Amazon did not have L size in stock These minor details do not demerit the 5 star rating though 
4 0 Good Gloves These gloves are comfortable but I didn t realize that they were 3 4 fingers and that was a little hard to get used to They are also really warm But I would buy them again 
5 0 Hardbinger Gloves This is an excellent product made for my training needs Is not the first time I weard this glove brand and I just have to say that I am very satified with the performance 
5 0 You need em If you have a Wave you will wear out the wheels These are what you need 
5 0 Speedo Long Hair Swim Cap The Speedo swimcap is awesome I love it It makes swimming so much more enjoyable with not having to worry about my hair If I were to replace it I would replace it with a regular cap not one for long hair but there will be a next time Thanks NormaJeann 
4 0 Heavy Duty These workout gloves are the real deal They have rubber on the palms for grip and cushioning A well made well designed glove 
5 0 On second pair in six years Great gloves for working out Take a few weeks to break in but provide great grip and cushion In fact use them weekely for mountain biking as well And they ve still held together 
5 0 A birthday gift for my son I purchased these gloves based on my son s wish list He had used this type previously for about 4 years The new ones seem comfortable durable He is quite pleased with them 
5 0 Great Gloves I ve had a pair for a little over a year and they are the best gloves I ve ever used I ve destroyed every pair of gloves i ve owned Harbinger training grip s Nike s and Atlas and these have really held up They are starting to come apart right now but they have been used 4 times a week so it is expected It took about a month to really break these gloves in but once they get broken in all of the thumb pains will go away and the rubber will start to loosen up They are really worth the extra 
5 0 These gloves are awesome I have the first iteration of these gloves which were only a little bit different and am now ordering another pair for backup This is the best pair of weight lifting gloves I ve ever used My first pair has lasted more than 3 years now and they are tough as nails Comfortable well built and leave your hands so smooth you ll never get another callus again 
5 0 Worth the time of break in The gloves at first seem very stiff and actually uncomfortable to wear but once you get over the break in time these gloves are great Very comfortable and dont feel awkward at all The rubber padding really helps with grip so much that you dont even really have to think about slipping when you go to lift also make heavy presses a little easier on the hands 
4 0 Tee ball Pants I bought these for my daughter who played tee ball She loved them they were very durable and size was gret fit 
5 0 Quality for backyard This pitching rubber is solid and of good quality to last many years of backyard baseball games 
5 0 Sit up aid or Sleepfest Just woke up from the incredible nap I had after doing sit ups on this mat It is extremely comfortable and easy on the back When doing push ups however I noticed that there isn t much support for the knees But do you really need a mat for push ups Overall I recommend it for the average workout person For those hard cores out there you may want to invest in a thicker more padded mat I like it because it is easy to transport and makes a quick and comfortable bed after a late night out 
4 0 A Magic Carpet of Pride A kind friend brought over the flag pennant knowing my love of the Cardinals and of bright cheerful things in general This baby is no pushover either It s nearly a square yard of flapping screaming Card Fever I have three poles outside my window and this pennant fits nicely via the top sleeve so that neighbors can t help but notice that a Cards fan lives in their hood One or two of them have teased me saying that my Cards banner seems to be slightly larger and hung higher than the traditional US flag the Stars and Stripes Forever but as I tell them that is just an optical illusion due to the color red being so prominent on the banner both on bird and background what you might call the field Even those who don t follow the ballgames will recognize the familiar red bird its good nature and its competitiveness with other birds The cardinal as we all know has staying power It s the team that boasted over the years such Hall of Famers as Stan the Man Musial and Grover Cleveland Alexander not to mention Cy Young himself Dizzy Dean Rabbit Maranville Leo Durocher the Fordham Flash Frankie Frisch and Enos Slaughter just to name a few The banner is as big as a magic flying carpet let it take you away on a never ending tour of imagination and baseball firepower First thing in the morning I will order another one through Amazon com and take my chances Which if my neighbors and or fellow Cards fans shall I gift with this red surprise Not everyone has the big personality it takes to display a red flag outside your front door especially here in dim foggy old San Francisco where our own ballteam has plenty of vociferous boosters Well we ll see In the meantime let the red bird soar and to all who know better better luck next year 
5 0 Great Knife You always hear reviews say if I were to loose this I would buy another one Well I bought one when the model first came out and it worked great for more than a year then it was lost in a cross country move After a few weeks I realized how much I was missing it for many every day tasks I have now purchased my second blur They are great knifes the only drawback is you cannot sharpen it yourself with the serrated section but that will get you on any knife Spring assist functions great without any unintentional openings Safe Fast useful Highly recommended 
5 0 Fantastic knife You can t beat a Ken Onion Knife This one is great Smooth action no slip grip and sharp enough to shave with Highly recomended 
5 0 This is a good work knife The knife holds a good blade even after some abuse The thumb button is a little small and a bit tough on the thumb after repeated openings but does open the knife very well The textured handle provides a very good grip but works like sand paper on anything else in your pocket If I lost it I would buy another one 
4 0 A stable if obvious pocket knife For perspective my last pocket knife was a Kershaw Sapphire with a plain blade so this was a step off the beaten track The handle is wide enough for a comfortable grip but slim enough for my pocket the sandpaper like insets snag my jeans but hopefully that won t turn out to be a bad thing This is by no means a small pocket knife the blade is large but stable and a good balance for the handle If it wasn t as slim as it is I wouldn t even try to carry it The speed safe was a little bit of a surprise I thought it would be a lot less forceful than it is To be honest I wouldn t bring this out in public the Sapphire was as exciting as a butter knife because of the attention snapping it open is likely to attract If anything that s the only downside to it it looks as useful as it is Don t be surprised if you get a is that even legal reaction 
5 0 LOVE IT I have had this racket for about two years My racket has just recently broken though and it sucks I would advise you that if you do end up getting this racket to not let anyone but yourself use it for it MAY break 
4 0 Nice and Solid This is a really nice bench for the money Easy to put together The only drawback is the lat attachment is a little noisy Otherwise a good investment in exercise equipment 
5 0 Great Product I looked everywhere for a good bench at a decent price This has every thing that I was looking for and the price was great It is very sturdy and well made Thanks sooooo much 
4 0 Looks Nice Easy To Use Wears Down First this style board is much nicer looking than the other It sits in my corner and doesn t draw much attention Second it s very simple to use and helps condition balance It s fun too why sit and watch TV when you can be on this Sounds goofy but it s good stuff Last the only downfall is that the base has a sand paper like finish to help it from slipping on the roller This is a good idea but it wears down after several months However you can fix it pretty quick with stick on sand paper or skateboard grip tape 
5 0 Delivers Quality and Good Value OK so let me start by saying that I am a little older than middle age and I am not training for a marathon I bought this jogger for running in the 30 40 minute range a few times a week I was a little concerned in that there is a whole series of joggers in the 300 and up category but I thought I would try this model I have only used it a few times but find it to be very functional and meets my needs precisely I have nothing to compare it too but it does assemble easily and tracks smoothly I think the documentation could be a bit better but that is a very small gripe The jogger arrived within a few days of my ordering it even with Super Saver shipping I saw some consumer report complaints of joggers that would not track straight and I can definitely say that this one is just fine It pushes smoothly and has adequate room for your feet when either running behind or alongside I am sure that there are some qualitative differences with the really expensive ones but I would definitely say that if you want a good jogger and a good value this may be the one you are looking for For a jogger who is out there several times per week but maybe not training for a marathon this seems to be an excellent choice 
5 0 Good jogging stroller for a decent price I did a lot of reading about all the major jogging strollers I do about 50 miles a week and also own a BabyJogger which I also like very much This one was for our vacation home so I didn t want to spend another 300+ for an item I would only use part time I also didn t want the size of the B J which is quite long and too big for our little beach condo But I wasn t sure what to expect for a cheaper jogger I have to say this has been a wonderful item It is just as light as the B J which is a real help since we also have to carry it up and down steps and moves almost as easily The built in drop down rain shield is a real help given Miami s frequent showers and fast changing weather The sun bonnet is huge very important with all the harsh sun down here It is very comfortable to run or walk with and maneuverable enough that we even use it as our regular out and about stroller It assembled easily and folds up pretty well yes you have to remove the wheels which is a pain but not a big one The fully adjustable handlebar is great esp since my partner and I are about a half foot different in height About my only complaint is that they cheap out and make you pay an extra 13 for a storage net underneath and don t even really have one to fit this model this is a silly omission for any item aimed at serious or even semi serious runners But all in all we re very happy with it the price is right and it s competitive with the Baby Jogger The B J is definitely faster but not much I would definitely recommend this model if you want a high quality jogger and budget is any consideration 
4 0 Love them absolutely works but tears up too This is a great product for the price and it absolutley works on carpet it holds your paws down with sufficient friction and you can do a pretty good practice on or off the mat Of course it is better ON the matt for added stickiness but off the mat you have to think of knee support without the matt It does get warm wearing them for a whole practice Also they do tear up as in the blue little bits and pieces of the glove start falling off I do however recommend it it s a great little yoga accessory and very handy for travel hotel room asanas 
5 0 Pleased with Yoga Paws Purchase I gave the Yoga Paws as a gift They have since been used in an apartment setting with excellent results Fit was good Shipping time exceeded my expectations 
5 0 Love Cathe I love all of Cathe s DVD s this is not for the beginner this is definetly an advanced workout Her cues are right on and as always she is movtivating 
5 0 Our Tailgate Chairs We have not used our red sports chairs as yet because we bought them after our football season Some people had these chairs at the Rose Bowl and they really looked comfortable and they were the right color so we asked where they got them and they said their daughter got them online So we can t wait for football season to start again so we can use our chairs 
4 0 just started seems to work but get a mat to roll If you purchase this wheel you should get a yoga mat to roll the wheel otherwise you can can seriously hurt yourself if you try to roll it like the bodybuilder on the box You really feel it working on your abs and shoulders with the mat I bought it because it was very inexpensive portable and easy to store This is an excellent piece of equipment that can be used alone and or if you work out in a gym 
5 0 Bernadette s Choice On a Roll Home I find On a Roll Home extremely easy to follow because the instructions are simple and step by step There are also great pictures to illustrate the movements I find that the roller exercises not only increase my core strength the area around the center of your body front back but also help keep me flexible and improve my balance I am a 57 year old female I had breast cancer and lost some movement in my pectoral area There was a particular exercise Snow Angels in the book that increased my flexibility An added benefit is that I feel very relaxed and focused when I concentrate on doing the movements 
5 0 Bought this as a gift for my 15 year old nephew he loves it He is always into air time snowboarding or skateboarding He loves this toy 
5 0 Cool product i used this product last weekend and thought it worked well steve and i were able to compare our jump time to each other though i wish we didnt have to share the air pod meant loaning it to him after every run a lot of people on the mountain liked it and had never seen anything like it 
5 0 This thing is SICK I tried out the AIR POD last weekend on my first trip to the mountain this season I never heard of Tech4O before but they have a nice site with some other really cool watches and stuff on it I m still not sure how it works but it is so cool AIR POD can tell the exact second you leave the top of the kicker and measure your airtime until you land Me and a friend of mine had a little comp to see who was going bigger off the same kicker and the most air I was able to get was 3 45 seconds Even when we didn t totally stomp the landing or washed out a little bit the AIR POD still recorded our air time perfectly The strap was a lot more comfortable than I thought it would be and the light made it easy to check my air even when it started to get dark The last couple of seasons all I did was hit the rails and boxes in the park but those got old Getting an AIR POD really makes getting bombing the mountain for huge airs fun again I m defintely gonna keep it my bag with the rest of the stuff I always bring to the mountain 
5 0 Comfortable This bag is awesome everything fits and I m a girl so I stuffed the bag up My camping fit and all my clothes camping gear towel everything i only wore a spare bag for my money and things i wanted to have handy and thats it excellent bag I highly recomme 
5 0 Great Bag for The Money I was very satisfied with this backpack I took it on a vacation and had no problems at all A great bag for the money 
4 0 Great backpack for a big notebook The backpack is great By far the coolest you can get for a 17 notebook On the down side it doesn t exactly fit any 17 I had to adapt it to my brand new Dell which is a little bigger than average 
5 0 Gray Lexan Wide Mouth bottle The bottle is durable and a good size Its also easy to carry around much easier than those big nalgene bottles Good for travel at work or at school Im pleased with the product 
5 0 Great Design This Nalgene is a great size not big and bulky like the 32 oz bottles The mouth is just as wide though preventing the glug glug glug effect of smaller mouths when full It fits in virtually every cup holder 
5 0 Comfortable and effective I started swimming about 6 months ago to get in shape Pool chlorine really bothers my eyes even a little exposure will cause hours of discomfort I tried 10 or 12 different goggles in a variety of sizes and styles For my face the Hydrospex is the most effective It keeps ANY water from reaching my eyes all of the others leaked to some degree regardless of price or configuration My 10 year old swam competitively this summer and she also tried quite a few alternatives before settling on the Hydrospex Jr These Speedo goggles have stood up to 5 7 swims per week for 5 months now with no signs of wear The headband stays adjusted the gaskets form a great seal around the eyes and the anti fog feature is a nice benefit I ve dropped them in the parking lot and they ride around in my workout bag continuously as I swim at different locations on different days but they still look new I ve bought a 2nd set in case I ever manage to lose or break these I don t want to be without them Just a note some of the other goggles that I tried were also Speedos and others were also respected brands but the Hydrospex are by far the best fit for my personal facial shape Be aware when selecting goggles that each design will fit people differently It doesn t make a particular brand or model good or bad it s just what works for an individual Shop around and try different styles until you find what works for you Once you find the right fit you should experience no leakage or discomfort For me the Hydrospex are just the right ones 
4 0 Hydrospex Swim Goggles I really like these goggles They work well to keep water out of my eyes and the tinted colors helps with seeing underwater I highly recommend them 
4 0 Sharp Product Great Price on a sharp tool we use to trim the root ball on Japanese maples 
4 0 Golf head covers I like the head cover quality and appearance The only slight negative is that the covers fit a little more snuggly than I would like need to work them over the head a bit and my fairway woods are the old Haig Ultra s that are quite small This is not bad though and I will get use to it and they will probably loosen up 
4 0 Great big umbrella for the price Not so sturdy built This umbrella has an excellent cost benefit ratio It s big enough for the days of heavy rain and or for two or three persons the color is great because it looks diferent from most umbrellas the material is good also The only complain i have is that it is a little loose in the ends so it is kind of easy to have one of them out anyway they are also easy to put on the rigth place 
5 0 neat little gadget This does a far better job on milkshakes than the regular blade Was worth the price 
5 0 Makes Super Smooth Shakes Oster has made great products for Years This special Blade makes Smooth and Creammy Milk Shakes Just like I used to drink as a Kid I use this blade on a 1950 s Oster model 448 Bee Hive Blender This is a great addition from Oster 
5 0 Deluxe Hockey Set We bought this for my boys age 7 10 for Christmas and they absolutely love it They have been playing street hockey with it and it is perfect for their age We like it so much that my husband I went out and bought us some hockey sticks to join them 
4 0 Hockey anyone The delivery was fast with this item I had found this item at other sites but was not able to purchase it as they were out of stock The set is good for younger just starting hobbyists I found the net slightly awkward to put together alone The only thing I saw wrong with this whole transaction was that the package came delivered to the front door and you could see exactly what the product was by the pictures on the box This was a Christmas present and thankfully I got to the door first 
4 0 Good These darts were not to bad the barrel on them where a little big though

5 0 Aqua Fitness belt works well I bought the aqua fitness belt to wear while snorkeling Since I am not a strong swimmer it helped me stay afloat so I could concentrate on seeing the beautiful fish and coral reef off the shores of Belize It worked beautifully and I am very pleased with my purchase Delivery was prompt and I was able to track the progress of my purchase 
5 0 they LOVE this our kids have a blast with this great way to entertain a bunch of kids 
4 0 Works fine chairs a little small for larger folks Table is good quality and size for putting inside a tent room Chairs are a little small for full size adults but will do the job Good quality materials and workmanship and price is good too 
5 0 great stretch strap My personal trainer recommended this one and I really love it I m at an age that flexibility is non existent and trying to maintain range of motion is a high priority Pilates stretch bands lost their elasticity or worse yet snapped and hit me I ve even maneged to break tubes This seems more likely to last and consistently allows for increasing range of motion 
4 0 Works good as a key ring Knife blade very functional Don t know yet how well the blade will hold an edge Carabiner seems well put together One more small straight slot screw driver would have been nice Internal opening needs to be about 3 4 wider to form a better handle I really like the finger contours A hole at the base would have also been nice to secure keys from sliding up and down the gate maybe in place of the bottle opener Overall I like it and carry it everyday as my key ring 
5 0 Whee Pod Rear Bike Carrier I really like this rear carrier I have bought 3 of them One for me and two for friends We all love them 
5 0 Jr Clubs Great Quality at a Great Price The Jr Golf Clubs exceeded my expectations in quality They are excellent clubs at an excellent price They are top quality I received the clubs very timely and couldn t wait to give them to my son as a gift Definately a great bargain and I never had to leave the house 
5 0 Schwinn IC Elite I knew I would like the bike as I ve been using an identical one at the local gym Ordering and delivery was fast and painless Assembly was simple Then I was disappointed to find severe vibration at low speed which I thought might be the same as that noted by a previous reviewer flywheel problem The bike was useable but clearly not right I contacted Schwinn directly who were helpful but did not seem all that knowledgeable about the bike or its problems They immediately offered to set up a tech visit to fix it but called back the next day to say that they have no techs in this area New Mexico and that the only solution was to return it to Amazon I said I d see if I could diagnose the problem first which not surprisingly they thought was just fine After removing the chain guard the problem was obvious The chain was so tight I m surprised it hadn t snapped Poor quality control on the assembly line Adjustment of chain tension at the flywheel end is fairly easy and cured the vibration Hopefully there will be no more problems CONCLUSIONS These are great spin bikes and seem well made but quality control may be an issue One of two IC Elites at the local gym had a warped flywheel on delivery a manufacturing rather than assembly fault presumably In contrast ten older Schwinns have had few problems The lack of any service availability here makes me wonder how easy it will be to get warranty work done if needed I guess I should ask 
5 0 3 years old and still considered a great purchase I initially purchased a Velocity spin bike because of its lower price about 150 less but after a few weeks of buyer s remorse it was back to the bike shop to exchange it for the Schwinn IC Elite This bike offers an amazingly smooth and stable ride which is well worth the extra money I also appreciate its extra features I ve only had to use the emergency brake twice but both times I was happy to have it Just check the specs of other indoor cycles and you ll be amazed at how many do not offer a standard emergency breaking feature When you re spinning a 25 40 pound fly wheel you really need the ability to make sudden stops in the event of an emergency Having an additional water holder is great because I always drink at least 2 while riding and I don t want to have to stop mid ride to reach for another drink Many indoor cycles offer only one if any and aren t built to accommodate add on holders I ride using the adjustable foot harnesses which are comfortable and sturdy I haven t used toe clips with this model It s a comfortable bike overall but I do question the 4 11 compatible user size I m 5 3 and could use an additional half inch forward adjustment However I ve found that I can compensate by using the handlebar s center protrusion when riding in a neutral position Shorter users should probably give the bike an in store test run to make sure it won t cause neck shoulder arm or back strain The specs also state that it s compatible for users up to 6 8 My husband is 6 8 and he is able to ride very comfortably without straining his back or knees The saddle is okay on its own but I prefer using a gel cushion cover for added comfort The seat width is standard so it was easy to find a suitable cover After 3 years of use my schwinn has held up perfectly without needing to be serviced It s a great product Highly recommended 
4 0 Comedy of errors but all s well that ends well I did my homework and investigated various brands and models of spinners in person I went with the schwinn ic elite because at the time of purchase it was be sold for less money than the model below it the ic pro I had originally planned to purchase the ic pro but that made no sense when the better model was cheaper I wanted a gym quality spinner that i planned to ride regularly and would not need to ever replace I read many reviews on amazon that talked about the equipment being good starter equipment and if the buyer actually wound up using it they d upgrade later That s not my style If I m buing it I m using it The ic pro and the ic elite are both built to last a lifetime I didn t order from schwinn because i would have incurred an additional charge for delivery and installation mandatory plus a hefty new york sales tax Had i ordered directly from schwinn who send a nautilus representative with the bike to put it together the trials and tribulations that followed would probably been avoided First amazon sent the wrong bike They sent the ic pro instead of the ic elite I had to request a replacement and a pick up of the incorrect bike I had to tip the delivery people to help me get the very heavy sturdy bike back into the box for return shipping The correct bike came a week or two later The bike comes mostly assembled and I had no problem putting it together It really just requires putting on the stability bars and pedals Unfortunately when I got on the bike which is supposed to be gym quality it provided a terrible ride The wheel seemed to wobble it was noisy and there was some sort of grinding going on which made the whole bike vibrate I requested a serviceman come out an fix it Customer service people were nice but somehow the service order didn t make it through to the service department for a few weeks I finally got a serviceman out and he said that the wheel and it s assembly would have to be replaced The wheel gets assembled in china and this particular job was faulty He ordered a new wheel be shipped to me and another ten days went by until the serviceman could return to replace the wheel We opened the box of the replacement wheel and found that schwinn had sent the wrong wheel Again they sent the ic pro instead of the elite New wheel ordered another couple of weeks to get service The wheel replacement did the trick and the bike rides like a dream I am now totally happy with my spinner Four stars instead of five because it took a couple of months to get happy with my purchase I purchased the it on April 5 Today is June 16 the red letter day that the bike finally works well For me the cost savings purchasing through Amazon was worth a couple of months of inconvenience I might have felt differently if it were winter when I d rather stay home and ride than go out to the gym 
5 0 GREAT for diaper rash on babies My family has used this product for YEARS 50+ years as a diaper rash for infants There is NOTHING that works better than this stuff I ve slathered it on my daughter s bottom when the diaper rash had broken down the tissue of her bottom to the point it was practically bleeding and within 48 hours the rash was well past the point of on the mend Obviously because it s packaged for veterinary use the company cannot comment on whether it can be used for humans however I ve taken it in to my child s pediatrician and been given the go ahead I ve even had my 70 pound boxer eat an entire tube of it with no side effects Yikes 
5 0 one of the best This is one of my favorites perfect fit nice details great cargo and water capacity 100 satisfied highly recomende 
5 0 Better than BodyGlide Great stuff for long distance hiking needs Truly believe that it beats BodyGlide 
5 0 Sportslick is the Best As a runner with heavy legs I always use a lube to prevent chafing I have used them all and this one works best by far If you read the ingredients you will find that it has an antifungal which helps keep away jock itch etc The product also washes off in the shower with soap and hot water 
5 0 No more blisters and no more athletes foot I had the worst trouble with blisters No amount of taping lathering on stuff etc helped For me this is the one I do ultra distances at a very slow pace can anyone really go that slow This lasts me until my next sock change I keep large tubes for the beginning of the race and small ones for my drop bags I also used to suffer from athletes foot but since I slather this on my feet in massive quantities now all the time no more athletes foot either just a side benefit to the no more blisters Give it a try and you won t go back 
5 0 Wilson ncode5 Tested before order Very helpful for players with elbow problems Great vibration dumpening 
4 0 Just what I expected I received the product in a timely manner and the chair serves it s purpose I can t wait to use it in Costa Rica 
5 0 Best Bang for the Buck It appears that Schwinn read about the minor problems sited in the numerous reviews of the older model 213 fixed every single one of those problems and added a walk through design I did a lot of research on line as well as going around to every large retailer and professional dealer in Nashville TN Based on my research and discussions I bought the Schwinn 231 sight unseen and have never been happier Granted I ve only had the bike for a month now but so far this bike compares quite well with bikes I tested that cost 2 5 times what the Schwinn 231 costs It is completely stable virtually silent and more importantly it s very comfortable I m a really big guy 6 3 and overweight And this bike fits me and my wife I just started working with an exercise Physiologist who has the top of the line expensive gear in his club Cybex LifeCycle etc The Schwinn 231 is the recumbent bike he is now recommending to his clients for in home use He even plans to add a few 231 s to his exercise floor If you re looking for the biggest bang for the buck in recumbent bikes my research and experience so far tells me the Schwinn 231 doesn t have any competition at it s current price point of 550 PS Cycle Sport and Fitness have the bike for 550 and free s h 
4 0 Swiss Army Knife Pouch The product itself was just what I wanted However they were out of stock and did not deliver in time for Christmas When advised that the item was not yet available I remarked that I would like free shipping if I could not get this item for Christmas I had no response one way or the other from the company I would be hesitant to purchase again from this company 
5 0 Sometimes you get more than you pay for I gave up trying to find a watch with both a compass and a thermometer since none of the temperature watches seemed to work well according to all the reviews I then looked at only watches with compasses plus the usual set of timers and alarms and stuff The Enduro seemed to be the best combination of cost and value My first day with it I was driving in an unfamiliar city at night on a poorly marked road and the compass helped me determine I was going the right direction Soon afterwards I found a route sign I have since used it kayaking to orient our group so that feature seems to work fine The rest of the features are as easy to use as any watch I have had and I doubt I am using them to their full advantage Also it s easy to read and I think it s one of the more stylish of this type of watch So I feel like I got more than my money s worth here Note that I have had the watch for only one month now so time sorry will tell But so far so good 
5 0 The ball is good The free pump is worthless The included pump has no real value You might enjoy playing with it in your bathtub The ball is well constructed If you need a pump consider the Yoga Exercise Ball Air Pump by ATAFA 
4 0 Mixed but pleased Of the 12 batteries advertised and ordered as such Vendor made a switch with out notitfying me Otherwise ok 
5 0 Ultimate Disc The package came on time It was packaged securely I was extremely satisfied with the whole process and have no complaints 
4 0 ULTIMATE FRISBEE DISKS I am very interested in frisbee and it makes the game so much more fun when the disk you are using works well and feels good to throw These disks definitely work well and I like the feel and weight balance They are not the best I have ever used but they are high on my list 
4 0 The Original This is an excellent all around disc The price i paid was great 7 and it s been lasting great 
5 0 Discraft The Best There s nothing more graceful than the flight of a brand new Discraft Ultra Star These discs are really fantastic no other Ultimate disc i ve played with compares 
5 0 Perfect disc I ve played with many different discs and the discraft ultra star is definetely the best I could throw this one much farther and much more accurately than the Wham O It also seems to spin very fast without effort It is easy to catch as well the rim is wide and curls slightly The material is tough enough to avoid getting too scratched firm enough to avoid bending and warpage and yet flimsy enough to not hurt your hand too much The price is also good most discs cost a few dollars more Conclusively if you re thinking which disc to buy stop thinking The discraft ultra star is the only one I would use whether I m playing a serious game of ultimate or a simple game of catch 
5 0 Best Ultimate disc This is by far the best disc that i ve ever thrown It has a nice rim size not to big so you can throw a much easier forehand The size is right on the spot It also has a real nice underside that is perfect for a nice nail delay The colors are also good since there is a nice range and the star in the middle looks sweet in the sunlight Much better than any whammo or innova Ultimate disc Highly reccomended for anyone that wants to play a good game of disc 
5 0 Great disc nice feel This disc is certainly the best I have played with It s rim is lower than those made by Frisbee which gives the disc a much nicer feel It flies well and the material is also good not super soft or thin so it doesn t warp easily but soft enough that it won t hurt your hands when catching a fast throw I recommend it for all players but especially those more experienced and Ultimate players 
5 0 Great Actually you can t judge this flashlite till you get your hands on one of them even in day light it working let alone in the dark it just lights and lights The batteries are quite expensive but the quality is great I love i 
5 0 WhoA Wet Willy At first I was regreting that I ordered this skateboard because I heard ordering online wasn t the best thing to do But when I got it and tried it out it was awesome and amazing It s a nice skateboard i m just learning right now but it s still great All my other friends who can skateboard said that the board was pretty nice and really worth it if i got it It s as good as the ones they get in the skateboard shops and pretty nice considering the price It s great Get it Great to use going across the UCLA campus and what no 
5 0 World Industries Wet Willy V2 Complete Skateboard I ordered this skateboard for my niece for Christmas and I was very pleased with the product It was packaged well and appears to be a very well made and sturdy skateboard After Christmas my niece told me that her friends who are skaters said that this was a very good board and that she was lucky to have it 
5 0 happy child I bought this item for a Christmas gift and after he opened it he was thrilled and it was hard to get him off of it to open the rest of his gifts 
5 0 The 21st Century Flashlight For the past couple of decades the only real name in pocket flashlights was Maglite s MiniMag Used by police and professionals alike even honored with design awards the MiniMag pretty much ran the show since it s introduction in 1984 Sure the light output was just decent and the beam focus feature was a gimmick no one really used but for a well engineered flashlight it couldn t be beat Until now It s the classic David vs Goliath tale the Fenix P1D CE is small even on a small flashlight scale keyring small silly small picture a cylinder roughly half the height of an aluminum soda can with the diameter of a nickel that s the kind of small we re talking about here It doesn t even look real the size combined with the perfectly smooth and exquisitely faceted exterior gives the impression that this is perhaps a 1 2 scale mock up of an actual flashlight The disbelief continues as you remove the Fenix from it s slightly larger than a cigarette pack box The P1D CE without a battery weighs in at 27 grams or the weight of 27 paper clips More precisely that s less mass than an iPod Nano That s less than one ounce But the feel is without question the cold and unyielding touch of heavy gauge Type III aluminum and the lens is not just actual glass but perfectly flat and coated optics grade glass The size might not be serious but the engineering certainly is Yet all the dimensional absurdity is just the prelude to the light itself this is where the real ridiculousness begins The light is phosphor white similar to an HID car headlight in color but plainly speaking there is more of it than is physically possible from an object this size It would make more sense if someone were standing behind you with a spotlight or perhaps if the Fenix were nuclear powered The P1D CE produces more than twice the total light output of a 4 D cell full size MagLite Point the Fenix at the ceiling of an unlit room and the area is lit with more ambient light than a 15 watt light bulb License plates and street signs hundreds of feet away blaze to life in the night Shine it in your eyes and you re legally blind for the next twenty seconds That is of course unless you turn it down As if the Fenix engineers weren t content with an alien technology light source the P1D CE also includes modes which give you a range of lighting options You probably don t always want to walk around with the flashlight blazing full tilt so there are low medium and high settings Twisting the head of the flashlight turns it on and twisting it off and on again moves it into the next mode There s also strobe mode which flicks the light on and off quickly for a stroboscopic effect and SOS allowing you to send an emergency signal automatically without further touching the flashlight at all And all of this is powered by drum roll one battery No fumbling with giant family packs of box store batteries just to get some light a single 123A lithium battery sold overpriced at your local store in the photo batteries section find them online at less than 2 each powers everything Battery life varies wildly between the modes low mode will net you over 10 hours while high can suck the cell dry in less than an hour But the key here is intelligent circuitry Unlike flashlights of old where you could determine battery life by how bright the light was Fenix employs a power regulator circuit no more slowly fading light over time leaving you to wonder if the flashlight is really as bright as it could be the P1D CE is just as bright as when the batteries were first installed for nearly all of the total runtime That means that on the low setting the ninth hour and beyond is just as bright as the first few minutes And since it s a lithium battery months of shelf time doesn t make a difference So what is Fenix s secret It all comes down to LED technology and the Durham North Carolina made Cree LED in the P1D CE is a fine example Just as you can buy an LED light bulb for your house which uses less than a tenth of the energy of an incandescent bulb the same concept works just as well with flashlights and people are starting to notice these super small super efficient LED flashlights are all the rage nowadays Police departments are actually doing away with the old full size Maglite and replacing them with newer and better mini LED lights of which the P1D CE is by a large margin the brightest and most versatile You re only 70 away from dumping your vintage incandescent antique and joining them Five tiny but beaming stars for Fenix s remarkable introduction to 21st century lighting technology Addendum What about the new LED MiniMag Maglite s new LED series of MiniMags have less than half the light output of the Fenix and their energy management circuit doesn t quite live up to it s name so the light gradually dims over time like most other flashlights LED MiniMags are also larger and heavier than the incandescent originals still use a plastic lens prone to scuffing and still use Type II aluminum that collects nicks and scratches over time Powered by regular AA cells and with no brightness options battery life is at most four hours until completely dead plus there s no polarity protection should you accidentally place the batteries in backwards the light will be destroyed The LED MiniMag is a definite improvement over the original but not quite on par with the Fenix 
5 0 Holy Cow I have bought from Amazon since 1998 and this is the first review I have done This light is amazing it literally blinds you It is brighter than all of my other LED lights and I have a few It is on my keychain and goes everywhere with me I like the bear claw you can easily remove the light from your keychain for use Go ahead and buy this one you will not be disappointed 
5 0 Another Milestone in LED Flashlight Development The light performs as advertised and noted in earlier reviews My sample comes from month 2 of production Early manufacturing issues seem to have been ironed out because I can t find anything negative about this light It is as bright on low as some very expensive 1x123 lights I bought only a few years ago They served me well but the Fenix is my new EDC When incandescent flashlights first were invented I m sure they were very expensive adjusted to today s dollars Design and manufacturing improvements eventually gave us the well made and reliable Maglites and similar from other companies that can be bought cheap on every street corner today Just several years ago a well made high output LED flashlight cost over 100 The Fenix P1D CE is a milestone along our path from that pricey beginning to the ultimate goal a pocket size light that has multiple output levels puts out tons of brilliant white light while never needing a new bulb and is affordable The P1D CE deserves milestone status because it is twice as bright and costs half as much while still being well manufactured compared to lights available right before its release Will the performance and price of LED lights continue to improve You can bet on it Right now though the P1D CE is the benchmark for this class of lights Buy it if you have the need and about 70 to spare Buy a rechargeable RCR123 setup to power it if the light will see frequent use If your service needs are more occasional then use standard 123 batteries Buy them for 1 1 50 each in bulk on the web instead of for 5 each locally 
5 0 The other reviewers have said it all almost The other reviews are on the mark this is a great little light I have other Lithium powered lights and this one may not be as bright as some of them but its so small I have no excuse not to always carry it I have only one bit of personal experience to add I ve have found that if you turn the bezel just past where it goes off maybe 1 8 turn past you can operate the light one handed just like a tactical light hold the front of the light inside a curled finger and press the back with your thumb for momentary operation This may be unique to my particular unit so YMMV 
5 0 Handful of light This is my favorite carry flashlight it hardly takes up any room no matter what pocket you put it in On the high setting it lights up a broad area that few lights of any size can match and I have a large collection of Luxeon based lights up to 5 watts and one K2 The K2 based light runs two CR123 batteries and tends to get hot which the Fenix doesn t Since it runs on one battery it s easy to tuck another battery away in case you really need a lot of light for a long time The strobe is very impressive looks like it s projecting 135+ watts The SOS is a little slow but it s usable When you get good at twisting it for on off you can one hand it without a lot of fuss by setting it for a minor twist If this is is a portent of the future I can t wait to see what other Cree based offerings come along from other manufacturers Highly recommended 
4 0 Good could be better I was expecting alot from this little light maybe too much As the owner of several hundred dollar plus lights I eagerly anticipated a light that promised to outshine them for only 70 Needless to say I was a little disappointed It doesn t seem any brighter than my HDS EDC U60 on high mode There s also a giant black donut that surrounds the hotspot I love all of my Fenix lights they re a steal for what you pay for them but honestly I was expecting a bit more than what I got On the plus side it s extremely tiny and lightweight the extra modes are neat although I generally only use the high setting it seems very well constructed and it looks nice I like clickies so the twist head bugs me a bit but I think the idea was to pack as much light into a small and affordable package possible At that it succeeds immensely If you don t own an ultra bright CR123A flashlight yet grab this one If you already have a nice light you may be a little disappointed by the hype 
5 0 big things come in little packages You will be amazed at how bright this little flashlight is I own several LED flashlights and this one beats them all hands down This beast is powered by 1 CR123a battery and has 5 settings primary maximum low strobe sos strobe Fenix claims a 50 000 hour life Cree LED My only gripes with the flashlight are It s rather expensive but worth every penny The holster is fairly cheap nylon elastic The unusual way to switch between settings Twist the bezel on to turn on the primary light twist it off and on again quickly to change to the next output and so on These are all very minor and have no effect on my rating It is a very top notch flashlight There are rumors about loose threads on the bezel which could cause water to leak but mine did not have this problem On a final note If you do purchase this flashlight you should also invest in a Protected RCR123a Kit it ll save you a fortune in battery cost Also if you plan to hook it up to your keychain get the natural color that way scratches won t show up so easily 
5 0 an amazing light for the price and more I ve been hooked on flashlights for going on four years and this light may be the ultimate culmination of flashlight development driven by the good folks at the candlepower forums I ve spent up to 350 on flashlights that frankly don t do what this one does namely offer an insane amount of brightness out of such a small package with three brightness levels and two strobe levels and an easy user interface making this little sucker work is a piece of cake I believe that the low output setting will offer something like 21 hours of usable light imagine some kind of disaster with the need to have a really long run time I m writing a few of my impressions because I had become burned out on flashlights until this one came along Imagine being out in a dark forest and you hear a sound you flash your light 75 yards down the trail you light up a bear and then you make a run for it It s got two strobe one fast one slow positions both useful in emergency situations where it s important to attract someone s attention this littls sucker will do it all and it literally disappears into your pocket or you can use the handy belt holder that it comes with what a bargain In case you were wondering I don t work for and having nothing to do with fenix other than owning two of their lights 
4 0 Zippo Handwarmer almost identical to a Hakkin Peacock I believe that the Zippo pocket handwarmer is made by the same Japanese company that makes the Peacock The Hakkin company of Japan The hole pattern on the top of the Zippo warmer has a hole patterm similar to the chimney on a Zippo lighter The Peacock has a hole pattern shaped like a Peacock and is more elegant The Zippo filler flask is ok but the one supplied with the Peacock is superior It is a funnel with a valve that fits on the fill area of the unit When the funnel is rotated 90 degrees the valve opens and fluid is inserted with no spillage Not so with the Zippo filler flask The bag for the Peacock is a drawstring closure where Zippo uses velcro The Zippo bag has a big Zippo label on it where the Peacock does not and is more formal I prefer the simpler style The Zippo bag is black while the Peacock bag is green shows less pocket lint than black The burners Both units share the same burner which Hakkin offers individually However the Zippo burner is stamped Zippo as is the base of the unit with a huge Zippo The quality of the Peacock Zippo is superior to that of the Jon E For the similar price of the units get the Peacock The Zippo is a close second due to cosmetics and accessories Also any brand of lighter fuel can be used you don t have to use zippo fuel 
4 0 Zippo Hand Warmer Works very well Long lasting Not as warm as I had hoped 
5 0 Quality product The pocket heater came quickly from Chelsea watch and worked great out of the package It s made in Japan and has a quality look to it that leads me to believe it will work for a long time It gives out enough heat to keep my hands warm and will last a full day or half a day depending on how much fuel one puts in lights easily and stays lit I love it 
5 0 Marvelous hand warmer Compared to other similar warmers I have used in the past this device shows typical Zippo quality and attention to detail Easy to fill using the included measuring device for half or full day warmth Easy to light with a color change heat detector on the cap to verify ignition And just as advertised produces abundant warmth for hours No leaks no problems just heat My wife loves it for her hands and even tucks it into the small of her back when she is extra chilly Highly recommended 
5 0 It works and looks like a much more expensive rower After having purchased an inexpensive piston rower which was not so bad by the way I tried in a fitness shop some magnetic rowers and I found them much better So I shopped around and I tried the Tunturi R30 The Kettler Coach the Fitness Quest Integrity 3000 the Water Rower the Lifecore R900 the Life Span and the Body Craft VR 100 I found that the Body Craft has the best value for money ratio It is built very well its ergonomics are handsome the workout is fantastic and the price is very acceptable I particularly like the position of the footpedals and of the handle bar which I think is perfect It also looks like it is very durable and it will last forever I am very much satisfied and would recommend it to everyone looking for a classy rower at a very honest price 
4 0 VR 100 Rowing Machine Bought this as a way to exercise through the Cleveland winters Easy assembly Have owned it for about two weeks Easy to work up a sweat Two negatives the fan is louder than I anticipated and there is no way to disengage it necessitating high volume of music TV while rowing Polar heartrate monitor does not report accurately when exercising Heart rate OK at rest but with movement it jumps all over Overall well worth the 699 let s hope it lasts 
5 0 Got me back to exercising regularly There aren t many exercise routines I can do without getting bored or hurt bad knees but rowing is reasonably low impact but great all around This machine is a great value given its variable levels of magnetic assist resistance on top of the basic air resistance It folds up nicely when you need the floor space runs smooth and isn t too noisy Best of all it got this lazy bones back to exercising regularly and after one month I can already feel the difference 
5 0 VR100 Rowing Machine Very easy to assemble and seems very robust There are a good spread of exercise levels from gentle to tough but evenly graded in between This machines action is very smooth the pull action is progressive and there s no whiplash of the belt on return The ergo s are perfect for me 5ft 7ins but a much taller person would also fit easily Can t fault the seat and it s great to have the cool air directed at you so all in all I would say this machine is a good buy and great value 
5 0 Nice product easy to install and to use Installation was a breeze Took less than 10 minutes from opening the box to installing the lock cylinders I finally used the ski rack yesterday and it worked great 
4 0 Good Solution at a Decent Price I found this product to be a good solution for what I needed it to do Carry my families ski s up to the slopes There s not a lot of noise from wind aerodynamic issues even at high speeds It holds the skis firmly in place and has a very easy to use open button close snap Although it may not be made of metal it s sturdy enough that nothing moves in it This was by far a better option that several other systems I found which offered too many parts not a whole lot of value for the price they wanted The factory installed ski rack which would have cost 300 was roughly the same size and was not as good a deal as this rack for my 2000 Dodge Durango In response to the previous two reviews I must note a few corrections Firstly the rack DOES hold two snowboards I tested it with two of my friends snowboards on my last trip In order for them to fit one must face down and the other face up one on top of the other The individual who posted that it does not obviously didn t think to try stacking them Second In response to the fact that the bar could simply be twisted you re joking right It would attract attention if an individual attempted to twist off the bar On top of that in order for them to twist off the bar they would have to break the board skis in the rack in the process and that would defeat the purpose would it not The only problem I had with this was the FM1 adapter which was required to install this carrier on my factory bars The instructions for assembly didn t provide any information for any vehicles besides imports Domestic cars are out of luck since this is a Sweden based company 
2 0 Thule 724 rack I recently just purchased this rack to haul at least 2 snowboards In the description it states that 2 boards will fit Well to my dismay I found that only 1 board will fit I am a big Thule fan and have bought a roof rack and accessories to haul my bikes plus kayak To me this carrier is not up to the traditional Thule quality I feel that it could have been made better and larger to fit what the description calls for 
5 0 Great inflatable bed strong comfortable and priced better than the competition We got rid of our standard Queen sized bed to make room for our kid and have wanted a replacement since I finally pulled the trigger after a lot of research and I couldn t have been more pleasantly surprised Let s face it buying an airbed is a bit of a craps shoot So YMMV even with this one but I m going to lay out my impressions The Good Sturdy construction Has held up despite being wedged against two chairs and on the other side a steel filecabinet It hasn t leaked yet though it did include a patch kit Fills fast with the included Air Pump I would say about 2 minutes Deflates fast using the pump to reverse air flow You can also pull the pump out Comfortable The pillow top has a nice feel and it is fairly firm Comes with a nice carry bag and really isn t too heavy The Bad The pump is a little loud Fill it up before you put the kids to sleep or dampen the sound with a pillow don t cover the pump For the volume you would think it would fill faster too Could use a more firm fill setting Cord could be a little longer Okay so the bad is pretty much picking for nits I d say that this easily rivals the queen Aero I ve used before at a friend s house For the price I didn t expect anything nearly as rugged and Aero had better pay attention to the new competition Even at the lowest prices I ve found for Aero the Wenger is a better deal And I ve seen mixed reviews on Aero quality All airbeds have faults and I m fully expecting this one to not last forever but with the repair kit it should be well worth the cost until I have to replace it For the money I was surprised at the quality of the construction Don t hesitate to buy it instead of the competition and have that spare bed for the holidays or emergencies I figured for sure it would spring a leak when it was rubbing against the steel file cabinets or the caster wheels on the chairs in my office 2 nights It s nice to be surprised by quality in a good way now and then 
5 0 My macaw fell in love This parrot horn is humorous well sculpted and a good size It never made it onto the bike as the macaw fell in love with it The company was a pleasure to deal with We received the horn promptly in a sturdy package 
5 0 Fit existing seat cushion perfectly It is so nice to find a product that fits exisiting products The 72QT marine cooler was hard to find this summer but Amazon had it It replaced an old cooler seat on our boat perfectly 
1 0 basic dog frisbee only lasted 1 throw before there were teeth marks only a couple more and it was destroyed I recommend JAWZ for dogs who love frisbee and are tough on them 
5 0 Card Shuffler The product was exactly what I thought it would be Does good Just wish there was better grade of models to choose from 
4 0 Stamina Electronic Mini Stepper The stepper is tough to use at first but that s probably because I m out of shape I ve used it several times but not on a regular basis The only probably I have is that it s hard to maintain your balance at times Otherwise it s a great little exercise medium for the price and I like it because it s small enough to put away anywhere 
4 0 Good item At first it was hard to get used to the stepper I started using the post of my bed to keep my balance and it worked much better I like this product It is small and easy to store It gives me a good workout when I am unable to make it to the gym 
4 0 Great price but a little hard to step This is the first stepper I bought and I don t know if they are all like this but it s a little hard to step on meaning I have to use all my might to get each step to sink down But it s convenient and the price is grea 
5 0 Well worth the price I live in a tiny apartment so this was perfect for my daily workout It s so small and compact I can use it everyday and then easily store it out of the way And the workout I can really feel the burn in my upper thighs I usually work out 30 minutes a day while I m listening to the radio It s perfect for anyone who lives in a small apartment or dorm And it s very well built too Like the other users have mentioned it does tend to squeak a bit but it wasn t enough to really annoy me especially with the music playing 
5 0 A Good Set of Weights sometimes simple is the best These adjustable weights are easy to increase or decrease The Velcro that attaches them is very nice because as compared with another brand I tried these are better because the velcro just hooks onto itself there is no loop or anything the strap has to go through in order to secure it in place For a person recovering from surgery and limited bending right now the less work to hook the weights in place the better A very good buy and less expensive than some of the others out there 
5 0 Good buy durable and adjustable weights These weights can be adjusted at 1 4 lb increments and they don t scatter little metal granules like the Bell wrist weights that I used to use You might consider wearing a thick old sock under them at the wrist cut out the toe to prevent chafing since the terry cloth lining is good but not at the harder edges 
5 0 One more for the collection I thought this was a great dagger and the blade was fairly sturdy to boot As a fan of Knight s Templar weapons I enjoyed this piece and was satisfied with my purchase 
4 0 daughter loves it My daughter bought this with a gift certificate she received She absolutely loves it 
4 0 could be better I got tired of wearing a wristwatch but still need to know the time so this is a good idea I bought the product as soon as it came out so I have used mine for over two years now I was attracted by the altimeter but have found that it is wildly unreliable either that or my desk is going up and down berserkly My desk is at an altitude of about 270 meters but I get readings everywhere from 240 meters to 350 meters I wrote to the company asking about it and their reply boiled down to Live with it Also the thermometer is usually very slow to react to big temperature changes It is very good for slight variations in places like a closed room but if you go from indoors to outdoors plan on waiting half an hour to learn the outdoor temperature The current weather display is always good for a laugh Overall I enjoy this but I hope their next model is better PS shortly after I wrote this review the clip broke and had to be replaced for twenty bucks May 2006 
5 0 Excellent aid but expensive This is an excellent club for grooving your swing After just a few practice sessions I was completely confident with the driver You learn the importance of tempo swing plane and proper mechanics The accompanying video is helpful in the appropriate use of the driver The swing tips video is also worthwhile There are lower priced alternatives however at a fraction of the cost Refiner Driver which is what I used to replace the Medicus after I accidentally damaged it 
5 0 Works Great This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have use it along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips I live a Florida skiing is far away The rack hasn t shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install Yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car 
5 0 Harbinger glove Works as advertised I ve only used them for about a month so far but they certainly make lifting much more comfortable I expect them to last for at least a year or two when they do burn out I ll most likely buy another pair 
5 0 Great glove Very good glove i love the wrist wrap it has helped my weak wrist i also feel my wrist getting a lot stronger I on the other hand have been using these gloves for weight lifting and they are great i get an excellent grip of the bar They are also pretty comfortable would recommend wouldnt expect anything less from HARBINGER 
5 0 Harbinger rocks Besides weightlifting I used them as wrist supports during computer work and they worked quite well Very durable 
5 0 A Wonderful At Home Workout To those who are new to step as I was don t get frustrated The footwork may seem very fast and confusing at first Just keep doing it the steps WILL come to you eventually At that point you will really begin to enjoy all that this series has to offer The longest of the three videos has a 55 minute running time I m amazed at how quickly the time goes The other two run for 45 and 35 minutes The Transfirmer series features CALM polished instructors accurate cueing good music correct counts adequate warmups and cool downs weights aerobics upper lower body work abs AND stretching in ONE pleasant session There is a thoroughness and consistancy that I have found to be missing from many other exercise videos My ONLY complaint is the bulkiness of the Transfirmer There s not much time allotted on the dvd to move it from one position to the next Because of its size and the rubber stabilizing treads you must lift it to move it rather than drag it This could be helped by placing handholds or holes on the sides units to make them easier to lift Once positioned it s also critical to make sure that the two units are joined properly so that you don t go flying I m getting quicker at this but I still miss the first few reps sometimes Please note that for maximum effectiveness you will also need to purchase a set of 3 5 and 8 lb dumbells I prefer weights with longer necks as many exercises require you to place the weights on your shoulders I ve tried many of the most popular exercise videos This one is BY FAR the best The claims are true Done as directed you will see and feel a noticeable difference in your muscle tone and definition after the first ten sessions 
1 0 Not for beginners In my personal opinion these tapes are cued extremely fast I had a hard time keeping up even after several attempts Grrr Very frustrating for a beginner seeking inspiration Very disappointed Pricey item down the tubes 
5 0 Firm up with the Transfirmer I finally caved in and bought the transfirmer system with 4 videos plus I bought jiggle free buns and arms to go with it I have been doing this program for about three weeks and can say that I feel FIRMER indeed I don t follow the meal plan that they suggest either and have almost lost one dress size and my clothes are fitting better The Transfirmer system is basically a step system If you have done step workouts in the past then you will have no difficulty becoming acclimated to the system However since this is a much higher step you will experience more muscle burn especially if adding weights Interlocking the two steps keeps the Transfirmer from sliding around during lunges like my old step did As someone else mentioned this is a very sturdy piece of equipment and I was impressed with the quality of it You can use it for any step workout The videos concentrate on getting the job done and are borderline boring at times The instructors don t offer the perky motivational conversation or explanations on how muscles are being targeted like Kathy Smith and Denise Austin This may be a plus though because after repetitive use that kind of chatty conversation can become annoying The exercises are heavy on lunges and squats with and without weights They also offer modifications to use until you can build up to your maximum level These workouts were refreshing because they mix and match low impact floorwork with step training and weight lifting So you never get that jittery feeling after jumping up and down for 45 minutes like with other step workouts One more plus is that these workouts do not take alot of space I gave this sytem five stars because I think it is offers a great approach for longterm fitness and diet 
5 0 Stylized Workouts The FIRM Supercharged Sculpting workout is a highly stylized workout with electronica artistically designed sets and a clean sleek mood This is a combination of traditional weight training with aerobics using the necessary TransFIRMer Most of the exercises are recognizable as traditional exercises like plank or sit ups and squats The lunges seem easier to do with the TransFIRMer although weights are used throughout most of the exercises to give them a little more edge The workout is followed by a brief stretching segment but if you want to totally relax there is a Bonus 8 minute Stretch Workout This set also includes two additional DVDs The FIRM Ultimate Calorie Blaster and The FIRM Aerobic Body Shaping If you have any issues with your knees you may need to try various workouts to see which ones you can manage I found the Ultimate Calorie Blaster DVD was hard on the knees The TransFIRMer was designed with multiple uses in mind and has 5 different configurations to take each workout to the next level pg 6 The TransFIRMer can be positioned in five different ways to increase the possibilities 6 TransFIRMer The green section can be used alone 8 TransFIRMer The blue section can be used alone 14 TransFIRMer The blue and green sections used together Side by Side TransFIRMer The blue and green sections placed next to each other Incline TransFIRMer The green piece fits into the blue piece for a convenient and stable incline You can adjust the intensity of the workout depending on how high you step pg 7 The workout booklet has some interesting rotation calendars so you can plan out 21 days There is also a section on healthy eating tips an eating plan 21 day diet plan list of 100 calorie snacks and list of 200 calorie snacks A substitution list makes the diet easier to follow especially if you are eating out and want to still keep to the diet plan For years I couldn t do the FIRM workouts because I kept forgetting to buy the equipment but now with the step at home I can try out most of the new workouts and have fun working out The 2 piece step is also easy to arrange and is very sturdy The low impact exercises work well with the step and the incline is used for push ups cardio arms and ab exercises If you are buying this step to also use with other workouts that use a step they say that is not recommended The Rebecca Review 
4 0 Beware of the footwork I have been using the Transfirmer series for three weeks now and have to say that while it has the potential to be a great product for me I have wasted my money I have been exercising regularly with personal trainers for four years and have excellent fitness so I am not new to rigorous exercise I thought I could save my money and use these DVDs at home instead While the weight portions of the videos are great the step and aerobic portions are difficult to follow What would make it easier to follow is if the instructors did more repetitions of the same move rather than constantly adding steps and switching back and forth between moves There is nothing in the DVDs to help you slowly and clearly learn the steps prior to beginning the work out Also the camera angles do not do anything to help a beginner learn the moves They claim the steps are easy to follow yeah right 
4 0 Almost perfect I m a lover of FIRM videos for a reason They are the best out there This series is no exception The moves are good and the music is great The only reason I didn t give this five stars is because the new TransFIRMer is large and somewhat difficult to move into new positions That said it s by no means a reason to not buy the system The new box allows for new moves that stretch and tone parts that the other boxes weren t able to get to Overall it s a good purchase 
5 0 What a workout I really like the setup that the Firm has developed The steps are versatile and the workouts can be pretty tough but fun 
4 0 Nice beginner board Purchased this for our 7 year old for his birthday He can handle the size of it fairly well with room to grow Hefty construction can hold my 200lb husband Graphic is an applied decal brightly colored and cool according to the 7 to 12 year olds at the party Wheels and trucks appear durable and have handled smooth and rough surfaces well Deck has agressive tape and concave surface both making for secure footing while onboard Overall an excellent value for the money I d buy it again 
4 0 What a great skateboard This skateboard I bought for my 13 y o son is awesome He says it s a really smooth ride and the look is really cool Also the price couldn t be beat I strongly reccommend this purchase 
4 0 Solid Product My son was very happy with this It is a perfect set up for the beginning skater 
5 0 Great backpack and style I would normally wear totes from abercrombie or hollister When I saw the black crazy dots I thought it looked really cool This is the best backpack I have ever found and I wish that I figured that out a long time ago Bit you know what they say it is better late then never finding that out Overall JanSport mad another great durable and cute backpace I reccomend it for anyone that needs a new stylish backpack 
5 0 awesome bag i use this bag while attending classes in college and it is perfect for all my needs 
5 0 Good Bag I always liked JanSport bags for their durability I bought one for my husband 5 years ago He uses it to go back and forth from work to rock concerts and when we go rock climbing 
4 0 A nice backpack I ordered this backpack as a temporary solution I thought it was cheap 20 item around 10 shipping but now I realize it isn t Maybe I will start with the negative aspect of the product Too simple only one big and one small compartments with the small one being the front pocket In addition The straps are small I am big but I see many larger people than me around and to be honest if you are aroun XL or XXL size it would be quite uneasy to put the backpack over a jacket as its straps are simply too short The good part it looks durable does the business and now I will keep it as a spare since I now have another one Not JanSport but sill the price somehow appears to be alittle too much for me For the same amount I gave I could find a real nice Adidas or Nike original ones back in my country 
5 0 Love Jansport This is the best I have always used Jansport backpacks they last forever 
5 0 Great Backpack This is a great backpack it has plenty of space for all my stuff 
5 0 Classic Backpack In these days and times backpacks bookbags etc have become so outlandish This is a classically styled all american backpack No bells no whistles just a good ole standbye bag Hard to find now a days 
5 0 Good sturdy pack I bought this pack for hiking I find all JanSport products to be of good quality I don t like lots of bells whistles on a day pack and this one is pretty basic It is a decent size to allow me to carry all my necessities and some extras but not so big to tempt me into over packing A larger pack would be preferable for a winter hike to carry bulkier items This pack is fully functional and if it lives up to previous Jansport packs I ve owned then it will be around for some years to com 
5 0 Jansport Superbreak Backpack The backpack was very good however it was packed in a box that was wayyyy to big and i have to incurred additional charges since it was shipped out of the US to the Caribbean I will really like it if you guys can send make your packages much smaller Thanks Remo 
4 0 geat brand for a great price This is a nice looking sturdy back pack for most elementary school children The only drawback is it s a bit small I bought it for my middle school son He loved it but could not fit all of his books and school supplies in it My fourth grader who is notorious for tearing up back packs uses it every day It s a perfect fit for him It is holding up quite well 
5 0 Butthead Cover Purchase The product was a big success at the going away party where it presented Only problem was I am a Military member living overseas and had to send the itme to a stateside address and then have them forwarded it to me lost time and a little Wish more products would be sent to APO s it s the same cost compared to a package sent to the house next you in the states so there is no excuse but the product was great would buy again 
5 0 Best workout system you can buy This is truly a revolutionary workout system It is fun easy to set up and use and offers a full range of workout possibilities from low to high intensity Highly recommended 
4 0 My Workhorse This recent purchase was for a gift I have had mine for about 2 years with almost daily use doing maintenance around my rural property yard work and equipment usage and maintenance It is very reliable under hot cold and wet conditions I use the low beam 3 LED most often However it does not take long for the light output of the 3 LED to get noticeably weaker using alkaline batteries The high output long range single LED seems to last longer even when the 3 LED light is diminished I ve switched to NiMH rechargeables which serves me better since I can charge the batteries often and not have to put up with using the weaker light output until I had close to exhausted the alkalines As for maintenance of this headlamp I occasionally wash and submerge the whole flashlight in a sink to clean the straps I wish the straps were removable so I can just put them in the washer Recently one of the 3 LEDs started to blink like a strobe light and then died I sent it back to Princeton Tec and they sent me a new one immediately I am quite pleased with this flashlight 
5 0 Authentic merchandise The scarf I received was absolutely what was ordered My husband a great Liverpool fan was thrilled Thank you 
4 0 Mens Cruiser Easy to assemble quiet and smooth with an acceptable single gearing it seems to be a great relaxing bicycle 
4 0 kaluna wahooie I bought this bike to have something to ride but not too often I changed out the handle bars and seat and I must say for the price it s a great bike The ssembly instructions were okay and the bike went together w o incident I would recommend this bike for someone not too serious about riding and doesn t want to spend too much So enjoy and ride on 
5 0 use it in my truck the bike meets my expectations It is well built and I get a good work out on it while parked in my over the road tractor trailer It fits between the bunk and the gear shift just fine I use a folding chair to sit on It s like riding a tricycle as compared to a bicycle when comparing it to a standard sized stationary bicycle I like it a lot 
4 0 Cardio while web surfing or watching TV Okay I am a geek I admit it I saw this at the local Brookstone store and had to have it I saw the box cover showing a guy using a computer with this under the table Burning calories and using the computer What could be better I tried out their floor model with one of their desks there It actually worked pretty well I decided to take it home and try Yes I am able to use the computer and exercise at the same time I use it in the morning before going to work I can browse the web for about 30 minutes while I use the mini bike It really does work pretty well The design is good on this thing It will tell you how fast your going as well as how many calories it thinks you have burned The screen is setup so you can easily look down and see it Its actually quite heavy which is good you don t tend to push it around Everything seems to be constructed well except for the straps that hold your feet onto the pedals They are made out a flexable plastic The floor model at Brookstone was already broke If you are careful I am sure they are fine I am sure someone tried to jam a pair of workboots or such into the floor model and destroyed it in the process 
5 0 the best This is the best bowl for camping and hiking I don t like eating out of aluminum but this is just as light and titanium is too expensive This is just the right size and it nests inside the Alpine cookset It also doubles as a small pot if you re heating something for yourself and works with the MSR handle I highly recommend 
5 0 excellent service the item arrived on time in perfect condition it was exactly as they said it would be i am pleased to say that i will definitely buy from this vendor again thank you for the excellent service 
4 0 Best Value Tent Purchased the tent as an upgrade for more space and comfort Haven t been camping yet but did set it up to make sure it was all there It was complete and also as exactly as described with plenty of space 
5 0 excellent outdoor backpack It has a middle volume but can contain many things It is very suitable for a short time outdoor use Although it just has two pockets a primary one and a mini one on the top it s enough It s very fast I believe it can never broken with a regullar weight 
4 0 Good pack for the money Took this brand new pack on a 3 night 4 day trip through the Sierras I had my sleeping bag and bed roll straped to the bottom and had a tent wedged between the front panel and the pack itself This pack was big enough to carry all the gear I needed for 4 days The trails had major climbs up and down trails carved into granite My pack weight was about 40lbs The pack held together great The extra lashing points on the front panel are handy when used with carabiners for small items such as water shoes flashlight sierra cup My only real gripe is with the two side mesh pockets They are rendered useless because the bottom adjustment cinch straps are on the outside of the mesh pockets and the only thing you can get in there is a flat map What I ended up doing was cutting two slits in each pocket and passed the the adjustment straps through the slits on the inside of the pockets That gave me the use of the pockets back In addition the mesh pockets have little to no elasticity With a full pack it was still tough getting an item such as Sierra cup in the mesh pockets and impossible to get a 32oz water bottle in there Anyway for the money this pack is a good deal I thought for sure this pack would ve been in shreds after the trip Well after inspecting it after the trip no rips no bad seams nothing torn or broken 
2 0 Good price but cheap quality Similar to the other reviewer my seams ripped the first time i used it I don t like top loading as well but it seems pretty common Would avoid and spend an extra 20 and get something else It does fit into carry on regulations however 
4 0 Quiet low impact exerciser This machine is more of a strider than an elliptical Its advantage over Tony Little s machine is the smaller footprint Nonetheless it beats sitting in front of the television No variable resistance is available Heart rate is measured on the grips Exercise cannot be performed without holding onto grips The readout gives calories cadence and speed The machine is very quiet and sturdy if you fit the weight limit 200 lbs or less I would not go higher as this may wobble It s big advantage is that it folds easily and fits under the bed to save space unless you need a clothes rack Not exactly for the advanced athelete but for a beginner or intermediate fitness fan This will more than fit the bill PROS Price Quiet Storable CONS Lack of resistance Not a true elliptical motion Not for the advanced fitness afficianado or triathelet 
5 0 Liked the first one so much bought this one too We have the original without heart rate monitor in our San Francisco apartment and love it Easy to set and convenient to put away when not using it A good aerobic work out without making a lot noise no complaints from downstairs and no need to turn the TV way up The include mat protects the carpeting and the wheels make it easy to move out of the way when done We have this new one in our house in CT Very solid and quiet to use just like the original The heart rate monitor is a nice upgrade Highly recommend this You can work out anytime no excuses and it takes up almost no room foled up Well built and seems like it will last a long time 
4 0 A good product at a good price I ve had by strider for about 3 weeks now and am very impressed The assembly was not too tough and the instructions were very easy to follow Total assembly time while watching the World Cup was about 20 minutes The machine itself is sturdy enough considering it folds up I am a 195 lb 6 ft guy and it works just fine for me It is very well designed so there are very few moving parts that could possibly break It is very quiet and the display is refreshing in its simplicity It tells you the time you have have been working out the number of strides your heart rate and an approximation of calories burnt That s it For those who complain that it does not give an intense enough enough workout you are looking at the wrong machine This is a strider not an elliptical devise meant for triathletes If you want a killer workout you will need a 900+ elliptical or join the local gym All I wanted was a machine I could pull out of the closet of my office and get in a 30 minute workout before heading home at the end of the day This suits the bill just fine 
4 0 Compact Durable Pros 1 This product is awesome if you don t have a lot of space 2 Solid steel frame 3 Very inexpensive compared to other machines 4 Reliable machine for starters 5 Easy to put together Con 1 No resistance Overall I m pretty impressed with this machine When the weather is horrible outside or when you don t want to head out to the gym this is perfect to have at home I get a pretty decent workout for what it s worth 
5 0 best stroller ever I recommend this stroller to anyone I have 2 boys 5 16mo Total I have bought 5 strollers and this one works the best my husband loves the height adjustable handle he is 6 ft 2 and the ease of folding it The stroller make turns like a sports car and goes over any surface with ease I had no trouble at the mall even with narrow asiles I wish I would have found a stroller like this 5 yrs ago I LOVE IT 
5 0 love it I really like this stroller It s just what we wanted and a great value It was no trouble to put together The only problems I had were trying to air up the tires and the straps that hold my son in could be padded to be more comfortable I really love the adjustable handle on this stroller It rides like a dream I like the cup holder on the tray for my son but my cup holder is too shallow to keep my water bottle upright I recommend this stroller 
5 0 I love this jogger This jogger is awesome I looked for a very long time and picked this one off of Amazon I love it The swivel wheel is great and has the option to make it stationary I love the extra pad on the seat My daughter can fall asleep easily in it and the ride is very smooth I would encourage anyone to buy this The handle is great adjusts to any level that you need The storage is big and I love the baby tray My daughter loves to nibble while we walk I love the colors too This is just a great stroller The only thing is that it doesn t fold as flat as I would like but that goes with the teritory of joggers 
5 0 So much fun As a competitive swimmer who goes through caps very quickly this is more than I d usually spend on a cap However I bought the pink purple cap and I love it It s nice and stretchy and still very sturdy and I like how I can change the color The only thing I could complain about is that the pink side faded some the first time I used it 
5 0 husband loves it I purchased this as a gift Several people warned me about ordering this product I am glad I did not listen My husband absolutely loves this item He is on a mission to raise his chest back to where it use to sit when we got married He has used it since Christmas and I am starting to see the difference I don t know about the previous brands put out as AB LOUNGE but this product is GREAT 
4 0 Great Raqcuet I am a 5 0 ranked player I was participating in a tournament yesterday and my head raqcuet was being restrung So i Go over to my club and get the Babolat Pure Drive Andy Roddick racquet And what a nice surprise Serves at least 20 30 miles faster Sweet spot is HUGE Volleys were nice Over heads awesome The only issue i had with it was the weight which i didn t feel while playing but now i have a sore arm Ill get used to it after i use it more If your a big server and a big baseline player then this is for you Volley s are alright no problems But if your big on the net game go for the flexpoint 
1 0 Not for doubles The Babolat pure drive Roddick plus was purchased recently by me on advice of my teaching pro I am a former Division III college player who now plays doubles only and found that this racquet does not have the touch of my previous Prince racquet The sweet spot is very small and it it not a good volley racquet If you are a high level USTA 5 0 player who hits the sweet spot consistently then this racquet may be for you provided you are a singles baseline player If you are a serve volley player skip this racquet 
4 0 Nice option This is the best training option from Polar You find here 90 of what do you need to run or ride looking for fitness improvement or serious training The IR interface is nice Once the watch itself is a little bit bulk is not a good option if you want it to daily use wearing shirts for example 
5 0 Great Tool I have had the S625X for almost 2 years and it has been fantastic I have tried several of the GPS based solutions and they are much less accurate because they loose signal and they take time to start The Polar software is also very stable and useful 
4 0 Almost perfect I ve been using this product for half a year now and am most happy with it Heart monitor function works flawlessly watch is comfortable to wear with clear display It also includes a bunch of useful features such as the different fitness tests and the link with PC where you can download training information and upload exercise sets What I am not so happy about is the accuracy of the foot pod Even though it has been callibrated carefully it deviates by 5 from actual distance run But I would nevertheless recommend this product over some the GPS based sets that some of my co runners have as these seem to be even much less reliable 
5 0 The tool for serious runners and everybody else Have owned this for 2 years and would simply not live without it Compare with previous HRMs this is both simpler to use in particular since all settings can be managed from the PC via the interface and a lot more fun Please notice S625X is really the jack of all trades as it can be used for both running biking as well as other sports swimming for example The distance measurement is fairly accrurate and certainly useful when pacing yoursel 
4 0 Awesome You do not need anything else If you are a frequent runner or want to train correctly for your next race this is the one The only thing it is a litle complicated you have to spend some time reading the owner s manual It has so many functions Don t get me wrong Easy to use once you know how to do it 
5 0 nice little knife bought this knife for a friend it is small and sharp but mainly bought it for the looks very bright and colorful though i think this would ware away pretty fast if was put to much use 
5 0 Handy Sleek little knife I m mostly a kitchen knife collector but was so impressed by Kershaw Shun Ken Onion that I decided to try a style of knife sport that is his usual forte I m just as impressed with the design of this knife as I was with the Shun Onion knife It s compact it s attractive and sharp enough to shave an arm with I have the rainbow chive and I am still amazed that as much as I ve used it the surface and coloring is still intact and gorgeous I m now a believer in Speed Safe and have my second Ken Onion leek on order 50 dollars for a small pocket knife I hear people complaining Absolutely it s well worth the price but anybody who knows knives knows that the truly good ones are never inexpensive and last a lifetime You get what you pay for and this one is well worth it 
5 0 Knife Novice My first Kershaw knife But not my last In fact my second Kershaw has already been ordered Blown away by the quality of this product Extremely smooth operation Outstanding fit and finish Sharpest knife right out of the box I have ever purchased SWEET 
4 0 Good knife could have been a little better I like this knife very much it s size shape fit in the hand and pocket clip are all just what I wanted It has a nice edge and the Speed Safe assisted opening feature is fantastic My only complaint is that the safety is placed in such a way that makes one handed opening difficult with the safety engaged I want the safety engaged because the assisted opening is so easy to activate and I don t want the knife springing open in my pocket This is only a minor quibble though I do enjoy the knife very much it is a good size to wear with jeans for light duty day to day use which is what most people need a pocket knife for anyway I use a different larger knife for heavier duty use 
5 0 Great buy on a great pocketknife It took me a long time to accept the notion of paying more than 10 bucks for a knife This is a great deal though Very very smooth opening and closing action keeps an edge very well and is shipped to you super sharp already What I really like is the ability to keep it on you almost all the time since it is very small and light You have to be careful opening and closing it the first few times though read don t buy this for your Cub Scout Overall definitely the best deal I ve seen in this price range 
5 0 Deceptively Effective This knife is wonderful I m one of the last people to get something that looks this girly but there was something about it that appealed to me It looks cute and innocent with the pinkish rainbow sheen mine has a lot more green and blue than the picture but it s wicked sharp Since it is spring assist it opens lightning quick and can be deployed instantly for opening boxes or what have you I like carrying mine with the pocket clip but it comes with a safety lock so you can carry it in your pocket without fear of having it accidentally open Very essential for the times when I m wearing dress pants and can t have a knife showing It is very small though It is perfect for kids or someone like me who has very small hands Though I do have problems opening the knife with the thumb stud It s just small enough that my thumb will slide to intercept the edge of the blade Fortunately it has index opening and with one flick of my index finger I can open it I carry larger knives in my jeans pockets on a daily basis but if you need something discreet and stylish you can t go wrong with the Ken Onion Rainbow Chive It certainly looks inconspicuous but it s incredibly useful for many applications 
5 0 Perfect Pocket Knife Even though it s a relatively inexpensive pocket knife I poured over reviews compared the more trendy Benchmade Spyderco Kershaw knives and went over every option on the Swiss Army Why not the more expensive knives Because I wanted a compact knife with more than one blade I also wanted a more options than they had to offer Yes I d be a lot cooler carrying the lastest Spyderco or Benchmade but I m about practicality I was a little concerned about how well it would hold an edge The more expensive knives have a stronger denser carbon based steel but it comes at a cost They re a little more prone to rust I read up on the Victorinox and although it might be a slightly softer metal it is virtually impervious to rust It being a compact folding knife with multiple blades that I plan on using outdoors quite a bit this was a concern So far I ve used it quite a bit and it remains super sharp as the day it arrived and of course absolutely no rust stains or discoloration I chose the harvester over other Swiss Army Knives for the following reasons I wanted the silver metal exterior with the texture not the slick red plastic that tends to scratch The silver also makes me feel like it is more durable and looks much more expensive The small pruning blade I use this one most often The hook shaped point of this blade makes opening anything very simple The saw wow The teeth are extremely sharp and arranged in such a way that they rip thru wood I tested it on a scrap piece of 1 2 plywood and even though you can only make small strokes it wouldn t take long to saw thru a decent size limb The awl is perfect scratching a starter hole for nails and drill bits The overall size of the knife is not too small and not too large You barely notice it in your pocket The overall build quality is excellent You feel like you re getting more than your money s worth The only feature I sort of miss is the lanyard attachment It s available in other knives but it s a tradeoff in size and options that were important to me That s my review I use the heck out of the thing and am extremely happy with it You will be too 
5 0 Great basic little knife Bought this knife so I d have a good quality basic knife to carry around while I m camping I didn t need some Rambo style knife for that so the combination of the features quality and price of this knife really fit the bill Unlike many other small knives this one has a very substantial solid feel to it Very happy with this purchase 
5 0 A Good Looking Knife I have several of the swiss army knives including the 4 5 inch Trekker and a Fieldmaster Both those knives are great but too hefty to be in your pocket all day However this knife is what I was looking for as a daily knife to carry around with me It feels extremely solid even more so than the Trekker The blade is sturdy and the quality of the construction down the spine of the knife is seamless It has significant heft for a 3 5 inch knife and it would take a lot of torque to bend the blade even a little The knife looks great I much prefer the color and grip material over the black of the Trekker or the classic Red This will be my first choice for a knife to carry on me while hiking To sum up if you are looking for your first Swiss Army knife or one to carry with you hiking or day to day I recommend this one over all others The only thing it is missing is a Phillips head screwdriver but beyond that you would do well purchasing this knife 
5 0 The Best Sport Wiffle Ball is the best in the world I play it everyday Im on a real wiffle ball tea 
5 0 Great Towel but not sure of the usage I did not purchase these from the above seller but I did come across a pair at the local salvation army It looked like they had been used to wipe away tears but had held up pretty good They were really yellow though I thought they would be more gold colored 
4 0 Green Nylon Lanyard I was hoping for more of an around the wrist type Lanyard but this is around the neck and the clasp was not to my use I needed it for the use of carrying around USB Flash Memory but the clasps where to large to fit into the holes made for smaller Clasps I would say these are still nice for the gym teachers and ref s out there that need them for the whistles 
5 0 I love this mat This is the perfect mat for my Power and Hot yoga classes It s sturdy with the right amount of thickness especially on your knees It lays flat without the edges rolling up I m 5 7 and appreciate the extra length I ve been practicing Yoga for a year and have purchased 4 mats during this time This one is my absolute favorite I won t go back to the others 
1 0 Too slippery I couldn t wait to get this upscale yoga mat At first glance it looks like it is great quality and offers tons of stability The problem is it is way too slippery I can t hold a downward facing dog without having to adjust all the time and forget about holding a lunge I finally just threw the mat to the side and finished my yoga on the carpet 
5 0 Love the Hugger Mugger Yoga Mat I m only 5 ft 9 inches but I always seem to fall off the edges of a mat during classes This mat really keeps my attention on the class instead of repositioning so much The extra thickness is great I see other people doubling their mats to get the extra cushiness 
5 0 I Haven t Slipped Yet I have had my mat for two months now and I am totally in love I get sweeaty palms during practice and down dogs have always been tricky to stay put As of yet I have not budged one centimeter during any posture Amazing The mat is very thick and heavy A bonus for us with stonger vinyasa and ashtanga style practices It feels very stable with enough give without being mushy I love this mat so much I am going to buy one for my husband We both tend to dig holes in our mats from jump backs No nicks or holes yet A friend of mine has had hers for a year and still loves hers too I highly recommend this mat to any serious yogi or yogini 
5 0 Mandara Yoga Mat The mat is awesome It provides great support better than the other yoga mats that I have used It s thicker for better support unlike the thinner mats 
4 0 A lot of fun with small expense Living in the Puget Sound begs for time spent on the water However being a frugal sort of family we re not likely to ever purchase a real boat We found a good price on these fun little items and have been enjoying the water all summer How do they size up they float well grin they paddle OK the blow up quickly with a hand pump they pack nicely in our car two of them and they store nicely on a shelf in the garage That is just what we were looking for We take our two girls with us when we go and the eldest seven now can paddle the kayak by herself with one of us in the boat of course if we let her You won t find this to be a replacement for a real kayak don t even think that way or you ll be dissatisfied But think of this as an economical way to get more time on the water and you ll be thrilled OH and prepare to get a little wet there s no drain and you re sitting in the BOTTOM of it Does restrict it to the warmer days AND the clips to store the paddles aren t very helpful and get in the way while you paddle Design issue you know 
4 0 Strips and loads fishing spools Overall I think this is a good product that does just what it promises helps you to easily spool line onto your fishing reels under the appropriate tension This will keep your line tight on the reel maximizing the amount of line it can hold and preventing line from digging into the spool under the load of a fish I would point out that the instructions attached to the bottom of the unit are lacking when it comes to spinning reels and do not mention or illustrate that you can and should rotate the spool holder bracket 90 degrees so that your spool is facing sideways to your reel You also should flip the spool of line on the bracket if it looks like the line is coming off twisted instead of loading smoothly Most good fishing lines come with instructions that explain this process that is specific to spinning reels The battery powered line stripper has worked fine for me on heavier trolling line 30 50lb but I haven t used it on thinner lines yet The instructions and product descriptions do not mention it but on my model the line stripper also has a revolving sharpening stone protruding from the end for honing hooks a nice added bonus This exact stripper is sold separately on Amazon com under the name Berkley Pocket Line Stripper Hook Honer look it up for a closeup photo and more details The package I received came with two spare orange rubber wheels for the line stripper but it also came with two black rubber grommets on the spooling bracket that are not depicted or used anywhere in the instructions illustrations or on this unit and they have to be removed to insert the bracket into the base Not sure what s up with that Lastly everything breaks down and stores together so it can be hung on a wall until needed Set up takes only seconds 
5 0 wow I just bought an acrylic sphere and this dvd and i was blown awayat how easy it is to learn how to do things that would literally seem impossible I find it kind of like a mix of magic juggling and dancing all thrown into one I would highly sugjest buying this it is entertaining to watch and even more fun to learn 
5 0 great fun Fast paced video is fun to learn with fun to watch I went from knowing a couple of tricks to performing 8 10 in a few weeks with this video You will find yourself doing things you didn t think possible very quickly with this one The performances are fun and inspiring There is a wide variety of skill levels displayed so whatever level you re at you can find something for you on this video 
4 0 Stretch This is a good item for limited exercise Easy to use Kinda like minimalist Yoga Like all exercise equipment if you don t use it you lose it 
4 0 Don t toss kick or throw I was a little surprised at the warning when I first read the instructions but once you fill the MEGA ball with Ice you really won t want to toss kick or throw this thing anyway It s 9lbs when filled Plus the plastic is hard and I imagine would crack of you drop it on another hard surface or worse it would crack bones in your foot if it landed on it Even so it was great fun passing and shaking the ball We used the Strawberry Rival ice cream mix packet along with a mixture of heavy cream half and half and milk YUMMY Took 30 minutes total to freeze I would recommend the smaller ball for smaller children to help with even though that is 7lbs filled still a bit heavy 
5 0 It does work I got this ice cream ball as a gift It has been a great success Fun to use really works 
5 0 Really fun I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and we have been making ice cream ever since It s great for him and his roommates and when they have friends visiting The ball works very well and its really easy to use and clean I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys ice cream or having fun 
4 0 I wish it was bigger Worked great for the kids The only problem we had was that is wasnt enough All three of my kids fought over the ice cream Of course we made more but it just wasnt fast enough My advice is to buy big soft cookies so they can make ice cream sandwiches and then they wont fight over wanting a BIG bowl full Enjoy We really do like it 
4 0 nice icecream maker This is a nice little icecream maker Simple efficient Just one thing The recipe that comes with this is lame It s worth it to look into a better recipe At the very least use real cream 
5 0 Fun and Yummy for all ages My teenage kids made the best ice cream and they enjoyed the process I enjoyed watching them as they rolled it back and forth telling jokes and playing word games Also it was a good deal for me because they did all the work and I got to share the ice cream I was afraid that the ball would leak or be messy but it really wasn t a problem The Play Freeze Ice Cream Ball is fun and produces delicious ice cream Great gift choice 
4 0 nice addition to your paddle These grips were ordered for my wife and she likes them very much You may have to work them a little to get them on 
5 0 Entry Level Game Improver I am totally pleased with this purchase My tennis game has dramatically improved because of this product Having the tennis balls at arms length away while I practice my serve has vastly excellerated my progress I can now play a respectable match with those who have been playing years longer than I have 
4 0 Just perfect for lakes excelente producto aunque si hay un poco de olas el agua entra rapidamente debido a que la punta no es muy alta pero es perfecto para lagos tranquilos 
5 0 Perfect for the price If you are looking for a sturdy easy to assemble rack that will hold 6 8 pairs of dummbells this is a good one to buy I have a small home gym and needed just this size rack In 30 minutes I had this rack put together and it is very solid For the price you can t beat it I am a personal trainer and I have seen a lot of equipment This is a great buy especially compared to some of the flimsy racks that are marketed for home use 
5 0 Great Great Dumbell Rack I was suprised at the quality for the price Wal 
5 0 Good Choice Made very well for the price The three racks are 32 in length Holds about 9 sets of dumbbell max Easy to assemble and easy to access weights due to the slight angle Could not ask for more I chose this one after many searches good product 
4 0 3 Tier Dumbbell Rack For the price which was a great deal less than any other same capacity rack the Apex dumbell rack is hard to beat The tiers are recessed which allows for easier access yet the rack is built so that it does not take up any more space than a rack with vertical tiers The rack seems to hold up well and it will easily hold up to 7 pairs of dumbells Recommended 
5 0 Apex Deluxe 3 Tier Dumbbell Rack The rack is easy to assemble it looks gym quality and is reasonable priced It s perfect for a home gym set up I am extemely pleased with the quality and ease of assembly 
4 0 Not a bad propane stove for the price I bought this stove primarily to use for emergencies or when I experience a power outage but I like that I can also use it for camping note it is not a backpacking stove it s too bulky and propane is too heavy for that I was a bit surprised that the base is a lot larger than it looks in the online picture This stove can accommodate 12 and even 14 pots and pans While this may seem like a positive for me I wish it was slightly smaller At least it can be stored in a cupboard vertically I also wish the stove came with a carrying pouch or case but it does not The stove performs and functions perfectly well and seems sturdy and well built so all in all for the price I m happy with it despite the few negatives I ve mentioned Small propane tanks are cheap and readily available for about 1 50 2 00 which is a real plus 
4 0 Small and compact Pefect for the emergency power outages Compact stores in very little space and provides enough heat to boil water quickly or to heat up a can of soup 
5 0 aromatic Besides all the phun of 4 square and dodgeball that can be had these balls also smell REALLY good I m not kidding 
5 0 the cutest best crib soother we have had this since my son was in his crib and he loves it we have tried others like the aquarium and the rainforest versions but neither have the movie that projects on the ceiling like this one he is now 20 months old and still loves it it really soothes him to sleep and if he wakes up in the middle of the night he just pushes the button to turn on the birdies i don t know why they don t make more of these soothers with the projector the others are not nearly as good because they lack it 
4 0 Buyer beware The people selling this 30 00 item for 119 00 130 00 are disgusting I want to throw up on these people Please do not buy from these people Go somewhere else leave amazon if you have to Boston_Bookworm and Hotwheelskingdom Boo Boo Gross exploitation 
5 0 Life Saver My daughter has loved this since she was 5 months old Even now at 15 months she must have it playing when she goes down for naps or the night In the morning she is able to entertain herself with the music and the fluttering birds for 30 40 minutes This is a GREAT product and will be buying another for the little one we are expecting 
5 0 A MUST for our baby We bought this when our daughter was 3 months old and she STILL loves it over a year later She uses it so much we ve almost worn it out At first I thought the mechanics were kind of loud but I think that either goes away with a little use or we ve just gotten used to it Now it s not noisy at all The best feature is the projector It s not too bright or too busy All the songs are soothing even the bird chirping is soft It has 3 volume levels but we ve never used the loudest one We replace the batteries every few months or so The only thing I wish it had is a remote control to turn it on from afar so she doesn t have to get up But other than that it s perfect But it s got a long play on it so that usually she s asleep by the time it s done We ve got the Ocean Aquarium older version at Grandma s house it s okay but it doesn t have the projector and the bubbles are really too loud and distracting By the way This is NOT 99 We bought ours for about 35 I think I don t know why Amazon s listing it for so much 
4 0 GREAT I ve owned this for about a year now and here s what I like LOVE the projection on the ceiling music volume levels music choices My son continues to love it and use it to calm down to fall asleep The only thing I would change is I wish it had a remote to start it over again Also we ended up buying a battery charger because it does use the batteries pretty quick But I love it and would buy it again in a heartbeat 
5 0 Very cute great options This is such a cute soother I found it in a magazine ad and looked it up on the internet to check out the parent reviews and it sounded great so I ordered it on the Babies R Us website for 30 It is great has 4 musical and 2 soothing sounds option for baby s listening pleasure and also has the option for the light up moving birds and even a light show on the ceiling The only drawback to this product is that the mechanism that moves the birds around is a bit noisy makes the music hard to hear But overall a great product 
4 0 Projector review I found this product to be great My baby was fasinated by the projector at night and has saved me countless nights 
5 0 Great You NEED this If I could rate this 10 satrs I would do it My daughter LOVES this She is 6 months right now but it has been in her bed since the day she came home Every time I put her in her bed she turns her head right to it wanting to see the baby birds dance The music and sounds are really relaxing and the lights are super I also have the mobile in the Flutterbye Birds and it is super too but the music is not as soothing with the mobile The mobile music is more fun sounding and it also shines a light downward on the baby which is not too good for trying to go to sleep LOL The ONLY thing about this soother that is lacking is the remote that the mobile has With the mobile if she starts to fuss after the music goes off I can hit the remote from the doorway without her seeing me but with the soother she sees me come in and turn it on But with as much as she loves the soother she doesnt fuss at me for not picking her up after it turn it back on all her attention is on the birdies Get this you ll LOVE it 
4 0 still bouncing out it s quite pretty in my livingroom and high tech with no staples BUT the wire metal is very soft a sharp dart easily digs in and bounces out i had to dull my darts 
5 0 Great Board I ve played darts in many bars and in many homes The Blade III is an awesome board Very few Bounce Outs and a good Bristle board plus Winmau is a name in darts you can trust Bristle Dart Boards can be used with either Steel tip or Soft Tip Darts but the Bull is a bit hard for Soft Tip otherwise i cant find anything to complain aout 
4 0 performance In my opinion this is a top quality solid bristle board that seems true to normal wear under our cricket matches Any dart player knows the bull eye target on all dart boards are prone to wear down first and expose the ring metal rendering the board useless because of bounce outs or dropouts If I may add if such a company were to design a dart board with a synthedic polymer or sometype for the small bullseye which gets hammered more than any other area of the board the concept might rectify the problem of premature wear for any bristle dart board be it regulation or amatuer Albeit i like this board as any of the dozen quality made dartboards i have purchased in the past 
5 0 works great flies straight These BB s work great If you use a gun that requires high polish BB s You can t go wrong here 
4 0 Good product for kids This bowling ball has a very nice color and feel to it I took it to the local bowling alley to have the holes drilled for my daughter and she loved it She was always complaining about using the bowling balls at the alley and I wanted to get an affordable bowling ball that was of good quality but would not break the bank This is certainly worth the money 
5 0 solid reliable comfortable I have owned and used the Smooth Fitness 5 25 Treadmill for about six months I ve had lower cost treadmills and you do get what you pay for Though I don t see that spending 3000 gains all that much This one is definitely worth the price It s comfortable and stable and a pleasure to use My significant other and I put around 30 miles per week on it so we re not heavy users like runners in training We both use the power incline and vary the speed a lot It does not have a built in fan or fancy programmed routines I put a six dollar clip fan on it and I don t miss expensive electronics to break I just want to walk on it And it fulfills that function very well The one feature I wish it had was a set of sideways wheels I had a heck of a time getting it into my workout room because it only rolls forward and I don t have 40 doors in my house Does anyone It s difficult to fold it up keep it folded and get it through normal doorways Other than that I am very satisfied with it 
4 0 A few problems but a smooth experience overall My wife and I have owned the Smooth Keys Fitness 5 15 Treadmill for over 2 years We have not owned another treadmill but before committing to this one we tested many other brands in this price range The Smooth brand is definitely the smoothest ride you can get without paying significantly more Each of us runs about 2 5 miles daily and when maintained as prescribed in the owners manual occasional lubrication and belt realignment the 5 15 handles it easily The ride is very comfortable compared to other treadmills and running outdoors and we have no doubt that this treadmill would handle more vigorous running with ease We have had a few problems with the 5 15 Within the first year some of the soft touch buttons on the control panel stopped working and the circuit board had to be replaced twice This involved working with about 25 screws each time Then about a year later the arm mounted toggle switches stopped working These are small auxilliary switches for incline and speed levels so they weren t vital They were easy to replace without tools Then at about two years the belt tore slightly at the seam along one edge The treadmill was still usable but the loose piece of belt smacked against the plastic housing loudly on each revolution This wasn t terribly difficult to replace but it certainly wasn t fun requiring disassembly of the entire platform Service Notes Outside of the parts and labor warranty period when only parts are covered customers pay for shipping the parts to and from Keys Fitness Most Keys service technicians are knowledgeable and are perfectly willing to guide you through a long repair process providing frank and helpful advice along the way Today the 5 15 still works as it did when it was new over two years ago Nothing else has been diminished and nothing else has shown wear When things have gone wrong Keys has provided us with good customer service Overall we re happy with our experience and we ll probably buy a Smooth treadmill next time 
5 0 awesome we have one of these and love it we take it on the boat it cooks we swim Great for hot dogs and buns and a lot more we take it on road trips to Schliterbaun Food keeps hot in there for awhile so when we re ready to eat 
5 0 Excellent Fast Service We ordered an exercise seat cover on July 1 Saturday evening before the 4th of July Tuesday holiday It was delivered Thursday July 6 Estimated delivery was July 8 13 Our 93 year dad really needed this for the exercise bike he received on Father s Day We could not locate this item in any store in our small town Thank you for such wonderful customer service 
4 0 GREAT SHOES These shoes are great in the summer Great support and they also look great 
5 0 Good and reliable These fins are great They are comferatable and are very reliable and flexable They work great in the water I own several US diver sets They are all great 
4 0 Hot Fin If you are a snorkeler then you know what you need and this fin better be on your list of gear It gives you maximum thrust for your kick It s got style comfort and power It s design makes it easy to carry and it travels well You can t ask for much more 
5 0 This is one sexy fin This is by far the best snorkeling fin I have ever used Most fins cramp your feet within 10 min but you can snorkel all day in these and they have a lot of snap A+ 
5 0 Alaska and Back Excellant Cooler Shipping was fast Reasonably priced coolers and shipping I used two of them to bring back fresh caught Alaskan fish Not only did they survive the luggage handlers everything was still frozen after 18 hours without any ice Buy with confidence on this one 
5 0 Just the essentials This knife is perfect in terms of sleekness no bulge knife cutting into your pants and just having the few tools I most commonly need I use the knife corkscrew and bottle opener all the time when camping and the tweezers are surprisingly handy too 
5 0 The pocket knife you really use This is the pocket knife I carry when travelling You have what you need It is thin ligh You have a blade for peeling and cut a fruit A corkscrew for that special wine you will have in your room at a discounted price Sometimes I use the cap opener and as far as I can remember I have used once the can opener In other words do not go for those mini or maxi pocket knife have your quot waiter quot with you 
5 0 Favourite Alert This is a favourite among our players I recommend this blue grip more than its fellow colors bacause it s the best surface Among the surfaces presented white and blue hit the top But there s something about the blue We could be wrong but this is the result of tries and feedback This overgrip is favourite among Babolat Pure Drive Team Standard OS and Plus users 
5 0 Back for Another I received a Polar S610 as a gift nearly three years ago and am back for another I m buying one for my husband who finally thinks it s something he d like to have too I use it religiously if I forget it when I go for a workout I feel I m not getting credit for my exercise I upload with a Polar IR receiver not included with the watch all of my workouts and set weekly goals for time and caloric expenditure that I can easily track on the calendar Having had mine for three years I sent it in for a new battery and replacement of a button I had knocked off about a year ago local watch shops won t guarantee water tightness if they change the battery and bought a new chest strap transmitter a couple of months ago but it continues to work very well 
4 0 For all of the features what s not to like I have owned my S610i monitor for just under a year now and I firmly believe that this heart rate monitor has delivered the features exactly as described by the Polar company The bundled software though basic in nature does allow you to view several informative charts and graphs which gives you an extensive workout history to base your progress To realize the full potential of the S610i monitor you definitively will need to read and reread the owners manual as well as the software s help section Alas such are the torments of technology I like the S610i monitor for several reasons one being the large amount of exercises you can track another being the 50 meter water resistance and finally the multiple user features However the dim display leaves a lot to be desired for an old pair of eyes like mine hence the four stars rating out of five As far as any durability concerns I have only had to replace the red button which was expeditiously sent to me free of charge by Polar after a simple Customer Service e mail Nonetheless this is a very solid performing monitor and a basic level scientific device that gives you some invaluable information on your overall health and provides tangible feedback to achieve your exercise goals My exercise plans now take me to another level which include the incorporation of jogging and then running The S610i monitor is not really geared for that type of workout so I will upgrade to the S625x monitor in 2007 The S610i monitor will go to my wife not that the blue color pleases her but we workout at home so it should go unnoticed 
4 0 Terrible design but it works This is my third heart rate monitor I decided to upgrade to a model that could upload workout data to a PC and this was the least expensive Polar model with that ability Specialized versions that can double as bicycle computers cost only a little more but I don t ride much anymore and my road bike already has a computer so I decided those capabilities were worth nothing to me Pro The s610i works Period The WearLink chest strap is more comfortable than other chest straps I have used It comes with logging and training software and you can upload performance data to a website run by Polar for comparing with friends It works with either sonic or infrared connection to your PC or PDA I use infared Transferring data for a one hour workout takes only a couple of seconds and the watch can store many workouts between uploads You can set the watch s time date and other variables from the PC which is much more convenient than trying to program it with the buttons on the watch itself It is easy to get extra parts so that you can keep a heart strap at home and another in the gym for example Though I will never be a competitive athlete I find that this monitor and the knowledge that it logs all my workouts help me stay motivated I work out harder and more often as I feel the watch is looking over my shoulder and I don t want to leave a blank spot in the automatic training diary Anti The watch s software design is terrible You have to click buttons over and over again to get anything done and it s not always clear which button will have what effect The documentation was clearly not written by a native speaker of English and many passages are opaque You will end up figuring out how to use features of the watch by trial and error I failed to log most of my first workout entirely because of bizarrely phrased directions about how to pause the monitor The watch is garish and looks silly with a suit The software is PC only and doesn t seem to export everything if you want to analyze your heart rate data in other software or on another machine it will export some of the information that was recorded including heart rates but not others including time stamps or workout descriptions Polar s USB Infrared adapter which costs extra is completely incompatible with Macintosh You can buy software that will analyze Polar s data on the Mac but you can t use this adapter to move the data over Instead you need to buy a serial to infrared adapter and a USB serial adapter and connect them together This is slower and somewhat maddening If Polar were to publish all APIs and make their drivers and software open source they wouldn t lose a dime in hardware sales and people who would be able to make much better software for their monitors running on many more platforms 
4 0 Good budget wireless bike computer I bought this computer because it is wireless and you can see MPH odometer and time all at the same time The wireless works well I question the accuracy of the computer It seems off at high speeds Also the readout has a 3 4 second delay So when you change speeds the computer takes a few seconds to update the display My wired cateye does not seem to have this problem For a serious competitor I think you would want to spend a little more But for recreational biking it works fine 
5 0 Finally a bag for all your basketball needs I looked high and low for a sports bag for all of my basketball needs Finally I discovered the HoopSaq and I couldn t be happier I love being able to carry by shoes clothes basketball and drink all in one bag Before I always had to carry my ball seperately because typical gym bags aren t designed with the space for a basketball I bought a really few big gym bags before that carried all my equipment but I was always lugging a bag too big not to mention that my shoes clothes and ball were mixed together It was always a mess when I d play outside and get water and dirt from my shoes on my clothes I love this bag and any series basketball player should own one themselves 
5 0 Indianapolis Colts gift bag If you are wanting to show the sportsfan in your life that you went the extra mile to for their gift this is right for you My brother was really touched that I did that for him 
4 0 Everlast 6 Piece Platform Bag Set Product Description 24 Smoothly finished adjustable 6 3 4 wooden drum Powder coated enamel brackets for superior durability Hand wraps Bag gloves Leather speed bag with swivel Jump rope This product is a great deal It may be shipped with a vinyl speed bag even though it says leather My package shipped with one mounting bracket and a chipped particle board BUT IF THAT DOESNT HAPPEN TO YOU AND YOU RECIEVE WHAT IT SHOWS IN THE PIC YOURE GETTIN A great DEAL black handwraps instead of the tan ace bandages they send you would be nice for starters an 
4 0 Good value starter boxing set This boxing set is a good value compared to if I would have bought each item separately However you only really need the boxing bag gloves and that spinning thing to attach it to the ceiling That other piece of equipment that you mount on the wall is very large and was not really that useful to us Maybe it would be to someone else but you can just use that spinning thing and mount it to a beam and use the boxing bag that way That other mounting wall bracket is heavy and takes up too much room But I bought this whole set anyway because it was cheaper to buy all this together than to buy it separately and it s good exercise 
5 0 A DOR ABLE This little backpack is the perfect size for my 2 5 year old He loves having his own backpack to take when he stays with Auntie I hate the cheesy character bags he is very fashion forward with this bag I actually went back and bought another one for my 7 month old for when he s big enough for it 
5 0 Perfect Little Backpack The dimensions are clearly stated above I had also seen this bag in a bookstore once so I knew what to fully expect I use this bag to hold my purse items I like having a bag I can strap over my shoulders when I need my arms free I am also able to pack a textbook and notebook in it when I need to This is a versatile mini backpack that is also super cute looking It has a bunch of little pockets throughout to securely hold items like a cell phone small bottle of water cd mp3 player headphones credit cards lipgloss If you are looking for a huge clunky backpack to hold tons of stuff then this bag is not for you Also this bag is definitely for a female I could not see it on a man 
5 0 Great for Safety I purchased this whistle for scuba diving It is very loud You can even hear this whistle underwater I like this whistle because it is all plastic so it can t rust and it provides a lot of noise in a compact package Every diver should carry some sort or noise alert system If you are like me and need a very affordable solution this whistle will get it done 
4 0 Best bang for the buck Did you just break the bank buying your dream gun but have no dough for optics Never fear Leapers will save the day For about 30 you get a decent red dot that will get the job done w o the bells and whistles I use it on my Remington 11 87 and it still shoots 3 slugs accurately after approximately 150 of very punishing rounds I got a second red dot for an AK 74 and the scope is more accuarate then the rifle This is a great scope if you plan on messing around at the range but I wouldn t put it to the test if you plan on hiking hunting with it for days on end The green dot option has been lost on me so far but I guess it s usefull if your being tacti cool at night or something My only problem so far is the pin to one of the flip up lens cover worked its way out and I used a picture frame nail to replace it Otherwise bang for the buck you can t beat it 
4 0 nice but big for a paintball marker good lens Is a little bigger for my paintball marker tippmann a 5 because I cant put it right with the loader The 2 lens covers are too big so if u wanna open and close them u will have problems with the space Also it comes with special adjusters to fit in the marker s rail BUT it has I dont know why 2 diferent screws to fit it the front one is lower that the rear one so I couldnt make it fit lined up Be carefull if you want this for a paintball marker 
5 0 Great I love this belt Its bigger than what i needed but great I have no problem with the velcro and i wear a 40 42 waist workout belt usually Plus its light wieght Great for walking running 
1 0 HA You got to be kidding right If you are an Intelligent Human Being use common sense please LOL You can not loose ONE body part by wearing this kind of gadget LOL You got to loose entire body fat mass by cardio work out plus eat good PERIOD Gee I could come up with TONS of silly Gadget like this to become a millionaire for silly consumers can not believe people actually spend a penny on these things LMAO People are cute 
5 0 Works great for what it is works well in an urban enviroment i also use one while on my bike compass works fine as long as it s level the clip is real tight and secure tadah you get what you pay for but for me it s worth every inexpensive penny 
5 0 Good Compass I have nothing bad to say about this compass It is very compact the thermometer is accurate and the compass works perfectly when HELD LEVEL It s not a state of the art digital GPS high tech item You need to hold the compass level for it to work properly I have one on my bike I love it 
5 0 Hugger Mugger Foam Roller I love this body roller The foam is dense and holds up to my body weight perfectly The fabric cover is a great idea When it gets dirty I just take it off and throw it in the washer It is light weight and easy to carry into the gym or use in any room of the house It is a great massager for all body parts I love to roll out watching TV in the evening time It it also a great item for improving balance and strengthening abs There is a lot you can do with this roller For the price 11 95 it is hard to beat I definitely recommend this product 
5 0 Very nice item Damn Its just an umbrella but I don t think you could find a better one anywhere 
4 0 Handy bottle I got this bottle so I could get super saver shipping and I m glad I did It holds 1000ml of water so if you remember to empty it twice a day youll be getting over the 8 cups of water a day you re supposed to drink The only problem I ve had with it is that it s not spillproof and will leak if its upside down but I carry it in my backpack and as long as it doesnt tip over inside it s good 
4 0 Serves its purpose For the money it definitely serves its purpose Has enough room to carry all the stuff you need to the court When not in use it is foldable unlike other bags 
2 0 NOT AS STATED I JUST OPENED BOX AND WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT IT IS 24IN WIDE NOT 30 AS ADD STATES SEEMS FLIMSY wOULD RETURN IF NOT SUCH A HASSEL 
5 0 Works fine The mat works fine for my rowing machine The price is better than many I have seen 
4 0 Great low cost for light to medium duty use I purchased this mat to place under my treadmill to protect the floor underneath and prevent any slippage The mat is well constructed and large enough for just about any treadmill This one is a larger than most would need but I thought I needed the extra length I don t It is strong enough for light to medium use If you were especially rough on this mat you could wear it or tear it fairly easily But it does what it s supposed to and you get what you pay for I m very satisfied with it 
5 0 Swim gloves Item purchased was a gift Recipient said it was exactly what he wanted 
4 0 Excellent Product Title says it all I bought the X Large that s my normal glove size but should have purchased the Large the gloves stretch slightly 
4 0 Strengthen your swim workout These definitely do what you would expect and are fairly comfortable although you may have some sore shoulders the next day I wasn t sure if I should get the medium or the large and wish I had gone with the smaller size 
5 0 Very pleased I ve been riding with a FlatBlocker Max in my back wheel of my mountain bike for about 4 months now It has really performed well I ve got a standard Slime filled tube in front and both wheels have Slime Tube Protectors Every time I need to add air to the front I check the back and it is fine My riding is almost exclusively off road in the New Mexico desert around Albuquerque with lots of Cholla Prickly Pear and the dreaded goatheads The only downside I can see is that some folks might think the tube is heavy Personally I ride for exercise so I don t care about carrying around the extra weight or any effects it may have on acceleration 
5 0 Inner Tube This tube is preforming well I have since had the unfortunate pleasure of riding thru a trail with massive amouts of glass However the tubes dint even get scratch I Love them 
5 0 Great Looking well crafted knife This was my first Kershaw Ken Onion knife and I love it I carry it with me all the time The belt clip can be removed or flipped upside down by removing two allen screws It s it small enough that it doesn t feel bulky in the pocket yet has a large enough blade to do any type of cutting The tungsten coating has also prevented further abuse I absolutely love the speed safe feature it makes opening the knife incredibly easy and fun too I have yet to see any problems with the knife opening inside my pocket there is also a lock to prevent the blade from opening I plan to make more Kershaw Ken Onion knife purchases in the future 
5 0 Nice fast pocket knife I use it as an everyday pocket knife Very fast and sharp from factory so like the previous person mentioned be careful when opening it the first time I bought it to replace my old Swiss Army knife as an everyday pocket knife It is light and relatively thin so it is easy to just clip it in your pocket and you barely feel it A very sleek looking knife although the finish seems it might get scratched easily if you re not careful 
5 0 My Favorite Knife I ve got a relatively small knife collection maybe 15 blades but this is the one I tend to carry every day I ve got a few Kershaws and the speed safe opening is what initially attracted me to the brand That said while it s a cool way to open the knife I ve ultimately decided it s mostly a gimmick I find it s just as fast and somewhat easier to open the knife with the thumb stud My collection has 3 other kershaws two chives and an avalanche The leek is the best size for a carry defensive knife The blade is long without being cumbersome and the shape is sleek and manageable The knife is also good for chores although for anything really heavy I d use a bigger blade like the avalanche or the blur The black finish is nice although truthfully my leek is titanium oxide rainbow One of my chives is black though and the finish is sleek and holds up well This knife is definitely worth the price 
5 0 Great Quality This is one of the best one handed opening knives i ve seen Kershaw s Speed Safe really is speedy Having the options of using the index opener of the thumb stub makes it a rather versital tool You get it sharp and thats how it stays Overall its a really study reliable and useful tool Definately worth the price and you ll have it a long time 
4 0 good for the price been on my hybrid for 3 months Works great with my suntour shimano stuff Not the lightest or best looking chain but it works 
4 0 Great Bib Nice fitting bib only flaw was the logo It wasn t on properly and took a swim in the first wash 
5 0 Great Yoga Pilates Mat This mat is wonderful It s much thicker than typical mats so it s much more comfortable This is especially important if you re doing pilates or yoga moves that involve the spine such as Rolling like a Ball Also the velcro closures make it very easy to transport It s the perfect mat 
4 0 Satisfied This comforter is a good deal for the price I received it within 2 weeks although when it got here and I opened it it smelled like plastic from the transfer applied to the front A few runs in the washer took care of that though It is very warm and very thick almost too thick to fold Overall I am happy with it 
5 0 awesome This gun is wonderful When I took it out of the box i emeadtly began to play with it it has alot of firepower I would recomed gettng he extra mags Defnaty rccend 
5 0 awesome gun As soon as I got this gun I knew this was an awesome gun This gun shot so far it hit my friend on his back porch I was amazed at how fast and far this gun shot This gun is easy to work This gun can compete with Tokyo Mauri s aug for one fourth of the price I would recomend this this gun for beginners and veterans I was very pleased with this gun 
5 0 sweet ive only had it for a couple days now but so far this thing totaly dominates any airsoft gun ive used or seen full auto is crazy especialy when compared to a mini wow it also shoots around 280 300 fps and is very acurate low mag tho and the battery doesnt seem very good 
5 0 Comes ready In the description it says it comes ready to play Does this mean that it is already charged Maby thats why the people who charged for more than 4 hrs didnt work and the dude who chareged for 10 mins worked U should propbibly try to see if it works w 0 charge before charging just to make sure 
4 0 dive gloves I use these dive gloves to cover a artificial hand Being of light weight they go over the hand and fit very well a great glove for me 
5 0 Great chair for outdoor festivals These chairs are very comfortable They hardly weigh anything so they are easy to carry around Used them for a big 3 day music festival and they did the job very well 
5 0 Tired of Changing flats These tires certainly meet their billing for being resistant to flats We put them on my girlfriend s road bike She flatted frequently due to county roads 150 mi week schedule and her weight No Flats since Now I don t worry about her rides as much She has had the tires for 4 months I ll get em next Not much heavier but a little and quite comfortable 
5 0 Yeah Something as long as I am A great mat even though it is on the heavyish side So what it s not THAT heavy Slippery at first that goes away Bravo to Manduka for making this long mat which keeps my face away from the studio floor and my feet still on the mat 
5 0 Manduka Yoga Mat This mat seems to provide padding equal to 2 or 3 standard mats stacked together 
5 0 This mat rocks For anyone tired of slipping around while in downdog this is the mat you want The thickness took some time to get used to because with thinner mats there is slippage that you can to your advantage such as when moving into cobra and with the manduka you have to force yourself forward thus getting a better sweat because your not cheating anymore Which you won t realize is cheating until you do cobra on this mat The price intially may be a litte off setting but it is sooooooooooo worth the price I wish I had bought this mat sooner I recommend the 85 inch to have room to move I use the whole mat and I m short Do buy a sling or case since the mat weighs about ten pounds and it has to be rolled very tightly 
5 0 If You re Tall or Like Extra Padding this Mat Is for You I m 6 6 225 lbs and have been doing yoga for a few years This mat is nice and long as well as a little wider and thicker than the standard mat Yes it s heavier than a standard mat and I found it to be unpleasantly slippery at first but I recommend it highly If you ever find yourself stacking one mat on top of another to get the padding you need or running out of room on your mat then please buy this mat now and you will thank yourself later Pros Longer thicker wider Cons A bit expensive I think it s worth it slippery at first goes away after a few classes NOTE You might want to periodically roll the mat from a different end to get rid of the teacher tripping curl that develops over time 
5 0 what a difference a mat makes The 85 mat is probably best for 2 different situations if you are tall like me 6 3 and you don t mind carrying some hefty extra weight around to class or if you want to do yoga at home or wherever and you don t need to ever move this mat It is heavy like 10 lbs because it is so dense but that is a good thing It is a solid mat in the sense that when you twist your feet your mat doesn t bunch up like thinner mats It also gives you great padding for the hard floors It is obscenely long which gives you room to stretch out and also has an additional advantage of giving you some extra space in a crowded studio call me selfish but that s a nice bonus It is very sticky unless you are really sweating but at that point you would probably have a towel I use this on carpet and hard floors and it works great in both cases Yes this mat is expensive but didn t you just spend 100 on those shoes with the little shox on the back You should consider your yoga mat just as important and buy yourself the best 
5 0 No more water in my ears I love that I don t get water in my ears anymore The one drawback to swimming was that I always spent the rest of the day jumping on one foot trying to get the water out of my ears These are so comfortable I forget I am wearing them At the end of the swim I pop them out put them back in their handy carry case and that s it 
4 0 Sweet Foosball Table This is a great foosball table the only drawback being the price but if you play a lot of foosball this is the table for you It says it can be put outdoors but the table is best used indoors The playing field is straight and has no flaws and the players themselves are well made and dont break like on the cheap foosball tables 
5 0 Happy Happy My grandson has been most pleased with this beginners set Good luck with your purchace j hudso 
5 0 Great value for the money I ordered these clubs for my twin 7 year olds for Christmas They are a little long for their age but will be a great set for them to use and grow into They can carry the bag which has it s own stand and a nice cover over the driver and irons They have already used the clubs and really like them I was really happy with them and they made a great gift 
5 0 EXCELLENT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE This is a really neat set of clubs for a child The driver is a little on the heavy side but otherwise the clubs swing beautifully and are very easy to handle for an average 10 year old The putter is a simple design and has proven quite accurate The bag is a heavy denier and quite rain resistant It comes with its own built in stand and double shoulder strap for ease of carrying My 10 year old handled this set very well All in all this product is great value for money good looking and gives a good game of golf 
5 0 Best Hard Case for Equipment I use my Pelican case all the time I love it It protects my Nikon Pro Series Camera Bodies and carries all of my equipment with no problems at all I can actually seal the case up in the cold air condition and then open it up after being out in the back of my truck in the heat and it is still cold inside That is a seal I cannot brag enough about this case I wheel it in to the photo shoot and I know that I have all my Gear at my finger tips It is amazing 
4 0 vjeliazkova I purchased this watch heart rate monitor about a month ago and have since used it pretty often It is a pretty neat gadget since it combines a watch a calorie counter a heart rate monitor and a chronometer It also has a light which makes it nice I bought it mainly for the heart rate monitor feature and am pretty happy with it overall It reads heart rate fairly accurately my only complaint is that you can not be moving very fast in order to get an accruate reading If you are running at a moderate fast pace on a treadmill it has a hard time picking up a signal and sometimes it displays nothing sometimes the reading is unreasonably low i e 65bpm when I know I have to be in the 150s or 160s But if you slow down to a walk where you have better control over how you position your fingers over the sensors you are most likely to get an accurate reading Overall I m happy with it and will use it for a long time 
5 0 Pleasantly surprised This product was surprisingly accurate quick and easy to use I compared it to the heart rate monitor at the hospital s cardiac rehab lab and it was within 1 or 2 heart beats both at rest and in full run mode Much more comfortable for women than a chest strap monitor 
5 0 Love This Watch I work out at curves 3 times a week and you have to track your heart rate I just use my watch to count the beats I was able to set my own lowest and highest beats per min and the watch lets me know if I m running low or high It also wakes me up in the morning so that I don t miss my curves appointments 
4 0 good product but not for everyone The watch is a good product and like the look color of it but it would not work on me I called Reebok and was told that some people it would not work on because of the nerve endings This was not disclosed anywhere and would have reconsidered since I had been struck previously by lightning When I was going to return it there was a 15 restocking charge on items opened 
5 0 Great product I was doubtful if a heart rate monitor without a body strap would work but my wife assures me that she has had it tested at her gym and it is extremly accurate Great product 
4 0 Good Product with one drawback I recently purchased this product and was dissapointed that it doesn t continuously take your heart rate You have to push down on the two silver buttons above and below the screen with your index and middle fingers to get a heart rate reading If I would have done my research beforehand I wouldn t have been surprised at this I know Anyway now that I have it I am pretty pleased with the product The pros of this product are as follows I really like not having to wear a chest strap transmitter I like that it is slightly girlier looking I have the blue model and I like it better than my very basic big clunky Polar model I like the calorie counter It is as accurate as my Polar model with the chest strap I used both watches during my last workout on my elliptical machine and everytime I took my heart rate with this watch it was usually within 2 BPM of my Polar Watch At the most a few times the difference between the watches was 4 BPM The only drawback to this product in my opinion as I ve mentioned before is the fact that it does not automatically and continuously take your heart rate Once I get used to that I think I ll really enjoy this watch 
5 0 24 Hopper When this first arrived I thought boy have I wasted my money but my 10 year old grandchild loved it and so far it s held up very well 
5 0 24 Hopper I was very pleased with this product I purchased it for my granddaughter and she really likes it I m also impressed with the quality it s very sturdy and I believe will hold up very well 
5 0 Surprisingly entertaining I bought this for my 10 year old daughter only because my 8 year old had asked for one and I felt I should buy them both a hopping ball Well I m glad I did because she absolutely loves it This ball is the perfect size and is great exercise for the kids They have so much fun hopping around the house and outside even on the grass It s pretty sturdy too 
5 0 the Hopper know as the hoppity by my grandchildren given as gifts to a 6 and 4 year old who immediately jumped up on them and started hopping around the house and then the yard A simple safe quiet toy using large muscles for exercise and balance Great way to blow off some steam either indoors or out Their mother had enjoyed this toy when she was a child and it still has great appeal to the next generation For smaller children think of a smaller diameter these children are long legged and so the 24 was perfect 
5 0 My boys LOVE their Hoppers Once again we bought our two boys 7 and 3 way too much for Christmas Out of everything we got them though the Hoppers are what they play with the most We are very pleased with their construction and durability I expect my kids to be playing with these for several years The only thing I would add would be a recommendation that you have a heavy duty bicycle style pump on hand for inflation It took us forever to get the right amount of air in them using a small sports ball style pump It was one of those We should have thought about this but didn t moments Overall one of if not the best purchases we made this Christmas 
5 0 Hopper My son age 6 has lots of fun with the Hopper It is colorful and seems to be very durable Good value for the money 
5 0 24 inch hoppers Well constructed even though they were made in China The Grandkids thought they were the best presents and had a blast with them 
5 0 Great toy My 6 year old wanted Santa to get him a pogo stick well that wasnt happening all I could see in my head were his teeth going bouncing aaaaaa but I found this instead I had bought one for my oldest 15 yrs ago and was so happy to see they were still around He loves it he can bounce inside or outside He gets great exercize at the same time he is having fun A hand pump with a ball pin is needed to inflat I highly recomend this for your bouncer a safe easy to use and fun toy 
5 0 Great way to keep your hands warm I must admit I am always skeptical when things appear too good to be true but once in a while they are I was looking for a back up pair of neoprene gloves I got these and was amazed at the quality of these gloves I have bought big name neoprene gloves and these were just supposed to be a just in case pair I have to tell you that NOW they are the primary ones I use and I love them The finger tips fold back for baiting my fishing hooks and unlike the other pair I have they have large patches of velcro to hold the fingers back not just little slices that always seem to come loose 
5 0 High Sierra Ravine Water Bottle Got it in good time It works very well for what it was wanted for 
5 0 New England Patriots Fleece Blanket Nice product but it did take almost a month to ship 
5 0 A+++++ A little steep with shipping but all was great Great Gift for nephew Great service A+++ 
4 0 Great Value At first I was a bit leary ordering a piece of exercise equipment through the mail and an inexpensive one to boot but I could not be more pleased This peice was relatively easy to put together I did it one evening while my husband was out of town It is a great peice of exercise equiment too the first I ve ever stuck with using now for almost three months The only criticism I have is the instructions did not provide any information about the computer it works but I m not sure if the measurement is in meters etc Overall a great value 
5 0 protius This is a great product This will be my second cross trainer My first cross trainer was purchased 7 years ago and have trained for 5 bodybuilding competitions with it My first cross trainer has alot of hard miles and still works fine I purchased this one for my wife 
4 0 good buy this elliptical is easy to assemble easy to use quiet while using and a good workout It is a good investment for your health and takes up little room 
4 0 Great value buy After recieving this item I was able to assemble and use this device in less than half an hour It is very easy to use and even if though I don t notice a difference in adjusting the tension dial it still does well to give me a good cardio work out My only complaint about this product is that after a few uses an odd squeek developed that is mildly annoying 
4 0 Elliptical Cross Trainer I was very apprehensive about purchasing an elliptical for only 90 00 but it turned out to be the best purchase I have ever made towards fitness equipment It is sturdy and works great 
4 0 excellent value for the price Since it arrived has been used daily with no issues Make sure to keep a lube material handy not something like WD40 something with a little viscosity I ve added a little about once a week to keep the squeak down and it works fine The computer is simple but does exactly what it says it will 
5 0 Better than expected For the price this is a very sturdy elliptical maching I like the feature which enables you lock the bars into place or use the bars like a tradtional elliptical The computer moniter is easy to use and efficent The wheel design allows for a smooth workout many elliptical are nowhere near a smooth as this one is Don t let the shipping price keep you from getting this model it is well worth the price Also the item arrived in 2 days and it is large and heavy which explains the shipping cost 
5 0 Terrific walking aid I used my Leki Travellers for a hike across northern Spain to Santiago Campostela about 160 miles total I have a torn ACL in one knee and arthritis in feet ankles Combined the Leki poles with Z Coil walking shoes and had no problems unlike several fellow walkers with normal knees feet I m sold on these sticks they really DO relieve the burden on knees and ankles They re light and folded easily so they went into even smallish luggage They improve the workout with upper body exercise I just fly They re my best walking buddies 
5 0 Great Walking Sticks Love my new LEKI They are lightweight pack easy and have both pavement and off road tips I use them on my daily walks My husband loved them so much I am getting him a pair for Christmas 
4 0 Park Sun Tournament Flex 1000 nice heavy duty net poles and rope the only downfall are the stakes used to hold the poles they look like 12 nails and come right out of the ground so i went to home depot and bought anchors 40 no problem 
5 0 Volleyball set The instructions were clear and made for an easy set up and a nice net Breakdown was also very easy and everything actually fit back into the carry case 
4 0 Great Value Nice Set For 80 bucks this is a great value The net and poles are made very well for the price We are ocassional players and find that this set suits us just fine The only reason I didn t give it 5 stars is because it took me a lot longer to set up than was advertised It s possible that my lack of experience in setting these things up that had something to do with that Overall I highly recommend 
5 0 Incredible Savings As the husband of a beach volleyball devotee I can honestly say that this set is going to make me a hero this Christmas 
5 0 Great Item This item is great for the cold winter helps keep you very warm I would definitly recommend this item for people who have to spend several hours out in the cold 
5 0 Excellent foot or hand warmer Thank you for offering this product It arrived quickly to my house just in time for our ski trip They worked great as foot warmers and hand warmers They stayed warm for many hours I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn t like to get cold 
5 0 Great craftsmanship I carried this sword at the Texas Ren Fest for 5 weekends and always received compliments on it The hilt is large and bright silver and truely stands out in a crowd of swords Bare in mind that this sword is just a prop and is probably no good for sword combat But it s a fine crafted item that is sure to look good on your hip or mounted on the wall 
5 0 Ask the man who owns one I like this sword A LOT It s well constructed it comes with a nifty leather scabbard with shiny silver trim and it looks good Excellent for costume display or reenacting but I don t know if the blade was manufactured for practical use theatrical or reeactor sword fighting Still it s a good prop Did I say I like this sword 
5 0 Really improved my kick My freestyle kick was horrible until I picked up the Zoomers Blue I ve been training with these fins exclusively for the past few weeks Swimming with the Zoomers has definitely given my legs a much better workout When I swim without the Zoomers I ve noticed that I m able to keep my legs up higher and am much more efficient 
5 0 Great Quality Great Value We recently purchased this item It was easy to assemble The frame is sturdy and portable with wheels It met our needs perfect We love it 
5 0 works for me I m fit and athletic and I don t mind a little blood rush to the head if you are too than you ll like these boots It takes about one minute of hanging to get comfortable on the ankles then after that it s almost like meditation I hang about every other day for 10 20 minutes at a time I usually do it with only socks on for a bit of extra cushion Feels great good stretch very relaxing And if your strong enough just hang from a pull up bar as they are cheaper than special bars and just as strong And it s fun to get the ladies into the boots 
4 0 good quality boots they not the easiest boots to put on but once they on they are secure and comfortable to wear 
5 0 Great Product I do upside down situps with a 50 pound vest on and a 25 pound dumbell in each hand I weigh 185 pounds No creaks bends or falls great produc 
5 0 These boots are made for hangin I got these along with the Teeter Hang Ups door rack The boots are sturdy and comfortable Feel confident in getting them They work 
5 0 A must for every home I wanted one of these for a long time I just didn t know it I always loved the Hangup Boots but never bought them because I didn t want the big inversion table Then I woke up one morning with a drive to get the boots and just find something a jungle gym perhaps to hang from And then I saw this rack that hangs in your door It was perfect It installed easily in my studio doorway It can be used for pullups or just something to stretch out with everytime I walk in and out of the room Our daughter is constantly climbing on it and inadvertantly getting great exersise I did get the inversion boots as well and try to find ten minutes a day to hang upside down It gets blood to the brain and takes pressure off the spine You can get a totally different work out being inverted I highly recommend this to everyone but especially fellow yogis Yoga is great for working out back problems and this rack paired with the Hangup boots really helps with strengthening and lengthening the back Cobra pose without a floor I am glad I didn t hessitate in getting this I use it everyday 
5 0 Hang Me UP Being a bodybuilder I hoist heavy weights all the time a major stress especially when it comes to squats I ordered the boots when I realized I had shrunk to 5 10 5 from being 6 0 5 I was thusly very happy when after approximately 5 weeks of hanging 5 times a week 10 15 min intervals that I am nearly back to my original height 6 0 25 I highly suggest this product as a supplement to good emphasis on good chiropractic care To those who have will order this product don t be discouraged if it seems to hurt your back at first that s totally normal because your back is trying to readjust while the discs which cushion the vertebrate start rehydrating Also it will take some time to find the strap tightness that s right for your legs Generally tighter on the top strap and looser on the bottom is a good combination p s Hang from a real pull up bar and make sure you have someone to spot you if you are not strong enough to pull yourself back up the bar to unlatch yourself 
5 0 No complaints seem solid haven t used much yet Seem to the best value on the market I didn t research too much but found them to be the apparent best value 
4 0 Great to hold a lot of decks Playing Hand and Foot with friends makes this gadget very handy We use 5 decks and this keeps the cards really neat in their piles Glad I got it Sometimes it is hard to pick up the card but with practice it should get easier 
4 0 very good product it is a very good product fits and feels great but cannot be used in conjunction with the gloves for a heavy bag 
4 0 Good all around workout gloves Decent product worth the 20 I paid The gloves look good are comfortable enough and not very difficult to take off The Diamond Tac Palm seems helpful for my grip so far unlike with other gloves I owned before Don t even need to use chalk The reason I give it four stars is that the metal ring through which you thrust the wristband may hurt your hand when bent backward and that after about 5 6 workouts the seam on one of the pinkies cracked easy to fix though on my previous GNC gloves the material ripped after the first workout P S The bonus CD is worth giving a look but nothing special 
4 0 Mini fridge to go We use this cooler along with a small microwave when we travel by car on dayhiking excursions It gives us a nice little kitchen in whatever hotel lodge we stay We haven t used the warm function yet but it does keep food plenty cold You do have to be careful about putting food right at the air outlet inside as fragile foods can freeze a bit at times Other than that it is plenty roomy The instructions say not to use ice in this cooler but when we will be away from power sources for a while we pack up ice in zip top plastic bags and it works fine It is well insulated light enough to shlep even when filled The fan is not so quiet so we try not to place it right next to the bed The Auto connector plugs into the A C adapter and we have used it on occasion to power auto cell phone chargers and the like That is an off label use but handy nonetheless I ve also used it as an extra fridge around the house on the occasions It seems to do fine when on for an extended period You can t leave it on for very long in a car with the engine off That will drain the battery Not a good thing A very useful cooler all in all 
4 0 Shipping was fast but the cooler didn t come in it s original box It s a nice big cooler which my son needed I received the order in less then a week after ordering 
5 0 Good buy I received the stroller last week and very happy with it The customer serive is also very helpful to answer all my questions I have been searching for a double stroller for some time for my 2 4 yr old and a new born I was first looking at a light weight umbrella style but my kids are all uncomfortable sitting inside after trying in the store I didn t find any local store that carry this double stroller to try on I was encouraged to see all the positive review on Instep stroller and decide to buy it anyway The price and value is unbeatable 
5 0 WONDERFUL STROLLER I m what ya might call a stroller hog I currently have 5 strollers including this one however this is the only Double Jogger I have The others include a Snap N Go for the carseat only an umbrella stroller a Jeep Single Jogger Stroller then a Baby Trend SitNStand and although I really like my Jeep Single Jogger the SitNStand this one is by far my favorite It s AWESOME I LOVE how EASY it is to push and manuver the swivel wheel is a MUST The only thing I have found so far that I think could use improvement is the sun shade it s very short and really doesn t do any good at all I have a 7 month old so she still tends to take naps during my walks and the sun gets in her face eyes a lot BUT I fixed that problem by getting a Rayshade Sun Shade and now the stroller has no flaws at all It was SIMPLE to put together I did it by myself in just 10 minutes Bottom line I LOVE it and would HIGHLY recommend it OH and I was suppose to get this in 2 days and I got it overnight so that was a nice welcome surprise 
4 0 Life Saving Stroller This stroller is a life saver I can actually enjoy shopping now with my 3 and 1 year old without them trying to climb out of the shopping cart They are both strapped in and can lay back and nap or sit up and enjoy the ride I wish it had some sort of cup holder for myself but the ride is exceptionally smoothe for the riders and myself The only downfall it is a little heavy and awkward lifting it into the back of my van but what can you expect for a double stroller All in all I would highly recommend this stroller to anyone 
4 0 Great I gave this stroller a 4 because there is no parent consol Other than that it handles very well 
4 0 Great stroller We have not yet been able to use this outside of the home the true test will be to get it through public doorways Everything is great and is a nice quality stroller 
5 0 Great swivel stroller Great Price Love this stroller I was actually able to put it together by myself while my husband was at work Instructions were very straightforward and easy to understand Works like a dream Great color Kids love it Amazon was fast and the best price on the web as usual 
5 0 Great stroller reasonable price This stroller is great I researched double joggers for quite some time and did not have a big budget for some of the higher priced ones but did find that this one got great reviews I just received it in the mail a few days ago and let me tell you I love to go walking now I can put both my kids in it ages 2 1 2 years and 5 months and no longer have to put my 5 month old in the Snugli carrier Also it makes walking my dog easier he just walks right next to it It has a nice smooth ride and barely feels like I am pushing any weight It folds up nicely and fits into my SUV perfectly a Honda Pilot It also has a little soft console for water bottles keys etc The canopy is nice and large and covers them from the sun My kids really enjoy riding in it it is roomy and has great 5 point harness restraints The ONLY drawback I can see is the angle of the seats I have them reclined forward as far as they will go and they are still at an angle where my kids seem to be lounging back My 5 month old does not mind however my toddler gets antsy sometimes and wants to sit up For the most part though they are content for the entire ride and don t try to sit up This stroller is perfect for fast paced walking or strolling around It is probably also good at the mall or other places but I know after about 45 60 minutes of sitting back my toddler will reach her limit and want to get out Luckily I have a different stroller for those occasions I highly recommend this stroller you don t have a spend a fortune to get a great stroller 
5 0 Schwinn Free Wheeler 2 This is a great stroller I get LOTS of inquiries about this when I am out and about It s VERY easy to push and maneuver I love the swivel front wheel and I use the lock mechanism for walks jogs I would really like to see a hand brake but the wrist strap on this model is definitely helpful for hills and rollerblading The seats are easy to adjust great pockets and cup holder The sun shade is upgraded to a curve which is really great It s a little bit tough to collapse but not too bad It fits into the back of my minivan fairly well GREAT value for the price and it s definitely a step up from the regular model 
5 0 Great Stroller We love it It is easy to push around The kids seem to be comfortable I did put a small towel under the seats so the kids can sit at a more upright position Easy to close and open It takes up a lot of space in the van but it is expected We have enjoy it very much For the price we paid for it is a great stroller 
5 0 Awesome Stroller Love Love Love It is easy to manuver and extremly light weight I have a two year old and six month od and they both are extremely comfortable for long excursions 
4 0 Wet to work The only odd thing I noticed about it is that it has to be very wet to work but it does work 
5 0 Love this Heart Rate Monitor I ve had this heart rate monitor for about 8 years now I really like the way it works and I ve never had any problems with it I use it about every other day for my aerobic work out The only thing I ve had to do is change the battery When I first got it and when I change the batteries I have to get out the instructions to re set everything but other than that it s great I m planning to buy a second one for my husband 
5 0 Great little gymbag Durable lightweight and a breeze to carry your things to the gym It hangs on my shoulder and doesn t fall off just one of those little things that makes the difference Also comes in a variety of nice colors 
5 0 Mom s Review Just got mine yesterday came really fast I must say that we had a cheaper version of this that fell apart right away then we had a Nike one that lasted a few months but when I saw this made by Jansport I knew I should grab it because they make well made items It is made from a very thick material and I trust that it will last awhile I m even ordering a few more now 
4 0 My daughter uses it for her school book bag I works well as a book bag and not as balky as many backpacks are as long as you do not need something larger 
5 0 Integrity Air Rowing Machine 3000 Just what I was looking for Easy to put together and easy to use Gives a good workou 
5 0 Great Value for your money Like other reviewers I also posted this review for the identical product sold directly by Amazon which is where I purchased it Let me start out by saying that this rower is not perfect It is in fact flawed As you may have noticed I still gave it a five star rating and I will try to explain the reasons for doing so Reading the reviews here I noticed two complaints One pointing out that this machine doesn t perform to the same standards that professional gym rowers do and the other regarding assembly of this machine I researched the various rowers available in the market for quite a while I spent a lot of time and effort driving around and trying various models before purchasing this one simply because I tend to be an informed shopper who wants to get value for his money During my research it became very evident that my favorite rower is a Water Rower followed by Schwinn s WindRigger both were extremely smooth in their operation Both were also about 1000 At any rate these sophisticated rowers gave me a benchmark against which to compare the Integrity and it should surprise nobody that the Integrity doesn t really come close to the performance of either of the other two rowers And it shouldn t given it substantially lower price And this is exactly what it important in considering this rower You cannot expect to get a professional grade rower for such a low price just like you cannot expect to get the comfort and performance of a Rolls Royce if you are buying a Honda Nonetheless what you DO get from Integrity is well within the parameters of what I would expect for about 200 The machine is reasonably stable it is reasonably smooth and it does provide a great workout The noise level is also not too bad and actually seems less than that of the WindRigger The electric monitor is basic and provides speed time calories burned and distance It also provides an option that continuously cycles through all these functions so you cant track all of them during your workout The seat is comfortable and slides smoothly along the track and the whole thing actually has a pretty professional look to it and doesn t appear flimsy I was also quite surprised by the level of resistance this rower provides it is much more than that of the Schwinn WindRigger In addition resistance can be adjusted pretty easily I think my only disappointment is that the air flow created during operation is not channeled toward the person using the machine to aid in cooling him her down but this is certainly a flaw I can live with As a potential buyer you should also be aware that the rower tends to slide across smooth surfaces such as tile which means you need to have a non slip mat under it if you intend to use it on such a surface As I said before I also read that at least one person had a problem assembling this rower I cannot confirm this problem Assembly was extremely easy and quick even though the instructions are not the greatest However it should be quite clear to most people where parts go and what needs to be hooked up where Winding up the chain onto the gear wheel is a breeze too All you need to do is unhook it from the retracting cord that you hooked it up to one or two steps before I suppose the person who wrote the instructions could have switched these steps to make it more logical but as I said the instructions are not great Taking all these factors into account I think Integrity provides a fantastic product for a very low price It does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does so in a surprisingly good manner However as with any product your expectations should be realistic and if they are you will not be disappointed If you expect a gym quality machine you will not get what you are looking for If however you are looking for a basic functional rower without all the bells and whistles of high end products then this is probably the best deal you can get 
4 0 So far so good So far the rower works fine although I have problems with my shoes slipping out of the foot holds Assembly was relatively easy although the instructions could be more explicit 
5 0 Good for the money This rowering machine is just what I wanted It is very affordable and provides a good work out It moves smoothly the readout is clear No problems with it 
5 0 sweet rower I have never ordered something like this from the web before but after reading the positive reviews here decided to do it I could not find a rower in town for less than 800 This rower is sweet and arrived in Idaho from the east coast 6 DAYS after I ordered it from amazon It was easy enough to assemble and works great I am a middle aged woman weighing around 175 under the max rower limit of 250 and feel safe and comfortable when I m rowing Also the seat is cushioned and it glides easily on the track I do not find it loud at all and kind of like the cool swishes of air when I m rowing You won t be sorry ordering one of these and I think it s a way more fun way to get in shape Get one 
4 0 It s Fine It was easy to put together The shipping was fast The only weird thing is that the feet are not stationary Your feet tilt forward when you slide into the catch And it does not show a split and I still haven t figured out how to see the speed in meters alone and not mph But if you just want to exercise and not record numbers its good 
5 0 Great buy Hi I just posted a review for the same product but shipped by Amazon and I thought that I d copy review here for your convenience Quick note though The one sold by Amazon has free shipping so definitely take a look Why I Bought it I like to workout about 4 5 days a week but I live in LA and it s sometimes hard to get to the gym if I work late or if there s traffic Also my neighborhood is not so nice so I prefer to avoid jogging at night Enter the Fitness Quest Integrity 3000 Air Rower Assembly If you can assemble Ikea furniture or a coffee table from Walmart then you can assemble the rower You put in about 4 pins and then hook a strap from the rower to a bungie cord under the seat Finito As far as tools go despite what the instructions say all you need is two wrenches Use a socket wrench about 10 at Target or Walmart and you ll be done even faster Quality The rower is of surprisingly good quality for the price It s made of a two piece aluminum frame and feels sturdy At first I was a little skeptical about the chain connecting the rower handle because it looks really small and cheap o But after a 30 minutes of hard rowing I could tell that the chain was more than adequate One reviewer on the Target website said that the chain exploded into a million pieces while she was rowing Maybe she had a faulty chain who knows All I know is that I can row 150 pounds on the weight stack at the gym but there s no way I could shatter that chain simply by rowing As a stress test I even rowed as hard as I possibly could and the rower was fine Performance The performance of this thing is really great The resistance level and smoothness is as good as the cardio rower I use at the gym This is an air rower so the resistance increases the harder you pull Additionally you can increase the resistance by wrapping the tension strap around its base one time before connecting it to the cord under the seat The seat slides very easily and the foot pads swivel to allow your ankles a little more freedom to move Also the rower folds vertically for easy storage When it s folded the rower is about 4 feet tall and takes up about 2 square feet of floor space It easily fits in a closet or in the corner Although it s too wide to fit under a bed Value Great value My buddy has a rower that costs twice as much and the difference is hardly noticeable The performance is great and if you buy the Amazon item you get it tax free and with free super saver shipping I looked at a couple of other rowers mainly piston rowers and nothing even came close to this level of quality and performance for the price Issues The only negative thing I can say is that it is a little noisy even for an air rower For those of you who have never used an air rower the resistance is created by a big fan which makes a whoosh whoosh sound when you row The noise isn t terrible but it prevents you from hearing the TV or radio clearly even with ear phones Summary So all in all I think that this is a fantastic value The quality is great and the performance is fantastic I highly recommend this product 
5 0 I bought a pack for Africa Bought the pack for a 23 day trip to Africa I would highly recomend this pack to anyone Carried on the plane easily stored Holds any thing you can think to pack with very little stress on your back 
5 0 JanSport Odyssey Backpack I bought this for my daughter to use for college based on previous reviews praising roominess and good support The backpack is great with lots of different compartments and shoulder and waist straps that really help balance the weight My daughter is able to carry her laptop numerous books gym clothes and a huge waterbottle to get her through the day 
5 0 Outstanding Pack One Happy Customer I ve been a JanSport fan for over 20 years and have owned various backpacks and packs and I always come back to JanSport You just can t beat the quality and durability of a JanSport I have to say without a doubt the Odyssey is an outstanding pack for what it is designed for It has tons of room is well thought out loaded with features and most importantly comfortable to wear even fully loaded I use if for commuting every day and frequent travel for work I can load it up with my laptop an extra sweater or light jacket my portfolio and still have plenty of room for all of those extra things you need when traveling If you re looking for a high quality pack that s versatile loaded with features and comfortable look no further 
5 0 Best Book Backpack I have had many backpacks for school and am always left wanting more space I like to have different places to put different materials This gives me the opportunity to do so I like the fact that I can put my Ipod in a section that is not likely to recieve the weight of the many books I use I would say that the area where you hold the smaller items such as pens and calculators is nice You have dividers where you can hold many different things Overall this is the best pack for school I have come across 
5 0 Jansport Odyssey This is the best Jansport has always made an outstanding product This is the third one I have owned Plenty of room and just right size 
5 0 Great Backpack for air travel I bought this pack as a substitute for bulky roller bags It works great but if you stuff it to the maximum you may have to compress it down a bit for some overhead racks The separate compartments give you plenty of flexibility and it will accomodate a shirt folded as received from most laundries The padding is excellent and the weight distribution makes it very easy to carry I will also use this as a day pack for hiking although it has more space than generally needed for this The organizer section works well to carry cell phone PDA or any other miscellaneous items Construction is excellent and it is versatile enough to accomodate a wide range of uses Great value at the price charged 
5 0 Great capacity holds 17 powerbook I needed a replacement for my Targus backpack that I used to haul my 17 powerbook This pack is lighter smaller which is a good thing the Targus was huge yet has as much useful pack space as the Targus I vastly prefer it the only question is that of durability but as my last Jansport pack lasted 5 years and my Targus only lasted 1 5 before blowing a zipper I ll give Jansport the benefit of the doubt Supremely comfortable two water bottleholders a bladder slot and plenty of pockets Top notch 
5 0 Excellent These are great I have flat feet if you have this problem then you should own a pair of them No cons Though you have to be careful taking them out of the shoes 
5 0 Graphite Sof Sole ARCH Support from DowntownBooksellers AVAILABLE FOR ONLY 36 99 from Downtownbooksellers on the AMAZON website Do NOT pay more 
5 0 The worlds best kickstand This is the world best kickstand and comes in black and alloy It is light easy to fit and has a great spring I now have one on all three of my mountain bike 
5 0 F9000 review Very well constructed The ratchet release ankle feature is well worth the extra money and feels very secure I did notice in the exercise booklet that comes with this unit which was written for all types of inversion not necessarily for this product that an inversion chair is recommended for lower back pain as opposed to an inversion table For myself I am thinking I should have bought an inversion chair because as a two time back laminectomy surgery patient L 4 L 5 laying flat on my back causes discomfort and I have experienced slight discomfort using this product when returning to the upright position to dismount I have experienced professional physical therapy traction while on laying my back with my thighs pointed up 90 degrees and my calves resting on a stool parallel with the table and the traction pulling from my hips I always felt great after those treatments but I don t feel that using the table In all the research I did prior to purchasing the inversion table I unfortunately found nothing that clearly recommended the inversion chair for persons with lower back pain I do have a gripe about the delivery of this product It came in two large boxes one each about a week apart and someone has to be there to sign for it That was a scheduling problem for us and would have rathered they came at the same time This is a high quality product but for my lower back ailments I think I should have purchased a inversion chair instead 
4 0 No more pain killers I am new in the inversion therapy arena and have limited knowledge both theoretical and applied in this field However I felt compelled to try it out after reading a bit about is as I was in desperate need to stop taking pain killers for my back when I sleep almost every other night I ve been using the Teeter F9000 consistently for about 3 4 weeks every morning Results were immediate From the first day itself I ve noticed my back doing much better I don t take painkillers any more and I can t tell you what a relief it is not to inject my body with poison painkillers I combine the inversion with some back and posture exercises that came with the machine free CD and the combination has worked its wonders So far so good I am extremely satisfied with this purchase The machine quality is much better than I expected and I am glad I ve spent the extra money for the padded leg area 
5 0 Easy to assemble easy to use great for your back I couldn t be happier with this table I hemmed and hawed for over a year as I researched all of the different tables While I debated over spending the money on an inversion table my back continued to worsen It finally occurred to me that for what I was spending on my chiropractor to perform traction on my back I have a herniated disk I could probably buy a few of these tables Now that I have it I m thrilled Others here have written great in depth reviews and I don t need to repeat what they ve said I just want to say to anyone debating the merits of getting an inversion table just go ahead and do it 
5 0 Amazing back health This is truely an amazing piece of equipment for back and body health I suffered from a herniated disc while I was pregnant and had some difficulty taking it easy on my back post partum as I have little children at home to take care of After spending many hours and with a chiropractor I realized that traction is a very healing process for keeping the spine in alignment and the disc properly hydrated Everything you read about for the positive healing aspects of inversion are true I had the opportunity to use the Teeter Hang Ups with the ankle release for a while and I must say I am extremely pleased with the F9000 Although the quality of the both the ankle release table and the rachet system is the same the F9000 is worth the extra expense The ankle release is harder to release because it requires a stronger pull from the handle Plus you have to reach all the way to the ankles after a good inversion stretch For anyone needing inversion because of stress or injury to the back I just don t recommend bending to the ankles The ankle release requires two movements one hand is needed to pull the ankle handle release and the other hand is needed to lift the piece away enough to get your feet out The rachet system is completely different The rachet system is a push button that releases the hold on the ankles and with the same hand you simply move it away from you Not only do you not have to bend all the way to your ankles just to the knees it is also a simple easy release I wondered if I wanted to spend the extra money for a rachet system but now that I tried both I have no doubt the extra expense was more than well worth it 
5 0 Hanging my my ankles volunarily We like to incorporate back exercise in our workout routine and after trying out a friend s inversion table we decided to get one for our home gym After considering various brands we settled on the Teeter Hang Ups convinced by their ad showing extensive stress and strength testing If you are hanging by your ankles upside down you want the best inversion table there is no doubt about it Why Invert The reason to use an inversion table is to stretch your spine Normally you stand and your legs and pelvis and stomach support the spine When you sit you increase the pressure on the spine by resting on your coccyx tailbone So for people who sit all day inversion can actually act like traction using gravity to pull the vertebrae and decompress the spine As you hang or lean at various angles from 20 degrees to 90 degrees totally upside down your head gets more blood your stomach muscles lengthen and stretch and your shoulders relax because you put your arms fully over your head You can gradually build up your angle from 20 degrees allowing you to adjust to the new feeling in your head and spine You can use the table to do rocking down to your set angle back up to level or vertical or you can do intermittent traction 1 2 minutes down 1 2 minute up In the fully suspended 90 degree position your body is literally hanging by your ankles and you can do twists sit ups squats and back arches This is not possible in the shallower angle positions as you are lying on the table in those positions as opposed to freely hanging with spine straight You may not use any bands weights or other equipment while on the table You MUST wear tie shoes with flat even soles no thick soles no high tops A standard pair of trainers running or walking shoes with ties works just fine What you get The table is a flat nylon bed resting on a steel A frame The bed rotates like a teeter totter There is an ankle clamp on the bottom to hold your feet securely and a pin lock height adjustment to set the table to the right height for you which may be 1 or 2 inches above or below your actual height depending on your center of gravity There are handles extended or normal for the arms There is an anti rattle adjustment screw to prevent unwanted shimmy The table is not powered you operate it with your body weight using your arms to add upper body weight to take you down to your desired position The unit is based on an A frame that collapses for folding and storage the hinges lock like on a folding table and there are clips on the base to stabilize the base on the floor The 5000 has optional over easy extension arms longer arm pieces that allow the user to move their hands and arms up and down to move to inverted more easily Mine were included in a promo A safety strap can be used to limit inversion to set degrees such as 20 40 or 60 degrees The table will automatically stop and the maximum degree you set and prevent you from inverting more than is comfortable for you When starting out have a friend to stay with you in case of dizziness or other discomfort The Teeter Hang Ups comes with a 90 page book Better Body on inversion ours turned up missing and we had to call customer service and a 14 minute video on set up safety and recommended use This is a must watch If you do not have a way to play a DVD you should find some way to do so as the information is vital to adjusting the table to your height and the safety information tells you how to secure your ankles against falls which head down are very dangerous Needless to say children should be monitored closely while using the inversion table The unit also comes with a laminated use guide that clips to the table with a chain This is a nice touch and important as safe usage is paramount when inverting The table weighs 62 pounds and measures 45 inches x 28 inches x 58 inches The maximum height for any user is 6 6 the minimum is 4 8 Maximum weight 300 pounds There are accessories available such as gravity boots that allow full inversion to be more comfortable on the ankles The standard ankle clamp is a soft rubber cup in back of the ankle with a pin lock rubber padded bar for the top of the instep When locked into the clamp your foot is secured above the ankle bone by firm pressure It seems you have to add a t bar to use the gravity boots The boots also afford a gentler angle to the joints so if you have joint problems and find the ankle clamp uncomfortable you might want to spring for the extra 100 it costs to upgrade to the boots Assembly was just a few pieces it took longer actually to watch the DVD We don t bother to fold it up because it s in our basement gym but it would fit in the corner of a master bedroom and if you lived in a small apartment it can be folded for under bed or against a wall How does it feel I am SO happy with my table While I normally don t like to be upside down I love the feeling of stretching my spine while I hang downwards I have not achieved the 90 degree setting yet but I am confident I will do so I use the table first thing in the morning to stretch after sleeping and it makes me stand up after I get off like I had a ballet workout stomach relaxed shoulders down chest out and relaxed Five minutes literally feels like I had an hour nap so I do this when I come home or at lunchtime BEFORE EATING if I am working at home I don t do it after I eat I never do it with a full stomach right after eating I do the intermittent traction most of the time When I get up to the full inversion at 90 degrees I plan to try some of those crunches which are said to be equivalent to 10 regular crunches Warranty Information Teeter Hang Ups home use inversion products are backed with a full 5 year warranty During

5 0 Most Healthy sugar replacement I ve found By all indications this stuff is really easy to use and is best for our health I m on my second shipment and highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in keeping their health while enjoying a sweet flavor Tastes just like sugar without any negative attributes 
5 0 Great product but a little vague I really like the product my snowboard rack hooked up great to my car and I am happy There are a few things I didn t enjoy There is no key lock it has a mechanism to keep it locked but it is annoying to get it unlocked Also I couldn t find anywhere in the product description how many clamps were included 4 and I ended buying two Needless to say I didn t have to and you don t either 
5 0 Jansport backpack I have been completely satisfied with Jansport backpacks They are very well made and I love the guarantee The straps are more comfortable than other backpacks purchased My 14 year old son has had one for three years and it is still in great condition Previous cheaper backpacks have lasted a year or two at the most This model has lots of zipper pockets in different sizes for storing just about anything you d want to put in a backpack Great product 
4 0 Sturdy Stylish Backpack Very Roomy I ve had this backpack for about 5 months now and I still have a great opinion of it It holds many books and folders It can also accomodate my Inspiron laptop with a 15 4 screen The backpack doesn t have an included laptop sleeve so I found a solution by buying the Sumdex Padded Large Laptop sleeve which isn t very expensive but very protective and a perfect fit and just putting the Laptop in the sleeve then putting the sleeve into my backpack Even after doing so I still had room for a couple of books Keep in mind that this does make it a large backpack slightly bulky so if you aren t in need of something with such a high capacity then this might not be the backpack for you The backpack doesn t have a lot of organization as far as dedicated slots for pencils pens etc It just has a few smaller zippered openings If you have a lot of stuff in them you will be having to fumble around your things I didn t find this too troublesome overall though The backpack is comfortable and seems to be holding up pretty well against all the weight of my nursing books etc I am happy with my purchase as I always have been with Jansport purchases 
5 0 Great quality and lifetime warranty Hey I decided to review some things I didn t buy off Amazon but I have owned for sometime that are really great items the kind I would buy again for sure if they were lost I would say lost or broken but Jansport has lifetime warranties If anything happens to your backpack all you have to do is mail it to Jansport with a note of the problem they will fix it for FREE and send it back to you They will even send you a card while they have it telling you it misses you and will be back soon Overall these are such great products you just have to get a Jansport if you re thinking of a backpack Also I am in a review writing competition with a friend of mine and if this review is helpful which I hope it really is I would love to have your yes vote With Care Sa 
5 0 Very Pleased I bought this for my son 2 1 2 yrs who is very interested in golf I wasn t sure if it would fit him well but the clubs were perfect for him The bag it came with was well made and the clubs were great for beginner clubs It also came with balls and tees after looking at many stores I found this to be a great deal 
5 0 good stuff good stuff does what its supposed to a lot of sweat produced when treadmilling with it 
5 0 Works D I had bought this item just for fun but it turns out that this really does work I love this and don t bother buying the larger version of this I am almost 100 percent sure that nobody who cares about their fitness and personal health wont fit into this size It gives support to your back which is nice when working out I had went out to play some basketball with my friend today and after i removed the belt I had sweat so much in my abdominal area This really does work D If you have back rpoblems want to tone lose weight then this is for you I am turning 14 but please do not dismiss this review as if someone that lacks knowledge wrote it ^^ feel free to check my wishlist X 
5 0 Solar Belt It actually works quite well as long as you use it how it s suppposed to be used You cant just strap in on and have rock hard abs It s purpose is to sweat away the water fat your body has thus making it easier to lose weight and tone I use it riding my bike and while I am working out and it does the job

5 0 Great product I purchased this knife 6 7 years ago for my husband and it is still in great shape The swiss army quality is fantastic I can t even tell you how many times this has gone through the washer I was glad to see this knife on Amazon just in time for Christmas I purchased 2 more You do not have to worry about the shamrock coming off because it is embedded in the plastic It s a great little knife especially for a Notre Dame fan 
5 0 AWSOME I purchased a ripstik and let me tell you THE BEST THING TO RIDE Whenever I go down the street everyone stares and ask what is it They all say they want one too The best thing of all is riding hills I can even go up them but when you go down its like snowboarding I recommend this 100 
5 0 RazorX Ripstick Rocks Owning 2 ripsticks for the kids in our household is not enough My husband and I are also hooked Looks like we ll need 2 more Fun fun fun Best on a smooth surface indoor tile or concrete not black asphault Highly recommended for ages 10 100 
5 0 Go Figure I bought this for myself to play with I m 35 and after all the presents were opened and toys video games and everything were forgotten about 4 hours after Christmas this was the ongoing favorite of the season Everybody younger down to 8 and older to 45 had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching It s already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such This is a GREAT present for 11 18 boy Fair warning though there will be some good spills on the fairly short steep learning curve helmets knee pads blah blah are a must and a video camera 
2 0 Disappointed I was extremely disappointed that there was no step counter yet the booklet that comes with it talks about step counts I also found that for a certain amount of distance it didn t register any more distance I took it off my belt at mid walk and clipped it on my pocket Now looking at the review of juicemonster I realize now that the pressure of my sweater and jacket over the device had probably reset it Spend a few more bucks and get the Omron HJ 112 The reviews are excellent If you already own it and don t want to buy a new one either clip it on your pocket your body goes up and down with each step unless you re an accordion if you wear it on your belt do not wear anything over it or it will get reset 
5 0 Very sleek design Very comfortable Very Sexy I love my Adidas and needed a new pair for the upcoming semester I looked around at the stores and on eastbay and stopped when I saw the Samba Classics I like to wear shoes that are low cut and clean There were some other Adidas shoes that I would have picked but Adidas decided to put some weird birds and chickens or some other big ugly logo on the shoe which completely threw off the price These shoes are perfect in almost every way Clean look Classy Agressive styling Affordable I had these shoes for about a week These shoes run a bit thin so people with wide feet I advise you to get something else Other than that these shoes were a great buy They are really light weight and has that classic Adidas look that just sets it off from the competition How does the shoes feel On the inside it is a cotton like feel no leather on the heel or anything On the back of the shoe it is a white leather feeling material that has 3 etched lines On the front of the shoe it has a furry little leather feel It s kind of furry too The entire shoe is completely durable plastic leather feel It doesn t feel like rubber or anything The bottom of the shoe feels like what you run on at the trackmeet BUY THESE 
4 0 Decent Shoes I bought these shoes about 2 months and a half ago and have been wearing them alot they ve gotten wore down inside the insoles These shoes are nice for wearing here and there not for everyday use They re comfortable they run true to size but seem a bit too pointy 
4 0 Great Camping Grill After reading the poor review of this grill I knew that it wasn t how they all were I bought this for camping this summer and it performed very well We cooked steak hot dogs and hamburgers and egg sandwiches and coffee in the morning The only complaint that I have is that there really isn t a low setting on the stove There is either high or higher Overall though great grill would definately recommend it 
5 0 Stay simple Jack Leonard s story is mine too I ve carried this precise model knife since my parents brought me one from Europe in about 1964 I am probably on my 9th or 10th one This knife is optimal enough blades but not so many that you list as you walk And yes one blade sharp and the other abused I am re ordering this model even though I m carrying a backup model that is identical except for swapping out the corkscrew for a phillips screwdriver That s not good enough you can improvise the phillips but not a corkscrew 
5 0 that s what i want everything is fine since I purchased this knife from Amazon com it has most functions I daily use and not too much complicated by the way the price is good 
5 0 The original and still the best I received this knife as a gift from a Swiss business associate back in 1998 and have carried it nearly every day since I have to say that I am truly impressed with the amount of abuse this little tool can stand up to as it s been dropped countless times and overtorqued more often than I care to admit but has never failed to spring back open ready for the next task I can t tell you how many times a friend has brought a bottle of wine to a picnic or some remote location only to suddenly come to the panicked realization that he she forgot the corkscrew You wouldn t believe the gratitude as they hear the cork being removed by the unassuming little corkscrew on this knife One small tip sharpen the blades from time to time A minute on a standard cutlery sharpening steel is all it takes to have these little blades ready for some serious work 
5 0 Quality General Purpose Knife I carry at least one Swiss Army Knife with me every where I go except a plane of course This 3 1 2 inch all purpose tool is suitable for your pocket glove compartment or tool box This knife has dozens of uses for a do it yourselfer a gardener or a camper This little wonder has a large and small knife a corkscrew a punch a can opener with a flat blade screwdrive on the end a bottle opener with a flat blade screwdriver on the end and what purports to be a wire stripper on the side I have never used that a key ring tweezers and a toothpick This knife is water resistant and made of high quality components I tend to use the knives on the pocket knife more than any other tools After that I find that the combination of one of the knives and the tweezers are useful for splinters and thorns and thus the tweezers often become the third most useful tool I must admit that occasionally I use the toothpick particularly when real toothpicks are not available The smaller screwdriver blade is small enough that it can also fit into a Phillips head screw I have even been able to use the flat blade on some small internal hex head screws I have never used the corkscrew and I have used the punch as an awl The can opener blade has yet to be used on this knife as well The difficulty with carrying tools is that they can fill your pocket very quickly This small Swiss Army knife is small enough to fit into a purse or a pocket and yet large enough to be useful While the larger Swiss Army knives have even more and larger tools and blades they are also harder to carry Of course this particular knife will not replace a tool box but I find it amazing how many tasks I can accomplish with the simple tools available in this gem 
5 0 Warm and Comfy This is Therm a Rest s thickest sleeping pad It s soft too I ve used it many times during cold weather camping and I ve never felt the coldness of the ground It works very well in that regard and it s comfortable It s a great mat if you are camping for the weekend with a car or don t have any weight restrictions but if you are backpacking this is probably going to be too bulky For casual camping though especially in cold weather this is a wonderful sleeping pad 
5 0 great product I needed a small stool so I could reach the cabinets over my frig This stool is very sturdy and best of all it folds down so it takes very little storage space Poblem solved 
5 0 Don t Know Why I Didn t Have One Before I was making plans to take my 86 year old mother to Las Vegas She has a difficult time getting onto shuttles and busses so I thought this step stool would be just what we needed When folded it is so small I had no trouble carrying it with me everywhere we went up and down the Strip My Mom was able to go everywhere she wanted and do everything she wanted And when we got stranded in Detroit overnight on the way back the stool was a lifesaver on the shuttle to the hotel The step was so high that everyone on the bus wanted to use the stool I would recommend it to anyone considering buying it 
5 0 Guitar Step I purchased this item for my son who is taking guitar lessons and he need a foot rest and this turned out to be perfect for him 
5 0 Simple safe effective developer of forearm strength This device replicates in a less stressful manner in my opinion dumbbell wrist curls and wrist extensions While it may not provide the pure strength gains dumbbells do it is a good way to hit the same muscles in a less stressful manner There have been occasions over the years after hurting my elbow or wrist for whatever reason that dumbbell wrist curls and extensions have caused pain trying to do In fact I got this Valeo product for that very reason I was immediately able to use it without pain People with tendonitis know what I am talking about qhen I say it does not take much to aggravate it and once it s back it makes lfe miserable With this Valeo device you can still work your forearms grip strength yet do so within your game and pain free I have been very very happy with this product 
4 0 Ultrathon It is really good I wasn t attacked by mosquitoes or ticks for a long time at all 
5 0 Easy to use I like how you can zip out the mesh Really great for dining or camping 
4 0 Great watch that despite promises is NOT waterproof to 100m To my way of thinking there are only TWO factors which keep the Vector from receiving a full 5 stars here 1 is the watch face It is not very durable It isn t even glass It s made out of VERY easily scratched plastic I own several watches and even the plain glass face models scratch at the drop of a hat but this one takes it to a whole new level I d be worried to sneeze too close for fear it may implode 2 is the fact that despite the promises of being water resistent to 100 Meters ie 300 feet this watch isn t FAR from it You are in danger of ruining this watch if you even enter a bathroom while someone ELSE is taking a hot shower The humidity alone may cause problems Pretty sad when a watch advertised as at the very least capable in a pool cannot honestly pull off a basic shower in a bathtub Now with that said if you take care to avoid moisture whenever you can the Vector is a fine wrist computer that works quite well in a variety of areas It ll tell you the temperature under the right circumstances of course help you predict the weather give you a bearing on where you need to go and then after proper adjusting tell you your altitude I found the altimeter to actually be rather accurate oh and those reviews I have read on and off by folks bragging about telling the altitude INSIDE of a pressurized passenger plane are BOGUS Considering what this watch can do and it s limitations I believe that the price is a bit high you can buy a Casio watch that ll do the same thing and is solar powered AND is REALLY water resistent all for LESS but the Vector has one thing that not all Suunto watches or altimeter barometer compass watches come with that little bubble on the face which allows a more accurate determination of specific readings If Casio add s one to their model I ll probably become a full time convert If you are looking for something similar but smaller try looking at the Suunto Observer It s a dang good looking watch but the price is considerably more so that may be a rather important factor for you I know it is for me All in all Suunto makes great products but water resistent models are unfortunately NOT one of them unless you are going for one of their products that actually are designed for underwater use 
5 0 great watch this watch is one of the coolest watches i have ever seen i have read reviews and technical data about similer products like the casio pathfinder the pathfinder primaraly has the same fetures as the vector the difference is that the pathfinders altimeter can be off by 1400 or more in stable weather the vectors altimeter never really gets off more then 200 feet if you want one of the best watches avalable get the suunto vecto 
5 0 AWESOME This watch has everything needed to do anything I being a skier bought this watch to find my way back to base camp after a long day of skiing The watch a new the altitude of the base camp b the compass guided me on a specifc heading without flaw lt and gt c it held up to the harshest conditions that France had to offer Anyone who needs direction in the wilderness MUST have this watch 
5 0 love it im a step novice but i was able to follow after a few trys i love this product and heck you can just buy new dvds if you dont like the one provided i do tho 
5 0 TERRIFIC I wish I had purchased The Step before I wasted my money on a recumbent bike that didn t last six months I love it because it is easy to use takes up very little space and appears to be virtually indestructable I am also very fond of the included DVD featuring Cathe Friedrich 
5 0 Great step for home This is the perfect step for at home It s slightly shorter than steps you d typically find at gym clubs and the risers are rectangular instead of square and take up less space The risers also have cut outs on the bottom which are perfect for dyna bands or other resistance bands As for the video Cathe Friedrich is one of the best step instructors out there I ve been stepping for 14 years and found this routine to give a great cardio work out It definitely is not for the beginner however with time and repetition a beginner could pick it up Enjoy 
5 0 tnx real nice scarf super fast shipping sounds like 5 starts to me 
5 0 super warm super cool Couldn t be more satisfied unless it were autographed by Jeter Perfect for early spring games and the playoffs The best casual scarf ever 
5 0 Double Dutch Delivers Got great turnaround Now if only my kid could figure them out 
5 0 One of the best ever This is among the best skate videos ever I think most would agree The level of skating as well as the quality of filming and music create a full package here This would be worth it at twice the price Buy now be happy forever 
5 0 Be safe be seen This is a great light perfect for a be seen and backup light in addition to a stronger source The plastic handlebar mount failed on mine the first time out apparently cracking from vibration fatigue The customer support from Princeton was terrific though and they sent a replacement mount I contacted them on Friday and had the part Monday I may try to rig a velcro strap through the clip and attach that directly around the bar instead of using the supplied part 
4 0 Bright and light I bought the Eos to replace a small Cateye light that I had used as a helmet light until it unexpectedly died on me I commute by bike and I got over 3 000 miles of solid on or flashing light from the Cateye but I expected more The Eos costs about the same as the Cateye unit and uses the same AAA batteries I prefer AA for runtime I ll put up with the weight this is the only reason I didn t give the Eos 5 stars However the Eos light is bright nearly as bright as my 10 watt halogen main light The runtime is quite good I got over a week of commuting from the provided alkaline batteries before switching to rechargables The light doesn t seem dimmer on the rechargables unlike some other LED lights The Cateye required some ingenuity to mount on my helment the Eos comes with a proper helmet mount in addition to the handlebar mount It s clear that the light was originally designed to be mounted on a headband which is fine for me The battery compartment is secured by a small screw with a knurled edge for grip and seems reasonably waterproof I ve used it light rain with no problems and I don t expect the eventual downpour will cause any trouble either Bottom line I d buy it again This one s a winner 
5 0 An Inexpensive and Versatile See Light Cyclists recognize that headlights can be roughly placed into two categories 1 See lights that provide sufficient illumination to actually see where you are going and avoid obstacles and 2 See me lights that are really only about being seen from the front I commute with an HID light that is much brighter than this one but I like having a backup light and also like having a flashing helmet mounted light that I can point in any direction to get the attention of motorists particularly those approaching me from the side The Princeton Tec light is one of the few LED lights I ve enountered that truly qualifies albiet barely as a see light On the highest setting it produces a very well collimated beam that is just the right intensity and width to make it suitable for night riding at reasonable speeds The light is less suitable at the medium setting and unsuitable for that purpose at the lowest setting I have the same gripes as Kent about this light 1 It should have been designed to use AA batteries If it were made to use AA batteries instead of AAA batteries the light would be only marginally larger and heavier but the burn time would be greatly extended enough to make it suitable for ultra cycling events 2 The duty cycle of the flash mode is too low The light would be far more visible if the flash rate were increased by at least a factor of two or three Those complaints aren t a knock on the effectiveness of the light itself Just suggestions for improvments that could make a great light even better 
5 0 Good Ball I like the ball Personally my golf game isn t consistent enough to notice a difference if changing my balls actually help or not so I can t actually tell you if it s truly a good ball However I do like the look of the ball the price is nice I trust Nike Golf to be good quality and superstitiously I like feeling that bringing out my MOJO helps my game even if it doesn t 
5 0 Great Basketball at a great price I use these for a Men s League They are excellent and have a great tactile feel to them Great product 
5 0 Great Product that works better than I thought I am a elementary school teacher and I wanted something to project my voice on the playground We have megaphones that the school provides by they are constantly out of order for one reason or another I decided to purchase this to use at school and now all the other teachers want one to They like how such a small device can project my voice so far Now I feel that I can cover more area on the playground by using the megaphone rather than a whistle and the most important of all my students are alot safer because of it Thanks 
4 0 Champion Sports megaphone Just what you need where background noise is a little more than what you want to yell over for extended periods of time In a noisy area plan on being able to be heard well only within a couple hundred feet Well worth the 40 to be heard while saving your voice 
5 0 Compare and you will see for yourself SUPERIOR This is one of the best dip chin bars out there Completely stable and solid Just look at the design compared to other models that rock and shake wobble as you do your dips Looks great too Well worth the 60 more than the 100 versions and better than most of the higher priced ones I ve seend Needs some assembly but don t they all 
5 0 What ever happened to Nerf Can you belive that Nerf doesn t make foam balls anymore These are the best substitute that I have been able to find 
5 0 Hit A Way is Very Fun We bought the Hit A Way after using their Jr version for several years This is a fabulous concept for focused young ball player An excellent way to get the feel of precision batting 
5 0 Read The Instructions Before Use Read a previous buyers comments However I still purchased this for my 7 y o Because of said problems I made sure to read the instructions prior to use Yes I am a man so y all know how hard that was Anyway the most difficult part of the Hit a Way Pole was putting it away After the 1 3 minute set up time my 7 y o needed about 5 swings to get the hang of this product 30 minutes later he and my 16 y o had figured out how they both could use it at the same time Helmets suggested 2 hours later I had to literaly pull my boys away from it Two points to address from a previous buyer 1 If you attach the ends of the cable to the pole correctly the legs will not cause any interferance 2 If you do not hit the ball correctly it will not return unwind properly I would not call this a problem but a training use issue My sons quickly learned that a bad hit swing was very obvious which lead them to practice and master the proper hitting technique In short the ball failing to return was not caused by any part of the device but by improper hitting technique by the batter It is a very well built product and it is easy to set up take down and store Because of its construction it is a heavy product but the wheels aide in the ease of its placement and storage I would recommend this product Heck so does Derek Jetter and Reggie Jackson before him PS I set it back up and took a few swings myself Ok a whole lotta swings but don t tell the boys that their mom had to pull me inside to get me to stop Remember how to be a kid again have some patience fun and play ball 
5 0 Nice blankets I got these for my kids to take naps with at daycare They are warm and a good size not too small like some toddler blankets There was no choice of color they just sent me blue ones They did have to be washed a couple of times at first to get rid of a strong inky kind of smell but the smell has now vanished completely For basic blankets to keep in the car or use for picnics or sports events or the like these are a good deal 
5 0 Works Great This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have used it along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips I live a Florida skiing is far away The rack hasn t shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install Yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car 
5 0 The Miller Lite of Jerky If you re as much of a jerky lover as I am you face the always challenging dilemma How do I get that great jerky taste without the fat I need a jerky that tastes great AND is less filling Yes I was looking for the Miller Lite of the jerky and beef by product industries I m happy to report Ostrim s Ostrich Meat Snacks fits the bill Plus I despise Ostriches and derive great satisfaction that each bite is a victory over their ornithological empire Cull their winged herd I say They are nasty mean spirited creatures whose sole purpose is to fill my belly in between brunch and lunch Ahem Back on topic Let s face facts We can t eat bacon three times a day Two is the maximum so for a salty meat based replacement it isn t uncommon to reach for a bag of beef jerky Ostrim s revolutionary product gives you 13g of muscle building protein and only 1 5g of gross girl deterring fat per serving Yep 13g protein 1 5g fat 80 calories That well outperforms other bird derived by products Consider this USDA guidelines for meats such as Ostrich when used for non refrigerated meat sticks require the use of at least 3 traditional meats OSTRIM satisfies this requirement and is approved as a dry shelf meat stick bearing the USDA seal from Ostrim s own Web site Well sir if you can name me one other just ONE non refrigerated meat stick that uses at least 3 percent traditional meats AND provides 13g of protein then I sure would like to hear about it Until then my quasi meat grocery money is going to Ostrim 
5 0 Tasty I was looking for a snack that contained high protein and something I could eat when I was in a hurry or to while I was at work I was reccomended ostrim by a gym buddy of mine What a great purchase these things taste great and are very juicy One downside yet understandable I get extremely bad gas from these I didnt know I was capable of producing such pungent bombs until I ate a few of these Watch out of that so other than that side note these treats are worthy of buying Enjo 
5 0 Slim Jim eat your heart out I was always a huge fan of Slim Jims as a kid but quickly realized they were no good for me as I became an adult I recently discovered these at my local smoothie place and was pleasantly surprised at the taste and healthy nature It s an added plus to offer this up as a snack to my daughter We are very strict about healthy food and I know she feels a little left out sometimes not being able to enjoy the typical American junk food I would stay away from the flavors other than natural but that is simply a matter of taste I just wish they were less expensive I encourage everyone to start eating these so we can start to see the prices drop 
5 0 Great high protein product These little sticks are a great source of protein for that afternoon snack or pick me up or as an adjuvant to a regular diet It is low in fat and there are practically no carbs to speak of so it is ideal for those seeking a high protein diet for weight loss or weight training 
5 0 cut very big great for soccer as we read in the other reviews this track suit is cut very big took their advise and ordered smaller based on this great athletic wear great co to order from 
5 0 Only the BEST will do If you want to keep track of times and do a couple different times at once this is the stopwatch for you This is so easy to use and keeps track so well I would buy it again 
5 0 Great Somehow you don t slip when using this on a yoga mat How I have no idea but it works I liked how it really absorbs all the sweat from my hands and feet 
5 0 Yes it does work if you use it correctly People are apparently not following or are misunderstanding the basic instructions leading them to believe the pump doesn t work Here s what it says on the box that my similar Airstrike 950 came in With pump lever in UP position tighten screw cap to ensure proper seal The screw cap is the knobby appendage surrounding the stem connector The pump lever is on the opposite side and UP position means to move it away from the pump body You MUST first move the lever up and then tighten the screw cap in order for the pump to work Be sure to tighten it all the way until you encounter strong resistance Tightening the cap applies pressure to the rubber sleeve inside which causes it to bulge inward and form a good fit around the valve stem If you make the rubber sleeve TOO tight and it won t fit over the valve stem only then should you loosen the cap slightly until it will fit Lock lever in DOWN position Pushing the lever down applies the final bit of pressure to the rubber sleeve inside creating an airtight fit around the valve stem When you have the screw cap properly adjusted the lever will offer some resistance as you push it down and then it will lock in place against the body That s it Now you can use the pump When you re done flip the lever away from the body and remove the pump Now that we re over that hurdle the good news about the pump is that it s amazingly small and light and it works great for inflating sports balls which is the main thing I bought it for The only issue I ve found is that it s pretty hard to generate high pressure with the pump I m reasonably strong but am unable to inflate bicycle racing tires to their proper level using this In spite of that I m giving the pump five stars here to offset all of those ratings from the people who just didn t use it correctly 
1 0 wish I could give zero stars This product simply doesn t work I don t mean that it works poorly I mean it doesn t work It doesn t pump air into tires How a company could put their name on a product like this and put it into the marketplace is beyond me I will never ever buy a product by Bell again Ever 
5 0 Awesome We use it indoors during winter months works great Must have a 10 foot ceiling if using this indoors Most likely I will set is up in the back yard when the weather gets warmer It will be very handy to get a few practice shots every day CON This net requires two people to setup 
5 0 Great practice net This net is just what I was looking for Easy to assemble and dissamble and has a huge hitting area The net is tall enough that you can stand right in front of it to hit which makes it very unlikely that you will miss the net Too tall to use indoors unless you have 10 ceilings It seems to be constructed to last many years Won t have to go to the range anymore to improve my swing Get a good matt to go with it and you ve got all you should need for years of practice swinging bliss 
5 0 Great little radio This is a great little radio It gets good reception is lightweight can be secured for running jogging or hiking Nice companion to make my workouts go by faster 
5 0 Very compact lightweight and works great This tiny FM radio is ideal for running walking or just using whenever you want to listen to news or music It has great reception and it s not at all clunky or obtrusive It s a great little device that will come in very handy 
4 0 Luis Ramos I was somewhat please but numbers are a little dificult to see in daylight And you need to go to school to understand all its fiturees And it came without a case 
5 0 This is an excellent watch I bought this watch for the altimeter for climbing in Colorado I recently went in January and it worked nearly perfect Every location I could find an elevation marker the watch was within 10 feet The thermometer works well also it just cannot be on your wrist to read the temp correctly The watch looks great I wear it to work nearly every day I would highly recommend it 
4 0 A bit surprised I bought the X Lander because I am a pilot and wanted a bit more information when I needed it The watch is well designed and of good quality A few things did disappoint me but I think they are outweighed by the features however It appears that it does not have a second time zone Why they would not include this is beyond me As a pilot I want local time in 12hour format and zulu time in 24hr format A traveler would want time here and at home It is not there but is on other models they offer The dial is not the easiest to read and I had to use a magnifier to see the units information on setup such as feet vs meters and celsius vs farenheit The display needs to be more vivid The company does offer a white face with black numerals which might be better It is a nice watch but not the greatest execution of the concept especially for 300 
5 0 Almost Perfect I recently ordered this watch from Amazon as a companion for a LTt Observer to wear in the field While the Observer is a more updated model they both share very similiar features and ease of operation My first recommendation is that you do order this from amazon com and be wary of the same item offered by market place sellers At the time I initially placed the order amazon com was out and the wait was estimated to be 3 to 5 weeks Since the item was also offered by another seller in amazon s referral system I placed an order and wound up with the wrong watch turns out the market place seller didn t carry the black face model Fortunately amazon got a supply in and shipped my watch within 24 hours good service The black face is a little hard to come by Now then to the watch itself First of all it IS big but very light almost as light as the titanium Observer I have The larger face makes it easier to read and Suunto has apparently gone back to the leather waterproof band which I prefer Functionally the watch is a full blown time keeper and non GPS navigation system including stop watch chronometer functions an accurate altimeter a barometer and digital compass Both the compass and the altimeter are as accurate as I ve found in analog portable units The alarms are sufficiently loud unlike the only chink in the Observer and my only criticism is that the back light is weak compared to the Observer but that fault doesn t draw anything away from the 5 star rating Add the user replaceable battery Suunto makes a kit that includes the battery a water dust seal and a new cap the intuitive operating system and you have the ultimate back country time piece Suunto was the first to offer this type of time piece and in my opinion still offers the best I ve used their diving computers and field compasses for years and am a fan of the company s many products I don t think there s a clunker in the catalog 
5 0 Excellent Watch This watch screams high tech and anyone venturing off to a comic book convention is bound to get a few nods from people dressed in Sith Lord garb and even a wicked witch or two So it s big real big but cool If you want a little more discreet go with the Observer The new synthetic band that has replaced the leather is a real improvement After all whoever heard of a sports watch with a leather band The idea is absolutely absurd HOWEVER the back eyelit got chafed and worn away the first two weeks Of course it doesn t show but it s annoying especially considering this isn t an el cheapo watch If you re into mountain biking running swimming hiking or training of any sort this is the watch for you It doesn t have super sports specific functionality but in my experience I ve never used stuff like that in any case so this watch accomodates me perfectly And women DROOL over it Well sorta 
5 0 Super Fun Personal Accessory and Water Bottle This is an upscale designer water bottle top of the line and so much fun The designs Of Sigg s water bottles are gorgeous from the plain solid color bottles to the ones with intricate designs They are simply beautiful I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns thinking it would take more work to maintain These do necessitate regular cleaning I clean mine every day but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun Sort of like my rings glasses and watch I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory reminding me to drink more water making a statement about my values and expressing myself with a special design Yes all in a water bottle Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality made of light aluminum on the outside slightly insulated and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles They are light durable and perfect for any activity Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles just like from the tap Sigg bottles come with several different types of tops I bought the screw top because I don t like sports tops and I don t mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink It is totally leakproof which is important to me The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner I get comments on it all the time What s that I love it The sports top version is ok I just am not a fan as I don t feel like I can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top However for convenience you might prefer it For children there is a cap type top All are leak proof If you are ever unsatisfied with the top you can buy a screw top separately to fit your Sigg bottle Sigg makes their personal water bottle in 6L and 1L in this style I have both I use the 6L for sports activities because they are smaller When I won t have to carry the container I like the larger bottle Sigg also makes a smaller 3L bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people You can buy Siggs in alternative sizes too such as 75L 4L for kids 6L 5L You can occasionally find this bottle in the 1 5L size also Search Amazon for the perfect size Pick a style and pattern you like as this bottle is a personal accessory and should reflect your style The colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on Amazon They are expensive but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health so they are well worth it value wise for me Highly recommended 
5 0 Slumberjack Whoolie Worm Toddler Sleeping Bag I bought this for my 20 month old son for daycare because at his school the children take naps in sleeping bags It was a little more money than your average small sleeping bag at Target but it was well worth it It is so soft well made cute pattern and thick I highly recommend it Also it says only to hand wash it and let it air dry I hate mildewy smells so I just threw it in the washer and then in the dryer it came out perfect and dried completely My son loves it too 
5 0 Sky Caddie SG3 a winner 3 of my buddies with SG2 s have upgraded to SG3 after seeing mine Screen uses larger bold numbers and is easier to read Grahics are excellent and very helpful versus SG1 or 2 Easy to learn and use I get 2 1 2 rounds before needing to replace the AA batteries Decided to buy rechargable AA batteries to save the environment You may want to consider the SG4 with the built in rechargable battery

4 0 Great pedometer This is my second one of these I lost the first one I have had absolutely no problem I think the trick to getting it to work is measuring your normal day to day stride so it will always record your steps no matter your speed I gave it a 4 because yes the directions seem at first to be difficult but I figured out what they meant and found it easy to setup 
4 0 I loved my pedometer This was the most reliable pedometer I have owned so far and I ve had a few duds It worked great for 3 years until I dropped it on a hard tile floor and it broke I esp like the button guard I have the fancy Omron pedometer but it s too easy to accidentally push the wrong button I am definitely getting another one of these pedometers 
1 0 Not dependable Having used this pedometer for several weeks I have found that it does not always record your activity Like a previous reviewer I have noticed from my first usage that it may not record your steps when you are not walking quickly But in the past few days I have also found that it does not always record vigorous walking either It simply stops recording entirely at times I have another pedometer costing less than half of what this one cost without all the bells and whistles but it is accurate and dependable This product is not only not worth the price being charged for it but given its inaccuracy is not worth any price 
5 0 Excellent and Fun The Kit is just what I needed to start my at home workout program Can t say enough about the lay out of the workouts and the bands I also recommend the Backsmart fitness Plan I have been using both of these workouts and Green s other books and making great progress

5 0 Excellent Dribble Glasses Thank you for an excellent product I think these glasses are not obtainable in Europe except ordering via internet from the U S Only a few basketball coaches know about their existence You should begin to deliver to Europe also Now you deliver only in the U S I got my glasses with the help of an American friend 
5 0 Solid Steel These are extremely sturdy made from metal no plastic at all Not plastic like the other ones in this price range Also can change height 
5 0 This is the one to get By studying reviews on Amazon and elsewhere I narrowed my choice to this Stamina 15 4600a bike or the similarly priced Lifecycle I had a hard time choosing could have gone either way I also considered recumbent bikes costing far more I ve seen some misleading or exaggerated reviews before but guess what this bike really is that good You are probably considering paying hundreds more because you are skeptical something this cheap could be very good I think for 90 of people this is definitely good enough It s compact and low which means we are comfortable putting it in our living room where a bigger bike would have been an eyesore in the way It s also comfortable wide seat good handle grip and sturdy doesn t wobble in use There is a low gap in the space between the seat and pedals great for mobility impaired people so they don t have to high step to straddle it as they would most bikes However mobility impared people will have anything to pull themselves up with on this bike since everything is low There is nothing to obstruct your view which makes this great to place in front of a tv I think this is a fantastic buy I encourage you to stop looking and just get this one 
4 0 Easy to use Needed a recumbent bike for physical therapy on knees It is comfortable and easy to use as opposed to the upright bike Seat is cushioned and bars on sides are very convenient I need to go forward and backward for different muscles so it works just fine enjo 
5 0 Does the job well It is very quite breaks down easily for quick storage and is rather small making it a perfect addition to my dorm room Having put over 150 miles on it so far I can honestly say I have no complaints 
5 0 Stamina 15 4600A Recumbent bike Very good product for the money Substantial weight so you do not feel like you are not stable and the electronics while simple work fine for time tracking etc I highly recommend if you want an easy to assemble comfortable recumbant bike that fits easily in limited space Good product 
5 0 Great bike for price I purchased this as a Christmas present for myself and couldn t be happier Fits great in a small space and is extremely quiet I had read other reviews about customers receiving this item damaged in shipping I did not have that problem and found the bike very simple to assemble Can t go wrong with this especially for the price 
5 0 Future MLS player My son will not play soccer without this headband He loves it 
5 0 Great Company Quick shipping Item was on backorder and they sent an upgrade Great customer service 
5 0 Good Services and Faster Delivery I ordered it on Dec 6 and already received it Compared with the similar ones in local malls the quality is high and price is low even with the shipping cost I sure will buy stuff from the company again 
1 0 Very poor customer service I recently purchased and returned a Bowflex Ultimate 2 and I wanted to convey just how disappointed I was with the whole experience My equipment arrived on January 10th As I opened the boxes I realized that not only were there no assembly instructions there weren t any user instructions on how to modify the machine to do the different exercises I contacted Bowflex immediately and was told that a mistake had been made but that I could download the assembly instructions from the website I was also told that a user manual would be sent to me One week later on January 17th I contacted Bowflex because I had not yet received the user guide and because during the assembly of the Ultimate 2 I noticed that one of the plastic balls that prevents the cables from coming off the cables was broken The representative I spoke to again pledged to send me a user manual and a replacement ball so that I could use the machine I asked if they could be overnighted because the machine was unusable to me with the broken ball which allowed the cable to pull through and without a users guide The representative said she would expedite the order but that she could not overnight it She told me she could not tell me for certain when it would arrive By the end of day Friday January 19th it was apparent to me that the items would not be arriving before the weekend and that it would be more than three weeks from the day I ordered the machine before I would be able to use it It was very frustrating to me that Bowflex would not overnight these items so I could fix and use the machine as soon as possible These items did not arrive until 7 days later making it a full month from the date of my order before the equipment would have been functional For these reasons I elected to return the equipment to Bowflex I was expecting far better customer service for something that cost over 2 000 Making matters far worse was the cost for me to return the items to Bowflex Using UPS as Bowflex recommended and knowing that the cost for Bowflex to ship the items to me was about 200 I expected it to cost about 200 to ship the items back to Washington However because all returns must go to Virginia the cost to ship the items via UPS Ground in the original boxes to Virginia was 489 more than double the original amount I m assuming that two reasons explain the cost difference 1 Bowflex must get some sort of discount from UPS for all of its shipping traffic 2 naturally it is more expensive to ship from California to Virginia than it is to ship to Washington Regardless of the reason my Bowflex ownership experience was only made worse by the fact that I had to spend 25 of the original purchase price to ship the item back This whole experience has made it very difficult for me to ever have anything good to say to anyone about my experience owning Nautilus equipment 
5 0 Don t leave home without it I ve been carrying a Leatherman Squirt S4 for about 5 years During that time I ve lost two of them When that sad day comes I always immediately replace it Don t let the size fool you If you re looking for a really useful little tool that is also unobtrusive you will not go wrong with the S4 It is perfect for handling those daily little office and home chores 90 of the time I reach for the scissors They operate smoothly and cut well The actual knife blade is small but works well enough considering the size and it ideal for cutting tape on a mail package The tweezers can be used to remove that occassional splinter I did make the mistake of buying a Micra at one point The S4 is a much more refined and useful tool The S4 has nice smooth edges for comfortable carry and you can use the tools without opening the scissors In contrast the Micra has rough edges and awkward functional design 
5 0 Great handy tool This is my first Leatherman brand tool although I have owned other fold out imitations This thing works smoothly and is incredibly light Very handy for the pocket or the keychain This will be one tool that will be in my camping bag 
5 0 great pull up bar It s a great product and I use it everyday It s easy to assemble and easy to mount I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to improve on their pull ups My pull ups have gone from 11 to 19 in a month 
5 0 good product I use this product with my P90X workout DVD s and it is excellent gives you the workout you need to build your upper body muscle 
5 0 Exactly as advertised Unmistakably easy to assemble Installs even quicker The only drawback would be the small divots left on the trim Otherwise fantastic 
4 0 Works great but directions are lacking Received my Door Gym yesterday had it put all together in about 5 minutes and I was up and hanging Also worked great for pushups With such poor directions it took a couple of minutes to figure out what bolts should go where but once I did it was a cinch For those that had problems with assembly or are considering purchasing the Door Gym here s the deal The hex head bolts are installed vertically where the 90 degree bend tubes connect to the horizontal bar Use the silver washers with these The rounded bolt heads are the ones used to attach the plastic bar to the two 90 degree bend tubes together at the back and will be installed horizontally Use the smaller black washers with these Looking underneath the rounded bolt head you will see that it is four sided for a short length and not round Now looking at the plastic bar with the pad if you look in the holes where the bolts go you will see that they have a square opening The square part of the bolt HAS to be pushed into the square opening If it s not you won t have the length necessary to securely screw on the cap nut This is why several people had issues with it Great product and would be even better if it had easily understood and complete directions 
5 0 Works wonders I love my door gym Used it for over a year no issues Actually gave my first one to family becaused they loved it so much and had to get another Holds my weight well and works for both the pullup and ab workout Great product 100 satisfaction 
5 0 Works great This is really a neat invention I live in an apartment and didn t have any place to do pull ups Bought this item and problem solved It s rock solid and very easy to install and uninstall It does leave some minor marks on the frame but no big deal 
5 0 Works as advertised simple and effective After reading the reviews I wondered if I d be able to assemble this product It s hard to be certain when half the reviews say completely worthless and the other half say awesome product After the speedy delivery by Karate Depot I was satisfied It took less than 10 minutes to put together The screws for some reason are just barely long enough to fit There are only two pairs of screws so if you try using the wrong pair in the wrong holes you re not going to get anywhere with the included washers there is just barely enough room for the bolts This is not helped by the almost humorously poor instructions Perhaps these factors caused the other reviewers to be disappointed or perhaps the screws were mispackaged in their boxes and were actually too short In my case I ve had the product for about two months and have done around 75 pull ups a week and have had no problems whatsoever Once put together the product works great on doors that meet its specifications you can see the specs online so check before you buy Most standard doors will work I definitely recommend an old sock or other added cushioning there is not damage to the wall above the door but there are occasional black streaks These streaks can be removed easily with a cleaning product such as a magic eraser so I ll accept them over other pull up bars that require drilling into the door frame I highly recommend this product Trust me this thing can be put together and used without coming down on your head I think pull ups are a great exercise and I know of no easier way to do them in the comfort of your home 
4 0 Hit A Way Pole This is a great teaching devise that is portable and enables good hand eye coordination It s great for getting your timing down It is a little heavy for my 11 year old son thank goodness for the wheels to help move it around Very easy to set up 
5 0 Awesome im new at airsoft so i can t really compare with any other guns but i got mine the other day and it s awesome really accurate hop up helps alot add ons that its comes with are great shipping was really fast came earlier then they said it would 8 day i think low price great for beginners 
4 0 A good gun for begginers I got this gun about a year ago after my friend got a really bad gun It was better than his but not by much The batteries are good value and have a good charge rate The stock on my broke off but now it looks even cooler than with the stock on the gun The sights were ok but not the best in the world The barrels dont help much and just make the gun look cool but if you drop the gun on the barrel they will snap Semi auto was great for 1 shot fireing Full auto was ok for auto The magazines I got held 40 shots and ran out very quickly the only bad part about the magazines are that they break really easly I hope this helped you in your airsoft gun buying 
5 0 awesome this gun is the best gun I own it doesnt curve at all the scope isnt the best but the laser and origonal sight make up for it The clip runs out fast so you might want to get a extra mag or a back up gun this gun is soooooooo cool you have to buy it pros 1 it is accurate 2 it comes with a lot of accesories 3 it is practically a give away cons 1 clip runs out fast 2 scope isnt that good 3 took 9 days to arrive this hasnt jammed on me once 
4 0 Good looking This gun luckly has a button not a peice of plastic sticking out in which you pull to get the clip out The reason i say this is that my freinds gun cant remove the clip becuse this peice broke so thaTS A GOOD THING ON THIS GUN IT LOOKS DURABLE AND THERES NOT THAT MAN7Y PEICES THAT LOOK LIKE THEY WILL FALL OFF iam still waiting for it to get shipped it said it will take 3 to 9 days even know i paid 18 00 for shipping dont you think that sucks i take one star off for the shipping price 
1 0 Help Hi this looks like a sweet deal i was wondering wat type of m16 magazine will work with this airsoft gun thx to the person who answers 
5 0 Resistance Tube The item I ordered came exactly as described quick delivery very pleased Would buy again from this person 
4 0 buyer for a gift It was a gift for my husband I think he likes it he said no negative feedback 
4 0 Great way to burn 400 calories while watching TV This is an inexpensive machine and when you get it you can see why Still probably worth the money if you actually use it while watching tv For people who essentially want the machine to show up and the weight to come off might hate it as might those who think feeling the burn is the only way to go but I think its the best way to burn about 400 calories while watching a single tv show without killing your back You can sustain the zero resistance level twist for an hour straight and break a light sweat lo level cardio At that rate as a tummy toning cardio machine for which it is excellent you can burn between 7 and 9 calories per minute I know this because I also own the body bugg calorie management armband and measured calories burned for a one hour work out I loved it because Its a great way to avoid just sitting there when you want to watch tv I ve killed myself with brutal kick boxing workout for the same calorie burn in shorter time this is less stress on the back I thought the video was a demonstration and I recommend only using it once to see the different exercises As a workout video I give it a negative 3 out of 10 The absolutely best thing is that this isn t a HARD workout but it does burn the long term 45 minute to an hour calories Because of that I think its sustainable motivation people who hate their workout machine will not use them and they end up in the garage This is my new tv chair 
1 0 Needs a lot of improvement Used this Digital Compass for about 20 days and am returning it It does not seem to be capable of giving reliable directions The same position try the reading twice and the directions are off wildly Tried in open fields inside my home and the same Tried calibrating a dozen times and setting the Declination correctly but no change 
5 0 excellent quality Really well made and solid feeling Easy to use has good instructions too Small enough to clip onto the fanny pack or backpack Numbers are big enough to easily read Looks cool too 
5 0 Neoprene hand weights I needed this product for better stretching and light exercise It arrived in great shape and in record time 
4 0 Shipping Ripoff I wanted to purchase another Ab Slider because my original one finally gave out after years of great service The slider is a great adjunct to ab training The 4 star rating is based on the shipping ripoff of 16 95 for a product that sells for 22 00 not the quality or usefulness of the product 
5 0 dont listen to the reviews that say this is a bad gun this gun is very good its amazingly good for the about 20 itl b with shipping this gun shoots about 80 feet acurately it is very good but runs out of ammo faster than you d think so get and extra high cap mag with the order 
5 0 this is an awesoe gun every thing on this gun works it it the best buy eve 
5 0 Better than I thought I bought this gun for my little cousin and I expected this gun to fall apart but to my amazement It didn did last to the rocks we droped it in well for the add ons the magazine Is all right it holds around 30 most ever thing that comes with It Is cheap nothing like the flash light and that laser I didn t even get that aiming thing worked for me at least but I was to lazy to call for it well to the gun Its self very good just I think It was made for close combat ya its a shotgun good for backyard wars 
5 0 sweet gun first of all im not a kid but this gun is friggin awesome it was alot of shipping but 100 worth it shiped in 2 days and everything works great no need for scope when you have the laser but who cares excellent buy 
4 0 good gun first of all i am not a kid just too lazy to get an account this is a really good gun i bought this gun because it was my only choice at the time but i reccomend it it says 100 round max capacity thats not true it only holds 50 but 50 got me through a round after a while i broke mine BUT it was my fault not the guns just do not take it apart i got curious and did it anyway though it has a pretty bright light and a good laser the little box scope does nothing but it is accurate enough to hit the laser or only be a little bit off my only regret was the price on shipping from this company but i would buy this gun again when i pull the money back in BUY IT IT S WORTH IT 
5 0 just great The shipping was quick and the product was exactly as shown Hard to beat the basics I hope these last as long as my first pair 10 years of a lot of use 
4 0 Super fast shipping I wasn t expecting it to arrive for at least another 5 days and was very pleasantly surprised to have it be shipped so quickly 
5 0 Favorite Shoes I once had a pair of generic Teva lookalikes I loved those shoes and wore them until the back straps fell off after a year and still wear them around the house and yard although the front straps are hanging by a thread So this year when I needed shoes to walk to school and work that would be compact enough to slip into my pocketbook when I got there and put on my heels Tevas were the only shoe I considered Most of the Tevas and similar shoes these days have been reinforces with bulkier straps and soles for hard core outdoors activities but this pair was perfect basic cute and packable Upon arrival I slipped them on and the straps adjusted perfectly to my larger in the toe than in the heel feet The soles immediately began their work of molding to the curves of my arches I was also tickled to find that they had an antibacterial coating to prevent any odors or bacteria while packed away in my pocketbook I walked in them that day and every day that I have had to walk since They feel sturdy and reliable and I have no doubt that they will last significantly longer than the generic ones that I once loved Simply put I love these shoes and recommend them to anyone with similar footwear needs 
5 0 great sandals for the price comfortable straps fit without irritation no real breaking in required although I would prefer a sandal with a higher arch 
5 0 love this shoe i love the comfort of this shoe it s on a par with my birkenstocks Service was fast and very efficient Will probably order more in the future 
5 0 great overall value Excellent product and reasonable price Very comfortable Last pair of these I had lasted for many years 
5 0 Teva s rock Great for beach flea markets biking hiking you name it Comfortable good traction and washable What s not to like 
5 0 Great bike for the price Great bike for the price it looks great and a great buy for a basic beach cruiser I purchased this bike for my husband and ordered it two weeks before Christmas I was very impressed as to how quickly the bike arrived it was on my doorstep within 4 days after I hit the online send button My husband not a serious biker just likes to cruise the neighborhood loves the bike We have since equipped it with a lite and horn for a real vintage flair Great deal and thank you Amazon 
5 0 Huffy 24 classic bicycle This is a great bicycle for those who like a classic bike with a coaster brake I am an older adult and I wanted a smaller bike for easier handling The bike took some assembling but I enjoyed it The instructions were good This is a strong sturdy bike and I love it It has the classic wide tires that make it easier to ride on grassy areas The seat and handlebars have convenient adjustments I like the black and chrome appearance 
5 0 EVERY COWBOY NEEDS A HORSE Where would Roy Rogers have been without Trigger Where would The Lone Ranger have been without Silver And Pecos Bill without Widowmaker or Doc Holliday without Big Nose Kate The indisputable fact is that every cowboy needs a horse to ride And what with the price of gasoline and oats these days is it any surprise that many of us urban cowboys have shifted to the two wheeled variety of equine transportation The other day just on a whim I did an Amazon search to see if anything would come up when I entered in the name and style of my deeply beloved bicycle THE HUFFY GOOD VIBRATIONS model cruiser How exuberantly surprised I was to find myself staring at a photograph of my lovely faithful steed It s still being made Hooray Classic cruisers are still in and I m still astride mine even if the fenders are long gone Let me tell you about my bike I bought my Huffy GOOD VIBRATIONS cruiser at Pep Boys in downtown Santa Monica California circa 1980 It looks identical to the one pictured here I ve probably logged over 144 000 miles on mine I used to pedal it every day before work on the beach bike path for exercise and for just the pure joy of it My favorite ride took me from underneath the Santa Monica pier through the human carnival of Venice Beach around the boat slips of Marina Del Rey and along the sand through El Segundo Manhattan Beach Hermosa Beach Redondo Beach to the outskirts of Torrance and then back again Or to put it more succinctly My favorite ride was Heaven on Earth And note With the barest minimum of maintenance I m still riding on GOOD VIBRATIONS Yeah uh huh that s right About 26 years after buying my bike for approx the same price it s being offered for here it and I are still the best of friends I m still planting my cushions on its seat and still pedaling along the canals to the horse track or to the grocery store or to work Now how many years have you been driving your car Think you ll get 26 years out of it Will you get 26 years out of your job How bout your marriage Yeah what I m saying is that GOOD VIBRATIONS last and last But I had a real scare recently The bearings in the doohickey that connects to the thingamajig had gotten wrecked and the handlebars were loose in the whatchamacallit Rode it that way for over a year anyway Finally took it in to a bike shop and Homeboy tells me to throw my best friend into a dumpster Homeboy says it can t be repaired According to Homeboy the bike was basically junk when brand new and that the fork could break on me at any moment and put me in the hospital Well certain that GOOD VIBRATIONS could never hurt me I put my buddy in the bed of my truck and drove it from Phoenix Airheadzona to Santa Monica California for one last beach bike path ride I figured that if it broke on me along the way I d just leave it on the beach to R I P Rust In Pieces Well we made it from the Santa Monica pier to Torrance and back just like the good ol days The other riders could hear us comin up on em because GOOD VIBRATIONS was loudly going SQUEEEK KREEEK RATTLE GROAN SQUEEEK KREEEK RATTLE GROAN Other bikers probably thought he was crying in pain but I recognized those sounds for what they really were SINGING JOYFUL SINGING Back home Good Friend Melanie suggested that I take GOOD VIBRATIONS to see the nice old gentleman who owns ROADRUNNER BIKE CENTER in Glendale AZ Two weeks later and only 34 59 lighter GOOD VIBRATIONS is as good as new and ready to hit the canals again as soon as the weather cools down Why that dirty dog at the first bike shop I think Homeboy just wanted to sell me some newfangled multi geared horse Only one thing concerns me My bike is clearly labeled HUFFY MADE IN U S A But nowhere on this Product Page do I see the country of origin mentioned Are GOOD VIBRATIONS still made here or are they now produced in China I urge you to investigate before buying because GOOD AMERICANS don t financially support Coummunist countries that utilize slave labor threaten their neighbors imprison the religious and force abortions on their women Right Sometimes only poetry can express a cowboy s love for his horse O my Bike O my Horse We ve ridden twenty six years You have carried me through Times of joy and times of tears We ve traveled city streets And journeyed along the strand I rarely gave you oil You never b tched bout the sand Leaving California You never said This is bad You never once complained Though I kinda wish you had You never bucked me off Never trampled on my hide Never had a headache When I said I d like to ride You are my Black Beauty You are truly my best friend I ll shout it from rooftops Though others I might offend Because of you alone I have known excitations And more than The Beach Boys You give me Good Vibrations I feel so close to you You are almost like my kin Throw you in a dumpster No I ll throw that Homeboy in 
5 0 Great Little Tool for Practicing Your Swing The IZZO Golf Swing and Grip Trainer is a great little tool for practicing your swing It has the proper golf grip molded into the handle and removable weights to adjust the heaviness It s also short enough so you can swing it indoors without worrying about breaking the TV or lights I have used the trainer every night for 5 10 minutes over the past few weeks I have seen a noticeable difference in the quality and distance of my shots I am hitting straighter and longer shots than before Recently I was hitting over 150 yards with my 7 iron which is a milestone for me If you love golf and want to improve your swing get this tool It s well worth the money and the satisfaction from seeing yourself improve

5 0 Great for sleeping bag storage and transport I purchased a Wenger Rhine Queen 20 30 40 degree sleeping bag which has a detachable hood and liner Rolled it was very bulky The product description said the bag came with its own stuff sack but it didn t The Granite Gear 3XL 12x25 sack fits the sleeping bag with the detached hood folded and laid inside on top of the sleeping bag I was so satisfied that I also purchased the 2XL 11x23 sack for a standard rectangular Eddie Bauer 40 60 degree bag and it fit perfectly and was a few bucks cheaper The construction of these compression sacks are very rugged The material seams hold solidly against the pressure of stuffing It is great for sleeping bag transport and storage keeping dust etc out of the bag over the winter This a great stuff sack 
5 0 this thing is tough I needed a compression sack for my sleeping bag and decided to check out granite gear as I had heard good things and my granite gear backpack is great I would compare it to Nalgene water bottles Sure you can break them but you have to be trying awfully hard When I really need the space I sit on it and pull the straps as hard as I can This could possibly be considered abuse but it has held up for years like that and is showing no sings of quiting Great product and a great company

5 0 RULES basketball hoop rules i play everyday and this is one of the best BUY IT 
4 0 Hours of Family Fun We have loved this basketball goal It is very well made and the height adjuster is easy enough for a 9 year old The frame is very sturdy and strong We have spent hours as a family playing basketball The only draw back is it took two grown men that are very mechanical 3 hours to put together Let just say my husband was not very happy about that But all together I love it 
4 0 Happy with Product Overall I am happy with this product The instructions were less than ideal but all in all the product went together well The backboard is very sturdy as is the entire frame 
5 0 Excellent Product I was extremely pleased The packaged arrived promptly even during the xmas rush The hoop itself is quality throughout the lift system has to be the best around The price was the best I could find Putting together was definitely time consuming figure 4 to 5 hours but it went smoothly Good luck 
4 0 Worth the effort Purchased as a christmas present for 12 y o daughter Two positive things first of all we were a little late in ordering so was scheduled to ship after xmas but actually arrived 5 days before also the price was excellent from Amazon local stores were selling exact same product for twice the price free shipping About the assembly I had read other reviews and was a little apprehensive but I also checked the owners manual online always a good idea to check out the step by step before I purchased and it seemed doable It was definitely a challenge and an effort but not horrible Instructions say you need 2 people but it definitely helps to have more often one person is needed just to sort through the parts while the other two hold the assembly We had 3 adults and the 12 year old and everyone kept busy The biggest problem is that there are a lot of steps but you can t intuitively figure out where the directions are leading you until you get to the end it s a lot like doing your taxes One very important recommendation the parts come in numbered bags the numbers correspond to steps in the assembly DON T TAKE THE PIECES OUT OF THE BAG UNTIL YOU NEED THEM Another confusing aspect one bag of parts might be used in 3 or 4 different steps and some of the bolts and nuts look very similar so you have to check double check and triple check before using them In one step the size of the bolt that is needed does NOT match the size matching template printed in the instructions It took us 4 hours to put it together this is definitely a process you do NOT want to rush through Once put together it is a nice product For those looking to purchase something like this I would definitely not get anything smaller that the 50 inch backboard it is not that big It is sturdy for a portable and the height adjustment works fine We filled it with sand which performs better but which we will probably regret when the day comes to take it apart and we have to figure out what to do with 350 lbs of sand However this will be out in cold weather so water was out of the question I ultimately purchased this model because it seemed like the value and performance made it worth the rigors of the installation I knew what we were getting into when we ordered it and it worked out exactly as I anticipated So get some friends be patient measure twice bolt once make sure you have someone with an analytical mind managing the parts and in a few hours you have a nice hoop 
5 0 Lifetime portable basketball hoop 71283 We ve been using this hoop for over a month and it is wonderful With children of different sizes the height adjustment is fun and easy The overall quality of the system is excellent It came with all the parts I read a lot of bad reviews about the instruction manual but all positive comments about the completed net When assembling be organized and have all tools layed out Be methodical and really study the parts before assembling both via the listed descriptions and the diagrams It took 3 5 hours to put it together and I do a lot of construction work We live in a cold winter climate so we put sand in the base It helped to level the ground where the net would rest beforehand Overall the hoop was well worth the price Thanks to Lifetime and Amazo 
5 0 Excellent Value for the price I paid I m very satisfied with this Lifetime basketball system Amazon s free shipping was great but somewhat slow I assembled and setup the unit by myself but at times two people would have been convenient If assembling by yourself just be sure you have a few things like garbage cans or boxes to support it when needed I even raised the hoop myself which was pretty easy I found the instructions sufficient not terrible but not great either The first thing I did was inventory the parts and nothing was missing There were no extra parts either I recommend you inventory the parts if no other reason than to become familiar with the many parts Some readers felt that an optional drill bit was needed This isn t the case because all of the screws that self tap are also self drilling I never used a drill bit But be sure you have a good power drill to drill and drive the screws where needed I was careful and took my time to assemble the unit I guess that my assembly time was about 6 1 2 hours and I assembled it at multiple times There was a few confusing steps but with a little thought it can be fiqured out from the drawings The instructions are mostly assembly drawings rather than step by step detailed explanations of what to do The hoop mechanism raises and lowers with ease I filled the base with water and the system seems sufficiently stable I spoke with Lifetime and they recommend not using antifreeze They said the base is designed to withstand freezing water expansion and contraction I didn t use sand because the fill opening is so small that I imagine it would be quite a problem emptying the base s sand if I had to move the unit someday I think this system was an excellent value but I noticed Amazon significantly raised the price since I purchase mine about 1 month ago 
5 0 Basketball System nice product I purchased this for my sons at Christmas time The newest version is 52 and is product 71284 I paid on sale at Dick s The boys were excited and were on me to get it assembled quickly I worked on it during three sessions of about 90 min each At first glance the directions were great Upon assembling however the directions leave a little to be desired Some details were oddly left out Still with a little head scratching and reassembling I was able to put it together with little trouble When I did have a question I called the Lifetime customer service number and found their employee to be helpful and efficient They recommended filling the base with water and a little chlorine to kill algae but did mention cold weather considerations I remembered adding antifreeze to an earlier system I built so decided to go with that 2 gallons The product seems excellent I look forward to rocking the rim with my boys during a little 2 on 
5 0 A Number One Seller This is an excellent seller I ordered one day and I think it was the next I got a notice that my item was shipped They came in great shape as well Thanks for such good service and merchandise 
5 0 Great1 recomending it This is fabulous I got this within 3 days of my order its awsome its comes with a black plaque bonus the picture is misleading it doesn t come with that strap thingy but the plaque is nice It really good for the price recomended to buy if you collect this stuff I DO really good product very detailed i am happy 
4 0 Great Deal Great item for the price It comes with the display plaque which is a bonus Item arrived within a week The box the actual item comes in was slightly crushed by shipping but the product inside was undamaged 
5 0 Does what it says it does Cytomax really helps cut the burn and gives you more energy during work outs and helps with recovery afterwards Great for those returning to a regular workout routine after a layoff Tangy Orange is low cal and tastes great 
5 0 Cytomax a runners best friend I have been using Cytomax regularly for about six years now I cannot preach the benefits of this product enough It really does beat the burn The percieved exertion levels the lowering of lactic acid levels in muscle and the subsequent enhanced recovery are all truly part of the package I frequently use it before bed when I know I will only have a limited time to sleep i e 3 5 hrs and have found that I will have deep restful sleep and awake feeling invigorated It is also a handy hangover drink according to some of my past roomates I have been encouraging other fellow runners triathletes cyclist backpackers mountaineers etc to try the product and have recieved similiar feedback Many nice climbing outdoor gear shops have the individual packets available if you wanted to demo the product 
5 0 FUN Personal Water Bottle This is an upscale designer water bottle top of the line and so much fun The designs Of Sigg s water bottles are gorgeous from the plain solid color bottles to the ones with intricate designs They are simply beautiful I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns thinking it take more work to maintain These do necessitate regular cleaning I clean mine every day but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun Sort of like my rings glasses and watch I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory reminding me to drink more water making a statement about my values and expressing myself with a special design Yes all in a water bottle Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality made of light aluminum on the outside slightly insulated and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles They are light durable and perfect for any activity Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles just like from the tap I bought this particular top because I don t like sports tops and I don t mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink It is totally leakproof which is important to me The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner I like carrying mine though I get comments on it all the time What s that I love it Sigg makes their personal water bottle in 6L and 1L in this style I have both I use the 6L for sports activities because they are smaller When I won t have to carry the container I like the larger bottle They are expensive but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health so they are well worth it value wise for me Highly recommended 
5 0 Beautiful bottle makes me smile My beautiful SIGG Mahardsha Traveller encourages me to drink my water It is an attention getter too Everyone comments on how unique it is By using it and filtered tap water I m saving a bundle by not buying bottled water This also reduces the number of plastic water bottles that end up in the trash too Besides the water tastes so much colder in the chilled aluminum than from plastic 
5 0 High points from a water bottle junkie I ve been lusting after an aluminum water bottle for quite some time and finally got this SIGG I am very pleased so far It comes to work with me every day True to the descriptions your water will taste neutral after being in this bottle I have not tried storing any other liquid in it however and so cannot testify to its taste properties with juice or anything other than good old dihydrogen monoxide I would recommend this bottle to anybody however don t go bashing it around like you can with a Lexan bottle Aluminum can dent fairly easily but that s the price you pay for lightweight SIGG Switzerland rocks 
5 0 This mat rocks I just started doing yoga again and was using another mat that made my feet slip all over the place if I perspired at all It was a bummer because I couldn t keep my focus during class because I was constantly adjusting my stance This mat is fantastic because not only is it non slip but it is very well cushioned for comfort and durability 
5 0 Two Sides to All Yoga Mats Know Which Side is Up Yoga mats come in three basic thicknesses with a newer fourth thickness becoming increasingly available At 1 4 inch this mat is one of the latter kind that tops even the thick mats 3 16 thick designed for those who need or want extra cushion It is exactly two times thicker than the average mat At 24 x 68 it is also the standard width and length Mats that are about one fourth as thick as this one 1 16 are good for travel or placing under a thicker mat to provide more traction The average mats are about 1 8 There are two sides to this and nearly all yoga mats Look carefully at the bumps on each side of the mat The larger bumps are designed to face upwards to cushion your hands feet and knees during poses while keeping your body from dangerously slipping out of alignment The smaller bumps are designed to face downwards to grip the floor and keep the yoga mat from sliding Many mats have a label on one end with the name of the brand This is typically but not always located on the up side The bumps will tell you for sure This yoga mat will increase in softness and stickiness with use So do most mats They start out mildly sticky and increase in stickiness the more they are used You will want to wash your mat when it first arrives so as to remove the thin film they get on their surface during the manufacturing process Instructions for washing the mat are included Once you ve washed and dried your mat you re ready to begin After using it for a while if you find the mat decreasing in stickiness each time you pull it out this is the typical sign that a light coating of dust or too much body sweat has accumulated on your mat and it needs a light hand washing with very diluted soap and water After washing roll your mat in a thick towel to squeeze out the excess water otherwise it will take forever to dry in the air Then air dry your mat unrolled inside and away from sunlight Hanging over the shower bar works nicely When you first unroll your mat you will find one end to be a bit curled Simply alternate the direction you roll your mat top outside once then bottom outside next or the end you start from curled end once flat end next time and you ll find it straightening out more or less over time I recommend buying your own yoga mat even if your yoga studio or gym provides them for you I ve worked in many studios and gyms over the years Sometimes management has mats cleaned often sometimes not If you bring your own mat you always know where it s been o Plus owning your own mat may encourage you to begin valuable practice at home For my students who have trouble with their knees in some of the poses requiring the body weight to rest on a knee I recommend temporarily folding over one end of the mat to get double cushion under the knee while still leaving one layer under the rest of the body This saves you having to haul more than one mat out each time you practice which can be discouraging especially to the beginner 
2 0 Couldn t get it to work threw it out and decided to get a floor pump Never could get it to impart air to my schrader type valve The bracket can only be connected to the frame if the frame is pre drilled and tapped and the pump is kept in the bracket by a rubber band that would have broke in a month This was the first frame pump I d bought so I can t compare but it certainly wasn t what I expected I give it two stars instead of one figuring maybe I wasn t doing something right but if so then I d have to say operation was definitely non intuitive 
5 0 This is an amazing little monster 160PSI version Pros High Pressure Very Small Light Weight High Quality Cons Heating Flimsy rubber holder on the frame connector This is an amazing pump very small and works really good I had other pumps before but for my racing bike I need to put over 100PSI air No mini pump could go near 80PSI This one goes as much as 160PSI according to the specs When I tried it on my bike I could go over 100 easily My tires can take a maximum of 120PSI so I didn t try further It is neatly built with high quality material The barrel is brushed aluminum and very narrow in diameter Towards the end of pumping it gets warm but it works like a charm Thanks Topeak If I lose I d definitely buy again 
5 0 High Sierra Jackknife Pack Charcoal Chipotle Black It was a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it a lot We can t share the backpack I think it s very useful with all of the pockets And I took it by super saver shipping That s the best shopping feature for me 
5 0 spacious bag I bought this when these bags were on sale A good spacious bag to carry your stuff for a weekend away as a carry on in flights without having to deal with checkin hassles It is spacious and comfortable I wish the material was a bit more sturdy but it is a good value for the price 
5 0 nice mat good quality I ve had one of these about a year and they don t get as dirty as others I ve tried I like the extra length I m 6 3 tall The thickness is nice if you do any poses on your back Recommended 
4 0 Good Product for the money You can t go wrong with this product for 50 bucks and free shipping Our son did find it to be a little wobbly but no show stopper If you are looking for a good deal on a decent bike trailer this is it If you want top of the line keep looking 
5 0 Terrific product We love this product My daughter is almost 4 she asks to bike ride all the time now She loves it so do we The first time we installed this on my bike we did notice the bike trailer feeling a bit wobbly but my husband readjusted the clamp on the adult bike it eliminated the problem while riding you might notice the bike leaning slightly my experience is it s because my daughter is looking backwards not because of a malfunction If you can teach your child to not turn to the back make sure the clamp is perfectly straight on your seat post you shouldn t have problems with it being wobbly 
5 0 We love this We purchased this for our 4 1 2 yerar old He loves it We love it Easy assembly Easy hook up to Bike Not to heavy for my wife to use on bike rides Stabiity is not an issue and it is getting our son used to riding on two wheels 
5 0 Very Pleased With This Product I was a little skeptical about buying this based on some of the other reviews that mentioned instability loose connections etc But I bought one of these from a local store today because it was the only one they had and I needed it today and I am very happy with it It was very easy to put together the connections are tight and my six year old boy is very stable on the back He absolutely loves it and I have no complaints It s also surprisingly easy to pull a large child We have a bike seat taht we still use with out 3 year old and I think it s actually easier to pull my 6 year old than to ride with my 3 year old in the seat probably due to the center of gravity One last thing I paid 99 + tax for this in the store Amazon is offering a very good deal Happy Cycling 
4 0 good value for the money My daughter loves the ride and i like knowing she is right behind me This trailer is easy to use and comfortable for her the only thing it could use is springs or shocks under her seat This does take a little getting use to as it does slightly swayto the side a little You also have to be sure that you have leg length as your seat needs to be up a little higher than your normal setting We enjoy our bike rides even more now that we can travel longer distances nice that your child helps on those inclines I recommend this product to parents who enjoy biking and wish they could take there little ones on those longer bike rides 
5 0 A Great Idea If this had been invented before the skateboard the skateboard would never have been invented 
5 0 AWESOME WAVE BOARD This board is so much better than a skateboard I got one for christmas and haven t really put it down Definately worth your money 
5 0 This board RULES very close to snowboarding on the street So it was the summer of 2006 I was walking in with my girlfriend in the park and saw this kid riding a two wheeled skateboard I went over to him pushed him off of it and took it Well not really I actually went home and looked it up online Found it for 129 on the home website then found it at sports authority for 99 with and had a coupon for an additional 40 percent off We purchased 1 then went back the same day and bought number 2 We started off riding it on a shallow hill and then started riding it on some steeper ground I couldn t believe how much it reminded me of riding my snowboard Yea its a little nerve racking at first but definiteley worth the 99 I now live by the beach in the south and can hardly ever snowboard the wave is my new fix 
5 0 The Wave Skateboard I never knew this skateboard existed until one day in P E when we got to try them out the whole period This guy came to our school with about 30 waveboards and helmets plus 7 boards he was giving away for free So we got in pairs of two and we tried out the boards They are a little hard to get but soo fun Even trying to get it is fun and it is a little helpful to have someone to hold onto in the beginning I couldn t ride the board on my own in about 15 mintues of trying it but I was getting close I will be getting this board as soon as I can It is sooo fun = 
5 0 Excellent I bought this Skateboard for my son and it is not easy for beginners but when you get used to it is amazing Kids can do things never thought for a traditional skateboard as a recommendation try to buy a spare of wheels 
5 0 Very pleased All three of my kids 9 11 and 13 are using it even the girls Seems great for coordination and balance and probably less dangerous than a skateboard scooter It is popular enough that they want another 
5 0 Great Laptop Case I purchased this to help lower my back pain from lugging a laptop in a normal brief type case It has far exceeded my expectations I do wish that there was something just a bit bigger This bag is 3500 cubic inches and really if you have tools gear books and a laptop to carry around this bag just barely cuts the mustard but it is the largest laptop protected case that I have found The specialized pockets are great even if you are unable to utilize them by designation I found there not to be enough pen pockets but I stored them other places as well The book file area could be larger and when fully stuffed with support equipment for the laptop this space is full I had hopped that I could find a case with support much like a overnight backpack but this was as close as I could find I have had this almost a year at this point most cases only survive for about 4 months for me and it is still holding strong Strong enough that 2 other guys I work with have purchased the same model 
5 0 The Ultimate Geek Backpack This is the ultimate geek backpack It was designed by a geek for a geek If you re a student and constantly carry around 10lbs of keys and gadgets in your pockets this is the backpack for you The laptop pouch is also sufficiently padded I happily carry my Thinkpad and a number of books and a binder and don t feel like I have to nurse the bag at all It feels very sturdy The construction is good The zippers work well The inside is deceptively spacious For those of you not sold by the millions of comparments for all the geek toys or with any other gadget that this backpack might have let me leave you with a final criteria I used when selecting this backpack it looks good I can walk around with this and no one would know that it s a laptop backpack it s not square it doesn t have 15 million straps it doesn t ahve 40 pockets on the outside In summary it doesn t look like Terminator backpacks that I see people wearing And frankly for the price you can t beat it 
5 0 Can t say too much more My thoughts on this bag have been pretty well covered by other reviewers This is a great backpack with LOTS of storage space and the shoulder straps are much more comfortable than my L L Bean I recommend this bag 
5 0 Best backpack available I bought this backpack from Amazon last week and I can say it is the best one available even much better than most of other top brands like targus Samsonite or Kensington Earlier I wasn t sure about the reviews about this product I saw on Amazon but still ordered it after reading and looking at its pics I am 100 satisfied with the product and whatever they say in the product description its all true Its strong with many different compartments suitable for your school or business I have HPDV4000 with 15 4 inch screen and it fits well The mesh on sides can hold even big bottles nice feature I have bought it for school but it has enough room to accomodate ur shoes and some clothes also along with books I enjoy using this wonderful backpack I would highly recommend it So go ahead friends 
5 0 Capacious well made organized and discreet I ve bought three of these laptop backpacks and this is the best Well made well organized and lots of space Seems durable but haven t used it enough to vouch for it Will protect my laptop physically with its padded pouch but also from theft How The backpack doesn t yell out I contain an expensive laptop it looks like a cheapo student bookbag And you can t beat the price Highly recommended 
5 0 Excellent Laptop Backpack This is an excellent laptop backpack It has plenty of pockets for all your electronic gear and cords There is also an abundance of room for files and other business items The section for your laptop is padded and convenient for easy access 
5 0 Backpack This is a great bag Very comfortable even with all the stuff I end up carrying around There is a pocket for just about anything you can thing of so it is easy to stay organized I love that it doesn t look like an expensive laptop bag which i suppose makes theft a little less likely 
5 0 Love this bike My son got this bike from Santa and he loves it The colors are great the training wheels are sturdy and it s just the perfect size for my 4 year old 
5 0 Weider waist reducer I wasn t sure if it was called a waist reducer because when you put it on it makes you waist a few inches smaller or it actually helps take inches off your waist I was a little skeptical because I have read no reviews on this item The first day I used it I seen very little difference The second day I used it I lost an inch and also on the third day I only had it for a week and lost a little more than 2 inches without exercising 
4 0 Works Great Installation could be better described Wish I had this cartop carrier long ago Much better than straping skis boards to the top or putting them inside 
5 0 Great cargo box I needed storage in my Geo Tracker because my Lab takes up the whole back end This did the trick I received my cargo box in good condition The only thing I needed to do was to install the clamps to connect it to my roof rack The clamps are adjustable front to rear so installation was easy Removal was just as easy so I could run thru the car wash I liked the dual side opening it allows access from either side It just clears my 7 foot garage door by 2 inches so I have to be aware of places that I go for clearance The smooth finish is easy to clean and looks good The free shipping also made the price competative with buying local My Lab is now able to ride in my Tracker all the time and she s a happy camper 
4 0 yay i just ordered it i am excited yay i can t wait to get it it looks awesome i like having something to look forward to too bad on columbus day the mail isn t delivered 
5 0 This machine is the argument against springs I have over 7 000 hours of experience teaching on studio quality spring loaded Pilates equipment In the last years that I taught professionally I cut down my insane teaching schedule by teaching group classes on these machines They are safer than spring loaded reformers because of the bungee cords springs snap back Bungee cords will move but not with the kind of propulsive really dramatic force you see in springs Over and over again I watched students do things on these reformers that would have injured them on spring loaded equipment In my own practice lack of attention has caused a moment or two of real danger the worst thing that happened was a flying bungee cord cutting the upholstery Safety aside these provide enough resistance for a really good workout They are big enough that anyone under 6 2 can do all of the exercises with the exception of the Semi Circle which is a more intermediate exercise anyway Students with knee and hip injuries reported that they were more comfortable on these machines possibly because the bungee cords provide less resistance Also these reformers do what reformers were designed to do in two hour long workouts a week these machines increased flexibility improved back pain and dramatically changed the shape of bodies just like studio quality equipment would Yes Virginia there is a way to get rid of saddlebags without lipo Finally unlike some other pieces of non studio quality equipment I can unequivocally recommend these for even very fit men The runners bikers and hunters in my classes really found the machine workouts challenging Cons I have never been able to get replacement parts You will need two people or one man over six feet to move each machine Attempt to fold them up again at your own peril Lock them away from children or vice versa even bungee cords can cut 
4 0 Great Quality A little larger and heavier than I expected but a solid home Pilates reformer As someone who has been taking classes in a Pilates studio with professional grade reformers this comes as close as possible and for about 10 of the price of a studio quality reformer It s versatile easy to use once you figure out the sparse instructions on how to set it up and the cords provide some serious resistance and a good thorough workout The one complaint I have is that the wheels don t seem to be in the proper position to actually function Then again if the manual weren t so minimalist I might have been able to figure out what if anything I m doing wrong 
4 0 Great product The product has been very helpful to m wife and myselff We use for 10 min each every other day and the results have been great I highly recommend it 
4 0 Feel The Burn I like this machine If you do spend your 3 quality minutes with it properly you should feel those abs burning I usually like to do 3 minutes to the front and then 3 minutes to each side to attck my love handles I just a little overweight so it good for burning calories and toning too Good product try it out 
5 0 ab slider Excellent Ab workout I did ten minutes the first time I used it and I was so sore that it hurt to laugh Definitely works 
5 0 Ab solutely Great This product really does work WHEN you work with it I feel that there are a lot of people who really want to start exercising who want to start improving their bodies who want to look good and so they start out all gung ho with the exercise and the diet but pretty soon the enthusiasm fizzles and they are right back where they started Before you begin any exercise routine sit down and write out what you want to get from exercise In other words what do you expect Do you want to be able to see your abs Do you want your energy levels to improve Do you want to look great for your 20nth reunion Whatever your goals and dreams are write them down and every day before you start your exercise routine look at your goals for a few minutes and then visualize how you will look after reaching those goals If you are 225 start seeing yourself looking down at the scale and seeing it say 175 or however much it is that you want to get down to Imagine your family and friends congratulating you on your efforts See yourself getting out of the shower and looking in the mirror loving and appreciating this wonderful vehicle of the soul Writing down your goals and visualizing the end results will not only get you in shape faster it will also inspire you to keep on going with your routine With all that said this is a great piece of equipment and something I keep by my bed I use this every other day for about five minutes It not only works your abdominals it stretches out your entire upper body I had back surgery not too long ago and so traditional ab exercises really bothered me not so with this If you don t push too far outward you get a nice deep stretch Almost like how a cat stretches when it wakes up after a nap I think this product is worth trying but please write down your goals envision them happening realize that you aren t just a body you have a spirit and a mind as well Keep yourself focused inspired and enthused and you will reach your goals Here is wishing you a Healthy Wealthy and Fulfilling 2007 Peace and Blessings john the light coach 
4 0 Simple Ab workout I m pretty good about exercise and the muscle I absolutely hate working out is my stomach I hate situps crunches and I m not big on pilates I used to have the original ab slide but lost it It definitely works out your abs and I love the counter on this particular machine It s hard to keep track of time when you are focused on your exercise When I see 3 minutes I know I m done The only reason I didn t give it 5 stars is because I still hate working out my abs 
5 0 Hate Gimmicks Hate Sit ups Start here This thing works I won t make a lot of crazy claims but I will say that this is a great starter device to get your abdominal muscles working properly My wife bought it and I was afraid it was going to be a typical TV gimmick Now I use it more than she does It seems to tighten up and strengthen the whole range of abdominals and some parts of the back and shoulders making you more slender across the midsection and giving you the strength to do gut busting exercises if you want to do those crunches you feel you cannot do right now As someone else pointed out this is really a benefit if you already do cardiovascular or fat burning exercises but need to trim in concentrated areas Exercises like this don t remove fat cardio etc does that consider doing them with a heart monitor to guarantee a consistent effort They firm up the muscles in those areas instead of hanging loosely and looking flabby What NOT to do I know this from experience Don t do crunches with weight I built a nice strong round belly that way once thanks for the wrong advice Bally s If you made that mistake I hate to say it but you ll probably have to LAY OFF the abdominal exercises for a long time then use this add torso twisters with very low weight and lower back extensions crunches without weight and knee raises You will find that the AB Slide and torso twisters build your strength so you can do the other exercises a total of maybe 10 15 minutes a day As with any exercise TAKE IT EASY at first Don t extend all the way until you ve been using it for a while Once you ve been using it a week or so you ll get a feel for how far you can extend 
5 0 No more crunches With the Ab Slider you will no longer need to do the crunches It workes out your back ab s butt and arms The most important part is that you feel it the next day and know that it is working While when you are doing the excercise you don t really feel it if you don t extent yourself to far I love it and I ve lost 2 pant sizes using it Good luck with your own 
5 0 amazing This device is awesome the first time i used it my upper body was burning for days especially my abs all you have to do is 5 to 10 a day to make a difference they will be tighter in no time i recommend this to anyone who is doing a lot of cardio already this helps you not get flubby on the tummy 
5 0 Strongest I ve ever seen This is anamazing bright white LED light Can be a focused spotlight or a wide beam You will be seen by cars at night AND you will be able to see the path ahead of you Because of its short run times I would recommend this only to those who do alot of night riding in near pitch black conditions 
5 0 Great Product Although these blocks are made of foam they are very sturdy My daughter 15 months has chewed on them stepped on them thrown them and generally mistreated them but there isn t a mark on them They are a great toy for toddlers Her 3 and 6 year old cousins enjoy them too The colors and textures are a fun touch and because the blocks are so lightweight nobody gets hurt when they are thrown 
5 0 Excellent economical workshop floor covering There are a lot of similar floor mats for sale on amazon but these are the cheapest decent ones here The thickness of this flooring is just enough to mitigate the hardness of a bare cement floor but aren t so squishy that you can t put a chair with rollers on it The tiles go together much more easly than I expected There s enough give in the jigsaw edges that you don t have to fight to get these lined up On the other hand the edges are rigid enough that they hold together tightly The only potential negative to this set is that there are jigsaw edges all around and I don t think there are plain edge pieces available to finish them off I don t really care about this as I don t mind the look and I don t need wall to wall coverage Oh one last thing Note the contradictory information in product features description regarding how much you re getting It s 8 2 x2 squares for a total of 32 square feet You can make an 8 x4 square If you want 8 x8 order two sets 
4 0 Compact easy to use bike computer This unit has many features to give you more information than you probably need One feature I found to be interesting is the accumulation of the time you spend riding You get the trip time plus the total time you have spent riding the bike on all trips while using this computer Similar to the trip mileage and ODO mileage Only complaint is about the mounting of the transmitter Topeak gives you a single band strap which snapped when I tried to tighten it I think it would be better to have a mounting bracket that would use 2 plastic wire ties Had this broken at a point where there was not enough left to wrap the fork I would have had to find a whole new bracket It s a good computer at a reasonable price 
4 0 Christmas Gift This was given as a gift to my father for Christmas he loved it It s great and cranks out some heat the only downer is that it s really low to the ground I should have looked at the dimensions Other than that Fabulous 
5 0 Coleman Copper Firepit This product is great Very nice construction easy assembly and fun to use We have used it quite a bit this summer to sit around at night The kids love cooking marshmallows and Smores 
4 0 great bike Overall this is a very nice bike for the price Before I got this bike I had a 21 speed and was skeptical about switching to an 18 speed but the difference was not that noticeable to me I pull my kids in a bike trailer too and the bike works just fine The only conn is that the seat is a little ridged but you can get a more comfortable one I just haven t yet

5 0 Honking good horn It is cute easy to put on the bike and a good noise level to alert others 
4 0 little soccer star My little soccer star feels like a pro I only wish these came as a PAIR instead of a single It does fit nicely around his little wrist 
4 0 Nice Sweatbands I am placing my second order with this company for additional sweatbands The quality of the sweatbands is very good and they are thick and absorbant and comfortable to wear Like the first reviewer I was expecting to receive 2 wrist bands per pack instead of having to purchase each individually luckily I had purchase 4 initially and had two pairs Overall I am very happy since they are cheaper than most places and shipping was fast 
5 0 Very nice and affordable wrist bands I think these wrist bands from ATAFA are very nice and cheap I bought several wrist bands a few days ago and they were received on time More important these bands have very good quality Overall I would like to rate them 5 stars 
4 0 Took it to the top of Mt Katahdin The is a very durable and spacious pack Sits very nicely on the shoulders and back with lots of handy loops for everything you can imagine One thing that annoyed me was that Amazon AND the Wenger Co labeled this pack as a 3 Liter hydration pack but it is in fact a 2 Liter This may make a difference to a calculated hike so keep this in mind But a GREAT buy for the money 
5 0 surprisingly great i really didn t expect much from this product In fact i left it in the box in my yard all winter The weather here finally improved so I decided to break it out and see if it would really work to my surprise i found myself spending an hour hitting forehand after forehand it really works and helps improve consistancy of strokes and allows you to really hit out on your shots a great investment for those who like to swing a racket and smash a tennis ball 
4 0 Good pratice equipment Fairly good pratice equipment for tennis or baseball If you want to challenge yourself it s better on the tennis court For pratice during the off season or when it s snowing this is a good alternative I recommend this product if you have the space 
5 0 Great multi purpose pain reliever My husband and I are both long distance runners and are in our 50s We use Biofreeze with Ilex for mild and more serious pains and strains I also use the roll on version on the back of my neck and temple when I get migraines the cooling helps tremendously My mother uses it for severe arthritis in her hands and my father uses it for back pain I recently ordered some for my mother in law for hip pain She called raving about how much it helped her and my father in law Its a fabulous product that I recommend for many purposes 
5 0 BIOFREEZE with ILEX Pain Relieving Gel Excellent product relieves pain of sore joints and muscles I use it regularly on ankles and knee joints The pain reduction generated warmth allows free movement of joints 
4 0 Pleased Pleased with product takes longer to acheive desired results than gel but cleaner to apply 
5 0 YES It works and does not burn I ve been using ths for about a year now and I haven t found anything better for aching muscles or lower back pain The smell is not as strong as some other pain relieving ointments and it starts to work almost immediately Also it does not burn the hide off you like that OTHER stuff in the red tube does This is safe for sensitive skin and inexpensive to use and lasts a very long time The spray and roll on are my favorites because you don t need to use your fingers to rub it in less messy for sure 
5 0 BioFreeze The product is great I highly recommend it to people who have muscle pain I use it daily for back and leg pain 
5 0 Pain Relief I love this Product I have burcitis in my shoulder and the Biofreeze really releaves the pain I love the roll on it makes it so much easier to apply 
5 0 BIOFREEZE is the BEST BIOFREEZE is the very best Muscle pain reliever I have found I have looked for years and there are many good products out there but this is clearly the best Nearly all Chiropractor Offices I have visited in the last couple of years use and sell this product 
5 0 AWESOME I ve been using BioFreeze for 4 years While working in the hospital a co worker gave it to me for pain in my wrists since I do a lot of typing It worked immediately Whenever I feel the pain arise periodically I apply Biofreeze I haven t used anything else since I highly recommend this product I ve only used the roll on and all I can say is FANTASTIC 
5 0 Biofreeze I first saw this product at the Chiropractors and have been trying to find something to give my husband some relief from pain in his neck This product is wonderful it has helped him with his pain and allowed him to get some sleep at night The roll on is a great idea no messy hands and he can even put it on himself 
5 0 The Best I ve Ever Tried This product works better then any other s I ve tried with very litte odor that goes away quickly 
4 0 Hugger Mugger Foam Roller Price was great product is excellent Just wished it could have shipped sooner 
5 0 Excellent the price is nice The price is great for this foam roller with removable cover The fabric that the cover is made from is a tad slippery but otherwise it s a great product I plan on buying more at this great price for friends and family 
5 0 Great gift for an athlete who often works out solo The Stretch Out Strap was recommended to my teen age son by a professional speed and agility coach I tried it and found it allowed me to stretch as well as if I had a partner helping Recommended for anyone who works out solo at home or work out at a gym but don t want to ask a stranger to grab your leg 
5 0 IF YOU NEED A GOOD STRETCH I have been in therapy for about three months due to a back injury and the use of the Stretch Out Strap was part of my treatment It is excellent and I feel should be used before starting any excercise routine I recommend it 
5 0 Especially helpful for hamstring stretches I first used this strap in physical therapy for lower back problems For those who are supposed to stretch their hamstrings daily this strap is very handy Really you could do just about the same thing with a towel but this just makes it much easier and provides much better control I literally use this product every day 
5 0 Stretch Out strap I recieved this product quickly and in the exact condition that was explained and the product itself is exactly what I was expecting as well I give five stars for a perfect service and a perfect product 
5 0 Reviewer I use this strap in my Power Stretch class and this is really helpful to maximize your normal stretching ability of your body It appears simple but extremely useful in the stretching exercise A small booklet explaining how to use the strap comes with it I recommend this to everyone who doesn t like heavy exercises 
5 0 Good product but misleading specs I originally bought a kit elsewhere with handles 3 assorted tubes with clips and a couple of accessories I love the idea and have found a lot of easy ways to exercise at home My back deck has a wood arbor above it and I can put these around a horizontal wood piece and do a lot of exercises involving pulling down like pullups etc or I can loop it around a vertical post and do other exercises including leg exercises But the ones I bought keep breaking so I bought the bulk cable which is much cheaper than the kit It s also got much heavier duty tubes so I don t need to use so many at one time Also I have the ability to make different sizes to expand the types of exercises I do One thing to be aware of is that sometimes at least with the 25 foot lengths it may not be a continuous length In my case there were two pieces in some but the total length was more than 25 feet since I intended to cut it into pieces anyway it was OK I mentioned that it wasn t one piece and they offered to swap it for me and seemed very motivated to make sure I was happy with the product If the length is important to you you might want to contact them first and let them know via their toll free number listed with the product 866 263 0674 I was disappointed with the customer service rep who made promises to send email with a special offer for a future purchase for my trouble but failed to follow up I never got anything 
5 0 This Product Rocks This stove is worth every penny It has a lot of burning power and is relatively efficient with the gas It cleans easily and packs away nicely My only complaint is that the burner guards could be better secured 
5 0 A great stove Have used this stove several times and am in love with it Love the way that you can fold it up when it is not in use Lots of firepower too I would reccomend this stove to anyone 
5 0 Excellent Pedometer Excellent Pedometer Tested first by walking 20 steps and it registered 20 Stride is preset so it does estimated distance but there is no set up so it is really easy to use 
5 0 extreme pilates I am very pleased with this item The shipping was fast The item is very sturdy and can be stored under a bed And most of all the price is very reasonable Nowhere out there can you beat the price and I researched 
4 0 Great product I ve really enjoyed this product and you really can t beat the price It s fun and easy I just wished it came with a video 
5 0 Extreme Pilates I also own the Pilates Reformer I found this easier more affective and it seems to beable to do more things my than what my reformer could do I have more room to either leave it done or store it away ILOVE WORKING OUT ON IT Carol M 
4 0 excellent Unfortunately due to the holidays I haven t tried to use it regularly but will be able to soon also other things going on possibly will be getting a new home soon currently looking But as far as I can tell I will enjoy it a lot and hopefully get good results from it 
5 0 love it so far You can do so much on this and it really works you out But it could of came with more clips so you dont have to keep switching things around as much Going to the hardware store to pick more up Also the machine came with no manule instructions or example s of moves to do on it I have mat pilates tape and just ajusted the to the machine work out and got ideas form the Surpreme Pilates Informershal This is for some one who knows previous pilates moves 
5 0 I bought a pack for Africa Bought the pack for a 23 day trip to Africa I would highly recomend this pack to anyone Carried on the plane easily stored Holds any thing you can think to pack with very little stress on your back 
5 0 Excellent pack especially for students Highly recommended My wife uses this pack for nursing school As you can imagine she carries A LOT OF STUFF This pack makes it a lot lighter on the shoulders than a normal pack would because of the padding in the straps I would recommend this to anyone who is a student and is looking for a durable pack for school 
5 0 JanSport Odyssey Backpack I bought this for my daughter to use for college based on previous reviews praising roominess and good support The backpack is great with lots of different compartments and shoulder and waist straps that really help balance the weight My daughter is able to carry her laptop numerous books gym clothes and a huge waterbottle to get her through the day 
5 0 Outstanding Pack One Happy Customer I ve been a JanSport fan for over 20 years and have owned various backpacks and packs and I always come back to JanSport You just can t beat the quality and durability of a JanSport I have to say without a doubt the Odyssey is an outstanding pack for what it is designed for It has tons of room is well thought out loaded with features and most importantly comfortable to wear even fully loaded I use if for commuting every day and frequent travel for work I can load it up with my laptop an extra sweater or light jacket my portfolio and still have plenty of room for all of those extra things you need when traveling If you re looking for a high quality pack that s versatile loaded with features and comfortable look no further 
4 0 Great compartmentalization a little stress Pros 1 great compartmentalization everything is easy to obtain if you know where to put it 2 Lots of room able to put just about everything in it gym clothes several text books laptop camping gear etc Cons 1 its bulky even when nothing is in it its bulky if your one who likes to show off your back or want a sense of style this is not the product for you Tip to make less bulky put more stuff in bigger compartments relative to smaller compartment 2 THe shoulder strap strain resistant doesn t quite work i m consider myself an average male strain works in about 25lbs if you want less strain i d go for the Targus or Wenger brands Conclusion if all you want is lots of space to put ur stuff w o the style involved this product is for you 
5 0 Great Backpack for air travel I bought this pack as a substitute for bulky roller bags It works great but if you stuff it to the maximum you may have to compress it down a bit for some overhead racks The separate compartments give you plenty of flexibility and it will accomodate a shirt folded as received from most laundries The padding is excellent and the weight distribution makes it very easy to carry I will also use this as a day pack for hiking although it has more space than generally needed for this The organizer section works well to carry cell phone PDA or any other miscellaneous items Construction is excellent and it is versatile enough to accomodate a wide range of uses Great value at the price charged 
5 0 Great capacity holds 17 powerbook I needed a replacement for my Targus backpack that I used to haul my 17 powerbook This pack is lighter smaller which is a good thing the Targus was huge yet has as much useful pack space as the Targus I vastly prefer it the only question is that of durability but as my last Jansport pack lasted 5 years and my Targus only lasted 1 5 before blowing a zipper I ll give Jansport the benefit of the doubt Supremely comfortable two water bottleholders a bladder slot and plenty of pockets Top notch 
5 0 frigin awesome BUY IT this gun is sweeeeet ive had it for 7 months and have had no problems at all it shoots 300 fps with 12g bbs and a very strong 260 fps with 2g bbs and that is a deal for 80 bucks the small mag that comes with it holds a lot and you can order bigger ones the sight works good and it is 800 rpm the only thing is the selector switch gets confused between semi and full auto all you have to do is move it in the direction of the mode you want and its fixed 
5 0 Great Gun This gun is fantastic My friend has it and i have used it He however bought it for a considerably cheaper price 65 at Big 5 The gun does go 330 fps though and is really accurate and teh 110 round clip is a big plus It is more powerful than my utg 870 shotgun and almost more accurate I am not kidding about this This gun also has adjustable hop up Great gun but overpriced on this site 
5 0 excellent for price i gotta give this gun 5 stars because for 100 its a remarkable gun It definitely doesn t shoot 330 fps more like 270 280 which is pretty impressive for the price if you do buy the gun i would reccomend getting a classic army clip because the one it comes with is cheap and made out of plastic Its got a nice rate of fire and great accuracy just don t try to snipe anybody out I don t think it can be compared to classic Army but definitely as good as tokyo marui better than utg 
5 0 A must for bookworms This light has been so great I suffer from severe migraines and some of the time I cannot stand to have the main light on in my room This light has helped me continue reading with no trouble I have also used it to look around unfamiliar rooms hotels relative s home when I forgot to bring a flashlight I am planning a trip in May and on my list of things to take with me will be both my light and also extra batteries for it The batteries are easy to find in most drug stores And having it in my favorite color is an added bonus I am so glad I bought this 
5 0 Best Book Lights We ve Tried First in the interest of full disclosure I am writing this review under my husband s real name because it s his account My husband and I are avid readers and we often read in bed before falling asleep As such we ve looked at and tried just about every book light on the market We initially found these lights by chance at a Costco sitting by themselves the only package available on top of a stack of books We tried them out and they were fantastic Most book lights had one of two features we liked and a lot more that we didn t These were just what we wanted They are lightweight They are very very bright The battery is easy to change The light bulbs have never needed to be replaced They are compact and don t weigh down a paperback The clip is strong and stays in place Best of all is the swivel You can direct these lights anywhere you need them left right up down all around Plus you can direct the arm that holds the lights to various angles It s perfect for night time or car air travel reading Someone said it s hard to find batteries for the lights We ve never had that problem Target and WalMart carry an extensive supply I think they are 2032 we get Duracell and Energizer brands and they last a long time Very easy to replace just unscrew the back of the light and pop them in I will say the first lights we got in that original two pack from Costco we have never seen them at the store again it was such a fluke did have a problem with one of the two lights One of the batteries always gets stuck and is next to impossible to remove We end up unscrewing the other half of the light where the bulbs are and pushing the battery out the other side This is obviously not intended to be the way to change the battery HOWEVER this has NEVER happened with the lights we ve bought from this company through Amazon only one one of the first two we got at Costco and I m not even sure they were made by the same people although they look identical Since buying that first two pack we ve bought four more lights from this company at Amazon My husband and I keep them in various locations of the house in our travel bags in the car etc and get constant use out of them They are durable and long lasting Only one thing I have a complaint about the claw clip is supposed to open using a thumb press movement but I find it difficult to use It s easily worked around just by opening it with my fingers and attaching it to the book Maybe I have small hands my husband doesn t have this problem It s a minor issue though Finally I love the colors Pink blue and purple especially They just make you happy to look at but maybe that s just me 
5 0 Good Light Boy do some reviewers have an axe to grind or what You d think they were reviewing a 100 light or something I like these lights I have had several for the last few years and they have held up great and been very useful I use mine as book lights fix it lights and I keep one in my car I have even given some as gifts to the recipient s delight I might agree that there may be better pure book lights on the market but there are not better book lights that are ALSO all around good task lights flashlights This one is the best I guess as far as booklights go it just depends on what your expectations are and how you use it and how big the pages of the book are that you re trying to light up At least with this light it s way easy to roll the ball around and point the light where you want it Contrary to some weird reviews the batteries have all lasted a long time were very easy to change just unscrew the back of the ball drop in the batteries and screw it back together that s it and were not hard to find in stores I have purchased several sets of batteries at both WalMart and Radio Shack If you get this fun light and you don t like it then you are probably the kind of sour person who s just never happy about anything 
1 0 Two of the most EXPENSIVE Five Pound Sand Bags You ll Ever Purchase PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE STEER CLEAR OF THIS ITEM The listing advertises two 10 lbs weights however you ll ACTUALLY receive two 5 lbs weight sets These weights are actually sand rather than the iron tubes you get in most other sets I received a set that was ruptured and leaking sand so I had to return them But it was for the best because the advertising on these are misleading anyway The set is bulky and not particularly comfortable Furthermore these can t be all that durable either Finally these are the most expensive 10 lbs ankle weights that I ve seen thus far You d be better off with anything other than these 
5 0 Conventional swing trainer for a 2 Plane or 1 Plane golfer A simple concept A hinged 5 iron club that bends with errors in your swing It does require that a person is comfortable enough to actually hit a 5 iron which many high handicap golfers struggle to hit well For those people who use Hybrid 5 irons or greater or defer to the 7 and 9 Woods this aid is NOT for you If you have developed your fundamentals and have Grooved your swing through thousands of balls and numerous lessons you will not benefit The value of the club is that it can be used to hit a ball note that the Momentus cannot be used to hit a ball Key difference here that gives this training aid greater versatility From the original takeaway if you re not in the correct position the club with break In every aspect of your swing if there is a flaw it will be found For the most part I have found my faults to be at the initial takeaway when trying to rush the shot I need it to remind me to get me back on tempo when on the range It is an excellent tool for someone with a conventional golf swing with either the One plane or Two plane method as outlined by Jim Hardy Regarding the Natural Golf method I cannot verify its benefit This club will reveal your faults immediately I wouldn t recommend it for a novice without any experience or formal instruction or even a beginner who hasn t the consistency to groove a swing It is for a person who has more consistent swing one who isn t struggling to get the ball in the air or getting wormburners With just one week of working with this club I have found some fundamental faults that have plagued me After a few weeks I have developed confidence with irons Obviously a golfer s swing is a composite of various facets of grip alignment stance tempo takeaway backswing transition downswing contact and follow through If you find one aspect of your swing at fault there is likely a domino effect that will require some other changes in your technique This tool will not in any way obviate solid practice or a lesson from a golf professional it will complement it depending upon your style The club head is small compared to oversized game improvement clubs with a thin topline and it is in the profile of a muscleback more than a cavity back iron Thus its sweetspot is smaller than the modern iron for the Duffer like me I use the Ben Hogan Apex Edge irons with a wider sole and thicker topline If you do hit it correctly it will sail to its intended target I don t typically hit a 5 iron very far but it goes about 150 160 yards for me I highly recommend this club It is worthy of consideration and it s an excellent tool to maintain a proper swing plane and tempo No other device can help tell you the multitude of flaws that your swing may possess It s no wonder that training aids have come and gone but this one has still met the test of time I have also reviewed the Medicus Driver 
5 0 Medicus Dual Hinged 5 Iron Training Club I am a beginning golfer and I love this club It has helped me to develop and maintain a solid consistent swing with my irons I now keep the Medicus in my bag to take practice swings with during rounds It is great for keeping the right swing motion grooved into my body and mind I am looking foward to trying the Medicus driver 
4 0 I really like this machine This machine gives you a really nice workout and I like it a lot The instructions are a little lacking and don t be fooled there is a lot of assembly involved takes about 1 5 hrs total to unbox and assemble but the tools are all included which is terrific and the packaging is very thoughtful and well done I like everything about the unit except some of the connection points where the arms attach to the pedal can get clicky and loud at times there are no bearings at all to connect this portion just metal on metal washers which in my opinion makes for a 2nd rate connector type The heart rate strap works poorly until you work up a sweat but after that it does a great job i try to moisten it first but sweat seems to work best and the computer does a great job tracking results too For 1000 it s a really nice piece of equipment but definitely not health club quality it s for home use only 
4 0 Generally a very good machine with a couple of quirks I ve read several reveiews that mentioned the LCD was faulty When I assembled mine and tightened the mounting screws that hold the LCD in place the unit simply beeped and would not enter data or respond at all when various buttons were pushed I realized it is a solid state with touch sensitive plate underlying the LCD and loosened the mounting screws from the back of the LCD just a hair This seemed to relieve a bit of pressure that the unit was under and it responded immediately It now works fine and I have had no further problems The instructions for the unit are pretty well written although they do not tell you that two cylinder bushings go into the crank units on the front Other than that everything is well explained and bolts together quite well The unit is sold sturdy and on par with units I ve used at exercise studios It operates smoothly and while a little pricey I feel that you really can t expect to get a unit that is not flimsy if you don t pay a little more On the whole I think the unit is a good buy and a well made product Just be careful about how tightly you screw in the LCD unit If you tighten it aggressively it seems to short out or cause an electrical problem of some sort Back off just a hair on the tension on the mounting screws and it seems to make the unit work fine LIN 
5 0 Good but needs lube I received this item on time but when I looked at the box I discovered that I d been mistakenly sent the lesser 418 A few clicks put it right and the correct 438 model was shipped The incorrectly delivered item was scheduled to be picked up during the 438 delivery Assembly was not too difficult if the directions are read and followed I noticed a bit of noise from the start but cured it I thought with a few sprays of WD 40 That lasted only a short time The slight noise developed into a loud creaking sound over the the course of 2 months After disassembling the arms and linkages I realized that the bushings and moving parts had only the thin spray of WD 40 that I had delivered I greased every one with a thick water proof grease re assembled and now it is as quiet as it was advertised to be 
5 0 smooth ride Of all the home based elliptical trainers this is the smoothest ride It s one of the priciest in home ellipticals but definitely worth it We ordered on line through Amazon free shipping and no tax Came promptly to our door and we assembled it fairly easily 
5 0 Excellent Assembly Guide 2 hour Assembly The first thing I always do is take an inventory of all the parts I labeled small zip lock bags per the steps and inserted the required hardware for each step Good thing after assembling step 6 I found I forgot to install two flat washers It was very easy to find out what step I didn t assemble correctly when I discover two left over washers on the table I was disappointed when I audited my parts and saw that two of the wave washers were missing I received the machine on Friday which meant I would have to wait until Monday to contact Customer Services So I started assembling the elliptical Much to my surprise I found that two of the wave washers were already installed step 7 I was very pleased to be able to assemble and start using the elliptical The computer did not work at first Thanks to a few of the reviews I tried loosing the console screws and the computer started working I love how the machine is easy to use and very quiet 
5 0 Great Gadget Wonderful Gadget The cover helps prevent reset Accuracy rating was right on at 98 99 A little tough to open at first but does get easier with use Highly recommend this mode 
5 0 Replacement order of Multifunction pedometers Received the order of Multifunction pedometers to replace the single function pedometers that were mistakenly sent They seem just right Many thanks Carol Connolly Parish Nurs 
4 0 Get what you pay for These pedometers are great because you can track distance calories and steps but it is inaccurate uses a standard rocking mechanism to count I ended up giving them to my kids and they think they are great 
4 0 Hummer Shake Flashlight I was concerned after reading the posted review before mine I had ordered a Hummer Shake Flashlight and received it today Dec 28th as a Christmas gift for my husband I noticed the on off black switch is on as when I horizonally shook the light the bulb light appeared So I click the black switch again and no light appeared as I shook the flashlight therefore assuming it was off The light lasted 5 minutes but did become dimmer after 1 minute I live in a rural area and it is enough light to walk in the pitch dark of the night I notice that the warranty is for One Year We are pleased with this product as our Eternal Light 
5 0 Excellent dartboard This dartboard has been an attractive and fun addition to the game room The wooden cabinet is very handsome it has a nice finish and is well constructed and the actual dartboard itself seems to be of top quality My one complaint is that the darts that come with the set while highly servicable are somwhat clunky and the flights frequently fall out However you could remedy this by buying a slightly better dart set the old darts can be used for kids or for parties Overall this would serve a player with medium experience quite well 
5 0 Family and friends poolside fun A great sideline to a pool party placing it on the patio lures the more active crowd around and gives the party some substance and competition not to mention good laughs Even gives all ages of family members something fun and easy to do together whether it is in the heat of the day or the cool of night Nice easy scoring included and case gives some protection to outer wall area 
5 0 Spectacular Best work out gloves i ve had sure beats the mesh gloves and the grip is outstanding 
4 0 Still the best glove around This is still the best weight lifting glove out there comfortable extended finger grips attractive NO ANNOYING WRIST WRAPS My only complaint is that there could be maybe a little more padding but other than that it s an EXCELLENT glove One other thing I don t understand why it cost about 10 dollars more than the regular Harbinger glove basically you pay 10 bucks more for some extended grips which there really isn t that much more of 
5 0 Weightlifting Must These gloves are comfortable and help grip the weights that are handling I like them a lot 
4 0 very effective training gloves I ve been using my Harbinger 1260s for approximately three weeks The padding on the 1260s took a little getting used to The majority of my weight training is on machines that have rubber padding on the grips This makes gripping with the Harbingers a little awkward at first but I got used to it after a couple of workouts Only time will tell whether these gloves hold up as well as my old Nikes I used those for over three years they were lost lifting weights 3 times a week 
5 0 Lift hard in comfort My last pair of leather and mesh training gloves where trashed so I shopped around and decided to replace them with these gloves The Harbinger 1260 gloves provide ample padding for protection and comfort while providing a solid grip The nosweat tm lining wicks moisture away from the skin while the curved three quarter finger design fits more naturally improving dexterity The gloves are fastened in place with an adjustable wrist strap Even though the gloves are partially constructed of leather they can be hand washed to remove salt and oils Washing with a mild soap and air drying will help the gloves to maintain their comfort fit and will last longer My workout partner uses the Harbinger 143 gloves Compared to the 1260 the 143 are simpler gloves with less material and padding Since they sell for about the same price the 1260 gloves are a much better value PROS Washable Comfortable Durable enough for rigorous strength training CONS Sizing seems slightly small in comparison to other gloves I can get my gloves on easy and they are comfortable They are a bit of a challenge to remove though The next size up is too big on me 
5 0 no dejen de obtenerlos el material es bastante fuerte y duradero por el precio son excelentes para los practicantes de cualquier intensidad el agarre es perfecto no deja lugar a las magulladuras en las palmas de las manos ni en las articulaciones limita un poco el radio de accion de la palma e la mano pero eso no lo hace malo muy buena adquisicio 
5 0 Great Gloves for Lifting If you are into weight training these are great gloves Well padded washable flexible and great value for the price The 3 quarter length fingers provide extra protection while maintaining freedom of your fingers 
5 0 Will it work for a m4a1 and hk g3 sg1 Will it work for a m4a1 and hk g3 sg1 
5 0 very good I am a 14 year old boy ordering off his mothers account i just got this scope yesterday and it works terrific with my super 9 airsoft gun if you have read my review on the super 9 from airsplat this is the 4x32 scope i was talking about It is a great buy for only 20 00 and if you attach it to your super 9 it is very easy and makes your super 9 very accurate I hope this was helpfull to you 
5 0 For the price it s great If you have a gun like an airsoft gun or airgun or 22 this is a good scope for you It s decent quality and adjusts well and unless you are doing some serious shooting or shoot at longer ranges this scope will work just fine for you Take care and good luck Sa 
4 0 Simple Adapter that Works I purchased this for my son who plays alot of Airsoft If you are into Airsoft you know that Green Gas is expensive This little adapter makes it possible to use propane to power your gun The piece is expensive for what it is but it works Which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five In the long run you will save money Just make sure to use silicone oil on your gun every eight mag fills 
5 0 A gas gun must have The Airsoft Innovations propane adapter is an absolute must for airsofters with gas guns Sure it s a bit of money up front but it s well worth it since a bottle of propane from a local store such as Wal Mart is a whopping 2 42 I ve been playing 3 months with a gas pistol as my sidearm and I haven t yet gone through my first bottle of propane It s not that I don t use my gas pistol because I do on each and every outing which is almost weekly A bottle of propane simply provides a lot of shots This is where the value of AI s propane adapter really shows 
5 0 Excellent Value I ve owned this product for four months I use it for my indoor workouts when weather or time don t permit my outdoor walks about 2 3 times per week I ride for 45 50 minutes and feel that I m getting a good workout I m sure it s fine for exclusive use but as with all exercise you ll hit more muscle groups if you mix it with a walk or jog and thus lose body fat more effectively and quickly I also do some light muscle toning with resistance cords I prefer recumbent bikes over uprights because they re more comfortable and don t cause the back strain Also I haven t had knee pain using this bike unlike when I do high impact stuff like jogging It only took me and my son an hour to put it together The instructions and drawings could have been slightly better but we got through them One tip make sure the tension line is loosened = lengthened before you attempt to attach it to the adjusting wheel I ve exercised regularly for the last three years and find the resistance settings adequate Settings 1 6 are nearly useless because they re so light but may be good for some who are not yet fit I do a warmup for five minutes on level 6 and the majority of my ride on level 7 for a moderately tiring workout Once in a while when I m feeling strong I ll crank it to level 8 for 5 10 minutes I don t think I ll outgrow level 7 and 8 The bike rides quite quietly and comfortably I like how I get a little give from the seat support pole It s strong but bounces just slightly depending on how hard you re pedaling I m of average height and build for a man and weigh approximately 165 lbs I m over 40 and no longer do high impact or agressive workouts My goal is moderate fitness and low body fat maintenance without workout strains or other injuries I feel the bike is sturdy enough for me It s very easy to adjust the seat distance from the pedals The pulse monitor seems to be relatively accurate It s easy to change the monochromatic monitor screen settings with the large button and I m very happy with the large display as I m somewhat farsighted I have not yet had to replace the monitor 9 v battery even though the diplay has no manual off setting it turns off automatically if the pedals aren t being used after something like 5 minutes I like the fact that the monitor can scroll through the various workout data or I can select them manually I usually just set it to the timer I ve had no problems with anything breaking At this price this is a very good value and I recommend the product 
5 0 Awesome Bike I ordered this bike on Monday and received Thursday even though I did the free shipping Today is Friday and after riding the bike I am very impressed My boyfriend and I put it together last night and it took about 1 1 2 hours I bought this bike after reading the reviews and yes the instructions sucked but we knew that going in We did have to use a few of our own tools to make sure we really tightened the bolts Like a previous reviewer we were also confused at first about the rear and front stabilizing bar the parts really should be numbered for this purpose the illustrations do not help much But once we got past that it was pretty much a breeze to put together I ve ridden it today and am VERY impressed The bike is so quiet you almost can t hear it I really can t stress enough how quiet it is someone could sleep 15 feet away from you and not hear it I am 5 6 and lengthening the bike out is very comfortable for me I love everything about this bike although I do agree the seat could be a little more cushioned but that s okay For the price of the bike I would DEFINITELY recommend it I doubt you would find a better bike for under 200 Great quality and it provides a good workout 
5 0 One Year Later 5 Stars for the Price I have owned this bike for a year now having purchased it from Amazon The bike is comfortable I am 6 0 tall It is easy enough to push into position for a morning ride while watching the news then push back out of the way Occasionally the digital display freezes and I have to take the batteries out and reinsert them Maybe once out of every 30 uses The display cycles through the usual readouts except heart rate which is a stand alone reading I bike for 20 to 50 minutes in the morning It is not an expensive piece of heavy equipment that people buy and get tired of using I use it 5 times a week and after a year I have to say 5 stars considering the price 
4 0 good great for the price arrived faster than expected the instruction is small should have bigger font siz 
5 0 Great great great I bought this recumbent bike just three days ago and it is already at my house and set up It took my husband about 1 1 2 hours to put it together if we were younger it probably would have gone faster The bike is GREAT I can t say enough good about it I don t know how it will hold up but it seems to be sturdy and so worth the price As I said I am no longer so young but I was able to get on the bike and ride it comfortably on a low setting for more than a mile The bike kept track of my distance speed calories burned etc I know that this is an exercise that I can keep up with I am so happy 
4 0 Great product for the price fairly easy to assemble and great workout for a stroke recovery patient Bought this bike for my husband to get some extra rehabilitative exercise but found myself and my daughter in law both using it as well 
4 0 Good Bike with bad wiring The bike itself runs very well and is very solid However the wiring for all of the body monitoring and computer input is wrong with two male connectors under the seat that don t lock in with two male connectors under the arm bars and three female connectors coming out of the front upright tube which don t lock in with the two female connectors from the computer Does anyone have an idea on how to fix this 
5 0 Great bike I love this bike so far It arrived only 4 days after I ordered it It took a while to put together but nothing troublesome I m out of shape so the tension is good enough for me It is sturdy comfortableand I don t dread getting on it It s small enough to have in our family room so I can watch tv read or listen to music while riding It s easy to move to get it out of the way 
4 0 Interesting I finaly got this knife so I could figure out how they open D The knife is pretty good especially for the price It is a little hard to open though that might be the same with any paratrooper dagger 
5 0 Well made and functional This is the best front fender I have found It is so well made locks good and tight in your fork tube and deflects water and mud very well Also it looks very cool and solid and I think the price is very fair considering how well made this fender is Shipping from Amazon was fast as always 
5 0 Super Life Jacket This is a class I jacket class I is the best you can get Made for offshore but can be used inshore as well A little overkill can t hurt right The jacket fits good I feel like a marsh mellow in it but I didn t by this jacket for style The photo shown is last years model This years model has a total of 4 reflective patches on it instead of just 2 It also has a little loop to string a whistle or strobe device around for a little extra safety I highly recommend this jacket in all conditions Sometimes it s flat when you go out in the morning and rough 6 hours later This jacket covers all the just incase scenarios This is by far the lowest priced Class I jacket Heck it s even cheaper than most dinky class III jackets Other Class I jackets go for 2 3x s the price of this one Keep yourself and loved ones safe with a class I jacket 
5 0 Top quality Bought this for my son as a gift and liked it so much that I now have to order one for myself Great authentic design 
5 0 The Perfect Plane Bag I carried this bag on my last plane trip and it was awesome It was easy to carry and easy to access It has several convenient pockets inside and out There was a nice little pocket on an inside flap where I kept my ID and plane tickets Sure made it easy going from plane to plane It also took the place of a purse overnite bag and a carry bag Very roomy and you have both hands free Would not travel without it 
4 0 Bigger than is looks Needs more inner pockets It s a comfortable sling when filled The ipod pocket is handy The outer flap is secured by magnets It needs at least 2 inner pockets in the main compartment otherwise things get lost into the void Great travel bag 
5 0 Just purchased I had a Head TI S6 racquet and it wasn t enough for me not enough control with it I did a loner from my local sporting goods store an loved this racquet I m a 3 0 3 5 player the feel and the control of this racquet is ten times better than my other racquet Great racquet 
5 0 Review by former Physiology Fellow and coach who works in the area of stress management This latest version of Freeze Framer is an excellent tool for the home user to practice relaxation and learn to synchronize the two branches of the autonomic nervous system In HearthMath terms this state is called high coherence and represents a heart rate variability pattern where the sympathetic excitatory and parasympathetic calming parts of the autonomic nervous system are in balance In more simple terms it represents a state of less chaos in the nervous system which simply means we are in an optimum state that favors good health With respect to the software itself it has a nice user interface is easy to use and you don t have to have a technical or medical background to get the full benefit from it In fact you don t have to understand the technology at enjoy the benefits That s one of the things I most like This software is particularly good for people who are working with stress management pranayama meditation or other relaxation techniques and want to see the affects on their nervous system and heart How it does this is by exploiting monitoring heart rate variability from moment to moment By practicing meditation various breathing techniques or relaxation exercises one can see the affects on the nervous system as manifested in changes in heart rate variability HRV This data is shown graphically along with other useful information such as the percentage of time spent in the session in high medium and low coherence There is also graphical and audio feedback to let you know whether you are in high medium or low coherence in a given moment You can also measure pulse waves and see your pulse rate at any given time This software also allows you to save past sessions change many options and increase the thresholds for the various states of coherence This allows you to keep things challenging as you get better at achieving a state of balance There are also a variety of games available for you to practice your skills outside of the main program This package also comes with some useful tutorials and good online help It is very simple to use and doesn t have a busy or complicated user interface or instructions I do a fair amount of biofeedback work on some very expensive equipment and I find that this program has most of the things I need for heart rate variability measurements at a low price This makes it ideal for home users or people contemplating more in depth biofeedback work If you want to no more about the theory behind this product and how it could help you you can look at HeartMath s website or do a search on the book THE HEARTMATH SOLUTION by Doc Childre and Howard Martin You can also search on biofeedback heart rate variability and respiratory sinus arrhythmia on the web While I don t necessary agree with everything the HEARTHMATH SOLUTION says I think it makes some excellent points that have been validated scientifically and that I ve found to be true in my own experience and the experience of my clients I think one of the most powerful uses of this software is to see how different emotional states affect coherence such as anger compassion love anxiety etc For most people it s a very visceral experience to see how states of love and compassion correlate to maximum coherence It is also an eye opener to see how anger and other negative emotions cause these physiological states to deteriorate I also teach various types of meditation including loving kindness and forgiveness meditation This software is an excellent accompaniment to this type of practice or pranayama work in yoga In summary I think this is a great investment for busy people trying to find a simple stress management practice yoga practioners and meditators It will help you to develop higher awareness of your anxiety levels and other emotional states It could also be used in combination with therapy for anger management and other issues in a very effective manner The tutorial also gives you beginning instruction on how to increase your coherence on your own and points you to other more in depth resources If you have depression or other serious difficulties in your life then I recommend checking in with a professional as to the suitability of this product Some things just can t be treated on your solely on your own and I have found that deep relaxation practices without guidance when there are serious issues going on can evoke anxiety or strong emotions For the average person however this shouldn t be an issue 
5 0 IN YOUR FACE THIS IN YOUR FACE PRODUCT LETS YOU SEE INSIDE YOURSELF RIGHT NOW SEE WHAT YOUR MIND AND BODY IS DOING LETTING YOU GO FROM CHAOS TO COHERENCE IN SECONDS I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW PEOPLE HAVE SAID WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOUR DIFFERENT BY IT GET I GO FOR I 
4 0 Digital Compass Passes but not without sticking issues This little wonder does exactly what it s supposed to do It tells you in what direction you re driving That s what it does well What it doesn t do as well is stick to your windshield Even though it has three suction cups it still has trouble staying where you put it But aside from that issue it works as advertised 
4 0 Digital Compass Easy to install and setup Good solid bracket Works great The only negative is it doesn t light up so its hard to see at night 
5 0 Does the job I bought this on sale for around 10 if memory serves Works as expected A backlight is sometimes wished for but I find that the car s dome light makes the reading ascertainable If you do a lot of night driving you should consider a different compass one with a backlight 
5 0 PNI V100 compass Works very well easy to setup Price was right 
5 0 Digital Compass Works great I have it attached to my motorcycle and love it Very simple to set up and start using acurate and with the auto shut off very practical 
5 0 This ball is awesome It takes a special soccer ball to be used in the World Cup Finals and this ball is worth it I ve played semi pro and pro soccer in the US for years and this ball is great EXCEPT as a goalie that I play at times other than halfback it s darn hard to stop It wobbles a bit making it hard to defend But as an offensive player it flies true Not cheap but if you want the best this is it 
5 0 Goalllllllllllllllllllllllllll We gave this soccer ball as a gift to our 11 year old daughter for Christmas She absolutely loves it She brought it to her soccer practice and all the kids were checking it out My daughter says it plays really well has a good feel and bounce to it This ball was well worth the splurge 1 
4 0 The auseome the incredible bladerunner fury IT IS THE COOLEST SKATE ON EARTH THE FIRST DAY I WAS DOING 360 SOUL GRINDS AND 1080S DEFINITLY BUY THIS SKATE ps AUSEOME 
5 0 Great We needed these helmets for my students to participate in our State Special Olympics Rollerskating event We ordered them on Tuesday and they arrived by the time we left on Friday Great prices and ON TIME 
5 0 excellent heavybag substitute Great for an upperbody workout when space is minimal i love it 
5 0 travel yoga mat I got what I wanted a yoga mat easy to fold and easy to transport in its own shoulder bag 
5 0 Convenient I have 6 mats now of differing types including this Savasa and I really enjoy bringing this mat to class as well as use at home I participate in heated vinyasa yoga so this makes a great non skid layer underneath the woven mat or towel Because it packs up smaller than the mats I have to roll up it s definitely convenient for travel The little bag that comes with it can carry some essentials like an extra change of yoga clothes deodorant pack towel etc When I use it at home I find that the fold lines are great for alignment checks and I don t have the same slippage issues that I have with other mats I really appreciate the product 
5 0 EX3 Elliptical arrived by truck and fully assembled I have used this for one month and had no problems I am very happy with the purchase 
4 0 non commercial Although it is not commerdial grade it is still a good elliptical for the money I expected it to be more robust but at a thousand dollars I did not find anything better 
5 0 Kelly Kennedy Staff Writer for Army Times reviews Celox Shell based blood clotter works without heat By Kelly Kennedy Staff writer Posted Saturday Feb 10 2007 13 21 15 EST A scientist walking down a beach in Washington state noticed lots of crabs with no legs but none of them showed any signs of bleeding Most animals that lose a limb tend to bleed again after the initial injury so the scientist wondered why the crabs had such clean wounds The answer Most animals don t have shells It was the chitosan in the shells explained Limor Shemer spokesperson for Celox It stopped the bleeding The crustaceans natural body armor now serves a similar purpose for soldiers and Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan through a new quick clot agent Shemer said The feedback s been very positive she said It doesn t heat up Unlike other quick clot products troops have been using in the battle zone the seashell product called Celox doesn t depend on the blood s natural clotting agent to work Instead the seashells bind with the person s blood to create a clot That s important because other blood clotting agents such as QuikClot can heat up to temperatures of 230 degrees Fahrenheit enough to cause a second degree burn However Z Medica the manufacturer of QuickClot released a new product in September QuikClot ACS+ a clotting sponge that does not heat up enough to burn the injured person Celox also can be used on heparinized blood or blood that has been treated so that it won t clot on its own While HemCon which is standard issue for troops in combat zones also uses chitosan studies have shown it doesn t work as well to prevent bleeding because it is a dressing Celox which comes in granules is poured directly onto a wound and therefore works well on deep or arterial wounds Shemer said Scientists at the Portsmouth Naval Center N H applied Celox granules HemCon bandages or QuikClot granules to pigs with severed blood vessels in their thighs after letting the animals bleed for three minutes The study found that Celox reduced bleeding to nothing HemCon to 33 percent and QuikClot to 8 percent as opposed to a standard dressing which brought bleeding down by 50 percent Although all three agents were superior to standard dressing with regard to re bleed only Celox improved survival in a lethal hemorrhagic groin injury compared to standard dressing wrote Lt Cmdr Buddy Kozen in a letter about the study Celox was approved by the FDA in June and has been used in the war zones by Special Forces medics since September Shemer said Studies also found that even if Celox gets wet or is kept in humid conditions it may get clumpy but it still works It can also be easily rinsed from the wound Shemer said 
5 0 Great grip They work great Excellent grip only thing might be the fingers curl up but this is only a minor annoyance 
5 0 Beautiful block This Indian Rosewood Block is excellent Its grainy wood texture is beautiful and looks great in my home yoga studio I ordered 2 of them so I could have a pair These blocks are the perfect size and are also a nice weight Whenever my friends come over to practice at my studio they always complement these blocks and I refer them to order them online for themselves 
5 0 here it is noobs alright since it seems that someof you have no idea what airsoft is i will help you hop up is a must for electric guns it makes it fly farther and shoot harder it goes on and if with a buttin it is really easy to use second those rail things are important for up grades and things like that is is how things attach and the battery in most guns goes in the barrl hand grip area most of the time u want a gun that hits harder if ur on a team like over 400 fps and things that are gas powered this thing seems that it will brake easy too 
5 0 help o k first of all i can t wait until i get this gun But i need some help I think i will take of the shot gun part but where can the battery go second what is a 3 point sling Third what are those hand guard things Fourth what is the heat shield thing And lastly how does the hop up thing work thank you to any one who can help answer some or all of these questions and yes i am new to airsoft 
5 0 Great Weapon for the money If you re getting started in airsoft and you need an AEG to make yourself a deadly force on the field I recomend this gun I bought it last summer and I loved it The rocket launcher is kind of worthless It works like a shot gun Just pump and shoot a bb I think I used it once then it had to go It was too bulky and I didnt use it I also don t recommend dropping it too hard The plastic is kind of weak If you take care of it it will last you a good while I ve never had any problems with it jaming It shoots great The high capacity clip is a crap You have to crank it to load the bbs Unfoutunatly it s hard to find extra magazins for it You have to really look for what magizine it is compatable with All in all this is a great weapon to get started with it can compeat with many tokio marri guns obviously a tokyo mari will last longer because it has metal parts but you can still kick but with this 
5 0 Size I am looking at buying this gun but i have a question Is it a Full Size 1 1 or is it not full Also is the sling a 3 point one or 
4 0 Good gun I got this gun for christmas I was really happy i got a clip a few clips with it but some did not fit the hole was in the back and it was suppose to be in the front I have 2 problems with it one it was hard to put to gather took about 3 hours Second the shotgun stinks it goes about 8 feet other then that its Great 
5 0  cna u put a real shell in the 203 launcher part and what parts are mad of m etal and about how amny peices does the gun com in answert as quick as possibl 
5 0 Great product I received the product in the expected delivery time and it works great with my XP operating system that is running on my Apple computer via the Parallels software I downloaded the software to run the Interface from the Polar site Did not need the small CD that ships with the product which was too small for my CD drive 
4 0 No Problems but High Price I purchased this IRD from Polar because I don t want to face any problem during the interface between the watch and my laptop I had no problem with this device but I had a problem with the watch I returned the watch and kept this as IRD for my laptop Some people are saying that you can get any IRD from the internet for 5 to 15 but I prefer to go for Polar 
5 0 Finally Mac and Linux Support from Polar sort of I picked this up looking for a non serial or bulky IR device for my desktop PC but was VERY happy to find that it came with SigmaTel IR 721 USB IrDA Bridge Driver drivers for both Linux and the Mac on the CD in addition of course to the standard Windows drivers The only drawback with the Mac Drivers is that it is a Mini CD which is not compatible with the insert drives on Mac but I was able to get it installed successfully without issue on my MacBook Pro Intel Based and on my Windows PC Now if Polar could start releasing a Mac Version of their Polar Precision software and the other third party vendors of HRM Software like iSmarttrain can get the update out for this new hardware it will make many Mac owners happy Polar Precision 4 03 43 Mar 06 has worked with this device on my Windows XP SP2 on a Native Intel AMD Windows PC It also works fine on my Mac Book Pro under Nova Development s Parralels Desktop still windows but on a Mac running Polar Precision 4 03 43 I have not gotten Polar Precision to run under Dreamweaver s Crossover yet though but hopefully that is only a matter of time As an added bonus being this device includes Macintosh Drivers it could be used in theory to support other IR applications that have been limited by the lack of two way IR support on Macs as of OSX Tiger 10 4 x on the MacBook Pro the built in IR support is only receive mode 
5 0 PUGG 6 Footer Portable Soccer Training Goals Pair If your soccer club takes down their goals nets at the end of each season spring fall and you still want to take advantage of day with good weather these goals are the way to go They fit in a van truck car with decent trunk space perfectly and they re easy to set up and take down In many practice sessions you ll realize that they re a huge step up from using cones or flags as a goal and your team will appreciate the target they offer The quality of workmanship is excellent the netting holds up to powerful strikes and they bounce back well if accidently fallen over by a player with little injury to the player likely to occur These training goals are also perfect for the backyard player or travel player looking to improve his her accuracy Amazon offered the best price on the pair and I recommend them 
5 0 very good gloves These are probably the best gloves I have ever had The foam padding in seriously amazing plus they are very comfortable and seem to be pretty durable so far I would definately recommend these gloves to anyone who is serious about working out 
5 0 For serious and champion lifters These are by far the best gloves I ve used even better than the harbinger gloves I reviewed These gloves are very Thick on the palm thicker than any gloves I ve used providing real good protection from blisters and sores I have not gotten one blister or sore since using these and the wrist wrap is the best on these gloves 
5 0 great gloves I have used these gloves for over a year Still just like new 
5 0 superb My boyfriend was very thrilled with the gloves I was very pleased with the outcome I will definately continue shopping with amazon Thanks guys 
4 0 Bang for your buck I d have to disagree with the other reviewer I ve been a tennis teaching pro for seven years now and these balls have put up with tons of hitting and have great shelf life I ve used them in much less than desirable conditions and only have to replace them once a summer and I coach 5 or 6 times a week They bounce true and although they aren t the exact weight of a normal ball the average player would never notice 
4 0 Amazing scope for an amazing price I planned on using this scope for target shooting at 100 yards Unfortunately the product description at the amazon site was not all that detailed but I took a chance given the great review and the price It turned out having the parallax setting I was hoping for In other words you can focus the scope to any distance between 10 yards and infinite so you can get your target clear and parallax free at any range The clarity of the picture at 100 yards with 24x magnification is amazing It started raining while I was shooting and I was still able to use the scope effectively and the target remained bright and clear The reason why I am giving it 4 stars is that the scope I received is obviously one that was produced before Tasco changed ownership and as I understand it there is no support for this item 
5 0 TASCO TARGET 7 VARMINT 6 24X40 RIFLESCOPE Worked out very well on my Savage 17 varmint rifle Clarity and function of this scope is great considering the low cost of this instrument Very satisified with this product 
4 0 Knife Throwing This book is a great introduction to the art of knife throwing and I found it useful as a guide and as a teaching tool 
5 0 Bones Swiss Ceramics Labyrinth I did not order or receive this Please let me know how I can investigate this Cindy Peterson Dana 845 709 720 
5 0 Excellent bearings Just what I d expect from Bones I ordered these bearings to use on my rollerskates and chose this site to order them from because the price was the lowest I could find from a reputable website The product image is slightly different from the actual product and the description isn t very well descriptive but I received exactly what I wanted These are Bones Ceramic Labyrinth bearings eight in a pack I ve used Bones bearings for a while and I have always been impressed with them They hold up to abuse much better than other bearings I ve used I would highly recommend a set of these bearings to anyone looking for excellent high quality skate bearings It is also important to note that these bearings are designed for 608 axles 8mm and not for 627 axles 7mm They can be used on 7mm axles with the proper axle upsizing shims but without the shims they will not fit a 7mm axle 
5 0 Great Product In 2004 during my hike of the Appalachian Trail my water filter was nothing but headaches clogging and maintence I replaced the filter 2 weeks into my hike with Aqua Mira and used it extensively for the rest of the trip I found only a slight chlorine taste no worse than some city water I ve had The only issue was I couldn t drink my newly gathered water immediately as one could with a filter Water management had to be planned I would take my breaks at or near a water source so I had the aloted time for parts A B to mix properly Then once at camp first thing I would do is get and prepare my water then move onto setting up camp By the time I was done I had water During my hike and afterward I used it without any problems and without contracting any sicknesses I liked the product so much I m back to purchase some more for an up coming hike I m planning on the Ouachita Trail in AR and OK 
5 0 Great alternative to iodine I ve used Aqua Mira on 2 backpacking trips thus far and it has been better than iodine The only problem is spilling it when you mix both parts together and also keeping track of the time Eventually if you use this for over 2 weeks you ll begin to taste it because it will build up in your bottle however if you rinse your bottle out well your water will barely have any Aqua Mira taste if any 
5 0 super easy to set up and take down We bought this soccer net for our 3 year old who loves to kick the ball around With a quick two handed motion the net collapses to a convenient carrying size perfect to take to the park Excellent quality size and ease of use 
5 0 Professional use of cap light Am using the light for early morning and late evening trash hauling Heavy duty work Have tried several cap lights and this one works out the best so far The lights that fit on top of the cap do not shine where you are trying to look and we have not found any other cap lights that are as bright as this one 
5 0 20 oz Tank Good guality tank at a great price I think that two smaller tanks would have been better for me though 
5 0 co2 tanks I got these for my son for Christmas and he says they are great I am so glad I bought them through Amazon I saved a bunch of money and got high quality tanks 
4 0 good tank co2 is the best in hot weather but if u dont have an expansion chamber dont use during cold weather but other wise this is a good size tank that will fufill all ur paintball need 
5 0 I got two This is probably the best deal you can get on any CO2 tank considering they are brand new PURE ENERGY TANKS 
5 0 AWESOME TANK DUDE THIS TANK ROCKS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SOME CRAPPY OFF BRAND BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY A PURE ENERGY BEST DEAL I HAVE EVER SEEN THESE ARE 30 40 BUCKS AT A STORE 
5 0 from looking at it this tank looks like a PMI tank or pure energy idk cause i use air but i have a 12 oz that looks like it so i would buy it actulay i might buy it right now so if any one gets there comment back and tell me if its a pmi pure energy thing ok thank 
5 0 acc for paint gun this is a good co tank easy to fill and use 
5 0 Ping Pong Balls on time They were delivered on time I needed them for a game for my daughter s birthday party Got them on time and very reasonably priced Thanks 
5 0 more balls than you can shake a stick at How can 144 ping pong balls be anything but overwhelmingly positive Sure a few came out of the box cracked but great bang for the buck here Lots of pong gets played in the office sadly more ping than beer and we have some really good players but there have been no complaints about the balls 
5 0 Keys Pro Trainer Great unit It s really sturdy enough to support my 200+ lbs for push ups and gives me an awesome ab workout Better quality than I expected 
5 0 Versatile Product Well Worth the Money The thing that I like most about the Keys Pro Trainer is that I could do many different exercises with it The ab crunches are great but on top of that I could do push ups and dips with it too So overall I think the Pro Trainer gave me a pretty good bang for the buck 
5 0 Solid product This product is no joke I can do various exercises with it including dips ab crunches sit ups and push ups as well as stretching Work out regularly with the protrainer and you ll see results after a while in your targeted area Make sure you stretch before exercising 
5 0 Excellent product I ve been using the original purple AB Roller Plus for several years with good results and decided to try the Keys Pro Trainer Ab Roller because I was looking for more of a gym quality machine After using this product for a few days I must say it has exceeded all expectations It is similar in quality to the Pro Trainer Culb model made by the AB Roller people but at a third of the price It is comfortable to use and provides more workout options Most importantly it targets the abs much better than the AB Roller Plus Unfortunately it doesn t come with a workout video but using the AB Roller Plus workout video I find that I get a much better burn in my abs with the keys model 
4 0 Card Shuffler Item works reasonably well Sometimes the cards get jammed and flip over while being shuffled 
4 0 Loving it My hubby bought it for me for my birthday and I love it He also uses it just as often as I do A great work out out for a small price 
4 0 Exercise with ease A compact easy to use recumbent bike Easy to assemble as well My only complaint is it could have used more holes to open wider for long legged riders 
5 0 kids go outside This is a great item for those kids who only like to stay inside and play video games When i gave it to my kids they looked at me funny at first until they started to play with it Now they go outside and play with their friends I m very thankful for this item Its easy to put together and provides some good fun 
4 0 Halex Darts They are of good solid material and the case is sleek and cool We ve been using them a lot 
5 0 Speedo Swim Goggle Review I purchased 2 pairs of goggles for my 10 and 12 year old children They used them for a week on vacation in Mexico swimming in the pool and ocean Both of my children said they were the best goggle s they have had and were able to play in the water for hours at a time without having any eye irritation Both my children have light blue eyes which are very sensative to chlorine and sea salt I highly recommend them 
5 0 These are long lasting My daughter swims summer swim team for 8 weeks at a time and she has had the same pair of Jr Hydrospex for 5 years Yes years I don t know how they have lasted that long because we also swim at an indoor pool about 20 times the rest of the year Only now as a teenager does she need the adult size Hydrospex That s a pretty good recommendation 
4 0 Great fun I bought these for my daughter when she was a toddler She is now 4 5 and still uses them They are sturdy and safe We love to march around the house to music 
5 0 good fit My daughter a competitive swimmer for 5 years will only use these goggles She loves the suction cup gaskets that let no water in and the one piece design She feels confident that they won t slip out of place during a start She now has her younger sister insisting on these too 
5 0 Best bang for the buck Got it love it loved the price CD Best Buy and they were right If you don t want to drop 2 3 grand for the top of the line drop 800 bucks for this and enjoy I ve used it for nearly a year I ve lost 45 pounds combined with a sensible diet I put it by the TV it s quiet and the functions are great Pros Price features lightweight programs Cons LED lighting not as stable as higher priced items probably not a big deal unless you weigh over 300 pounds heart rate monitor is definitely off I d say it s about 10 20 too low In my years of internet shopping I rank this buy in my top 3 Enjoy 
4 0 Schwinn 418 Elliptical good choice I am very happy with my purchase This elliptical is big and heavy but I managed to bring it in piece by piece from my garage to my family room It took me about 3 hours to put together not too bad but you need to make sure you have everything you need and follow the directions as best you can After I put it together it had an awful rattling noise that I couldn t figure out When my husband got home he suggested it might be a plastic cover where the arm handle joins the foot pedals I put tape around it and resolved the problem It s not completely stable but pretty good for a home elliptical I m happy overall with my purchase and would highly recommend it The machine is rather long so you ll need some space for it I ve lost quite a few inches and I m not even dieting 
5 0 Excellent Exercise bike The Schwinn 212 is an excellent bike very sturdy and quiet I love all the different programs and it is easy to program My husband said this is the easiest assembly he has ever done The hardware was packaged showing what pieces go with each assembly step what genius Thanks Schwinn 
5 0 Great product Very solid construction feels like something you would find in a top gym Great variation in resistances I have yet to manage anything more than half way up the scale Built in heart rate monitor works great and a fairly good variety of preset programs to chose from If you are looking for a robust system you should definitely consider this bike It is pretty heavy so moving it around especially on carpet is not that easy even though there are wheels built into one end 
4 0 Addicted to Exercise I bought this bike 2 months ago and I ve been using it 6 days a week Pros Easy to assemble Reasonable Price severall exercise options Cons It is uncomfortable after a long exercise +60 min I don t like going to the gym so this bike is the perfect solution for a guy who works 9 10 hours in front of a computer 
5 0 Better than anticipated I read the reviews of this product before purchasing promises of fast delivery easy assembly etc with a grain of salt I live in a very rural area where nothing ever gets delivered in two days But the bike sounded so perfect for our needs I ordered it anyway I was amazed when two days later the bike showed up on my doorstep Assembly was incredibly easy with all the tools and hardware bubble wrapped and labeled by assembly step It could not have been simpler The bike itself is a wonderful exercise tool It is quieter than I even imagined and the ease of operation is unsurpassed I mix up my morning routine with a different pre programmed ride and I really get my money s worth In short this bike is everything that is promised and more 
4 0 JSam I agree with most of the reviews Some stated their box upon delivery was in bad shape They must have corrected that deficiency mine came in pretty good shape One gentleman indicated hearing a loud clacking sound when peddling that eventually went away I too have noticed the loud clacking sound and is still awaiting the day it goes away Someone stated the bike isn t geared for people under 5 4 I agree shorter people are going to need some propping Bike is sturdy Instructions are clear Overall a pretty good bike Seat is semi comfortable I really like the computer monitor It monitors distance heart rate and even have programs I took a star off due to loud clacking sound that I m HOPING eventually will go away 
4 0 I love this bike but bad shipping I want to say first of all I love this bike It rides smooth is comfortable and adjusts to fit my long legs so that I can get a full extension It is much bigger than I expected so I had to move around some furniture but it gives a great workout with a lot of choices It also has to be plugged in so make sure you have a place with a plug where you are going to put it That being said the rear stablizer bike works without it was broken when I recieved the crashed up box from ups I called and they overnighted a second one but UPS also broke the second one plastic part on outside So I emailed and they sent a rear stablizer out wrapped in many layers of bubble wrap It was easy to put together it took me less than an hour even with a two year old helping me It rides quite and other than the occasional beep from the computer it is silent I would give it 5 stars but I am taking away one for the trouble of having to contact them twice in order to get a part replaced twice 
5 0 Awesome Machine The Schwinn Airdyne is everything I expected it to be and a little more It is extremely well built and was easy to assemble I was hesitant to assemble it myself and the assembly instructions are minimal but clear and easy to follow The parts fits together beautifully and assembly went without a hitch Assembly took about 1 1 2 hours This bike is really awesome I thought free shipping and no sales tax was sweet the bike arrived in seven days from the date it was ordered from Amazon and I literally live in the middle of nowhere I was very impressed with the whole process especially with my wonderful new bike The fact that is good looking is just a bonus 
5 0 Terrific workout Most workout equipment either doesn t give a total body workout or they cause me to have joint pain espcially treadmills The Airdyne works both arms and legs and it easily will get my heart rate to wherever I want it The best part is that at the end of the workout my joints do not hurt I love my airdyne 
5 0 Good exercise I bought this for my wife who has been going to an exercise class for 4 years She rode an older model of this bike there and really wanted one It just fits in our bedroom at the end of the bed and we can run in and ride it for a bit any time of day She rides it for a half hour every day and I ride it for about 12 minutes I get in about 3 5 + in that amount of time and hit 18 mph for about 2 1 2 minutes so far It seems to be a good purchase and Donna thinks it may be one of our best investms thus far It seems to be well made and my only questinon is does it need greasing in any of the areas ever or at cetain times 
4 0 Schwinn Airdyne This is a pretty solid machine I have used them before in a local health club I think it is worth the money I like the new color vs white and it is super easy to assemble Issues it came in a box that needed to be sturdier mashed up but not damaged It has a little click during operation that seems to come and go and the rubber skuff pad adhesive is not satisfactory but also not necessary and I wouldn t bother with them It is a good work out for me becatuse I am missing one leg It is probably the best one out there if you want to get your arms into the action CWB 
4 0 Excellent for exercise awful to assemble Schwinn s assembly instructions leave much to be desired Poor poor graphics and the words didn t help much Additionally some of the nuts and bolts are of obvious poor quality However once assembled it provides a good workout Buying from Amazon was as always a great idea Free shipping and no tax saved my a bundle Amazon is now my favorite store internet or otherwise 
4 0 Good bike but you have to use it I like the bike a lot but I find it extremely loud and not very smooth The best part is the resistance I find the resistance to be much more realistic than magnetic or other kinetic resistance methods You work as hard as you pedal just like a real bike The only problem I have is I don t use it enough The seat isn t very comfortable it s not horrible but it s not comfy The noise is another detractor My bike seems to have a lot of squeeks and creaks but they re generally drowned out by the noise of the fan I probably should have checked out the one with the smaller fan but I researched all of this online I m 250lbs so I hope it holds together So far so good but time will tell It s an old school workout machine If you re looking for something effective but not refined this is it 
5 0 Some Assembly Required Seems to be a very good exercise product But the product description should mention that assembly takes about 2 hours Stabilizers arms computer pedals and seat need to be attached to the frame This should be easy but the assembly instructions are minimalistic at best The method for attaching the arms to the frame requires quite a bit of strength 
5 0 I Like it This is certainly not the least expensive piece of equipment I could have bought but I am glad I made the decision I did I am almost 300 lbs and this bike is plenty sturdy for me and I am sure it will still be working just fine long after I am dead It is quite comfortable and the seat adjusts easily up and down The air blowing on you from the front wheel is a nice feature too I like the little computer it gives a nice variety of measurments depending on what you want to use as a benchmark mph miles traveled time calories burned heart rate etc and you can monitor 3 at a time Overall a good purchase 
4 0 Pretty sweet nice and slick Although this stuff is inferior to Curb Candy it still makes grinds nice even on extremely rough surfaces It does last a real long time 
5 0 Tight Lines Excellent tools for your tackle box excellent use of material anti rust easy carry All in one complete package 
5 0 Great Knife LOVE this knife Looks great sharp as can be out of the box Thin enough for the pocket of my khakis One disclaimer use the safety It opened up in my pocket once no clue how and could have been dangerous 
5 0 nice little knife bought this knife for a friend it is small and sharp but mainly bought it for the looks very bright and colorful though i think this would ware away pretty fast if was put to much use 
4 0 Great little knife not for big hands Great little knife I ve taken to carrying it with me on every occasion my Native is too big Super sharp and keeps its edge even after some pretty heavy use Only beef is that it s a little hard to open and close with one hand because of its size I m going to have to get the leek 
5 0 Handy Sleek little knife I m mostly a kitchen knife collector but was so impressed by Kershaw Shun Ken Onion that I decided to try a style of knife sport that is his usual forte I m just as impressed with the design of this knife as I was with the Shun Onion knife It s compact it s attractive and sharp enough to shave an arm with I have the rainbow chive and I am still amazed that as much as I ve used it the surface and coloring is still intact and gorgeous I m now a believer in Speed Safe and have my second Ken Onion leek on order 50 dollars for a small pocket knife I hear people complaining Absolutely it s well worth the price but anybody who knows knives knows that the truly good ones are never inexpensive and last a lifetime You get what you pay for and this one is well worth it 
5 0 Knife Novice My first Kershaw knife But not my last In fact my second Kershaw has already been ordered Blown away by the quality of this product Extremely smooth operation Outstanding fit and finish Sharpest knife right out of the box I have ever purchased SWEET 
5 0 Kershaw Ken Onion A 1 Perhaps the best and most useful pocket knife you can have 
5 0 Great buy on a great pocketknife It took me a long time to accept the notion of paying more than 10 bucks for a knife This is a great deal though Very very smooth opening and closing action keeps an edge very well and is shipped to you super sharp already What I really like is the ability to keep it on you almost all the time since it is very small and light You have to be careful opening and closing it the first few times though read don t buy this for your Cub Scout Overall definitely the best deal I ve seen in this price range 
5 0 Excellent knife useful for personal safety I purchased this knife for about 4 cheaper than its usual Amazon listing price at Amazon s Friday Sale I had been looking at the Kershaw knives for awhile and following an incident in my building s parking garage woman accosted pocketbook stolen it seemed like the perfect time to buy The rainbow titanium coating color might bother some men but I m a woman so I don t mind the color of the knife I would have preferred the black on black but this was too good a deal to pass up The safety lock looks like it might slip out of safety easily but in two weeks time of regular wear use I haven t had a problem I flip the knife open often heck it s fun and I wear it regularly what s the point of having it if you re not prepared to use it The thin attached metal belt clip is very sturdy and multipurpose it looks similar to the metal clip on a writing pen Not only can I clip the kninfe just inside my slacks waistband but it clips easily to the inside leather pocket of my purse The single finger flip open mechanism is beyond belief very easy to use exceptionally fast and accurate The locking mechanism keeps the blade in place is extremely solid and has worked without flaw When I m walking anyplace suspicious by myself I hold the knife in the ready to flip open position in my hand held down at my side The knife is nearly invisible in that position so I don t stand out as oh my God she s carrying a knife However someone intent on a criminal act just might notice and avoid me altogether Great knife for personal safety Lastly like the other reviews point out these knives are SHARP I don t use mine to open letters boxes and typical pocket knife activities I believe that would gum it up and slow the opening speed of the knife so I anticipate the blade should have a good long life in my care 
5 0 Deceptively Effective This knife is wonderful I m one of the last people to get something that looks this girly but there was something about it that appealed to me It looks cute and innocent with the pinkish rainbow sheen mine has a lot more green and blue than the picture but it s wicked sharp Since it is spring assist it opens lightning quick and can be deployed instantly for opening boxes or what have you I like carrying mine with the pocket clip but it comes with a safety lock so you can carry it in your pocket without fear of having it accidentally open Very essential for the times when I m wearing dress pants and can t have a knife showing It is very small though It is perfect for kids or someone like me who has very small hands Though I do have problems opening the knife with the thumb stud It s just small enough that my thumb will slide to intercept the edge of the blade Fortunately it has index opening and with one flick of my index finger I can open it I carry larger knives in my jeans pockets on a daily basis but if you need something discreet and stylish you can t go wrong with the Ken Onion Rainbow Chive It certainly looks inconspicuous but it s incredibly useful for many applications 
4 0 Super versatile timer dial This is more of a timer than a stopwatch If you need to time standard intervals like a spin coach aerobics instructor or darkroom photographer then the dial can set any time to one hour quickly and time it once or over and over You can set in a longer interval that stays in the watch up to five of them Even the pace function is useful to set a run or cycling cadence So far mine works great and the button pushes have a very positive click which I like 
5 0 Does the Job well The chain is very reliable and holds my 100lb Heavybag with no problem 
5 0 Yummy I ordered the fuzzy navel flavor and it is delicious It tastes like I m drinking orange peach juice The texture is pleasing and there s no after taste I actually crave this stuff and it s sugar and fat free The sweetner in it is sucralose Splenda I can t wait to try other flavors Next I m getting Caribbean Cooler 
5 0 Austria not Australia All things was perfect except the US post Because some stupid monkey send the parcel to Australia I did not know why because the adress sticker was correct But the Australian post was so clever to send the parcel to me 
4 0 Energy sink This is our handy tool to avoid our kids bouncing off the walls instead they bounce count Its sturdy but portable enough to move easily around the house 
5 0 Very clear good distance If my wife can use it it s easy i bought em for a motorcycle trip They are perfect for use with the guy that have communication systems I didn t have a system I just wanted to be able to listen With a good headset I m clear and I hear my buddies clear 5 stars 
4 0 + + compact and lightweight no vibra no low power transmition at 0 5W 
5 0 Good radios I personally like these radios because they give good range than other brand like cobra The battery last full charge and it never brakes like cobra I recemend buying them if you need radios 
5 0 Good alternative to the hard to find T7200 As a former 2 75th Ranger I found these radios to be satisfactory for what they are I only use it when I need to be able to speak to the wife while we re working on projects no I don t make her transmit properly over the net but I do tie it off to her body lol but these SX800R radios allow me to talk to her across a city block approx 200 300m in downtown Las Vegas That means trees homes apartments townhouses and a shopping center in between us just not as loud and with static white pink noise That s downright impressive for a walkie talkie toy radio There were no battery failures issues Follow the directions and DON T turn them on for the first 16 hours of charging a problem for most I d bet The belt clips are fine no breakages there either There is a lanyard hole for you to tie them off so that s a non issue as well If I have a gripe it s not to do with the radio but the need for an accessory mic and earpiece as it s a PITA having to hold the radio up like a walkie talkie to receive and transmit because my hands are usually full Personally I ll fix that issue with a QUALITY throat mic whisper mic for the hooahs and acoustic ear tube setup or maybe the secret service hand mic setup I digress but overall after reading all the reviews of the prior Motorola FRS GMRS online I m satisfied with the SX800R especially the price almost free considering my other options RLT 
4 0 Versatile Radio with Extra Power I needed more coverage than the typical FRS radios provide I work with people outdoors in hilly terain reliable communications is vital so I tried 4 of these SX800R radios from Mot They where easy to set up and use The crew trained up in less that 5 minutes They provided the extended coverage needed and worked reliably Fast recharge and day long battery life was just what we needed The FCC has a quick and pain free way to get the license to operate at the higher power levels of GMRS Still in use today and very handy 
5 0 Nice Table Table came exactly as shown in the photo Works great for a small medium sized home poker game and quality is great for the price paid 
4 0 trike Tempting to the bigger children this trike is fun for all ages The front fork does not take the pressure an older child creates while riding aggressively and the result is the front tire axle can be forced out of position If not treated roughly this trike seems tough enough to handle even my 100lbs 11 year old 
4 0 SO MUCH FUN My former friend HAD one in blue We spent long summer days playing on this toy And it was so much fun But eventually it wore out and now theres a big hole in it I think it has cause a whole bunch of people jumped on it at once remember 2 at a time so much fun but doesn t last long 
5 0 5 stars is yes this toy is one of the best my mom have ever bought me thanks 
5 0 GREAT This trampoline is the best ever never before have I seen a trampoline only 8 all the others are 14 13 so one but only eight feet Great for chrilden for all ages I highly recomend this item I gave this item five stars for Educational value because if you use trampolines they increse young child s motorskills and for the fun and durablility i also gave five stars This tarmpoline RULE 
5 0 Wonderful for Mommy or Daddy and a small child This is a great toy for a small child I just got it for my highly energetic daughter s 3rd birthday and she loves it It s great bonding playtime too She always wants me to jump with her Best of all I m burning calories while we have a blast I gave it 3 stars for educational because it s obviously not teaching the alphabet or anything but it s teaching balance and coordination and spatial reasoning Since it s less than 2 ft tall she doesn t get hurt when she falls off of it and she has several times She just giggles and climbs back on I would highly suggest the enclosure for a child who was big enough to REALLY bounce but for a small child I don t think it s a requirement It s no more dangerous than falling off a couch or something All in all WELL worth the money 
5 0 thule carrier This is a great carrier We are a family of skiers This carrier was easy to install and I have put in it two snow boards two long sets of adult skis two pairs of kids skis and poles for the whole family This allows us to take a better gas mileage vehicle skiing and still fit all of the gear or to have room for groceries in the van when we come back down off the ski hill 
4 0 Late X Mas Present I ordered a blanket in the beginning of December as a gift True it was not recieved later than it stated but it took just a week to schedule a time to be home to sign for it It was incredibly aggravating but the product is good and I intend on giving it to the same person for their birthday in Feb 
5 0 Favourite Alert This overgrip is a favourite as well as the blue VS overgrip from Babolat They simply have great feel this one being the softer one 
5 0 Suunto Altimax Great Watch this is my fourth I have bought other models for different purposes and they are accurate and deliver all the performance I have required of them 
4 0 two year owner of altimax an excellent watch that could use some downsizing but its size gives the advantage of an easily readible face could use a mineral crystal lens even though plastic and inset but the best feature is the fact that the easily obtainable battery is so easy to replace that the wearer is not discouraged from using the features as often as necessary Unlike many other digital watches the band still fits my 6 inch wrist with holes to spare Although the operational functions are laid out well I was lost in trying to remember how to operate the watch after storing it away for several months after all to download the manual is 50 odd pages Still I think this is an excellent product that could be made better with the additions I mentioned 
5 0 NOW THATS A DUTY BELT Honestly the best duty belt I have ever used I am a Federal Security Enforcement officer and this duty belt goes leaps and bounds above my Government issue gear I am planning on starting up my own security company and I can say Ill be ordering these in bulk for all of my officers Thanks so much pyramid air Officer Steve Doh 
5 0 belt will go almost 50 plenty room outside ur chore coat as w the 1st opinion this belt in value quality beyond the price i m a 40 waist there is plenty of room maybe to 50 for using over outter wear altho i haven t taped as for smaller closure is velcro i doubt u could slim to less then 24 here again that s an eyeball i use side arm w a shoulder it is great have the nightstalker rifle 1008 hand pistol stuff i need for both carries well in the belt shoulder harness hope this helps joh 
5 0 Well made for the price I have a size 38 waist and this belt fit me fine out of the package If you re smaller than 36 or larger than 40 it might not be for you The quality is good for the price I was a police officer way back when leather was everything but this belt is just as good The keeper s shown are fake they don t unsnap to attach to your pants belt I m an airgunner not soft air so I can t vouch for magazine clips fitting in the horizontal magazine pouch I put a spare CO2 in one and my 4 folding knife in the other Leapers is velcro heaven I have 2 Leapers waist holster and they fit real well mgs 
5 0 Awesome This chin up bar works great It only took a few minutes to install and it looks good I weigh about 230 and it supports my weight without any problems Great product for a great price 
5 0 Chin up This bar is great for my 12 year old son He uses it every day and his strength has increased The padding makes it more comfortable and thus he uses it more often Just don t forget if you put it in a door way that you use bathroom door that it is there it is self critiquing 
5 0 Great Workout Aid The braces attach permanently to your door frame but the bar can easily be removed when not in use My 7 year old can take it down My teenager uses it for chin ups and my 7 year old uses it to do pull overs to practice for gymnastics 
4 0 Maximizes my push ups Even though these are made of plastic they are very durable and can support my 150lbs with no bending They can be easily disassembled for travel storage by pulling off the two legs from the handle no tools needed The best feature is probably the angled handle bars which reduces stress on my wrists 
1 0 Blackburn products are cheap Dont buy this product I have the other mountain bike pump which is same junk just smaller Its 90 plastic which doesnt hold up even with very occasional use Save your money get something else 
5 0 Chain runs like new It s simple really The stuff goes on wet and needs a little time to dry then your chain is lubed via a light wax covering which does not cause any GUNK build up The wax falls away while riding as your chain stays lubricated You gotta use it more than the others but so what No more grease on the pants 
5 0 Love it Several times I have looked at White Lightning in stores and never felt like going through the hassle of buying it and prepping my bike I recently had a change of heart and picked up a bottle After a thorough degreasing I applied several coats of White Lightning and let it dry overnight The next day the results were amazing My bike was much quieter and shifting was much better Ever since I ve been using White Lightning as my primary chain lubricant 
5 0 Alveo Shorts An excellent product designed to be a firm fit along the lines of compression garments At first you feel very snug as the fit is tight but as you ride there is no resistance and it s great not to get snagged by the saddle on mountain biking technical sections I live in a very hot and humid country and find the fabric is cooler than any other I have used and dissapates the sweat very well The little pocket is great for used gel sachets It is quite a short leg length not for the very self conscious An excellent product will buy another pair 
5 0 Fast shipping I was so suprised how fast I received the Dome Tent I have not had a chance to hook it up to my car yet because it has been snowing here but I am really excited to use it this summer Thank you 
5 0 Great Thick Yoga Mat It was exactly what I expected I used it right out of the box It really is 1 4 in thick 
4 0 pretty good buy I like the skates They are worth the money They run a little small though I wear 8 1 2 I bought a 9 they have very little room in them Other than that they are comfortable 
5 0 These rock Ok I don t know what that last guy s problem was I ordered two of these on the advice of people that I assumed knew what they were talking about it seems they did Now they are damned impossible to load without the speedloader and they can be a bit of a pain putting the last 20 or so BBs in even with the speedloader but they work great To settle the argument about capacity I filled one up as far as I could and then I emptied it and counted 70 BBs 
5 0 Good Magazine Dont listen to the last review He is wrong on the outside of the magazine there are marks that only go to thirty but i counted and it does hold 70 or mabey more I bought one with my high power AUG that i ordered and it turned out to be the same one it comes with It is a pain to load without a speed loader but dont worry beacuse the High Power AUG comes with one It is made of high quality plastic and fits nicely into the gun I would recomend buying 2 extra beacuse the High Power AUG goes through bbs quickly The picture is also wrong so i will post a picture of the actual thing Manufactured by BOTH ELEPHANT the same people that make the High Power AUG 
5 0 Great gloves for the advance and champion lifter These gloves are by far the best gloves I ve used very comfortable and protective for tough workouts And as an advanced lifter lifting weights three times a week these gloves have been very good Best part of these goves is the wrist wrap feature which protect the wrist during heavy lifts and it really protected my wrist Update for these gloves is I would have to rate it a four because they will tear in about 5 months and start to lose there protection for your hands 
4 0 Workout Gloves Really prevents tender hands from being torn up Really protectst the wrist too 
5 0 Carry it all the time in the car This cot has saved me many a time when bed space was limited because of it s small carry size It is not the easiest to assmeble or the quickest but it is there when I need it It is lighter and a smaller package than any aluminum cot I have found inspite of using a steel frame The one recomendation I would make is get one with the nylon mat I have one in nylon and one with cotton Carrying them all the time in the car the cotton takes more care to keep it mildew free In summer I understand cotton is cooler and gives more but I can not tell the difference One more consideration this may not be the cot for heavy person It works great at 200 pounds 
4 0 Sunfitness Deluxe 4pc Yoga Mat Set The product is good The only thing that I did not like is the mat was a little thin Other than that it is a good product 
4 0 Mongoose Dirtgrinder The first one we got was defective Amazon promptly sent out another one and picked up the defective one Communication was excellent and the new ATV works very well I love that we can control the speed with 2 speed settings I will defnitely keep Amazon in mind for future purchaces whether large or small 
5 0 Wow Why did I not find toy sooner The Mongoose Dirt Grinder is so far ahead of Power Wheels or any other piece of junk plastic riding vehical that I do not know where to start My kids woke up on Christmas to find a Power Wheels Hummer that they were thrilled about They jumped in proceeded out of the garage and into the yard That s about it My 5 and 3 year old boys couldn t turn the wheel and if they could the plastic wheels had no traction to get up the mild grass slope or the slightly sloped driveway The dirt grider has a very strong tube frame suspension steel drive chains and steel wheels with rubber tires The capability to cut the speed in half using a separate key is great and I belive my boys will be enjoying this toy for a long time This thing can even haul me around at 6 4 and 190lbs though not rated for it It went through the snow fair enough last weekend and the kids are getting a lot out of it My bottom line point is that if you are going to invest in something like this that will consume garage space then it better well work and give the kids hours and years of fun 
5 0 This ATV is awesome This is a real ATV with an electric motor It blows away those plastic ones you see in toy stores This ATV has a metal frame suspension front and back pnumatic tires lights keyed ignition etc My kids love it Plus it has a seperate parent control key to set the max speed at 4 or 8 mph which is great for the younger kids It seems to go pretty long on a charge and can go over about anything My kids are the envy of the neighborhood with this Plus the neighbors don t mind it because with the electric motor it is very quiet 
5 0 extremely well built I was amazed at the quality of engineering and materials used in this machine Most electric ride on toys have tiny batteries weak motors which last minutes and plastic tires which need an absolutely flat surface Not so this unit This is truly an ATV with it s hour and a half cycle time and pneumatic tires The kids absolutely love it ages 3 5 This is a toy that will last for a generation 
5 0 mongoose dirt grinder this in my opinion is the best compaired to the red one at walmart made by a different company twistgrip throttle full suspension lights keys for ignition and speed control loud horn 2 speeds forward 2 speeds reverse 2 12volt batteries over2 hours run time 154 pound max load big 300 watt motor will cary my son and i no problem not recomended im 140 son is 40pnds and 4 years old and has no problems riding it on slow 4 5 mph on fast 7 5mph which is faster than i can run to keep up he has crashed into everything possable but no damage to the mongoose at all the picture does not do it justice it looks better in person much better than razor dirt quad w its 40 min runtime 6volt batt no lights or speed control and front shocks no rear shocks 20 inches longer I hope this helped your desision on making a purchase I am very pleased with my purchase from amazo 
4 0 Great upgrade from Power Wheels We just purchased this for our 6 year old for Christmas He has been begging for a 4 wheeler and we re not ready to go gas powered This one is a little small for the age age my almost 3 year old looks like it was made for his size but it is too fast for little ones My 6 year old likes the speed and isn t bothered that it is on the small side He could have handled it last year though The battery life seems good It is not recommended to get it wet which may be a concern as our son loves riding through puddles 
5 0 Awesome knife I had my knife for 10 years and would still have it if not for the 2nd instinct of putting it in my back pocket whenever I leave the house One night I was heading for a flight at the airport going thru security when I realized I had it on me I had no choice but to throw it out So had to get another one 
5 0 Excellent product It is the same step we use at the club Shipping was SUPER fast too 
5 0 Received promptly steps in perfect condition Just as advertised Only problem was that the DVD in one of the boxes was damaged during shipment The other step s DVD was in great shape 
5 0 Aquaskies OK so it s a trip down memory lane to begin with this is the step that we first saw in use starting in the late 80s at the health and sports club that we taught aerobics at all over Southern California Same step same high quality You can find a little cheaper step around but this is the one that we all knew back when This is the step that took all the abuse professional classes at high end clubs could dish out and still look like new Highly recommended we love having this step right height right size adjustable strong as an ox and looks good too The memory thing that s just a bonus for us aerobic instructors out there 
5 0 Comfortable Quiet Ride I purchased this over a month ago and have rode it on average 5 7 times per week It was easy to assemble although I did get some help from my 4 year old son The heart rate monitor was a little flaky at first and would reset to zero when I was in the middle of a program but I later found that one of the plugs was not in all the way I usually use it in the early morning when everyone else is asleep and with it being so quite I dont have to worry about waking anyone I m 6 foot and find that the adjustments still have plenty of room both shorter and longer I m 41 and had been doing light weight training for about a year but hadnt done any aerobic exercise for a long time I started using it with the 20 minute programs at a resistance of 5 using the first program 1=Fat Burn 2=Max Fat burn 3= Aerobic working my way up to the third program The digital display shows you whether your speed matches the program with an easy to see light I am now on resistance 6 second program after four weeks with two more resistance levels to go During some evenings I just ride it for an hour at a steady 10 mph watching tv I would recommend this to anyone wanting an inexpensive comfortable exercise bike to get back in shape on 
4 0 A great deal for the money My husband bought me this bike for my birthday We really searched for the best bike and thanks to other reviews we bought this bike This bike accomodates me at 5 9 and my husband at 6 3 with no problem It is very quiet Although mine has developed a small squeal it is still not even loud enough for me to really care about or call in for advice I gave this bike 4 stars because the computer comes off a little too easily I have many small children and they take it apart a lot Nothing a little sticky tape cant fix My mother in law bought a bike for two thousand dollars and ours are almost identical hers did not develop a small squeal obviously Even the programming choices are the same Mine is a little lower to the floor also those of you with kids in the house will appreciate the lower profile your kids will have a shorter distance to fall off when they are climbing on it A good deal for the money feels solid and well built yet I can move it from one room to another easily when so inclined thanks to the rolling endcaps on the frame Aslo easy to move for vacuuming

4 0 Solid Comfortable Rower I am very pleased with this rower after 4 weeks of use It is very solidly built and the action is extremely smooth Assembly was straightforward with no missing parts As others have noted the manual could have used a bit of editing and some features like the pulse recovery mode are very poorly explained but you eventually figure it out I really like the constant heart rate mode which interacts with a Polar chest strap they actually provide a chest strap with the unit and adjusts the resistance to keep your heart rate in a defined range This is a good choice 
5 0 Like Being Back On the River I ve been using the Lifecore R900 Rowing Machine for a week since purchasing I used to row in an eight This machine is sturdy well engineered quiet and smooth It s the closest thing to oars in the water I ve experienced on any rowing machine but without the choppiness of waves and having to set up the boat It provides a true rowing experience and a great work out I had some questions initially about the feedback graphics which I emailed to the company and the president responded the same evening pretty impressive customer service He had one of his employees recontact me by email to make certain I d had my questions answered adequately There are so many similar products out there that I haven t tried and cannot make an honest comparison among them all I m just very lucky I chose this one because of its excellent engineering and simulation of actual rowing Even more important than the excellent quality of the machine is the obvious nature of the company that built it they ll stand behind it and be very helpful with any problems it certainly appears so from my experience with them P D M Woodstock GA 
4 0 Look No Further Faithful readers may have read the review of my previous dealings with a rower from Brand X I have been using this rower for a few weeks now and I am very pleased As other reviewers have noticed the magnetic resistance is very quiet I sometimes get rattling from the seat but not much Okay unlike other machines the max weight limit on this machine is 350 pounds not 250 The LCD display is great in my dim basement the heart rate feature is the HEAT I waited to try that feature before I wrote this review It s compatible with my Polar Heart Rate Monitor s existing chest strap one is supplied anyway The pulse program is useful as it raises resistance to raise your heart beat to a preset target and also reduces resistance to lower your heart rate to the target rate There is even a pulse recovery feature for when you stop rowing It monitors how quickly your heart rate recovers in a minute and displays your score from 1 6 to the nearest tenth The preset programs and options are varied enough to prevent boredom If there is any drawback it s the way that the operator s manual needs a couple of readings to get the meaning across In fact I basically tell you more about the Pulse Recovery feature than they do in the manual Barring that I was able to assemble the rower by myself in one session using the tools that came with it Overall a very satisfactory balance between price and features UPDATE 16 March 2007 I had a part break in the seat I called Customer Service and not only spoke to a human being but a human being in the States The part was on it s way THAT DAY Now THAT is what I call a positive experience 
5 0 Very pleasant surprise This is an incredible machine you can essentially do anything on the Ultimate that you do in a gym The first time I used it I was as sore the next day as I have ever been from free weights And for people who workout you know that being sore can be a good thing shows you actually did something Any exercise you can think of you can do on this machine and they all provide great resistance It is beautiful to be able to push yourself without worrying about needing a spotter Overall this is a super home gym even the delivery was fast and simple Putting it together takes a little work but once you re finished it is a solid well built device and the instruction manual is very clear Highly recommended if you re fed up with trecking to the gym 5 days a week 
5 0 A great workout even as good as the gym I have been using a Bowflex for years I am a huge fan Although I rip the Xtreme2 in my review of it I love the Ultimate The workout is as good and maybe even better than the gym I m a big guy and fairly strong The Bowflex gives me a great workout and even challenges me I honestly think its a better workout than the gym because with this I can go very heavy and not worry about having a spotter or dropping the weight on me You can apply all bodybuilding techniques including pyramiding drop sets rest pause sets low reps high reps heavy duty etc Additionally changing the weight and cables is quick and easy making the transition from one exercise to another quick so you can keep your heart rate elevated I have put on alot of mass since getting my new Ultimate not too long ago Those who say you can t go heavy or can t get a gym type of workout must not be doing it right This equipment can and if properly applied will give you a kick a_ _ workout 
5 0 It worked for this ol guy OK I m not THAT old 51 but I was starting to feel that way One day I woke up and realized I was 25 pounds overweight Add to that my rising blood pressure and poor lung capacity and you get the average guy in his 50 s As I wathched the Bowflex infomercial I just said to my wife I ve had it I went out and got one that weekend Well with the help of Bowflex and the accompanying diet info I lost the 25 pounds and have kept it off for almost 2 years now In addition I got into good enough shape that last year my wife and I bought bicycles for Christmas and have had a great time riding on weekends My blood pressure dropped and I can easily wear 34 waist pants again I have had to buy new clothes but it s well spent Take my word for it dieting alone will not do it Get a Bowflex follow the diet plan and use the machine You WILL succeed Oh one more thing Be warned As the pounds drop off be prepared for lots of comments Some folks will be complimentary but other nay sayers will try to drag you down by saying things like you re losing too much weight It sure is nice to be complimented at my age Good luck 
4 0 Make Sure You Have The Time Though once this piece of excercise equipment is built it s everything the advertisements from print to infomercial declare However somewhere I swear I read it takes only 45 minutes to put together and just taking the parts from the 5 large boxes took well over an hour Further the actual installation took over two days and I d like to think my buddy and myself are pretty good at these things However as I said once put together this is one solid helpful piece of excercise equipment One more thing be sure you have the space for it once assembled It really is a large piece of equipment both vertically and horizontally Good Luck 
5 0 Great Bag We looked all over the internet for a Bengals backpack for my 9 year old son He is a huge Bengals fan and all we can find in our area is Detroit Lions This is has many great pockets comfortable to carry and seems to be made well Would recommend 
4 0 NFL Backpack NY Jets My son loves this backpack It has tons of room and fits all his school books gym clothes etc I would definitely recommend it 
4 0 high price this item has a very high price if it could be lowered at USD 110 00 ill buy 2 pc 
5 0 Adorable Trike We bought the Disney Minnie Mouse Trike for our daughters 2nd birthday and her eyes just lit up when she saw it Eventhough she can t quite pedal the bike on her own just yet she loves to ride on it with us pushing her We are going to get the pedal blocks to make it easier for her to learn to pedal I would highly recommend this trike for any little girl 
5 0 Minnie Mouse 10 Trike I just love this trike The picture on line does no justice for this product If you want to buy something very unique for your little princess this is the perfect trike My daughter just loves it as much as anyone that sees her ride it 
5 0 Beautiful trike I love this trike the quality is great The price was very good You don t see these at stores Very nice my daughter loves it Get lots of compliments 
5 0 cutest tricycle we have seen easy to assemble and very cute for little girls our daughter fell in love with from the moment she saw it and it is very easy to ride and the sit has to settings to fit your child just right 
5 0 Randikay The InTone Jogger was exactly what I was looking for and hopefully will help get my ankles in shape along with the rest of me I read other reviews and really expected to have a difficult time getting it put together My husband and I got it all done in less than 15 minutes It s great I ve looked in local stores and can t find joggers like this When I did find this and at the shipping was free it was a much better deal than I could find anywhere else 
5 0 Good Value I love this rebounder It was a bit difficult to assemble but the instructions did say it needed two people to assemble it I have had no trouble with it the handle is sturdy and the cover stays in place It came with a DVD instead of VHS which was listed but I still have not watched it Good workout with less impact 
5 0 pleased I was suprised at how sturdy it is The metal tubing is thicker than I was expecting It wasnt too difficult to put together but it took two people 
4 0 stable and great video It required a strong man to assemble it Stability bar is great Video is a much needed addition because it s hard to find something to do on the trampoline It really supports the suggested weight I think the price was a little high considering it doesnt fold 
5 0 Great Product This product is better than expected Well constructed and it works very well 
4 0 good bounce I would rate this with 5 stars except that it is hard to put together especially getting the cover on the springs It took two of us to get it on and we will not be taking it apart for daily storage Once on the cover has remained in place The feet screw on and are secure The handle wiggles a little but is plenty sturdy I recently had knee surgery and the handle plenty sturdy enough for me to feel comfortable using it Once together this trampoline works very well The kids jump on it ALL the time The handle keeps them from getting out of control I have not had to tell my kids to stop jumping on the couch or beds since getting the trampoline They just needed a good place to expend their energy in the winter The springs give it a good bounce too I have not tried the video yet but the trampoline has been good for adults too 
4 0 jogger Exactly what I wanted and as described It was a bit harder to put together than I would have liked but once done it works fine 
5 0 Great Product I don t know what the other reviewer was talking about This product as pictured is exactly what you get with the VHS tape and all It has springs and not straps The only drawback of this item is the cover that covers the springs literally takes 2 3 people to put on and comes off quite easily The trampoline is very sturdy as we have had ours now for more than 2 years and my husband and I have used it as well as our three kids 
4 0 yoga chica i have to say that i LOVE this mat the combo jute and rubber make it nearly impossible to slip only thing is the jute and rubber are rubbing up against one another and kind of crumbling and flaking off where i often place my feet causing bald spots on my mat haha weird huh so now you know other than that the mat is visually very pleasing 
5 0 A hit Great quality and a hit with my son in law an avid fisherman They run a bit large 
4 0 Stanley 20oz Classic Mug The product will keep items hot or cold for up to 4 hours Since it is solid with no glass interior it is virtually indestructible It is dishwasher safe 
5 0 Great fun I m 33 but a kid at heart This was a great purchase Easy to learn and lots of fun I ordered a size bigger than my regular shoe size and it fits perfectly 
5 0 Speedo Rubber Nose Clip I bought the nose clip because face masks always seem to leak for me With the use of the clip to keep water out of my nose I can use a snorkel rubberbanded to the head strap of my very comfortable swimming goggles and not have to worry about leaks Of course I don t know yet how long the clip will last but Speedo is a good brand the clip is comfortable and I ve already gotten a lot of use out of it Joan Frost 
5 0 thule rack systems rule thule 871 is a great fit for the 07 toyota FJ fits great between OEM roof roack and reduces wind noise while underway greatly solid product i always use thule 
4 0 Not a bad trike We gave this trike to our son for his third birthday He s pretty tall but he had no problems reaching the pedals Took a bit to put it together but that s the case with any new trike bike product and the seat kept wanting to slide down even after tightening Eventually my husband got the seat to stay If your child is over 3 feet tall you should be able to adjust the seat enough to get his her legs to the pedals 
5 0 big is great I m glad that the first reviewer mentioned that the trike was too big My 7 yr old suffered a stroke last year and I needed a large trike for some therapy This trike works very well for the purpose 
5 0 Sturdy Little Digger I have an almost 3 year old grandson who is totally into construction toys and the sandbox He loves this digger and so does grandpa I found a cheaper digger when searching online but while the reviews said the child loved it there were also comments about it being less than sturdy Assembly is from drawings only little or no written instructions so you should have someone somewhat mechanically handy to put it together There are a number of plastic discs and rings that are important to not forget as they provide protection at various potential pinch points I had to re do some of these parts because in my hurry to put it together I failed to notice all these parts in the drawing Being winter now we are using it mostly indoors with blocks and beans and under a covered patio in a sand box but will move it into the garden area as the weather improves I bought this model because of Kettler s reputation for sturdy toys and I have not been disappointed This one will last for years 
5 0 my boys love this I have a 2 and 3 5 year old and they both love this toy I m ordering another one because they fight over it We put it in the sandbox and it s easy for them to control and they have literally spent hours playing with it 
4 0 Metal Detector GC1016A review The product is simple to put together seems to be functioning well and a good value for the money We actually ended up with the next level up due to a supplier issue 
5 0 Metal Detector We received prompt delivery and the detector was well packaged It was a Christmas present for our grandson so there was some delay between our receiving the detector and giving it to him The detector worked fine out of the box and all are happy 
5 0 Great Watch I have had this watch for 6 months now and during the height of the climbing season I can say I love it It does everything it it claims plus looks great I had a Avocet wrist altimeter for 10 years before this and the Suunto is much better and more accurate Yes it does take some study and getting used to but if you make the effort it will reward you So why do I like it 1 It looks great small enough to not grab attention like the funny looking bigger watches but classy Have not found scratching to be a problem even with rock climbing if you are careful 2 The controls make sense After having the Avocet this has multiple screens that if you use them for a time you don t even have to pause to find what you are looking for 3 Very accurate I climb much during the year and it is as close as a altimeter will get to accurate I compare the readings with my friends GPS and we are always within 50 feet or less 4 Being a mountaineer I love the lightness of it compared with the steel model I highly reccomend this watch 
5 0 Perfect watch for Urban Survival The watch is perfect I wear it in a business casual work environment during the day It keeps my bearings correct when I surface from the subway On the weekends it s ideal for roaming in the country side The slim design and light weight make for a comfortable fit I find the controls and settings to be very logical The black faced titanium looks great Thumbs up to the manufacturer 
5 0 A Great Watch For The Outdoor Person Great conversational piece The Titatium housing gives it a cool look on the black face As for the performance I have found the Barometer amp Compass to be extremely accurate The temperature is very accurate but you have to take it off your wrist for true reading I also love the chronometer stopwatch for jogging timing each mile I have not gone skiing yet so I really did not use the altimeter or try to figure it out yet The only negative I found is the alarm is not that loud and for the price I think the band could be all titatium instead of titatium amp elastomer strap together I never leave home without it 
5 0 Great gear Just got my Observer and I couldn t be happier Despite some of the reviewers comments on the instructions I found them easy to understand I spend a lot of time in the field and am looking forward to putting this watch through its paces 
5 0 A great kayak for back country streams This kayak is great for kayaking shallow streams Firstly it is very light I can carry it comfortably for moderate distances over dry land This allows me to avoid various obstacles in the water just run ashore pick the boat up and carry it past the obstacle Fallen logs arent a problem any more Secondly it is very durable Ive been using the kayak for about a year now with absolutly no problems There is an extremely durable outer shell made of nylon which protects the part of the boat that actually inflates this prevents any kind of sharp bushes or protruding brances from puncturing anything vital The bottom is coated in rubber which has yet to show any defect The rubber realy helps in shallow water or even in no water from rocks and dirt puncturing the inner tubing Thirdly and probably most importantly it sinks into the water only a little bit Paddling in 5 6 inch deep water isnt a problem as it is with most boats including inflatable sit in kayaks The boat is also alot of fun in the ocean much moreso than the standard ocean kayaks This is mostly because you cant hurt yourself by having the kayak run into you or flip over you Playing in the waves is really enjoyable The boat comes with a mesh bag with a draw string and backpack straps This is a good idea the mesh allows water to drain out after the boat is packed away and the backpack straps are suprisingly comfortable There are some problems with the boat The maximum wieght may be 250 pounds for the kayak but this is pretty unrealistic At 150 pounds i can sit comfortably in the kayak without there being a significant bending problem where the middle of the boat wants to sink lower than the ends With about 200 pounds the bending problem comes to be rather obnoxious because water collects right where youre sitting You WILL get wet using the kayak if youre over 150 pounds or an inexperienced paddler There are some tracking problems that can be eliminated by using the skegs The skegs of course make the boats clearance much more of a nuisance The tracking issue isnt an issue for experienced paddlers but if you want your inexperienced friend to take the kayak for a whirl he ll spin in circles for about an hour before getting the hang of it Inflating the kayak is very easy adn takes about 5 minutes Deflating the kayak is a bit trickier taking about 10 minutes Buying the sevylor pump that has both a pumping and vacuum function reduces the time needed for deflation 
5 0 solid solid piece of equipment and so much cheaper than the whole rack and solid cargo carrie 
5 0 Thule escape a great product We took this bag crosss country 4000 miles and lived to my expectations We encountered snow storms 14 plus continuous hours of pouring rain and the results were excellent I had two North Face base camp duffles inside and everything was pretty dry some minor dampness occured due to the extreme weather encountered The pros definitely outweighed the cons and I highly recommend this product 
4 0 Great value This set has a great cost benefit ratio The clubs perform well and also look good The only drawback is that the bag does not come with a travel cover neither does it have a support to keep it standing while playing Overall evaluation is very good though 
5 0 I love these bottles These bottles are great and I know I am getting a lot of water throughout the day due to the oz markings on the side I love it 
5 0 Wouldn t leave home without it This bottle is excellent if you are active and tend to drink a lot of water such as I do The spill proof cap is a great benefit too Very durable also I ve already dropped it twice and has not suffered in the slightest I highly recommend this bottle 
5 0 Great water bottle I love this water bottle It is perfect for me I love the no leak feature and the straw seems to hold up under lots of biting Wish it were a little smaller at the bottom so it would fit into my car holder better No complaints so far 
4 0 Awsome For 800 you get an ultra quiet well built sturdy machine This is money well spent and for me 800 00 is alot of cash so when I went searching for an elliptical I did a lot of reading up on them The warranty is by far the best on the market the 18 stride is great I am 5 11 207 pounds Its exremely low impact which is great for folks like me with bad shin splints Easy to put together since I did myself in a little over an hour The display is easy to use and read It is very quiet and does not rock back and forth or sway from side to side I have been using it almost every day of the week This is not my first elliptical but I hope its my last for a long time Good luck all I have had this machine for almost a month It still seems like a great buy to me and I have been using italmost every day Unlike alot of machines I read about this machine has a little fan built in that works The built in speaker is kinda neat but is not the best I have my machine near my pc anyhow so I wont use this feature much any how I will update my review sometime up the road so all of you future buyers can have an honest opinion Good luck and great health and fitness to all 
4 0 Great price and sturdy Guarantee to give you a sweaty workout Got this from Amazon The product arrived pretty quick Took my wife and I about 1hr to put everything together I use it for 30 min and I was sweating like crazy I also like the built in fan and speaker where you can hook up your ipod and listen to the music THe forward peddling motion is a lot better than the reverse There are some system out there that has smoother action but personally those system never really give me a true workout This model is not Precor but it s not 2000 either For the price a home model you can t really go wrong with this system 
5 0 Great machine My family absolutely loves this machine It has tons of different styles of workouts to do I ve had a long history of running and this thing gets my heart rate going and gets me huffing a puffing The only complaint that I have is that it squeaks We ve tried a lot of different things to stop the squeaking some days it doesn t squeak and others it does 
5 0 GREAT We just received ours yesterday Came packaged well and took less than an hour to carefully put it together Strong construction and very sturdy I wasn t expecting gym quality but honestly this is model is just as good as those 3K Ellipticals We are very pleased with this purchase and you will be too 
5 0 Love it This is a wonderful sled for children THe covering keeps them away from the wind and flying snow They sent this to me very promptly and my daughter loves riding in it 
5 0 Great sled for baby I gave this to my one yr old granddaughter for Christmas She loves it she even loves being pulled around on the carpet in it After finally receiving a little bit of snow she was able to try it out outside My son reports it was a huge hit Great sled for the younger set The wind and rain cover is a great idea I m only sorry she will outgrow it so quickly 
5 0 These work great I hit a lot of Almost Golf Balls which are hard foam rubber practice balls in my back yard I had gone through hundreds of wooden tees which made my back yard look like a driving range These tees solved that problem Now I have 2 or 3 tees out there and they last forever A great solution for my particular situation 
5 0 he s nuts disregard totally what the other reviewer says 1st of all a swing speed of 105 110 is not slow I am a 2 hndcp and mine is in that range Heck TW s is 120 130 and his is the fastest These are excellent tees they do not break they are easy to get in th ground and yes you guide them in as I do wooden tees They do seem to help with a notorious big draw I have BUY THEM 
5 0 The best thermos ever This thermos keeps things hot for a very long time I haven t tried cold yet No more worries of the glass breaking inside either Very well built and worth every penny 
4 0 Good quality Do what it claims But pricy This bottle is a little pricy But it does what it claims It preserves hot water temperature very well I didn t try the cold temperature The construction is very solid for high impact resistent good for portability I have no doubt that it will last for many many years In all I am happy with the quality of this bottle But I will take 1 star out due to its premium price 
5 0 Great bottle Must have for cooks and coffee fiends Over the weekend I bought a Stanley thermal bottle I ve been wanting a thermal carafe for a while now and this one has the capacity for a liter of coffee tea soup etc I was really jazzed about this specific bottle because it is aesthetically rich in testosterone The design seems to be straight out of the first half of the 20th century So you know geeky old me I had to perform a thermal performance test I first pre heated the bottle for several minutes using hot tap water I filled the carafe to the brim with boiling water and checked the temp using my probe thermometer 205 degrees This morning exactly 8 hours after my initial measurement I cracked the bottle for a second reading an astonishing 177 degrees I woulda thought 150 ish The probe thermometer showed that the temperature of the room was 73 degrees and I had the AC s thermostat constant the entire time If you run the numbers through Newton s Law of Cooling you find a K value of 0 029801 per hour given my environment and observations By empirical calculation that means that the bottle s contents would cool down to 150 degrees in about 18 hours at room temp the temperature I would still consider a beverage or soup pretty hot 24 hours after filling with near boiling water the contents would likely be near 137 5 degrees still pretty hot and still somewhat capable of fighting off some foodborne illnesses It would take 53 hours for the bottle s contents to cool to 100 degrees Your mileage may vary but this thing appears to be a winner 
5 0 Awesome Replica This sword is an awesome replica in terms of actual size to that of Sephiroth s Only thing that I think takes away from the sword is that the handle is a plastic wrapped in black cloth When sword is held outstretched it does become very heavy and a lot of pressure is put on handle Despite the handle and cloth the sword overall is massive and amazing to behold Great collectible for any FF goru 
4 0 The Masamune Replica I ve been a Sephiroth fan ever since i played the game This blade is exactly as it looks on Advent Children The only glitch i found is that the handle bindings were not tightly wrapped around the hilt causing it to slide and overlap in areas An easy fix if you know how to bind a sword there is no equal to the sheer size of this blade an absolute must for any fan 
4 0 My One Problem I only have one problem with this weapon the blade is far too short According to the game the BLADE not the entire sword is 68 long This one is more like 50 a foot and a half shorter than it should be 
4 0 Masamune a great value It doesn t weigh ten pounds like some have been claiming It weighs 4 at most I d say Quite difficult to hold one handed though and really difficult to resheathe it without propping the sheath up or something It really doesn t have much of an edge at all another contradiction to what I ve been reading from other reviews The particular sword I received is in amazingly good condition The blade is nearly pristine It s straight as an arrow The sheath fits snugly but is misaligned a bit and takes some work to get the tang into it There s no rattle when you swing it about it feels nicely solid This sword is an astounding value all in all 68 just doesn t really register until you re standing next to it The materials are nice the workmanship excellent and the packing job zealous to say the least 
5 0 Absolutely gorgeous Yeah more praise for the Masamune kids If you have to choose between paying the electric bill or buying this sword you can go a couple weeks in the dark and shower at your buddy s crib It s just that cool This version is cheaper in price and more realistic than the one made by weaponmasters com plus it looks much nicer On the white grease problem I also own several carbon steel katanas To get this grease off interestingly enough spray the whole blade with WD 40 let it sit for a minute or two wipe clean with Shop Towels or terrycloth Voila the grease is gone Now to protect it for years to come continue buffing the heck out of the blade until all the WD 40 is gone Purchase a can of Rustoleum Crystal Clear Enamel for 5 at your local Wal Mart Hardware department shake vigorously and LIGHTLY coat one side of the blade Wait a few hours then do the other side Finish up with the spine You should have also gotten a little bit in the crevice between the blade and the tsuba OK I can hear you now Hey I got build up in some spots Not to worry Check out the Automotive section at Wal Mart or hit up Autozone for some Rubbing Compound also about 5 Follow directions do not drink Hey now you can do ALL your swords For less than 15 you can protect nearly 100 of your most prized collections And yes to test the Rustoleum claim that it creates a waterproof seal I sprayed down a carbon steel blade allowed it to dry and dropped it in a bucket of water After a week no rust Wow a week in water is like a year of sitting exposed in your room This stuff is the cheapest and most effective way to go And if you ever decide you don t want the enamel you can get some paint thinner or acetone from a hardware store to take it off 
5 0 Near perfect replica This sword is awesome it s a near perfect replica of the masamune used by Sephiroth in FF VII Advent CHildren I say near perfect because masamune is about 8 or 9 feet long it makes sense that the replica is only 68 inches long because no human can wield a 8 or 9 foot weapon at least none that i no other than that i have no complaints If u love swords or r a big FF fan or r both u should definetely get this 5 stars hands down 
4 0 if your a fan its worth it If your like me you probably have been waiting for someone to make this for about 10 years so when I found it on here I really had no choice but to buy it first of all I need to remind you that this sword is 68 long If your not sure how big that is get a measuring tape out and see you might find out that it is bigger than you Also be sure you have a spot to hang it Shipping was pretty quick It was delivered by ups and it came a day early The shipping was also about 22 When I opened it I was surprised to find that there was some detail put into the handle like some people that looke like samurai and some weird looking animals I was also surprised that blade actually had a sharp edge to it I was expecting it to be just a big chunk of carbon steel It is pretty cool to look at yourself in the mirror holding something that you idealized since you were a kid and to swing it and hear that nice wind sound although you won t be able to swing it to many times because it weighs about 10 pounds Now a few things I didn t like about it which is probably what you want to hear First they put this vasoline type gel on it to keep it from rusting which I understand when you buy a carbon steel sword but I just can t get the stuff off Everytime I put it back into its holder more gets on also there looks like something the resembles waterspots on it I guess I got to polish it second thing I didn t like is the made in china carved into the blade third theres a little glue running down where the hand guard is All and all this is a great sword Especially if your a final fantasy nut like me and also a sword nut too and to have something so rare in collection for 99 why not get it I m also going to add even thou I shouldn t have to this sword is not to be used I know your probably saying the right now to me But when your holding it in your hand your probably going to get to urge to hit something I m just going to tell you that physics is going to be against you because of how long and thin the blade is Although I do think it will be pretty cool to watch a sword fight with that so if you decided to record it and post it Thanks for reading 
5 0 exactly what she wanted i bought this for my daughter for christmas she is a cross country runner and wanted a heart monitor sports watch with no chest strap she says it works perfectly and is very happy with it 
4 0 Works as I expected I am a cardiac patient and was not able to wear a strap for some time This watch is good for those who can not wear a strap I used this watch when I was only allowed to walk and not do any strenuous exercise And the watch worked very well for me Now that I am fully recovered I use a heart monitor with a strap because of my increased activity I now use this watch when I go to work and I check my heart rate while I am using the stairs instead of the elevator or if I am doing a brisk walk during my lunch break It is very simple to use 
4 0 This works the way it is supposed to I disagree with the previous reviewer If you want a truly accurate reading while doing exercise you need to have a model with a strap A strapless model requires you to stop the activity and read the results The Reebok Silver is a great value and does what it is supposed to The instructions are quite clear and if you follow them you will get an accurate reading I am very satisfied 
5 0 Great flags Just like the ones used in college intra murals excellent stitching and look to be very durable Fast shipping and great deal 
5 0 Great Item for Backyard Practice My 6 and 10 year old boys use this backstop regularly They put the batting T in front and hit hard balls into the net then use it behind them as a ball catch for hitting pitches sponge balls It has a red square strike zone that helps the pitcher find the strike zone and when facing the net provides a target for the hitter It pops open with great force so be carefull when you set it up the first time My 10 yr old folds it and puts it away for us This is a quality product and an essential piece of training equipment for any age We like the Jugs machine balls for use in the backyard They are dense yellow sponge with the correct size weight and seam Unlike regular training balls we have not broken a window with them yet 
4 0 Terrific backstop This hitting screen works very well for such a portable screen and the SportsRUs price is a good value The construction is high quality The refolding process takes some getting used to but works fine once you ve done it a few times The best part of this screen is that there is nothing to set up once it s opened You just pull on 2 straps quickly and it s ready to use It comes with some stakes but I ve never used them I suppose they might be helpful in strong winds The case and handles work well for over the shoulder carrying Overall a very good value 
5 0 Great ball for kids For kids just getting started with the game this ball is great and is the right size for beginning leagues Nice indoor outdoor construction My daughter is learning how to control her dribbles and is working on the shots and this ball does great 
5 0 Nice basketball I bought this basketball for my sons who are 9 and 6 for Christmas last year The ball is 27 as opposed to the bigger ones that are 29 This makes for great play for smaller kids The ball is colorful and has a rubber feel to it all around for a non slip grip Great product and inexpensive 
5 0 spalding No5 Ball is excellent my son adore it Its just right size and quality that Ihe nee 
5 0 Best way to get an arm workout with cardio I started using the BodyRev because I wanted stronger less flabby arms I was able to work out my legs and abs ok without any sort of gadget but I had to join a gym to get in an arm workout worth anything I had been doing 30 pushups 3X a week and that was ok but too much strain and one dimensional I wanted something intermediate between nothing and full or knee pushups and gym pullups I am contemplating buying the Perfect Pushup The BodyRev delivers and exceeded my expectations After about 2 weeks of essentials and or bootcamp 3X week my arms looked noticably better And after 2 months they are really really solid but trimmer and more toned I m a grrl that s good Seriously I did weight assisted pullups for a year at the gym and my arms didn t look this good And the BodyRev fits under the couch although it s usually on it so I can rev while watching TV The Bootcamp workout is a good cardio workout that targets the arms and core The production quality is a little rough and sometimes 2 more turns in to 4 more but overall the workout is a good one and you get to pretend you re kicking in doors while Navy SEAL Alden Mills smiles and tells you to reward yourself with more pushups The moves are designed to use functional training so it s easy to imagine when the use of the muscles being worked out would come into play in real life even if you re not a boxer or Navy SEAL I can t yet do bootcamp with all 3 weights but I do most of the Essentials 15 min workouts better for beginners than Bootcamp with all the weights Also the BodyRev customer service is excellent Highly recommend the BodyRev 
4 0 For serious swimmers only Bought this item to add some variety to my swim workout I d only recommend this kickboard to serious swimmers only The board isn t very boyant The shape design only really allow one type of grip hold the board at its pointy top the forearms lay on top of the board which forces you to stay flat with your face in the water Bottom line Not a kid toy but a good piece to add to your swim bag 
5 0 FUN Personal Accessory and Water Bottle This is an upscale designer water bottle top of the line and so much fun The designs Of Sigg s water bottles are gorgeous from the plain solid color bottles to the ones with intricate designs They are simply beautiful I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns thinking it would take more work to maintain These do necessitate regular cleaning I clean mine every day but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun Sort of like my rings glasses and watch I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory reminding me to drink more water making a statement about my values and expressing myself with a special design Yes all in a water bottle Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality made of light aluminum on the outside slightly insulated and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles They are light durable and perfect for any activity Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles just like from the tap Sigg bottles come with several different types of tops I bought the screw top because I don t like sports tops and I don t mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink It is totally leakproof which is important to me The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner I get comments on it all the time What s that I love it The sports top version is ok I just am not a fan as I don t feel like I can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top However for convenience you might prefer it For children there is a cap type top All are leak proof If you are ever unsatisfied with the top you can buy a screw top separately to fit your Sigg bottle Sigg makes their personal water bottle in 6L and 1L in this style I have both I use the 6L for sports activities because they are smaller When I won t have to carry the container I like the larger bottle Sigg also makes a smaller 3L bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people You can buy Siggs in alternative sizes too such as 75L 4L for kids 6L 5L You can occasionally find this bottle in the 1 5L size also Search Amazon for the perfect size Pick a style and pattern you like as this bottle is a personal accessory and should reflect your style The colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on Amazon They are expensive but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health so they are well worth it value wise for me Highly recommended 
4 0 Overrall I am happy Have a 10 month old and are planning to have another baby soon I needed something that would allow for 2 kiddos and for me to continue walking running during pregnancy and after I recently received the schwinn double jogger and I am so pleased It was easy to install I did it and I can t wait to get on the road It is a little overwhelming when you see it done and put together because it is so big and slightly heavy but the comfort of my kid is far more important I rate it 4 for comfort factor looks and easy to manuever It didnt get a 5 because the shade latch was broken I called and they will be shipping out a replacement immediately and it is truly bulky I think I might need a new car because I dont think it will fit in the back of my volvo wagon 
4 0 Very Smooth This stroller was well worth the money it is very smooth and unlike other strollers with the front wheel this one was very well put together My wife and I jog with it and our two kids 3yr and 5yr are very comfortable in it The materials used are high grade and with some care will last a long time I m sure One of the selling points was it being made by Schwinn we have Schwinn bikes in the family and this was just another good investment Bottom line is we are very pleased with this item 
5 0 Great Buy I purchased this double stroller for my twin girls Very easy to handle The swivel front wheel is a big plus and it can lock if needed 
5 0 Great value I love this stroller It is a good value one of the least expensive double swivel joggers I have seen With free shipping through Amazon you can t beat it It has all the features you would need My husband is 6 6 and the height is great for him My daughters are 5 and 18 months and we got this to take to Disneyworld My 5 year old thinks it s comfy when she is too tired to walk 
4 0 great gazelle I just got my gazelle set up and used it for the first time Set up was a little iffy definitely read all through the instructions before you begin Use is very simple Mine came with the DVD and since I don t have a player am not able to use that However the instructions in the owner s manual for the different moves are easy to understand I inherited faulty knees so was anxious to see how low impact this would really be It s great 
4 0 So far I like it alot I looked into buying a Gazelle because I heard it was little low impact on the knees and I have a knee problem that has limited my excersise routine recently When I received my Gazelle it was fairly easy to put together It took about an hour The directions were easy to follow and the only extra tool required that was not included was a screwdriver I was anxious to try it out So I streached out a bit and got right on Since then I have used my Gazelle at least 5 days week and I enjoy doing it It is a good work out and I can watch TV while doing it It will be perfect now that summer is comming and here in Arizona it is hard to go outside for a walk or a run in the heat I rated this item 4 stars instead of five for two reasons One because your feet actually get sore the bottoms of them from the bumps on the non stick pad unless you wear tennis shoes And the other reason is because it is a little noisy Other than that I like it alot 
5 0 Excellent way to get a good workout I love this machine It is so nice to get a good total body workout with just one machine If you don t have a lot of time to devote to different workouts or if you just want to get your workout over with then this machine is great I have been doing aerobics for about a year now and have had to scale back some due to an injury but this machine allows me to have a good aerobic workout without any impact on my injured ankles and feet Before I had this I was using an exercise bike but I was unsatisfied because I wasn t getting a total body workout Now I can get the benefits of a great workout and not aggravate my injuries I had no problems putting it together It took me about 30 minutes to get it together It does fold up but it is not easily movable on carpet Overall I am very satisfied with this product It was affordable and easy to assemble and gives a great complete workout 
4 0 pretty satified When I bought this product it was because I wanted a way to work out at home but i did not have enough money to buy an expensive tredmill or eliptical and thought this was a cheaper alternative I was worried because I read a lot of online reviews that stated it was very hard to put together but I did not find that was the case I just dont think people realize it takes between 30 and 45 miniutes to assemble but the directions were easy to understand and I got it together with out any major problems I have also read reveiws that states that the machine is very squeeky which it is at times for me but if you just spray some DW 40 on it a little that seems to solve the problem I orginally wanted to use the machine while watching TV but I usually dont feel like I am getting much of a workout My machine came with DVD s I bought mine from HSN and when I follow along with those I feel like I get a much better workout Its good to watch them to at least see all of the diffrent execrcises you can do with this product The machine does fold up but it is not something that should be considered very portable I thought I would be able to keep it in a closet and take it out every day but it is just to hard I am happy I bought this product it is easy to do and it very low impact I would recommed it to others 
4 0 I LOVE THIS MACHINE If you are a parent and can t get to the gym I would suggest you get the Gazelle I got mine for only 25 and what a bargin I really love this machine I usually watch TV or listen to music while working out When I am on the Gazelle time goes by sooo fast Before you know it it s time for me to head to work HOWEVER like many reviewers my Gazelle did make noise that s why I gave it four stars I brought WD40 and the squeaking did stop Hope this was helpful 
4 0 Great gift idea I was shocked when I found this skateboard for 3 00 as I had seen the same exact skateboard at K Mart for 10 00 Upon receipt of the item I was happy with the packaging and look of the skateboard It was a great gift idea for my kids ages 7 and 9 The only thing about the skateboard that I didnt like was that the wheels are not as fluid in movement as I had hoped They stick a little from time to time Other than that the product is great 
5 0 great Great skateboard for the money Got this for my angel for Christmas and he seems to love it Appeared sturdy and good quality like any other skateboard 
4 0 Cute Spongebob Skateboard A pretty sturdy skateboard for the money A great holiday gift for fans of Spongebob Patrick and the rest of the gang from Bikini Bottom 
4 0 average straps I would say average at best But low cost so what would you expect Worth what I paid 
5 0 Good comfortable lifting straps From novice to intermediate this is an excellent set of lifting straps You don t need something like this from the beginning But the weight you re handling starts to exceed your grip strength this is invaluable Use is simple You just wrap the strap around the bar There is no real technique to it As you lift the weight the weight itself will pull the strap tight and transfer some of the load to the straps around your wrists I don t recommend wrapping the straps too tight as that will transfer almost all weight to your wrists and your forearms won t get the usual amount of workout The point is to complete the lift without your grip failing not avoiding using your grip altogether If you do it right your grip will be supporting most of the weight in the beginning and as you complete more reps and your grips start to fail more and more weight can be transfered to the straps This is a simple no frills strap It works and it s priced very reasonably Padding is a little light but it s adequate unless you are handling some Herculean weight 
4 0 Bed Like Comfort Just like the description says For the money this is not a bad bed It is pretty bed like pretty soft It does lose a bit of air overnight though 
4 0 Airbed review Bought this airbed and it was just as advertised Looked at several vendors large range of prices for the same product It is heavier than the previous model I had but it is also twice as tall we like that Had a power outage and ended up buying a spare battery pump so it works under all circumstances Comparably speaking I think it is a good buy 
4 0 i m no professional snork other than not really knowing how to size snorkel gear for 2 people and i wasn t really interested in paying dive shop prices i was also leaving for the Mayan peninsula in 7 days i went shopping on line i didn t want to rent gear or use the gear at the resort the only issue is that i didn t couldn t properly size the gear the mask did not fit my face or my girlfriends face well and we have different shaped faces heads before we go again we will spend money at the dive shop for new masks the delivery came well before we left for mexico not having to deal with all the plastic packaging and marketing garbage that would normally come with this class of gear was wonderful i think that the masks may work well for kids 
5 0 flipping in bliss love the fins mask pressed on face need anti fog agent bag was Super for collecting conch 
5 0 SMITH WESSON GALAXY 6 LED FLASHLIGHT A GREAT LITTLE FLASHLIGHT WITH 3 ULTRAVIOLET LED S AND THREE WHITE LED S WHICH IS PERFECT FOR ALL SPORTSMEN ESPECIALLY HUNTERS WHO CAN USE THE ULTRAVIOLET FEATURE FOR BLOOD TRACKING GREAT CONSTRUCTION WHICH ALSO FEATURES TWO SEPARATE SWITCHES FOR THE LED S HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
5 0 That s the wonderful It is a great purchase for me My kids likes too much 
4 0 Good Price Point Horrible Assemby I was very excited to get a skee ball like machine for under 200 I was not expecting a top quality arcade verison which would cost 10 times the price I just was looking for another addition to our playroom that would keep the kids at my house My husband is a carpenter and does home installtions everyday and it took him 6 hours to assmeble with power tools I would have never been able to assemble this myself Even after assembly there still remain a few problems The balls get stuck alot To me this isn t too anoying until the all get stuck which does happen The game gives each player 6 balls to roll and as long as some keep coming back out Im okay with that again for the price I wasn t expecting perfection The unit does fold up so it doesn t take up as much room as you would think which is very nice I m waiting to see how long it will last given I have active kids The unit is not all wood they are plastic and cardboard parts that i worry might not hold up in the long run For now I m happy with my purchase because the whole family is having fun I bought this along with a folding indoor baseketball game Both have given my kids hours of fun saved space and I know the kids are safe inside in the and being active instead of spending all day with the tv video games 
4 0 Great Bar with no collars The bar is great but it was twice mailed without the included collars Amazon failed to help so I contacted Impex Fitness their number is on the box if you can read it They immediately sent me some collars something I guess Amazon couldn t handle Love the bar but it must travel the world first because both boxes arrived completely destroyed 
4 0 same troubles as last reviewer I had the same issue as C Denning previously posted box was a mess and nothing to hold the weights on the bar have yet to see how amazon addresses this problem 
5 0 LOVE IT I have a little over a week with my bar its great I got it on the time expected without any trouble I especially love the threaded handles cause they match my dumbells I use it on my scott curl and great for my triceps no need for a tricep bar GOOD BU 
5 0 simply the best goggles I have ever used I rather lost my love of swimming since I cannot see well without wearing contacts and the chlorine irritates me twice as bad while wearing them I have used several different brands of goggles with my contacts over the years and was overjoyed when I ran across these I debated a brand I am familiar with but reading the reviews I had to admit I wasnt really liking them for many of the reasons mentioned with that product so I took a chance You cannot go wrong for the money with these they fit comfortably could substitute for my regular glasses in a pinch and after a small amount of adjusting they are very leak proof with a wide field of vision The strap adjustment is a bit tedious to manipulate but that is a definate good thing once you have them dialed in there is no chance they will slip or move out of adjustment as it uses a very clever locking mechanism to lock the straps in place rather than the double strap through a buckle design that seems all to prevelant My eyes are in between the available powers offered so I went with the closest step down from my prescription figuring the additional distortion of the water would even things out but I see quite clearly with them both in and out of the water If you need some vision correction and don t like fiddeling with contacts in the pool as I do not you simply must own these goggles 
5 0 Fantastic I have always wanted a home gym but the bulk and weight of one combined with the size and age of my house were not a good match I had seen infomercials for the Total Gym and checked out their website and was SHOCKED to see the over 1 000 00 price This gym is fantastic I really do not see how the higher priced models could be any better The movement is smooth the unit is 100 sturdy and the user can do all exercises which can be done on machines at commercial gyms I LOVE my Total Gym and am thrilled with my purchase and the modest price Money VERY well spent 
5 0 This Machine Saved the Day I m Not Going to Get Fat This machine is great I ve blown thousands of dollars on gym memberships over 20 years believing home equipment was unaffordable This relatively inexpensive piece of equipment is fun to use The gliding motion makes you feel relaxed it is non stressful like no other machine I ve ever used before The daily workouts give me freedom to eat what I couldn t otherwise eat now that I can workout at home It has so many variations of exercises It just gets the job done I no longer have to fear getting fat I was averaging a pound a year the last 3 years working out with basic aerobics equipment Jack s Cardio Cruiser and had to do something This machine also gives you the kind of workout that makes you feel good not exhausted afterwards because it s low impact training and works the muscles well It s a very comfortable relaxing work out I m feeling the affects as I write this and it s a wonderful warm burning sensation in my muscles This equipment comes assembled and learning how to use it is a snap I have no complaints whatsoever 
5 0 An absolutely great value The Total Gym 1500 is one of the best values for the money Do NOT buy this machine if you want to become big and bulky The machine is all about building long lean muscle Think reps not amount of weight Bruce Lee not Schwarzenegger You will see wonderful improvements in the tone of your physique your balance your endurance and most importantly your flexibilily One last note the fitness board that you lie on is rather small If you are a larger person you may need to consider a machine that is a step or two up 
4 0 This is great but spend more for the next model up The total gym has several different models with bascially the same features With this model you can do everything that you can do with the more expensive model but in hindsight I wish I bought the better model The biggest difference is in the foot plate hand extension It takes only a few moments to add the piece of hardware on to do the next exercise but depending on mood it was sometimes enough to dissuade me You don t NEED to do the other exercises but I probably would do them more often if I didn t have to stop my routine to do it If this is all you can afford then this is a GREAT machine and you ll be very happy with it If you can afford a wee bit more you ll be happier with one of the next models up 
5 0 Fun and Easy way to a magnificient body I was 30 lbs overweight when I bought Total Gym The machine comes fully assembled You just have to adjust it according your requirements After a few minutes of setup I immediately tried a quick and easy workout bicep curls Within minutes I realized that Total Gym is the real deal It can make you thinner and stronger in just 20 minutes a day 3 times a week I know that there are tons of products out there making the same claim but if you want to invest in your health this is one of the best ones Here are all the pros and cons POSITIVES 1 Comes Fully assembled You have to make bare minimum adjustments according to your goals and fitness level 2 As the ad says replaces an entire gym You can do virtually any excercise on Total Gym 3 It is fun and easy Once you start your workout it is hard to stop 4 Comes with a video that guides you through some basic excercises and also shows you the ones used by LA firefighters 5 Compact and very easy to store away NEGATIVE 1 You gotta stick with the plan Don t give up and you will be a very happy thinner and stronger person within 10 weeks Remember you have to excercise and eat healthy to get back and then stay in shape Total Gym will help you do it For those who are wondering yes I lost all excess weight and gained new muscle Most people I meet think I am much younger than I really am 
5 0 Great workout for the Price My Total Gym 1500 arrived almost completely assembled and ready to use With about five minutes of adjusting and learning how it worked I was ready for a workout I ve owned it now for two weeks and look forward my workouts They are fun and relatively easy I do have to be careful not to overdo it however because my muscles feel it later I have tried other home exercise equipment but this is the first one that actually lives up to its advertising 
5 0 Works great and is safe This is a great addon to the door gym enables you to do even more upperbody workouts It rests ontop of the Neutral pull up bars on the door gym I think it s perfectly safe no idea how d it d slip off seeing as it grips very well to the neutral bar Suggest this to anyone that has a door gym obviously and would like more upper body workouts 
5 0 Door Gym I purchased the door gym based on the reviews It is a FABULOUS device and works as advertised Stable with multiple workout options from neutral grip chin up and pull up positions after two weeks of use I can see the difference and feel it The broad reach bar just came and after testing it I agree that it shouldn t be used by kids UNLESS they ve been shown how to use it the broad reach bar could slip off if a child has to jump up to reach it UPDATE This thing is genius Before I would STRAIN to do TWO PULL UPS Now I can do 15 I don t lift weights anymore I use big flexible bands the door gym and pushups I ve never felt stronger 
5 0 GREAT This thing is great I love it I don y know what that guyis talking about not letting kids use it My 10 year old son uses it every day Great for upper body greatness Very good Just tighten brackets then it works great 
5 0 The 1st piece of fitness equipment someone should buy I m 6 1 and really should have bought the 55cm product The guidelines for buying these balls seems to me to be a little on the large side Other than that this is very well built and seems superior to the other exercise balls on the market There ar so many uses for an exercise ball this really should be the first piece of equipment you buy 
4 0 Good gun but u can get better Ok first off dont listen to the idiot that said order from airsplat They sent me a broken gun and wouldnt return it and this happened to many others aswell Second off dont buy the enhanced version b c its most likely broken VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY HIGH LEMON RATE About 50 are lemons Get another gun for this price 
4 0 impressed for made in china i bought this gun about a month ago but didn t keep it long i chronoed it at about 240 to 260 fps using a 25 gram ksc bb it would be pretty safe to say that it would go 300 fps using a 2 gram it is made very cheaply but it was surprisingly accurate and had an excellent rate of fire the only reason i sold it was because i paid 80 for it and sold it to some kid for 200 
5 0 Awsome Gun I got this gun for my B Day and I got to tell you this gun is awsome It does not shoot 330 however with 20 gram bb but with 12 gram The gun however is still very strong It shoots through cans from close and kills bb on ground Gun is very accuarte even with 12 It does hurt when you get hit on your skin So wear a sweater The gears are also metal So you know it will last Don t buy a gun with no metal gears Only bad thing about gun is battery It does not come with any guildlines on how long to charge or a smart charger So you have to wait like 10 hours but not really know if it is done It does come with a Ni HD so you don t have to discharge fully and charge again You could just charge when you want to Also that battery drains by it self in three months Gun is plastic but feels stron 
5 0 For one and for two Well for one Do you even own this rifle And two you re ruining the moment pal I mean c mon Airsoft Forums please It s a waste of time Why not try actually going to one of these tournaments I don t wanna sound like a jackass but it s true I own over a dozen high quality rifles and SMG s that price way over two hundred bucks and this one is the only one I was willing to spend the least on Let s just say I was bored to I buy rifles and whatever else relating to airsoft To put it short for whoever s reading this THIS RIFLE ROCKS GET IT GET IT WHILE THERE S STILL TIME 
5 0 Biking Glove I bought this for a present The Adventure glove well made and a good value 
4 0 Nice Solid Glove This glove is not only a good looking glove but durable My only complaint is that the closure around the wrist is an inch and a half longer than cycling gloves typically are The extra length covering the wrist is fairly comfortable but very hot soaking the gloves in sweat in all but the coldest rides I wear full finger gloves year round for the added protection and sweaty hand have not been an issue in the past Buy this stylish glove wear it in the winter and keep it in the closet when it is warm 
4 0 open country 20 cup perc Perfect for camping Until I bought this percolator having to leave the campsite to go in search of a cup of coffee was the biggest drawback to camping As easy as boiling water Love it 
5 0 Stanley Thermos Works Great Replaced a Thermos brand vacuum bottle with this Stanley Has not leaked and keeps everything hot Best past about it is that it has a life time warranty I use it daily and it works for me 
5 0 KEEPS MY COFFEE HOT I had a steel thermos brand that was terrible This Stanley bottle keeps my coffee nice and hot for hours I also wash it by hand not the dishwasher 
5 0 Exceptional Vacuum Bottle This Stanley product is remarkable strong stylish handy and very useful The handle is great We put ice and water in it this summer and the next day there was still ice in it Highly recommend 
5 0 Radical Mag Crosman S32P Stinger If you own a Shottie this is the best mag you can buy It holds about 170 rounds compared to the stock mag which only holds maybe 17 Fits Crosman S32P and many other shotties Slam On 
5 0 Awesome Product This is by far one of my best investments Paired with the 180 round mag that came with my gun it allows me awesome play time with no reloading 
5 0 MUST have Tired of reloading your air soft gun over and over This product enables the shooter to shoot to his hearts content Well worth it 
5 0 Almost better than a mat I love these things They re very comfortable and so much more convenient and easier to store than a mat Best if you practice on carpet at home Super for travel I wish I d known about these when I started with yoga I d have gotten them before I got a mat Cons 1 Not great for full body on floor asanas 2 Foot paws slip a little but I ve seen something similar with back elastics to hold them in place and I don t like the look of them 
4 0 Yoga Paws Review I enjoy using the product It s great for travel It s a light weight alternative to traveling with a yoga mat As a yoga instructor I can also move off my mat and around the classroom to demonstate postures in large classes without slipping on the floor I really like Yoga Paws 
4 0 Nice I bought this because I have wood floors and cats so I don t like my 4 month old directly on the floor and he eats his blanket posing choking hazard This foam mat is great I can use a wash cloth to wipe cat hair away and baby doesn t smack his head on wood flooring Music makes my baby laugh he loves this play mat I looked every where for this mat to get it for less and never found one even at the manufacturers web site This is great mat for the money Though larger would be better 
4 0 Great Knife Love the knife it s just a little too large to carry in my pocket on a regular basis I returned it and bought the Chive it s perfect 
5 0 Sexy yet stabby Like the Chive this knife is a nice small package that s deceptively stabby Sure it looks innocent but how much of that blade do you want in your eye Hypothetically speaking of course I would never indicate that you should stab people with this knife Never ever The high points are the sleek design flawless assisted opening and light weight I have problems with thumb studs on assisted opening knives so I am very pleased that this has an index opening For the safety conscious there is a safety lock to keep the blade from opening in your pants Not that it will but just in case I guess The Leek is a perfect knife for people with small hands that i s assisted opening is a definite bonus Too many assisted opening knives are too bulky for my hand or too powerful when it snaps open Kershaw Tactical Blur for example The Leek firmly snaps into place without recoil and is light and small enough for people with small hands to easily use But don t be fooled by its innocent appearance This knife can be a deadly little package and should not be underestimated 
5 0 Sleek quality This is a beautiful slim sharp functional fast knife The knife is slim and with the clip can be carried easily in your pocket The safety on the end of the knife is a little stiff but can be adjusted so that it is easier to slip on or off The pocket clip is reversible allowing you to carry the knife point up This is a great feature because when the knife is carried in your pocket point up you do not have to swing the knife around in your hand to get it in position for opening The knife can be deployed much quicker when carried in this fashion The speed safe index opening flipper works very well opening the knife quickly with just a little pressure on the mechanism No grand flourishes thumb strength or wrist flicking is needed to open this knife The finish is good the quality is great everything about this knife is amazing A great knife to own 
5 0 VERY NICE I bought this for my boyfriend as an exact replacement knife He had lost the original doing god knows what He loves it it s not too big but not too small securely clips on your pocket and is so sharp its down right scary but I guess that s why it s a men s knife Opens quickly and the serrated part is a nice addition 
4 0 Nice little knife Maintains a decent edge the opening lock closing mechanism is simple and smooth The color is as intense as seen in the pic and pretty resistant to wear In general happy with the knife 
5 0 I love this knife I m not a huge outdoorsman but wanted a nice everyday pocket knife The Kershaw s Leek fits the bill I love the size long enough to get your whole hand envolved with the task yet small enough to have clipped to your pocket and forget its there I was planning on taking the clip off and just letting the knife float in my pocket but fell in love with the clip The only thing better than light weight in your pocket is no weight in your pocket I find that the knife is well designed and I really like the Speed Safe opening action It has a solid click that lets you know that the knife is in a locked position Super sharp and the perfect drop point blade 
4 0 Great Quality Great Carry Knife I purchased this knife at a gun knife show three years ago and have carried it everyday since I ve owned 60 00 Spyderco and 150 00 Benchmade Automatic knives but this Stainless Leek model is slimmer quicker to draw and has a better clip than both of these knives Because of the unique spring action mechanism many think it s an automatic knife My only recommendation is to occasionally lubricate clean the mechanism to keep the action quick I did have to tighen the allen screw to keep the safety from slipping on in my pocket I will be ordering a second one at this price This is a very well designed well made pocket knife 
4 0 OPENS BETTER THAN IT CLOSES The Leek is a wonderful knife but its sword like point is subject to breakage Throwing the knife into a wooden target will invariably break the tip which is what happened to two of my Leeks Fortunately Kershaw lives up to its lifetime guarantee policy and quickly replaced both of my broken knives with brand new ones no questions asked I just shipped them the knife explaining what happened and a week later got back a new knife The knife itself opens beautifully though I ve found that the liner lock sometimes sticks and isn t that easy to depress with one hand 
5 0 Love it This is the third one I ve owned the first two both met unfortunate deaths in the bathroom ahem and I love it The clip is sturdy and my older one was still very accurate after three years of use The battery lasted a few years on my first one I wrecked the second one before having to change it 
5 0 The best Very pleased with this pedometer It s easy to set up and use Also the leash is an added plus 
5 0 Great for the boys I purchased 2 of these items for my son for his birthday along with the rocky inflatable boxing bag too This was an excellent investment He immediately took to wanting to box with his sister and then the neighbor boy too All 3 of the children took their time rotating the 2 sets of gloves around so they would all get time to play and no one got hurt from them The children had an incredibly fun time with this The only thing is if you use an electronic pump then the bag and the gloves have a tendency to deflate a bit but once i refilled them all with out the pump by blowing them up myself they stayed inflated for weeks until i decided to deflate them myself to put them a way for a bit Overall I d say this is an awesome gift for any one who has children that doesn t shy away from play boxing 
5 0 Best Investment This was a present on our girls 3rd birthday She rode off an on from 2 until 9 She loved it so much we couldn t wait for the battery to run out For the rest of the day she would only stop long enough open another gift then back to the car Quick to learn how to drive it Loud a little bit but hey it s a kids toy If they didn t make noise the kids wouldn t like it Great Toy Great Value 
4 0 Bumper Buggie Review When the buggie arrived it didn t work I had to call Razor s Customer Service Dept Their service is awful The Senior Agent was very rude I managed to figure out the problem on my own The electrical unit was not connected Once it was connected it worked fine We have two of them The kids love them They are lightweight and ride well on carpet Overall the product is good 
5 0 Happy Children Great product fun for children nicely designed easy to operate I purchased 3 of the razor bumper buggie Ladybug cars for 3 of my grandchildren age 4 3 and 2 The cars arrived promptly At Christmas I charged the batteries and gave them to the children The cars work great Even the 2 year old can work her car Just like her big brothers Although one battery did not hold the charge correctly a quick call to the company and a new part was sent immediately GrandmaLind 
4 0 WOW best toy for 2007 This is the best toy I ve spent money on in years It s cute my girls love them I bought two They are great to ride in the garage or believe it or not they go well on carpet They have laughed bumped even learned how to use the driving handles with their feet Great fun 
5 0 Great Product This was purchsed in December 06 to be given to my boyfriend by our 17 month old daughter he loved it He put it on his truck right away Great product 
5 0 Great Product I had a plastic one before and it broke love this one 
5 0 Durable easy to set up This is a much much better set than you ll get from your typical sports dept store Though it s pricier it is sturdy and easy to set up The poles are rigid and the guide ropes are good and strong a decent all around design You may want to upgrade the racquets but they are fine for out of the box action 
5 0 Packaging for shipping Great product Amazon s packing for shipping reeks of OVERKILL The box was twice as long and deep enough to pack four mats Be more economical with packaging 
5 0 King Of All Bike Racks I just received this rack and it s great I assembled it in about an hour and installed it on a 2005 Honda Odyssey It holds 2 Fuji Monterey bikes securely and is very easy to use Without the bikes I can open the rear door on the Odyssey Cycle On Pro comes with 2 locks One locks the rack to the car The other locks the bikes to the rack I would highly recommend this product I have also ordered the 3rd bike add on and will review it when it arrives 
5 0 Great bike My husband I were looking for a basic bike and that s what this is We put it together in about an hour We had a slight problem with the computer connection but he was able to get it corrected The seat is a bit hard for me I use an additional pillow to soften it up a bit Overall a good buy for the price 
5 0 great buy bike was easy to assemble works great and cant beat the shipping cost 
4 0 Good product for the price We bought this about a month ago It went together easily enough took about 1 5 to 2 hours the instructions are clear It is VERY quiet I love that The resistance is plenty for us we aren t workoutaholics and don t overuse our equipment If you are a SERIOUS biker and want something to stay in shape I would go for one of the more expensive models If you are like us and work out 3 5 times a week for 30 45 minutes then this will be perfect for you It adjusts plenty for a tall person Someone 6 feet tall should have no problem Only three very minor complaints 1 If you have to adjust the length a lot for different users it s kind of a pain to change however we have it on a rug on a hard floor this may not be as much of an issue 2 If you get off it for more than five minutes the timer resets back to zero 3 The seat is cushioned but still a little hard I had to put an extra cushion on it Otherwise we DO love it It is an excellent value 
5 0 Light motivating fantastic I discovered recumbent bikes in the gym you know highly expensive technical things that cost over 1k This bike is almost free by comparison it s plenty sturdy COMFORTABLE which is very important for me because I have fibromyalgia There are days this is the only exercise I can do I put it together by myself and though I suggest that if you have a neuromuscular disease you should probably have help I managed to do it alone I was riding it that night It s compact so if you want to make more room for company you can move it easily there s little wheels in the front but the best bet is to set it in front of the TV so you can work out to the news or MTV or whatever you like If you don t want to constantly stare at the clock you can change the setting on the computer to measure your calorie burn your distance speed anything you like I have recommended this to all my friends think anybody who prefers a recumbent bike would love it 
1 0 Not worth buying Feels extremely fragile and rightly so since it broke the first time I test fired it Fortunately I got it for free with another purchase I wouldn t recommend this gun even for beginners 
4 0 Very cheap price overall very good value This is a very good begineer pistol Not real sturdy but well worth the 3 I paid for it 
4 0 Work out just to put it together but does what an elliptical should The box it arrived in was badly damaged and the elliptical almost fell out of the bottom when we picked up the box to bring it inside I was surprised that pieces weren t missing I started to put it together and it took about 45 minutes The directions were easy to follow except for the nuts and bolts I guessed which ones they were referring to because there is no guide that tells you which one is which Getting the pedal bars on the base of the machine was the most difficult task By the time I had it put together I was sweating After the assembly using it is very simple and it does what an elliptical should do I find that the right handle seems to move a little so I will have to see if I can tighten it a little more The display went dead in just a few days but after putting some new non generic batteries it seems to be working okay It is easy to move around the house and doesn t take up a lot of space When you are on it it doesn t move around like I read in reviews of other ellipticals Overall now that I have it all put together and the display works I am happy with it 
5 0 The Ultimate Paper Cutter This paper cutter puts the rest to shame I have purchased quite a few others in the past and after cutting several sheets of cardstock and cover weight paper the blades dull on the previous cutters This one Not even close I make 300 programs and menu cards for a military ball and the blade is as sharp as the first time I used it 
5 0 Great Exercise Bike I have had this bike for over 3 months and ride it about 5 to 6 days a week for 20 to 25 minutes each day It is a Great Bike It was easy to assemble though I did have my husband doing most of it and takes up very little space I keep it close to the TV so that I can ride it while watching my favorite shows It is very quiet It has more features than what I use I just want to know how long I m riding how fast and how far But I m sure the extra features may appeal to others I highly recommend this bike It was very reasonably priced and was well worth the money 
4 0 Great inexpensive bike This bike is quiet and works great It is a nice inexpensive no frills bike I recommend it to anyone who doesn t need a fancy machine 
4 0 Nice for the price I ve only had this for a couple of days but I m pretty happy with it The set up wasn t too hard except for connecting the tension cable which took quite a bit of fiddling The bike sits pretty high and since I m short it s a bit awkward to get on but the seat is comfortable and the machine is very quiet For the other reviewer with the complaint about cycling through the stats on the display You can easily set the display to show only one stat just read the manual Update I ve had the bike for a couple of months now I use it 4 5 days a week for about 30 mintues a day It s holding up well and I m still very happy with it 
4 0 Good for the price I received this bike as a birthday gift and am please overall with it One irritant I found was that some of the hardware was already installed on the bike so I spent 10 minutes looking for screws nuts and washers that were already on the bike Just be aware that when you purchase this even though there is a separate package of hardware that comes with the bike the majority of the hardware is already installed so don t assume that you got shorted some pieces The tension is a little difficult to set up and I plan on looking more into it I did what the instructions told me to however there doesn t seem to be an easy setting so far on this bike The tension setting range is from 1 8 with 1 being the easiest but I don t notice any differences between the ranges I know the other person that reviewed this bike didn t like that it cycled through the information while riding but I actually prefer that it does I found it nice to be able to just look at the screen and know how many miles I had ridden what my speed was etc without having to interrupt my workout to push any buttons 
4 0 Pleasantly surprised I bought this bike to rehab from knee surgery At this price point I was willing to take a chance and buy it sight unseen It works as advertised and I ve incorporated it into my daily exercise routine The bike is quiet when in use I ve used wind trainers before that sound like cyclones compared to this bike I don t have to crank the TV to hear it while pedaling The tensioner has 8 levels and provides a good spectrum of wheel resistance The electronics controlling the 6 exercise programs timer calories burned distance traveled and pulse all work well The only minor negatives 1 The setup instructions were clear but hooking up the tensioner was unnecessarily difficult Took 20 minutes and a lot of sweat 2 The stabilizer bars front and back are just a tad short so there is a slight side to side movement as you pedal Nothing serious 3 As you exercise the LCD readout cycles through all the stats would be nice to be able to select what data you monitor Overall I m happy with the purchase esp at this price and can recommend it others 
5 0 Better than expected We love the poker table that I purchased It is alot sturdier than I had expected and it looks really nice 
5 0 Love this vehicle information center I purchased this because I get my directions mixed up so easily and am always wanting to know what the temperature is outside This was so easy to install and set up I just love it and would encourage anyone to get this if you have a vehicle that does not already have the temp and directions in your rear view mirror 
5 0 Accurate easy to read Compass I installed the V2000 only for the compass as my vehicle is already equipped with a temperature sensor I appreciate the easy to read dual display of compass rose and degrees The V2000 seems to be very accurate as it displayed the same degrees as my army issue lensatic compass It is easily installed and aligned and was very helpful at night with an overcast sky when no stars were visible I would definitely recommend this product 
4 0 Good unit for direction and temperature This unit works as advertised I mounted it using the suction cups on my windshield in the lower left hand corner and ran the temp sensor cable about a foot over to the edge of the door frame to get outside temperature The suction cups work well if you clean the glass first Pros Easy setup and good results Cons temp gage is too small to read easily 
4 0 It works I was so reluctant to buy this item Having read the user review of it s relative models and it sounds so horrible Anyhow it turns out that this one work like it s supposed to I read the manual and follow the instruction carefully and it functions like a magic Very darn accurate for my standard ordinary people who get lost every now and then Compare to the map it ll be off no more than 5 degree I m happy with the purchase after finding that the 2 compass sold in Target won t work in my car Now we re travelling with more confidence 
5 0 Great Product I bought this product for my boyfriend who absolutely loves it I ve tried it before it has a GREAT flavor just like drinking chocolate milk The shipping was quick too 
5 0 Wilson balls I have found wilson balls to give very good distance off the tee The feel is also good around the greens when chipping and putting 
4 0 Really cool and useful I bought this for some serious ninjaing if you know what i mean Yeah last summer i was fighting some evil goblin dudes I was using my katana then I threw some stars and knives then i used 2 tantos As i was fighting i was wondering how i fit all of these weapons into my little pockets I remembered later that i had little hobbit slaves carrying all of super cool ninja weapons So in the middle of my battle i sent one of my hobbit slaves to fetch me a laptop with wireless internet connection When he came back i found a very nice desk in the middle of the battlefield and went to amazon com I found this super cool NINJA UTILITY BELT 1 OHIO So i ordered it A couple minutes later a little boy on a moped gave me a package not really It was my NINJA UTILITY BELT 1 OHIO So i unrapped it and there it was It was so cool it was black in the picture it may look brown I slipped it on and buckled it up It was a little hard to buckle but i have a jammed finger so it might be easier to other people like buff ninjas It was awsome it held 18 stars 2 throwing knives and 2 sais sadly that is all i have so far but it might hold more I didn t try to fit a tanto in it yet It was a little hard to open the velcro but once you get the hang of it it s a breeze So I fired my hobbit slaves and got back to the battle I had won all thanks to my NINJA UTILITY BELT 1 OHIO So that is my story of the NINJA UTILITY BELT For any new coming ninjas true ninjas such as myself or any halloween costume I suggest you get one or more They are very useful and will serve you well 
5 0 GreatTailBag I love this Fast Bag it fits all my goodies cellphone bike tool wallet while i am riding It is a great value for the price and it looks great Every one wants one I truly recommend it 
5 0 Great cooler for Fishing Kayaks This is the second 25 qt Igloo Marine Cooler I ve purchased this month it fits well behind the seat of the Hobie Mirage Outback Kayak you have to put a large watertight Plano box in the well to serve as a base for the Igloo Add a Fentress set of rod holders and you are outfitted for fish 
5 0 Excellent and Durable Product The Igloo cooler that this is replacing is my original 25 qt legend cooler that is over 18 years old The original legend cooler has held up extremely well to regular use This new cooler is nearly identical to my original Igloo legend cooler The only differences being the original was red and it had a drain this cooler is small enough that you don t need a drain I find this size of cooler very handy for fresh water fishing salt water fishing for weakfish and for keeping sodas cold on long trips 
5 0 So fast The box was kind of damage but I guees it was because the product was so big and huge beside this fact anything else was so perfect Thanks a lot I recomend him 100 
4 0 Good Product This product has everything I was looking for The price was great It came damaged and had to have it fixed 
4 0 Had To Repair Upon Opening Box But Good Product Doorbell rang I was excited My heart pounded I came down the stairs All 5 poodles were barking I opened the door and my box was delivered as promised I slid the heavy box inside my greeting room My son opened the box for me and my heart dropped The tube stand below the seat was completely bent Thanks to my son and his girlfriend they grabbed some heave pipe and tools and spent about a half hour straightening it out enough to match up the bottom rail support FINALLY Then it was assembled in like 40 minutes I love it But receiving anew product all jacked up did disappoint me The bike functions as designed Im breathing better shrinking my mid section and all in all HAPPY 
5 0 Great bike so far It wasn t too difficult to figure out putting it together Although one of the legs was bent and if it wasn t for my dad who straightened it needed strength I wouldn t have known how to straighten it back Also one of the plastic covers was broken just put it on top but can t tell It took me about 35 to 40 minutes to put together I like it There s about 4 people that use it altogether I like the cycles and the heart monitor Easy to program 
4 0 Comfortable and sturdy I m a large lady with a bad back so trying to institute an exercise program has been a challenge for me This bike is comfortable to use yet sturdy enough for me to get a good workout without being concerned that it would collapse under my weight It s adjustable so my husband who is 8 inches taller than I am can use it comfortably too Be aware that assembly is required Overall it s worth every penny 
5 0 quality Quick delivery better straps then the ones at the local gym safe easy installation 
5 0 A place for everything and everything in it s place I really like this storage rack Cost versus function is quite high It now provides a place for our 4 bicycles plus associated gear no more scrambling around locating all the necessary equipment for a ride on either the trail or road It doesn t have room for every piece of sports gear we own of course but seasonal adjustments puts everything we need within reach 
5 0 Delta Cezanne performs well Easy to assemble and solidly built Small point the description said it holds 6 bikes but it only came with hooks for 4 
5 0 nice rack I have a garage full of bikes and I needed some organization badly I saw this rack during a search on Amazon and it looked like just what I needed When it arrived I was immediately impressed by the materials and construction it is very well made and the pieces feel substantial All the fasteners are allen heads which is a quality touch The quality was such that I thought it must be made in the USA But alas after searching the packaging carefully I found the elusive made in China sticker Oh well what isn t made in China Assembly went well and all the parts went together without much struggle Follow the tip in the instructions to leave all fasteners loose until assembly is complete When I got it together and tightened all fasteners snugly I hung 4 bikes on it and it is very stable I have to say I am very satisfied with this product and feel comfortable in recommending it to others 
2 0 Not really good enough This is a reasonable light that certainly does a good job of making you visible to motorists I would agree with the reviewer about brightness it is not really bright enough to use as the only source of illumination For me the most disappointing factor is the no tools fitting strap It grips poorly on glossy surfaces like many handlebars for example I ended up gluing rubber patches to the inside of the strap to improve this Worse the strap tensioner actually broke apart after just over a year of use The pivot pins are just not up to the rest of the build quality Pros Good light for sodium lit city streets Really waterproof Solid case Cons The no tools strap simply sucks You ll need another light if it is genuinely dark where you ride Not really worth the investment I bought a cheaper 5 led light with a proper screwdriver tightened quick release fixing that I am far happier with The CatEye is now an expensive spare flashlight 
5 0 Excellent compass This compass has it all You will not be disappointed It is well constructed and thought out A must have for anyone who leaves the main roads 
5 0 Great compass I have used my MC 2G for about a year and am very impressed I can not think of any improvements that I would make To adjust the magnetic declination the compass is flipped upside down for access to the adjustment screw and for direct reading of the declination scale The fine green index line was a little difficult to see until I started the adjustment and the line moved away from the red declination marks Now that I know what it looks like it is easy to spot Two of the scales read directly in miles one scale for maps using 1 24000 1 inch=24000 map inches and one scale for maps using 1 62500 1 inch=62500 map inches I believe the scales do not go to the corners of the compass because the corners are rounded plus the three scales would then overlap This is my favorite compass 
5 0 Spec Ops issued US Special Ops forces use this compass This is pretty indicative of its reliability I own this compass as well as the Silva Ranger They re both great compasses but I prefer the Suunto in spite of the fact that Suunto now makes the Silva compasses as well The housing is indeed easier to turn on the Suunto which is handy when you re shooting by sight The Romer scales on the base are nice although if you re serious you re probably already carrying a transparent Romer scale card that s the plastic Graphic Training Aid thingy you take coordinates with for all of you Lt s out there When I backpack I take this Suunto as well as the Suunto GPS plotter compass for working with surprise my map and GPS If the Romer scales on the baseplate are really really important to you you might look into that compass as well or instead of as it features more scales and is just as accurate a compass All in all this is the ultimate baseplate compass in my opinion I have miles and miles of rifle piloting in the US Army behind me and now hump the hills for pleasure land navigation is a passion for me Suunto makes the tools that I find most useful in that pursuit 
5 0 Some clarification is in order I believe some clarification of this compass s features is in order I am retired military with over 24 years much of it using maps and compasses In my opinion this compass is the nearest I have seen to perfection for this style of compass The half moon hole is for easy sighting of a distant target with the mirror raised to about 45 degrees The backward markings are designed to be read by that same mirror thus appearing right sided in the mirror If there was a 6 star rating I would give it 
4 0 Nice mirror sighting compass The compass handles very nicely The housing is more comfortable to turn than the Silva Ranger CL This started to become significant after a few minutes of handling The Suunto can be used with one hand whereas it was difficult for me to operate the Silva due to the small knurls on the housing The bottom part of the mirror has a half moon hole in it allowing a midpoint view of your map Very nice The global gimbal system on the needle is pretty handy as you don t have to hold the compass totally flat for it to operate correctly Or I could learn to hold the base level too Presumably in the southern hemisphere the magnetic field causes the compass needle to roll a bit The one very strange thing about this model is that the declination markers inside the housing are printed upside down It appears that Suunto went with the declination readable from the opposing side while making the declination adjustment since the compass must be turned upside down to do this It s an interesting way to differentiate The inclinometer is probably pretty handy for snow travel among other things The base is a little wide for my hand as is the Silva The mirror appears replaceable Good thing since it s glass The map markings don t start on the edge of compass I prefer this since I never feel comfortable with that but it s a personal preference It has a 1 24000 and 1 62500 scale for map measurements The sighting notch seems to work well The lid snaps on to the base tightly and due to the thickness of the lid you can t quite twist your thumb to pop it It s a practice problem I m guessing The key on the lanyard is for adjusting the declination though I don t think I d do it because I d forget to realign it The compass is very heavy compared to a baseplate design but that s due to the lid It s a consideration if you re an ultralighter Those ounces really do add up There are lighter mirror compasses available The base does not have a centimeter scale whereas the Silva does 
5 0 Nice and smooth I have some of the regular bones swiss bearings and these feel faster I would recommend them 
5 0 They had me at 6 balls I had a mix of ABEC 5 s and 7 s on my skateboard and i thought it was about time to buy some good bearings so i bought the Bones 6 balls WOW the bearings are worth every penny you go faster and its alot smoother the Bones 6 balls spin longer not broken in than my mix of bearings I will keep on buying Bones products from this day foward My friend just cant seem to keep up with me when we skate around town and hes always outta breathe when he reaches me lol Grade A+ bearings hands down 
5 0 Best Bang For Your Buck Bearings Period I have been skateboarding for over 30 years and I own 14 skateboards 12 are longboards I m 43 after all I m in the process of converting ALL my boards to these bearings So far I have 8 boards with these bearings and I could not be happier They are fast and durable and less than half the cost of ceramics I m not aware of any bearings that come anywhere close to matching these in terms of performance and value Don t waste a 100 on ceramics GET THESE 
5 0 The best you can get besides ceramics Wow when I first bought these bearings I knew what I was after All my friends that skate and everyone I know uses Bones No wonder it doesn t have any reviews cause it doesn t need one If you take good care of them and clean them once a month or so they ll last you a long time and it also depends on how often you use your board but anyways if your looking for really good bearings for a decent price than these are the way to go 
5 0 solid lock comes with extra security cable includes 1 year free theft coverage on your bike when secured using the lock altho if you read the fine print it s redeemable only if the u lock is actually broken apart and you can show that nice set of keys including one with a light nice finish on the lock the keyhole is weather protected the shinier middle part rotates to cover it snug secure fit tho make sure it s big enough for your locking situations I d recommend this lock for anything up to medium high level of security 
5 0 great product the pennants are a great memento for the winning season of my favorite baseball team they are in great condition and will be displayed for years to come awesome product and a great price 
5 0 Wiffle Balls I just want to thank u for the quick turn around time for the wiffle balls My kids got into playing wiffle ball and at this time there were not to many around but u came through Thanks again Frank 
5 0 Skate Guards I just bought these guards and they protect my skate blades very well The only problem with these skates are that they are longer than my size 6 blades were So if you have that problem just trim After all it does say Trim if needed 
4 0 Nice case I picked up 1 of these as well as 3 single gun versions when they were 24 each just before Xmas 2005 They are built nicely with metal hinges and latches The description says aluminum but the sides seem to be a sturdy silver plastic not painted platic thankfully The frame is aluminum though Well worth what I paid I wish I bought the range case before the price went up It was 42 before Only problem is with smaller guns the padding doesn t hold the psitol tight enough so it moves during transport Nothing a thin layer of extra padding or magazine added under the thicker padding won t fix The locks are a nice extra but won t hold back an older child or adult determined to get at the pistol 
5 0 My old can swim My old has been using this at her local YMCA the 3 flotie one and she is swimming independantly I love that I can change the amount of boyancy by removing the bubbles as needed 
5 0 Excellent Swim Belt This is the same kind of swim belt used in our local instructional swim class We have tried others and we always come back to this one because it works better than the rest 
5 0 Best swim aid for kids Our local YMCA uses these at their toddler and preschool swim classes It s completely adjustable with 60 of belt The bubbles are on the child s back and therefore out of the way Unlike a lifejacket this does not allow the child to just float They need to keep moving and therefore actually learn to swim first by running in the water and then by stretching out to a normal swim posture Once the child progresses in his or her skills the bubbles can be halved and reduced until the child can swim without any help 
5 0 Instructional swim belt We purchased this swim belt after being introduced to it during our four year olds swim lessens Not only was it a great aid then but even more so when using it on our own We would highly recomend this to anyone whos child has difficulty staying afloat when vertical but wants to be on there own when swimming

4 0 Works good The quality is good Very accurate The only bad things is the wrist band is small in lenght for my wrist I used the last hole of the wrist band Everything else is good 
5 0 Awesome I love my watch The function to count calories burned during your workout is very helpful I take a lot of classes like step and turbo kickbox so its great to be able to have an idea of what I m actually burning It is easy to take your heart rate and if it doesn t take the first time you just have to lick your fingers and then it reads fine I haven t had a problem taking my heart rate while cycling or jumping around The watch is a little bulky so I m glad I got the petite It is definitely sporty so I wouldn t wear it to dinner or anything but it looks fine for the gym I m really glad I got it so I can track my calories burned better 
5 0 Horray for MIO I just bought my MIO and I love it I love knowing my heart rate when I exercise I don t leave the gym until I reach my goal of calories burned MIO helps me know if I need to increase my intensity or slow down I also love knowing my heart rate during the day to monitor my stress If it s too high I know that I need to relax and take a deep breath If you want to lose a few pounds or get in shape this is the watch for you Plus the purchase went towards a great cause 
1 0 Not a Good Buy I easily overlooked all of the issues that other people had with this watch It was close enough to being accurate since I was not looking for soemthing exact My two complaints are that it was not waterresistant at all even though it claimed to be and that after buying a new second watch that one broke within 4 months This is an unrelaible and cheaply manufactured item Spend a little more and get a watch that has a chest strap They may be tedious but they work and they dont break down 
4 0 Can be frustrating I have enjoyed using the heart rate monitor but sometimes have a difficult time getting it to reset Probably just because when I am done with my excercise I am warm and tired Sometimes it will take me several minutes to get it cleared But it serves it purpose for the heart rate monitor that I bought it for so I do like that way The band is not the most comfortable but assume that is just part of the necessary design 
4 0 Makes working out fun I wear this watch constantly now I love how it warns you when you go over your planned calorie allotment for the day so you can go work out and automatically subtract the calories it calculates from your total automatically bringing yourself back on track I also like learning how many calories I burn at work versus at rest versus during say rollerblading Really helps you budget your calories in line with your activities It comes with a calorie index pocket sized book that contains the calorie content of all foods that don t have tend to have caloric content on the packaging ex fruit beans vegetables and grants you access to their website which helps you have the appropriate expectations when it comes to daily calories needed and such If you re someone who needs a lot of information when it comes to motivation or someone who gives up trying as soon as you feel like you sabotaged your diet this is an excellent product because it gives you the information you need to undo your mistakes and keep moving forward towards a goal 
5 0 The Tow Mater Trike I recently purchased this cute trike for my godson who turned 3 The trike was very easy to put together and the look on his face when he opened his birtday pwesent was worth it Although he is having a bit of difficulty getting his feet and hands and eyes to get it all together to ride it hasn t stopped him We have about 25 inches of snow that is slowly melting but the first thing he wanted to do was take it out in the snow and tow Daddy s snowmobile We are gonna love this trike for a good many years because it will be passed on when my godson outgrows it 
5 0 Great trike my son loves it I bought this for my son s 4th birthday He and everyone else love it His legs are short and I thought he still needed a trike He absolutely loves the tow hook on the back It is extremely well made and the tow package is very strong and sturdy The seat has multiple positions for plenty of growing room My 6 1 2 year old loves it too They both hook things up and tow them around This is by far the cutest trike out there and I would definitly reccommend it It was slightly confusing to put together but once I got things figured out it was easy The instructions just aren t thorough enough but it s just basically common sense anyway This wouldn t keep me from getting it Just thought I should be totally honest about it 
5 0 Like tomata with out the Great buy My three son who this was for and his 7yr old brother and Five ans 20 month old sisters love it It is use well ans shows no signs of distress Easy to put together Was here in time for CHRISTmas Looking for the Lighting McQueen one now and will purchase with 
5 0 excellent My son got this for Christmas He loves it So far has seem to be very durable as to I have 3 rough boys The boys especially love that the tow really works they go around towing everything Takes only a few minutes to put together 
4 0 Best Toy We ve Ever Gotten We ordered this trampoline for our four year old s Christmas present It was the best 30 40 we ve ever spent She is very energetic and jumping seems to calm her Even in the middle of a meal or conversatin she will start jumping The small trampoline fits in our living room right between the family room area and the dining area so she has plenty of opportunities to jump This is a bit stiffer with not as much bounce as the outdoor trampolines but if it was that bouncy it would be more dangerous for a four year old and it would sag to the floor since it isn t high off the ground It is low to the floor and not super bouncy so I don t have any safety concerns with it Now if I could just motivate myself to exercise on it it would be even more of a find 
4 0 Useless out of the box Even a moderate wind tears it off the trampoline so we had to attach velcro straps to keep it in place During rain water is collected inside it and causes the trampoline to dangerously sag so we had to make a hole in the middle of the cover to let water out during storms 
4 0 Good but I was moments away from purchasing this but decided to call local knife ship for any details and found out the clock wasnt waterproof So seeing as i am in my school cadets experiencing rain lake and mud i really needed a sturdy tool that i wouldnt be afraid to get wet but with thorough research this was probably best tool for your average user who doesnt want the classic red handles so good size colour design tools but not waterproof 
5 0 Better than Climber I agree with the other reviewer that this is similar to the Climber but this has a better look It s just nicer The pen is great for work Very handy I ve found myself using it at bizarre times when I am searching for the pen In terms of the clock mine is going on 7 months with no forseeable problems 
5 0 swiss army voyager knife transparent onyx swiss army knife beautiful 21 feautres I own over 10 knives and this is my best one save over 50 by using amazon com instead of using swissarmy com I researched the internet and this is the best deal I could find anywhere for this knife 
4 0 Very nice pedometer This pedometer works very well and really helps to keep you motivated The instructions that come with it are really hard to understand but once you figure out how to use the watch it s pretty easy to use The colors are a little brighter than what you see in the picture It would be nice if there were more color choices Overall I am happy with this product and I recommend it 
4 0 Awesome Buy One of the best tihings I ve ever purchased I love top have the ability to keep track of the miles I run and the calories I burn Because I always suspected that the stats on the treadmill were off Just wish it came in more colors I m not really a girlie girl so wearing a pink watch everyday would be a bit much 
5 0 Tech4O Watch Great Watch I recently purchased the Tech4O watch This is a great fitness tool I love the watch You need to be somewhat technical to figure out how to use the watch it comes with a lot of instructions I love the pedometer functions and tracking that this watch can do I am just starting out on my fitness plan and this watch has helped me to track my progress on the number of steps I have done and encourages me to do more 
5 0 Walk off the Weight This thing is great I joined weight watchers a while back The watch helps me keep track of my steps easily and is super easy to use I don t have to think about it I just turn on and check how far I have walked at the end of the day I have taken off 12 pounds so far Thanks ACCELERATOR You are effortless 
5 0 Yep The knives came in a very short amount of time withing four days They are solid piece of stainless steale very sharpa and well balanced The sheath is pretty neat it holds all three knives at once It is an excellent buy 
5 0 The best sled under 50 bucks I recently bought several blow up and plastic snow sleds to try This one is the favorite of the whole family While all other sleds go wherever they want this sled has a steering wheel and indeed goes wherever you want It also seems very durble I am 180 lbs and rode it together with my 7 year old daughter even jumping over snow bumps 
5 0 GREAT GLOVE I have used this glove for several years and find that it lasts much longer than the competition foot joy etc sometimes as much as twenty rounds The only difficulty is finding them 
4 0 Ooh shiney sword It was fair in craftsmanship The blad was slightly crooked but that was the only thing I could find wrong with it The carving in the sheath was beautiful and my boyfriend loved his gift 
4 0 A solid purchase for the price I got this in the mail yesterday It arrived in a long box filled with packing peanuts After digging around in the foam clumps I retrieved the black and white spoted box which held this sword After examining it I found out a few things I got a blade that was worth the cost paid for it The detail in the dragon carving on the sheath is nice I can see some glue around the top of the pommel where the blade connects to the grip However it is not distracting or noticable unless you look closely Its balance is okay but it is no toy for it does have an edge With enough force you can injure someone especially if you stab them This is something that can be used for practicing swings as well as just admiring The blade is covered with oil when delevered You can wipe it off or leave it on if you do not intend to use it The oil does preserve the condition of the blade which is a plus when it is not being used Overall this is a great purchase However I do not think this sword could survive combat without being chipped Not sure about the quality of the steel used in creating it So its a great blade to admire and own if you have no intentions of practicing actual swordplay with it 
4 0 Decent sword fair warning Ok the sword s appearance is pretty nice it didn t dissapoint in that area I suppose I m not a blind swordsman so I can t really complain but it s about as sharp as a butter knife possibly a little more dull The sword fits in the scabbard well enough but when sheathing it gets stuck at the end and you have to force it just the right way and it s not as clean as I d like it to be All petty nitpicking aside it s a nice show piece maybe with a little sharpening I could become a blind samurai 
4 0 Review of Women s Long Sleeve Rash Guard The product was received on time and in excellent condition I had to however return it because it did not fit me 
4 0 Wayfinder is Way Cool The WayFinder is a very nicely packaged and built rugged and accurate compass It provides 5 degree sensitivity in the numeric display versus the typical 45 degree compass points of most automotive application units A result in some environments e g areas with lots of metal in the surroundings is that you may notice a numeric readout change back or forth that you would not see in the typical 45 degree type compass It should be noted that interference environments affect ALL compasses but when this one is significantly affected it will tell you by displaying DISTORTION so you know the currently displayed accuracy is suspect In the areas I have tried it the WayFinder is as accurate as my lensmatic engineering compass but a LOT easier to use It comes equipped with a dual suction cup mount which stays put on my motorcycle windshield while driving down washboard dirt roads at high speed Another post on this topic indicated that the compass would not stay put Chalk that up to operator ignorance Suction cups must be wet to stick to glass but the manual did not mention this likely assuming people have common sense when obviously they don t All suction cups require moisture on the cups to stick to glass The only bad thing about this unit is that it has been discontinued and is being replaced by a unit with more features at a LOT more expense Bottom line if you need a high quality off road tough accurate compass find a WayFinder before they are all gone 
4 0 Lost and need to find your way I bought this device primarily for the temperature feature but guess what it wasn t temperature it was degrees of direction Despite my misunderstanding it is accurate The only drawback is that the suction cups do not work on the windshield I keep it in my glove compartment and pull it out when I m lost The backlight is not useful because it is too dim Might as well have left that off and sold it a couple of bucks less 
5 0 Wayfinder Compass Review An excellent auto compass Easily set up Reliable operation Seems like an excellent value 
5 0 AWSOME I purchased a ripstik and let me tell you THE BEST THING TO RIDE Whenever I go down the street everyone stares and ask what is it They all say they want one too The best thing of all is riding hills I can even go up them but when you go down its like snowboarding I recommend this 100 
5 0 RazorX Ripstick Rocks Owning 2 ripsticks for the kids in our household is not enough My husband and I are also hooked Looks like we ll need 2 more Fun fun fun Best on a smooth surface indoor tile or concrete not black asphault Highly recommended for ages 10 100 
5 0 Go Figure I bought this for myself to play with I m 35 and after all the presents were opened and toys video games and everything were forgotten about 4 hours after Christmas this was the ongoing favorite of the season Everybody younger down to 8 and older to 45 had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching It s already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such This is a GREAT present for 11 18 boy Fair warning though there will be some good spills on the fairly short steep learning curve helmets knee pads blah blah are a must and a video camera 
4 0 walking on the celing I agree with the last guy They aren t actually anti gravity boots These are great but i think the harnesses could use some more padding I keep feeling like I am going fall on my head if relax my feet No complants on the product other than that Except these aren t even close to hoverboards 
5 0 No more Salt water This mask and snorkle for the money was fantastic My husband and I spent 8 days on Isla Mejeres Mexico this past week and we really used our snorkles NO SALT WATER got in our mouths at all The mask was clear and very comfortable Would highly recommend We received shipment prior to leaving within a week of ordering VERY HAPPY CUSTOMERS 
5 0 Sideview Mask and Dry Snorkel This is a really good mask that allows better peripheral vision and the snorkel works very well also I used them in the Whitsundays all day every day for 5 days and I was particularly impressed with the snorkel because you can duckdive and swim upside down or any way you want and the water pressure will keep the snorkel shut tight so that no water can get in I ve used it a few times since then and it still works perfectly I wish I could snorkel more often I ve never actually seen anyone with a better snorkel 
5 0 Good Gun I don t know what the other people are talking about but this gun is a spring gun and can not shoot on automatic Also there are no batteries that come with it except for the laser batteries and even if they don t work it s not the end of the world The gun shoots about the suggested speed for 12 grams but I would recommend using 2 grams This gun is so accurate with 2 grams and can shoot nearly the same distance People who said this gun is a piece of crap and is easily broken are retarded It is made of plastic and will break if you treat it like a metal gun I have hade mine for several months and it works like a charm 
5 0 awesome gun i ordered this m16 a4 and instead i got an m16 a2 and that is cool because the m16 a2 is better and cost 60 on airsplat and it has 305 fps very good gun reccomend to anyone just having little trouble with the foregrip 
5 0 Simply wonderful My grandson and I surfed through Amazon s website from very remote locations and this airsoft rifle is the one he wanted It arrived on time in perfect order and according to my grandson it s awesome Good product great delivery 
5 0 Good Gun The Gun has great Velocity at least 300 325 Has great accuracy from shortrange and longrange point blank 120 feet Comes with decent accessories Dual LED blue flashlight great for night games it illuminates the bb s and makes them glow in the dark and a laser which worked for me for about 30 secs and then the wires split apart Not visible outside during sunlight but good at night The magazine is great holds about 19 in the first part of it and then the attached speed loader about 65 Has a three point extendable stock a decent hand grip a little wobably at times Easy to cock right under the handel on top of the gun Overall the gun is a great buy cant beat it for the money Looks like a real M16 The orange tip is spray painted on 
5 0 Excellent purchase I purchased this gun for my dad for father s day This completed his Marine Corps kit He has his sword uniform and now his M16 He loves it I couldn t afford to get him a real M16 so this was the next best thing 
5 0 Quad Skates are Great These skates are comfortable and affordable By adding an arch support to each skate I never had foot or leg pain through the roller skating party 
4 0 Great Bike My daughter loved this bike It was easy to assemble and came complete with a bell and a basket It is a wonderful part of her Hello Kitty collection I only wish the shipping was not so expensive and that it got here in time for her birthday 
5 0 No Frills Security There is no one solution to securing a handgun with the exception of a vault but this little box makes me feel a little better when I need to leave my pistol in my vehicle It provides safe secure storage and is not too big or too small And the Secure It Handgun Storage Safe is very well made with a professional finish and top quality securing cable You d play hell ripping one of these things from an automotive seat rail and even if you did it might take some work to open the safe This is also an excellent place to store your registration too 
4 0 Pretty good value Has a few flaws but works well overall The BandFlex comes in two large boxes each around 70 pounds I was surprised that UPS delivered them since I got a note from Amazon indicating that Eagle Freight was handling the shipping BTW this is one of those times when Amazon Prime pays for itself since shipping is free under Prime but pretty costly without it One box contains the long arms and beams and the other contains the base and other smaller parts There are many bolts that are of very similar but not identical lengths and sorting them out and keeping track of them during assembly is time consuming Two cresent wrenches are required to bolt the gym together along with a Phillips head screwdriver I would suggest using a tape measure or ruler to sort out the bolts The assembly diagrams and instructions in the owner s manual are adequate but could be clearer Overall assembly took me about 3 hours The only really tricky part was attaching the bungie cords and the pulleys that they ride over to the gym The 3 cords on each side need to be stretched a little while you thread a single bolt through all 3 pulleys and keep the cords from slipping out or the pulleys from moving out of alignment or the bolt from missing the hole it mounts to One pulley set that was pre assembled at the factory was over tightened and needed to be loosened a bit which was easy to do When done the gym is very solid and sturdy I suspect that it is actually a standard stack weight gym that has been modified to use bungie cords instead of a weight stack which is fine by me since it probably is part of the reason it has such a low price compared to the competition Plus it keeps the overall weight of the gym down to around 140 pounds or so which means that I can put it on the second floor of my apartment without worrying about overstressing the loft s floorboards The gym has several attachments and allows many exercises including unexpected ones like rowing complete with rolling seat Since the cords increase in resistance as you stretch them they give plenty of weight at the end perhaps much more than the 10 25 35 pounds suggested in the manual On the other hand they give less resistance at the start of an exercise Overall I find the exercises to be challenging and I m still a ways from using all 3 cords at once Plus there isn t too much transforming needed to ready the gym for the next exercise type As another reviewer suggested cutting off the safety clips on the bands makes changes in resistance much easier but has caused the cords to spontaneously unclip on me a couple of times so proceed with caution Adding carabiners between the cord hooks and the cable rings might be a workable alternative to cutting the clips However changes to resistance for all of the exercises that use the lower pulley cable set are hard to do as you need to duck under the bench and attach detach the pre tensioned bands onto a very small metal ring The pulldown bar uses this same cable so it has the same issue The gym really does fold up into a surprisingly small footprint and has rollers on the back to aid in positioning But it is definitely a full sized gym when unfolded so it needs a bit of space Overall I m quite pleased with the gym My biggest complaint is that when starting exercises that use the bench at an incline like fly or bench presses it is very difficult to reach waaaay down and behind you to grab the cord handles as they re on the floor by the base of the gym I ve found that hooking the handle cords through the training belt and then draping the belt over the bench helps at least the reach isn t so bad but it still isn t ideal Some sort of velcro or hook on the back top of the bench where the handles could hang until needed would help a lot Other than that I think the gym is sturdy is very usable and is a definite bargain for the price 
4 0 Good Value I purchased this on sale so that made this an extra good value And Amazon ships this FAST it took about 3 or 4 days to receive It s very easy to put together I wanted to do this before my husband came home so I had to add rubber mat flooring AND put this together which I was able to do The only part I needed help with was stretching the gray resistance band and getting the pulley and bolt in since it was difficult to hold on to the band to lessen resistance and screw the bolt in at the same time It really was pretty easy and the instructions were surprisingly well written You must measure the bolts since they are close in size The machine is great for the price The only thing that makes this a difficult machine to use is how the resistance is altered That part is very poorly designed and I keep meaning to go to the hardware store to find an alternative hook or clip to use The way the leg attachment cables need to be changed is enough to make you want to choose some other exercise over leg extensions However if I find some clips similar to what the bowflex uses on its resistance machines they are built totally differently but I like their clips hooks I think changing the resistance will be much more pleasant and definitely easier The machine enables you to do very many exercises The leg curls are great the preacher machine curl attachment is wonderful You can even do leg presses on this machine believe it or not but only to 130 pounds Still that s great for me The lat bar gets a lot of use and that s easy to adjust All the resistance for the upper body is much easier to adjust than the leg attachment exercises Still they aren t as easy as pulling a clip and reinserting it Another benefit here is the bench itself It s adjustable to many positions no decline and when the upper part is removed you can use the machine as an rowing machine And I ve tried many rowing machines this one is very smooth and almost fun to use All in all this is a great value but not as user friendly as it should be My husband and I love it since we now don t have to wait for eachother for equipment when we do similar workouts and are working on a timer since we already have other equipment So we have an extra bench now and extra upper and lower pulley station now and it makes working out together much more fun 
4 0 Nice for the Price This is a nice piece of equipment for the price I was looking for under 300 a collapsable workout center That is exactly what I got It works for what I wanted and it allows me to have a great workout The only con I see is that the bands don t give enough resistance For a starter gym it is great but if someone is moving from the gym to home workout it might not be enough resistance To purchase replacement bands you have to go through Stamina but each band is around 10 or less so that isn t too bad I also had to modify some of the workouts that were described in the book to make them more efficient 
4 0 Good Value for Money The Stamina is definitely not a Bowflex but then I can t afford a Bowflex I really like the sliding seat for doing rowing type exercises The Stamina wasn t too hard to assemble but there were some quality issues with the parts that I had to correct to get everything to fit together My main complaint is the difficulty in changing the resistance bands Much of this was taken care by cutting off the plastic safety clips they really aren t needed There were also quality issues with the length of the ropes not being even which I had to correct by knoting one However overall I m pleased with the value 
4 0 ariel sleeping bag The sleeping bag received was not the sleeping bag pictured but I kept it anywa 
5 0 Excellent Tool for the new LL Pitch Count Rules This pitch counter was a very useful aid to our Fall baseball teams as we were able to accurately track both the number of pitches thrown and the efficiency of our pitchers and those of the opposing team Little League s new pitch count rules start next spring and this is a great tool much better than the manual tally counters Works just as advertised and worth the extra money 
4 0 Gel Works for Fog Free Snorkeling The product works as advertised used it snorkeling in Maui with water temps of around 70 75 degrees with no fogging up The only drawback is applying a small amount since it is in a gel form the trick is to squeeze out a bit on your finger then rub inside the mask Does not take much 
5 0 Nicely padded mat This is a great mat After using the paper thin one s at the gym my tailbone was sometimes sore and I had to double up the mats This one is 1 2 inch thick and is so comfortable It really makes a huge difference and I am able to focus on the moves without having to worry about discomfort Highly recommended I loved it so much I bought one for my husband 
5 0 My sister loved this mat My sister absolutely loved this mat I gave it to her for Christmas She just got wood floors and needed a mat to work out on This mat is the thickest I have seen I was very pleased with the high quality 
5 0 Great for pilates I love this mat for my pilates class it s nice and thick yet grips well for standing positions Easy to roll up and keep in my car too I highly recommend this for pilates exercise classes You will appreciate it when doing rolling like a ball 
4 0 Really comfortable Stays put on floor Bought this to do pilates on my hardwoods Really the perfect amount of cushion does not move with rolling exercises Great for spine and hipbones Came rolled up and the edge still doesn t want to completely unfold that s why it gets 4 instead of 5 I m sure it will eventually come out but it should ve been packaged more carefully Also since it is thicker than a normal mat it takes up a little more room but it is worth the comfort 
5 0 Great race food I got these as freebies at the Gulf Coast triathlon and have used them in every race since and for long training sessions I actually buy them by the case They taste great esp cran razz and strawberry but not so much cola are a great pick me up and are very easy to eat even mid race Best cliff product I ve tried yet 
5 0 The best for the long haul As a 6 time marathon runner and triathlete I have tried more than my share of gels and substances for carb replacement My running group favor Clif Blocks for a number of reasons 1 They taste great and are not too sweet Over the course of a long event you can t stomach more gel after a while these seem to go down OK hours into an event 2 They carry well and don t cause a mess like gels Even the gel flasks leak but no problem here 3 You can vary your intake one cube every 10min or 2 every 20 or 3 every 30 or 40 You can also get them down WITHOUT WATER Yeah a little pricey but well worth it if you are serious about doing the outdoors thing 
4 0 I Like Candy I ve been marathon training with these for a month here are my thoughts THE GOOD These things taste supernummy better than any gel bar or energy food I ve had I find myself eating them for breakfast Every flavor is my favorite with lemon lime being the most favorite The caffeinated ones really do have enough caffeine in them to wire me I weigh 115 though I guess it doesn t take much Keep em in your pocket they don t melt THE BAD No protein ingredient Packaging is hard to open I use scissors THE UGLY Expensive 2 for 200 calories 
5 0 Good energy good taste If you are like me and found the taste and consistency of products like Gu and Clif Shots to be pretty nasty you ll be very happy to switch to these Shot Bloks which remind me of eating gummy bears You can get the energy boost and electrolytes you need while participating in strenuous sports such as climbing running biking etc without the mess and inconvenience of those gooey energy products I ve tried most of the flavors and found all the ones I tried to be tasty and enjoyable to eat I like being able to eat just a few Bloks at a time from the package in contrast to needing to consume an entire package of Gu or Clif Shots at once or suffer the sticky consequences Shot Bloks seem to give me the same kick start as those older products and I actually LIKE eating them Give them a try I think you ll be pleased with them 
5 0 A good workout I have a two year old and a four month old so this is the extinct of my workout It was the perfect investment for me I m satisfied with my purchase my husband even plans to use it It took us alittle while to put together but it wasn t because it was difficult Matter a fact it was pretty clear cut For the price I think it is a good piece of equipment 
5 0 Great Elliptical My wife and I assembled this elliptical a week ago and have been using it quite a bit We love it The stride length and pedal design make for very smooth rotations with minimal up and down motion That was a must for us since my wife wanted to be able to read magazines while using it We bought ours from a different online source and for some reason it was missing the power adapter I called technical service at Horizon Fitness and they immediately shipped an adapter to us in 3 business days I also called them 3 weeks ago when I was doing research on ellipticals and they were just as friendly and helpful then The only other problem was that there was a small crack in the top right side of the elliptical s plastic housing but it is not very noticable has no chance of getting worse and is entirely cosmetic Overall we are very pleased with our elliptical 
4 0 Works great This elliptical is great I was able to put it together in 1 2 hours I ve had it for 2 weeks and so far works like a charm The only reason I give it 4 stars is that every time I turn the console on it makes a LOUD beep by design which is a problem because I usually workout late at night when the kids are asleep loud noises sometimes wake kids up There is a mute option but it only works after the console is turned on Other than that which is really a minor annoyance this machine is great 
5 0 Quiet easy to use easy to assemble Received this item yesterday in the mail Delivery was quick considering I used the free shipping option about a week and a half to get Piece of cake to assemble instructions are clear and easy to follow and the bolts and nuts are packaged into 8 or so little baggies one for each step in the instruction set this way you don t really have to figure out which bolt they are referring to I assembled it by myself didn t need more then one person which is nice The hardest part assembling it by myself was the first step which is to attach the front stabilizer bar that has wheels on it This requires you to lift the front end slightly and keep it elevated while you screw this piece on Once you have it on though it is easy to move at that point because of the wheels Gave it a try and it runs smooth and quiet for me even with high resistance I can still watch TV without turning the volume to a crazy amount So far overall I ve found it great to use even though I ve only been using it for a day The only problem I had was the back right stabilizer bar got dinged and because of that the plastic cap on the end cracked It is a decorative thing but that has been my only problem I watched them unload and carry it into my apartment Eagle freight and they were not gentle at all so that being the only thing broken makes me happy 
5 0 Outstanding kit This and the 5 for day hikes are the only kits I carry now I leave a larger kit in the vehicle I haven t found a more useful and lightweight kit out there Nothing but the essentials with room for a few personal meds I think this and the 5 are the best buys for the money the 7 isn t enough more or less If you are serious about weight and confident in your abilities to manage a situation with a limited amount of gear this is the kit for you 
5 0 Strong and compact As a woman who likes to go to the dog park at night I appreciate the small and easy to handle size Don t let the small size fool you though this is more powerful than many of the larger stun guns out there yet it fits easily in your hands and works well It is easy to carry on your belt in your briefcase or purse It is discrete yet gives a great feeling of security Just flashing it is sufficient to send a strong message The light is also a nice additional feature for those after dark walks 
5 0 Easy to use Received the XPort Hitch Rack and put it together quickly instruction clear and hitched easily to my truck It was easy to install not heavy not made out of metal but strong enough I absolutely love the rack and now I can take my bike wherever I want without hauling it in and out of the truck bed To discourage theft located a lock that I can insert at the end of the bolt that holds the rack in place Great product 
5 0 This product saved me I borrowed one of these for a campout high in the Wyoming mountains We were with a large group sleeping out in the open I recently purchase my own because I liked it so much On the trip had a burrito consisting of my sleeping bag a wool and fleece blanket covered by a small tarp This little baby was underneath Not only did it provide comfort on the hard ground it provided protection keeping me off the running water on the ground when hard rain started to pelt us for 2 4 hours I think the convoluted water resistant design of this helped Except for a little bit of water on the top opening of my sleeping bag i was dry one of the very few in our large group Most of the other people were drenched 
5 0 Its fine for me Hey these might not be the best but it works good for me maybe im a dumbass but ya 
4 0 Great storage device I was a little skeptical when I first ordered the Delux Hoist System but I really was excited about being able to make use of the space in my 12 foot garage We recently purchased 2 Kayaks and by using the Up Away Deluxe hoist system we were able to store them between the garage door rails and up out of the way The system is really easy to install works great and I m so glad every time I walk through the garage that I made this purchase The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is the ropes that were provided with the system Over time they will surely degrade and need to be replaced with a tougher version Outside of this minor thing I highly recommend this system if your looking to store your bike kayaks or even ladders up and out of the way Makes great use of wasted space 
5 0 XMAS gift My son loves it many of his friends have one as well Loves showing me new tricks his 10 year old brother enjoys it as well Hopefully no broken bones in the future 
5 0 Top Notch Quality Excellent product high quality and great functional design I bought it as a gift for my wife and she loves it 
5 0 Got my kid to shut off the television We have had hours of famly fun playing basketball 21 PIG and other family games outside with this hoop We live in a real windy spot so I filled the base with sand and it has not blown over yet I like the rebounding action provided by this design It is very helpful when practicing It is very easy for an adult to adjust the rim height Two basketballs store easily and out of the sun on the base behind the support truss This is a stable well engineered basketball hoop that I highly recomend Assembly took a while Don t expect to put together quickly or by yourself Filling the base with sand makes it very stable but is trying on the patience 
5 0 Great product I ve been using this product for nearly 1 month now and I absolutely love it Along with healthful eating this DVD is great for losing weight I have already lost about 7 lbs I recommend this product to everyone

5 0 Great Knife Shipping was quick and the knife what can I say Great quality and super cool 
5 0 great snowboard I love this board It was a great deal and is awesome 
5 0 Cathe does it again Beginners do not try this at home This workout is vintage Cathe Heart stopping cardio and tough weight work topped by Cathe s friendly demeanor and excellent cuing This dvd utilizes the High Step so this workout is perfect for exercisers that lack a lot of space You will need a loaded barbell and a medium heavy and light set of dumbbells Cathe uses 5 and 10 lbs The workout is an hour long but you will be so busy time will fly by There are five cycles each containing cardio and weights Cycle one Cardio followed by Legs and Triceps Cycle two Cardio followed by Legs and Shoulders Cycle three Cardio followed by Legs and Biceps Cycle four Cardio followed by Legs and Back Cycle five Cardio followed by Legs and Chest Finally you enjoy a well deserved stretch The legwork consists mostly of Leg Presses followers of the Firm workouts will be familiar with these mixed in with another leg exercise For example in cycle one leg presses are followed by barbell squats in cycle two leg presses are followed by plie squats Modifications are shown for some exercises and you can always adjust your step height and or weights This dvd contains premixes cardio only strength only cardio and upper body cardio and lower body etc for those who are short on time or want to focus on a particular body part I recommend this dvd for someone who is familiar with weight training and with Cathe s cardio workouts 
5 0 Incredible full body workout I have been working out 5 days a week about an hour for 4 years now I ve done the Crunch kathy Smith and buns of steel various workout tapes They re not a challenge for me anymore So I took the plunge and bought this video Cathe is an incredible trainer This is a perfect full body workout It was super easy to follow and the moves are challenging but easy to do You re sure to sweat during this workout This workout is perfect for those that have mastered crunch Kathy Smith or anything similar TRUST ME If you need a challenge this is it 
5 0 Weslo Cadence C44 Treadmill I find this unit to be an excellent choice for the money It has adjustable speed from 1 0 mph to 10 mph in 1 increments The belt is of ample width and long enough for longer strides The display is easy to read and the controls are well marked It has readouts for speed fat burned calories burned speed of belt distance travelled and time of session Also there is a pulse monitor It has a safety key that is necessary to operate the unit and which clips to you for emergency shut off If you want to pause a session you push the stop button and all read outs are frozen If you pull the safety key the unit stops and the readout goes blank The belt platform folds up fo storage in case it is necessary My only complaint is I wish the pulse monitor operated a little faster The assembly instructions could use improvement and the description of the screws could be better Although the instructions recomend a helper for some steps I was able to assemble it alone It appears to be a solid unit and I expect to get much use out of it 
5 0 Great bargain The kids are loving them They adjust quite easily and I am very pleased with the item overall 
5 0 Best Investment This was a present on our girls 3rd birthday She rode off an on from 2 until 9 She loved it so much we couldn t wait for the battery to run out For the rest of the day she would only stop long enough open another gift then back to the car Quick to learn how to drive it Loud a little bit but hey it s a kids toy If they didn t make noise the kids wouldn t like it Great Toy Great Value 
5 0 bumper fun These cars can be summed up in two words FUN and LOUD I have two and my four year old loves it and so do all his friends They work great throughout the house and hold their charge really well I am even thinking of getting a third They do leave little marks on the wood floors but it cleans easily Well worth it 
4 0 Bumper Buggie Review When the buggie arrived it didn t work I had to call Razor s Customer Service Dept Their service is awful The Senior Agent was very rude I managed to figure out the problem on my own The electrical unit was not connected Once it was connected it worked fine We have two of them The kids love them They are lightweight and ride well on carpet Overall the product is good 
5 0 Happy Children Great product fun for children nicely designed easy to operate I purchased 3 of the razor bumper buggie Ladybug cars for 3 of my grandchildren age 4 3 and 2 The cars arrived promptly At Christmas I charged the batteries and gave them to the children The cars work great Even the 2 year old can work her car Just like her big brothers Although one battery did not hold the charge correctly a quick call to the company and a new part was sent immediately GrandmaLind 
4 0 WOW best toy for 2007 This is the best toy I ve spent money on in years It s cute my girls love them I bought two They are great to ride in the garage or believe it or not they go well on carpet They have laughed bumped even learned how to use the driving handles with their feet Great fun 
5 0 Hours of fun We bought these so the children could have something to play with during the winter We backed our vehicles out of the garage and zoom they were off having fun The box says Ages 3+ and up to 55 pounds The bumper buggie looks small but it is roomy enough for my 5 1 2 year old He weighs 45 pounds and is 45 inches tall He can stretch his legs out in the car but chooses to keep his knees bent while driving My two year old can also work the controls It is easy to use and the kids can do a complete 360 My only complaint is that it is a little bit noisy but no more than other battery operated vehicles I highly recommend this item It is so much fun Best part is that there is little assembly required The only thing we had to do was screw the seat into the car 
4 0 Easy to use not easy to put together This treadmill works fine although there is nothing in the instructions about the incline May be obvious to some but at first I couldn t figure out how to change it Also it s not easy to put together The control panel fits on top of the legs but it s almost impossible to line them up with the holes and screws properly Great value for the price but don t put it together alone 
5 0 Wonderful product A gift for our goddaughter She is very pleased with it size and waterproof performance 
5 0 Highgear VIA Wrist Pedometer is High Qual After having several pedometers through the years that became damaged after their clips either broke or slipped off my waist I decided to purchase the VIA wrist pedometer So far the VIA Wrist has performed very well It has 5 primary operational modes Time Step User Data Alarm and Chronograph The Step Mode has 5 sub modes Step Time Step Kcal Step Distance in miles or kilometers Timer Steps Target The User Data mode allows the user to input his her age gender weight in lbs or kg stride in inches or centimeters The step mileage counter appears to be accurate when I compared it to one of my expensive waist pedometers The VIA has a plastic wrist band which may or may not pose a problem over the long term I plan on purchasing another VIA Wrist pedometer as a gift for a relative who is a cross country jogger 
4 0 my conscience This is an excellent product easy to set up and pretty accurate and it makes me push myself to get my steps in because the stats are right there on my wrist The only reason I do not give it five stars is that the watch band while waterproof and cleanable is not the most comfortable configuration with the watch It is the only complaint I have 
5 0 Surprize I ve lost or dropped so many pedometers I was about to give up I came across this marvel decided to give it a shot It s the best of all It can t drop off its accurate its more than a pedometer It s also a great tool for sticking to your goals 
5 0 Heavy Duty My Trek mountain bike came without a kickstand I purchased an aftermarket one at the bike shop but returned it as it got in the way of the pedals and never really fit right The Greenfield fits behind the pedals and doesn t get in the way It s rock solid and holds up while biking the trails without bouncing around It also holds the bike stable when deployed It does ad some weight but no more than other kickstands Easy to use and install 
5 0 Lightweight Sturdy and Practical Excellent design construction and functionality Works well in any surface and adapts to most bikes 
4 0 Light sturdy easy to install You need two Allen hexagonal head wrenches to install this kickstand What I don t like There are no instructions included Even the Greenfield Industries website has no instructions While I suppose that there is only one way for it all to fit together a few diagrams would have been nice Also it would have helped to know that the attachment point should be moved as far to the rear as possible Until I did this my heel struck the stand when pedaling I presume this is a function of both my shoe size size 11 male and the length and position of the horizontal frame member to which the stand attaches On my bike I think that a rider with a size 13 or larger show might well have a problem Again the Greenfield Industries website should provide this information but at this writing it does not The inner mounting bracket has a mysterious hole at the top and there is no matching hole in the outer bracket There are no lockwashers provided though perhaps they are unnecessary What I like It is light strong reasonably priced easy to install and appears to be well made Rear mounting avoids conflicts with the pedals and crank arms It looks great though it makes the bike look rather like a police bike perhaps not a bad thing if one is worried about theft 
5 0 Easy on Easy off I love this swim cap I actually look like I know what I am doing when I put it on I have long hair and it always took me forever to put on my latex swim cap and even then I still had hair poking out 
5 0 Great Cap My local YMCA requires everyone to wear a cap so I wasn t too psyched to squeeze into a latex cap everytime This cap is the best of both worlds The lining makes it easy to put on and the silicon still gives me some of the benefits of a rubber cap 
5 0 good for what it is I wear this swim cap because my local YMCA requires women with long hear to wear caps I don t wear it to keep my hair dry which is good because I don t think it s designed to do so However it is very comfortable for a swim cap and does its job so they let me in the pool 
5 0 Wavemaster review I like the size of this bag It s big enough for myself and husband both to use at same time yet small enough it doesn t take up large storage space Easy to put together Bag and stand seem sturdy 
4 0 Good But Has a Few Shortcomings I ordered 4 black Diamond Gen IV flashlights on March 2 and they arrived March 8th Not too bad All flashlights were shaken up and worked as advertised I put all 4 through a test and found that one had a sticky switch The switches could be more durable When the flashlights are lying on their sides sometimes the light comes on even though the switches are off The 2 hour light span as advertised is a bit overrated After 1 hour of continuous use the lights were barely visible A few shakes restored their brightness Overall they seem to be a good product for emergencies 
5 0 I D GIVE IT 100 STARS IF I COULD EASY TO USE This is the best flashlight ever I don t know why anyone would give this flashlight anything below 5 stars This is amazing and super easy to use As long as you follow the instructions which are very clear and easy to comprehend and shake the flashlight the way it says the light is VERY bright And it doesn t fade right away if you do it right either And the good thing about this is that if it does start fading all you have to do is shake it some more and you ve got the bright light again I recommend ordering more than one of these I just got one to try for my boyfriends BDay present and we both love it Im going to order these for our cars and more for the house This would be a great thing to have in a childs room If the lights ever go out or they are scared you dont have to worry about a battery not working or going dead on them This is easy enough for even a small child to use As another person commented on here This is by no means a spot light flashlight but it works 100 for what it was meant for This is a batteryless flashlight people what in the world are you expecting A flashlight that shakes itself With 3 Million Candlepower of light Give me a Break And as I said before this is SUPER EASY TO SHAKE You must be a real wimp if you think its hard to shake 
4 0 Good but expensive These gloves fit well They re comfortable They have wrist support Durability and washability don t seem to be issues Included workout software is crappy in my opinion which makes the gloves somewhat overpriced If the software had been up to snuff installable instead of CD based I might have given this product a five star rating 
5 0 Best I ve come across in twenty years Just ordered my third pair of Go Fit workout gloves Not available in stores in my area The best I ve come across in twenty years in reference to grip wear washability and quality construction I workout 5x a week An outstanding value for the price 
5 0 well designed product I ve had these gloves a few weeks and think they re great I use them for weightlifting workouts three times a week Not only do they seem well constructed and durable but they have nice features like a terry cloth patch on the back for wiping sweat and one longer finger to make them easier to pull off I didn t really have much use personally for the CD but the gloves are well worth the price 
5 0 great gloves I love these gloves I use them for cardio and weightlifting I work out 4 times a week and wear these gloves every time I work out very comfortable great grip for lifting the big weights don t ever smell I haven t listened to the CD yet 
5 0 great This sword is a really nice one it is worth the money its just great 
4 0 excellent as long as you re honest this product is excellent as long as you re honest about your pinching very easy to program and use 
5 0 Nice features I love that its small for my wrist Its simple to use and I love it Its also a really cute color I actually find myself using this as a watch when Im not exercising 
4 0 Polar F4 monitor I like the smaller size watch This particular monitor gives a summary of each workout session The directions made it easy to set up and read the watch face I mainly am interested in keeping an eye on the calories burned as I give myself targets to hit when I ride my bike However there is one annoying part with this watch the wrist band It is easy to strap on but not easy to take off The buckle does not open easily too take the watch off I have to hold down the middle metal piece that locks into the wrist band holes and play with the strap moving it up and down until I am able to take the watch off I have to strap the watch on loosely or it is very hard to unbuckle if I make the wrist band fit properly I didn t have this problem with my previous men s polar wrist band The wrist band feels like a stiffer plastic rubber piece then my prior polar band too 
4 0 I love this watch there is just one thing I really like this watch The heart rate is extremely accurate I love the reminder to work out feature also The only thing that I wish it had is backlighting or some sort of light feature I like to jog at night and it is impossible to read the numbers Even in the gym it is difficult to read in certain lighting conditions 
4 0 Great tool for helping to lose weight Gives a visual feedback to the effort extended so you have a more accurate picture of what your are or are not accomplishing Am happy with the accuracy and have had no problems with it to date after almost a year Just wish it had a backlight since it is often dark when I am walking When it is easy to see I can quickly pick up my pace or change my route to reach the goals I have set for myself Harder to do if it is dark and you cannot read the screen I was worried when I got it that the band on the watch would be small because I have large wrists not a problem at all Was also worried about the comfort of the chest strap do not notice it any more than my bra It was also plenty big 
4 0 Becoming accountable I love this It makes me accountable for my exercise It s accurate and I love that it keeps calories and records and logs it all I have used it in water and on land It is perfect for all levels of exercisers It is comfortable and looks nice Great features 
4 0 Polar Ice blue HRM Gift for wife who works out at 5 30am Primarily because it would support her current routine Lots of Aerobics Nice that it s compatible with many of the treadmills steppers Easy to set up and use Medium chest strap fits her size 4 and adust to fit me as well 42 chest had to try it Got this primarily because of design color Ofcourse the features are very important and I trusted that this model had most of the valued features in HRM s I ve owned Polars before and it helped me maintain a great workout schedule My wife uses it everyday and really enjoys the summary feature which recaps the week totals 
5 0 AWSOME I purchased a ripstik and let me tell you THE BEST THING TO RIDE Whenever I go down the street everyone stares and ask what is it They all say they want one too The best thing of all is riding hills I can even go up them but when you go down its like snowboarding I recommend this 100 
5 0 RazorX Ripstick Rocks Owning 2 ripsticks for the kids in our household is not enough My husband and I are also hooked Looks like we ll need 2 more Fun fun fun Best on a smooth surface indoor tile or concrete not black asphault Highly recommended for ages 10 100 
5 0 One aspect is indispensible As another reviewer hinted at it probably wouldn t be very hard to make one yourself it s really just a rope with a handle on one hand and a flattened piece that fits in a closed door with a stop on it to keep it from slipping through Here s what I like about it you know how fitness books always say Don t let your feet get in front of your knees when you squat You can t do much of a squat following that rule unless you have something like this You can lean back while squatting thereby keeping your shins vertical for the whole movement Perfect technique Even better you can hold on with only one hand and the effort of your core to keep in position makes this a more complete exercise I don t know the weight capacity of this piece so I won t advise this just yet but a one handed grip straight shin squat with a heavy dumbell in the other hand is an incredible exercise Not to downplay the other uses but this alone is worth the price 
5 0 Awasome I got this about 3 months ago Great product very flexible and easy to use Simple to setup Only suggestion is to put grip tape on the handles 
5 0 Great for motel workouts I am very pleased with the Jungle Gym I ve used mine for several excellent workouts during week long motel stays No more finger pain from door pullups and no more fear of the motel room s bathroom door coming off the hinges during the pullups The Jungle Gym is also great for free hanging pullups dips or pushups from a tree branch or other suitable surface The handles are slick plastic and rotate a little against the nylon webbing with makes for a nice grip workout The instruction sheet packaged with the Jungle Gym demonstrates several more exercises I most often add Jungle Gym pullups to a deck of cards workout for time pushups handstand pushups situps squats or other bodyweight exercises with a different exercise for the four suits and jokers using the face value for the number of reps and you can pummel yourself from top to bottom If you are driving it s easy to toss kettlebells or clubbells into the fray and you ll know there isn t enough oxygen in the room These workouts make any Crossfitter proud Lightweight versatile compact and it s never caused me any trouble getting through airport security it s one of my traveling staples I definitely recommend purchasing one if you like being able to work out irregardless of where you are 
5 0 Great Machine Superb Build Quality Very quiet Requires power to operate resistance Very easy to assemble 
5 0 love this machine I absolutely love my schwinn elliptical machine It is a smooth and sturdy workout that is equal to going to the gym for me The instructions were easy to follow however it was challenging to esemble You need two people at least and about 3 hours uninterrupted But once it is together it is well worth it 
5 0 A wise choice I am a soldier who has recently returned from deployment While I was deployed I injured both knees and am unalbe to run due to the impact I had tried ellipticals while I was deployed and was quite impressed with the work out I got When I returned I went out and started searching for one of my own My goal was to keep it under 1000 I tried many different brands and discovered that not all ellipticals are created equal Many of them are cheaply made and shake side to side or make alot of noise The stride is very important I am 6 foot tall and the 16 inch stride on some of them just didnt cut it I ended up buying a Proform 160 from the Proform website since it had an 18 inch stride and seemed to be sturdy however after discovering how little they care about customer service I cancelled my order I ended up buying an Image 9 5 from Walmart I used it for about 3 weeks and came to the conclusion that the foot pedals were spaced too far apart and it put pressure on my knees and made my hips hurt After thinking about it for a minute it made sense to me who runs with thier feet that far apart anyway My feet almost land in a straight line when I run So I set out to find one with closer pedals Overall I tried almost 2 dozen different machines and finally found the Schwinn 430 at a fitness store I tried the 418 and 438 also but the 430 seemed to be the most comfortable to me The 438 and some of the other brands seem to have a high arch on the upstroke The 430 was very smooth and ultra quiet It is very well made and should last for many years Amazon had the best deal on it and had it to me in about 8 days It is a very comfortable machine After all of this I would say to anyone wanting to buy an elliptical try alot of them I tried all the ones at Sears Oshmans Academy and Fitness in motion Make sure the stride length pedal angle and pedal spacing are comfortable for you after all if its not comfortable you wont want to use it The only thing I think could be improved on the Schwinn 430 is a backlit display Luckily I work out with the lights on so its not a problem haha I tried many machines that were between 2 3000 and this one was still more comfortable to me It is a heavy machine so get help carrying it in but you will be glad its heavy when you ride it It is some assembly required but it has fairly clear instructions so there shouldnt be a problem with assembly Happy Hunting 
5 0 Love it This arrived earlier than expected Great delivery company and ours was brought into the house even up several stairs My ten year old son put it together with a little help from dad took about two hours Was a breeze to assemble no problems at all I am so glad to have this It is a great workout and unbelievably quiet Very sturdy and well built I love it 
5 0 Great Value Our Schwinn 430 arrived yesterday four days earlier than expected My husband and I put it together in about an hour and a half and it was relatively simple to do All the parts were packaged and labeled very well and there was an insert with a correction to the instructions on step 2 As for the feel of the machine it s very smooth and sturdy If you re not looking for any fancy electronics and are looking to save some it s worth getting it over the 418 and 438 The pedals on this model are made of plastic not rubber and are cheaper looking and feeling than the other models However with sneakers on you probably won t notice the difference Also the handle bars with heart rate sensors are lower than the other models but they don t feel too low which I was afraid of All in all I m so glad I decided to get this elliptical machine The whole transaction has gone very smoothly and I m working up a sweat already The 18 stride is a good compromise for me 5 2 and my husband 6 and is comparable to the feel of higher priced machines Hopefully the machine will hold up to a lot of use 
5 0 Schwinn 430 Elliptical Trainer This is a fabulous product My advice is to take everying out of the box carefully and layout all the parts One bolt was listed in the instructions incorrectly The bolts included were correct just wrong reference in assembly instuctions I just used process of elimination to figure out which ones to use Amazon emailed me an update to the instructions which I was pleasently blown away from Unfortunatly it was about a week after I assembled the product Completely quiet and smooth opperation Use the feet to accurately stablize so not to stress out the base rails I am combpletely satisfied 
4 0 Great Training Device The Winter is here That means in the midwest at least I have just finished my first season of golf I have topped balls shanked balls and even missed contacting the ball However I was determined to better my game The first Swing Groover II I bought broke I called the stored I ordered it from and they were willing to replace the device I did receive a new Swing Groover II After using the Swing Groover II I must say I am well pleased It has transformed my swing All season long I thought I had a built in draw in my swing I saw many balls going left The Swing Groover II has corrected that and now many of balls are straight Also the Swing Groover II has given my a confidence to go out on the golf course and have the to go where I want it to go The Swing Groover II is accurate I went to a professional and had my swing speed tested My swing averaged 80 85 mph With the Swing Groover my swing speed is 75 80 mph That sounds accurate to me Looking forward to the start of the golf season 
5 0 Swing Groover For the money this is an excellent training tool I as others I see posting have used more sophisticated equipment but found the results to be very close + 5 margin error Many many golfers are in denial about how hard they muscle up to the plate and how far the ball travels I find my driver to travel approx 250 on the course more sophisticated machines and with this tool club speed slighty over 100 with a slice from time to time as recognized with the Swing Groover so it gets my humble endorsement 
4 0 Good Tempo Trainer I recently bought this product and I find it a good trainer 60 br 62 60 br 62 I ve used a much more expensive analyzer at a golf shop when getting fitted for clubs and the swing speed shown on this unit is within a couple mph of the golf shop machine 60 br 62 60 br 62 The yardage shown on this unit seems to be short but when one remembers that yardage is dependent on so many factors type of ball temperature humidity elevation wind one s particular physical state on each day that imo yardage matters much less in practicing than a consistent readout of swing speed 60 br 62 60 br 62 When I bring good tempo to my swing the result is immediately visible on the readout Get off tempo and my swing speed invariably drops Using this analyzer has helped me groove my swing and even add a few mph 60 br 62 60 br 62 The unit is best suited for teed up shots as the instructions discourage you from hitting down on a ball as with an iron And the ball can t be set flush with the quot grass quot 60 br 62 60 br 62 Even with that drawback I ve had lots of fun working on my game with the Golf Channel on and snow flying outside my Montana living room 60 br 62 60 br 62 All in all I m pleased with the product 
4 0 Best Tasting of the High Protein Low Carb Bars Actually the Met RX bars are just as good and the Balance Bars are a tiny smid below Odyssey Bars are great too And the Premier Bars have a great taste The Zone Perfect bars on the other hand taste a bit like plastic to me and they re not even as high in protein and are higher in carbs Before during or after a hard workout or even in between meals these babies really take the edge off that hunger and energize you 
5 0 OMG This is my FAVORITE childhood toy I had one similar to this when I was younger i am now 21 and I still totally remember this toy The one my brother and I had was acutally for 4 people though not for 2 I was so excited to see this I know that many people thought I was crazy when I would talk about my favorite child toy This is it many people did not believe there was such a thing This is also a great toy because it is good fo a child s vestibular system I have an AA in ECE so I will be buying one for my son asap he s still a little too young but as soon as he is 2 1 2 he will have this toy 
5 0 carnival ride in your backyard We are very happy with this seesaw The kids love being able to rotate 360 degrees in either direction in addition to going up and down and sometimes do both at the same time The Kettler beats the other seesaws available on the market hands down and is worth the extra money The only flaw I see is that if their is a significant difference in weight between the 2 kids riding that the seesaw can topple The seesaw also needs to be on very level ground or the same problem can occur 
4 0 Excellent fit comfort and value Nicely designed pair of very affordable gloves they seem to have gotten this right XL a good XL fit they even have XXL which are huge Very nice for the money 
2 0 do you know what gel to use I bought this belt a while ago but could not use it because I have no idea what gel I should get for it It says a water based gel or water Water definitelly does not work Could anyone tell me specifically what gel I need and where I could buy it Ignore my rating since I did not actually used the belt Thank you 
5 0 AbSonic Massage Belt Used properly this microprocessor with its built in timer makes this fitness work out a snap Owned original AbTronic belt that was made of a fine rubber material that conducted the electronic pulses Keep plenty of gel on and fresh batteries and you cannot go wrong 
5 0 great belt the belt has really helped my husband tone his stomach up he loves it and uses it everyday 
4 0 electric sit up sit up while laying down this works well as long as you have enough gel on it 
4 0 Great tool to add to your work out routine I used to have this ab Sonic before and lost it in one of my moves so I had to get a second one it is a great tool that will help you define your muscles in between work out or when you can not make it to the gym because of a last minute business apointment or similar I don t think it would do much on someone who do not work out at all and just think that absonic is a magic wand that would make you gain muscle and loose 20 pounds of fat overnite but I do see results and i see my abs more firm and getting more definition worth to try to the price 
4 0 Great Lack of alternate shipping method to Canada is the only reason I do not give it a 5 stars rating 
4 0 A Christmas present for my husband I bought this trainer for my husband for Christmas He has been pleased He rides an hour and thrity miniutes every night It is fairly quiet Keeps him in shape during the winter months 
5 0 I m sweaty but happy As a resident of the Pacific Northwest and a person new to the sport of triathlon I confronted an unfortunate truth this winter there are not many good biking days after September Between work weather and sun deprivation I was finding it hard to regularly fit in a trip to the gym for a ride much less get on my bike The Minoura hybrid trainer was tops on my Christmas wish list I had looked into other options and the Minoura seemed like a good point of entry The fluid mag hybrid was touted and low noise and road like but the overall cost I still found affordable I have been quite happy since I first unpacked it My observations 1 The instructions were simple and actually written in English a welcome change over the all graphic instructions that are all too common The one point that was unclear was the use of the skewer the crossbar through the rear wheel A skewer is provided but my bike fit fine using the skewer that was already in the rear wheel 2 Once assembled it is quite simple to attach the bike I spend more time getting my shoes shorts and a towel for my workout than I do putting the bike on the trainer 3 The balance and stability are good I have not had any concerns even when listening to an ipod or otherwise not devoting full attention 4 The most important aspect the workout has been exactly what I wanted I m able to get my heart rate up to whatever training zone I want The resistance provided by the magnet is smooth and in proportion to the effort I expend Need to simulate intervals No problem The resistance changes nicely with each shift of the gears When the workout ends my thighs feel it about like they would after a similar length of time and effort on the road 5 The riser block is a nice touch and ships in the same package as the trainer 6 Consider getting a training aid to encourage you to vary the workout Otherwise it s too easy to get in a steady cadence and not vary it through the duration of the workout 
4 0 Minoura VFS Experience The combination of both the magnetic resistance as well as the fluid resistance makes for a trainer that does a good job in creating a true road experience There are no adjustments other than adjusting the trainer to the wheel diameter of your bike As you change gears and the wheel spins faster you experience the resistance you would encounter on the road with the wind pushing you back Even after an hour of moderate speed the fluid and magnetic units only were moderately warm to the touch The heavy flywheel helps add to the smoothness of the ride If you are using a slick road tire the amount of noise generated is relatively small There is some minor assembly required but the instructions are well translated and illustrated Even a 5mm hex tool is included I recommend also getting the riser if one is not included to allow proper leveling of the bike The unit comes with a skewer which can be installed easily on your bike in case the one already on the bike does not fit in the lugs of the trainer that clamp the bike to the trainer In my case the skewer already on the bike Giant worked fine I recommend this trainer as a step up from those with only magnetic resistance and at a price point nearly a hundred dollars below the premium all fluid drive models on the market 
5 0 I love this belt This belt is much more comfortable than those full back styles It seemed too skimpy to hold up my large frame in the water but worked great I got the model with 4 floats but a smaller adult could probably use just 3 This is a very good value 
5 0 Brilliant little light This small flash light is really bright I bought two and am very pleased with the quality and the amount of light that this little light puts out 
4 0 Beautiful piece of engineering This product is well designed and constructed caveat I ve only had it for 3 months I love it The design allows one to arch his her back like doing a bridge stretch while crunching to further isolate the muscle group and provide a more effective work out And working the obliques is easy as turning slightly to one side giving a surprisingly effective workout And it folds up into a compact configuration for easy storage The dark gray mesh looks much better than the blue fabric used on the standard model I would have given this product 5 stars except taxes shipping and handling added fifty dollars to the cost bringing up to 200 A bit pricey but I don t regret the purchase one bit 
5 0 Much better than on the floor I enjoy using this ab device As the advertisement states it gets you off the floor and my back doesn t hurt while doing the workout After the workout you can reverse jackknife and relax which stretches the muscles 
4 0 Ab Lounge Ultra I am very satisfied with my purchase now I just have to find the time to use the product on a regular basis 
5 0 I just love my Ab Lounge Okay I caved and bought one of these thinking I would be regretting my purchase in no time Well how wrong I was It comes almost fully assembled and I was able to unpack everything and attach the cables foot pedals and hand grips in about 10 minutes I like the mesh material of the seat as opposed to the earlier versions that were made with a nylon type matierial The Ab Lounge comes with a nice workout DVD and an instruction book with photos and clear step by step instructions for 8 various abdominal exercises depending on your fitness level I have been using it about 3 4 times a week about 15 minutes each time and I actually enjoy doing my abdominal workouts now It s also pretty comfortable to stretch my back out on this too And the best thing of all it folds up very compact to about 5 inches thick so I can store it under my bed Overall it s just awesome and I am very pleased with my purchase Editing my review to add that the recall was referring to injuries that occurred when opening and closing the chair not while exercising on it I read about the recall when I was deciding whether or not to purchase the Ab Lounge The company has since added some safety features to the new units that have been sold since late 2004 to make it easier and safer to fold up the chair and unfold it If you have an earlier version there is a repair kit available to make it compliant You can read about the recall at the cpsc gov website by entering Ab Lounge in the search box 
5 0 IT WORKS GREAT ON ABS IF YOU HAVE MAJOR BELLY FAT IT WILL REDUCE IT I HAVE LOST 3 INCHES ON MY STOMACH IN 3 WEEKS OF USE I HAVE TRIED MANY OTHER AB EQUIPMENT THEY SIMPLY DONT WORK THIS DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES IF USED PROPERLY I COULD FEEL IT THE 1ST DAY 
4 0 Good The Ab Lounge Ultra works well and is easy to store however the DVD that came with it is faulty and I have not received the replacement requested over 3 weeks ago 
4 0 fun but not for long Ok 1 the instructions are so unless you have a good understanding on how airsoft guns work then i don t suggest unscrewing any screws 2 i also experienced a steady decline in fps as did my friends so i was determined to find out the cause i thought it was some kind of loss of pressure and sure enough i was right there is an o ring that is attached to the bolt and it had slipped off of where it was supposed to go i popped it back into place and after 1 2 hours of fiddling i finally got the dang thing back together there are lots of small parts and spring and lots of grease which doesn t help and it worked like new so if you want to take apart the gun and fix it every month or so then go ahead and buy it but if you don t then don t buy it it s only 35 bucks what do you expect 
4 0 for the guy who wants to shoot pinatas this gun is pretty good and fast its got a short clip so buy another 1 
5 0 Amazing Gun This gun is purely amazing received 3 days after ship dat with standard shipping The gun shoots alot harder than 300 fps I had an airsoft war with my friend and he has bruises from the gun Overall Great Gun Would buy from seller again 
5 0 Great Gun great price I ve been playing airsoft for about 5 years now and after using ics classic army tokyo marui i can truthfully say that this guns feels and shoots no different than the other 300 dollar brands The only difference i notice is that the gun makes a little more noise than other guns No problems what so ever I would however reccomend getting a btter scope the one it comes with is crap P S I am not audre 
4 0 Great4the Money this gun came in 3 days wen i ordered it ive been airsofting4 a while and alot of my friends have Tokyo Maruisand theirs shoot like 300fps and up and thier are consistantly accurate this gun is accurate if you use 20g bbs instead of 12g the 12g are cheaper but when u shoot they go about 22 feet the curve what ever way they want to one thing is that the clip only holds about 30 50 bbs if you try u can fit 70 but i like to fit only 30 or twenty so that i rely on skill rather than automatic i like to play in an orchord lots of trees and i knida wish that the guns orange tip wasnt so bright somtimes i think the gun could use a sling and a sliencer and a real scope the scope that came with is only good for looks and scaring people the sights work way better it hits really hard for 300fps i recomend an upgrade battery and motor so u can play longer and shoot farther it does shoot pretty far as is When in automatic it spools up and shoots harder and really fast I RECOMEND BUYING THE 330ROUND CLIP FOR IT ONLY 30 BUCKS MORE AND IT SAVES YOUR BEHIND 
5 0 IDK ANYTHING i dont know anything about airsoft or bb i just want to shot pinatas with my friends i want to know a straight answer IS THIS GUN WORTH THE MONEY 
4 0 A good quality fitness ball that is very easy to use I purchased this stability ball set used and so far I have been very pleased The ball comes with a foot pump which is very simple to use I was able to inflate the ball in less than five minutes The ball is perfect for stretching a chart of stretching exercises is included and can also be used to enhance core workouts as well as Pilates and yoga One thing I ve noticed is that if I don t use the ball for a few days I need to reinflate it slightly I m not sure if this is a defect or typical of all stability balls but adding the extra air takes only a minute This set also comes with a video called Tone Trim and Tighten Instructor Gin Miller provides an overview of using the ball and then leads a workout which includes a warm up abs work back work a lower body segment wall squats and stretches In the back and wall squat segments only one set of a single exercise is shown the video suggests that you rewind for a greater workout However the addition of the video makes this set a great deal so if you want to give ball workouts a try but don t want to spend a lot of money I definitely recommend this set 
5 0 A great portable table I bought this table about a month ago and have used it a couple of times and I am very pleased with it It stores in a bag just a little bigger than a folding chair it sets up easy is very sturdy and is even adjustable It even looks good Definitely recommended 
4 0 Travel Chair Canyon Table Le Grande The table is great It is light weight compact and will work perfect on my camping and rafting trips My only concern is that it is lightweight but the price if right 
5 0 Excelent bike carrier I have not had any problems I have been using it now for almost two months semi daily It holds the bikes well and does not require that I keep extra bungies I use it on a Ford Explore 
5 0 good bargain This eliptical is NOT as good as the heavy ones you will find in a gym but it s almost as good for the cost it s especially appealing It took about 2 hours to assemble but I m not an expert at mechanical devices so Reader you can probably cut it down to 1 hour nevertheless after two hours I felt an uncommon sense of elation The users of my eliptical are 150 pounds 99 pounds respectively but I m sure it can take up to 250 pounds both of us together perhaps it does move a little I exercise vigorously so it moved about 3 feet this morning during exercising but for under 300 it s worth it Definitely worth it 
5 0 Great workout This is almost a better workout than the treadmill to me I still use my treadmill but this definitely is a total body workout Great cardio workout if that is what you are looking for 
5 0 Easy Machine Although I m not sure that I would call it whisper quiet at least not by my definition it s is by no definition loud I really like this machine It was easy to put together easy to understand display and easy to use There are 8 resistance settings and even setting 2 you can feel the machine working I like that there are no wires or clip ons for a heart pulse monitor simply hold onto the handles and you get that information It is heavy so make sure you have someone to help you get it inside but all in all this machine is a winner 
5 0 Very pleased Cross trainer is excellent in quality Just as good if not better then like excercisors of different manufactures and brands I am quite happy with the price and quality and not to mention the fast delivery 
4 0 Hmmmmmmmm I think this machine is good for starters but can get a little boring at times Pop in a dvd and pump those thighs It is sturdy and didnt take that long to put together clear instructions Doesnt take up alot of room isnt an eye sore in the room and I feel it was a good deal for the price of 199 00 on sale Free shipping didnt hurt either All in all I give it FOUR STARZZZZZ 
5 0 Great Gift Idea I bought this set and the slim pack 25 and mix and matched for a great gift for a friend They really enjoyed the wild patterns and wide variety of flights Pick your flight based upon your mood 
5 0 pedometers I work at a hospital and we needed some pedometers to give out during our National Walking Challenge week WE are encouraging members to walk 10 000 steps a day Hopefully these will be perfect for that 
5 0 Perfect Price Perfect Accuracy A great buy Tested with same accuracy as a 20 pedometer Quiet operation Easy to use 
5 0 Great health device The Sportline bulk pedometer delivers exactly as its branded couperpart at half the price I have been a walker since I got a diabetes diagnosis five years ago and the Sportline unit is reliable and seems to be accurate The bulk model reviewed here is the same device as the one I bought at Target five years ago Functions include the step counter a calorie counter and an approximation of the distance traveled Doctors recommend walking for multiple health conditions and this counter helps keep you honest Great value 
5 0 Gee Sometimes the simplest thing can be the best thing in the world Gee I wish I came up with this gadget I would be a millionaire by now If you want to work your arms abs back just use this EVIL WHEEL everyday Forget about Sit Ups and wasting money on BIG HEAVY machine This Wheel can be used for ANYONE ANY age ANY sex and of course at ANY place Do not worry I will come up with some gadget next time and be a millionaire We all be glad I did it 
4 0 works well enough sometimes For the most part it works as advertised however as I was testing it I noticed that sometimes you can walk by it and the device wouldn t go off If I attempt this a second time however I would be detected I would just suggest for this reason you should buy two to overlap the secured area They re cheap enough for that and give you ample time to armed disarm the 
5 0 Love it There s nothing better than a dishwasher safe durable narrow mouthed water bottle that fits in cupholders 
5 0 great for helping child learn to swim Place the float low in the small of the child s back which will float them more horizontally This position will encourage your child to kick and stroke increasing their ability to swim independently Products like water wings and float jackets will certainly float your child but will hinder their ability to actively swim 
5 0 GREAT ITEM Both of my children ages 6 and 3 1 2 use these same floats in their swim classes at our local YMCA I absolutely loved them I was so glad to finally find them online at Amazon com I bought 2 for use at our local pool and our trip to Florida 
4 0 Super Swimmer This is a great product if your child is learning to swim older children 5 7 age Where the parents are still watching them but it gives them alittle more freedom to learn the strokes needed for swimming lessons It also can grow with your child as they learn to swim the pads come off as needed I have seen these also used in the swim classes that use them Its a confidence bilder for the child 
5 0 It Works I ve had it for over a year but have only used it a few times I haven t gotten sick The water I used it on was likly clean The only warning is making absolutely certain that the threads on your bottle lids are clean and dry which may be difficult It only takes one drop of contaminated water to run back into the sterilized supply I look forward to purchasing the filter cap I looked at the MIOX but the fact that takes up to 6 hours to work on viruses put me off 
5 0 A MUST HAVE FOR EMERGENCIES OUTDOORS This is one of those items that I spent over 100 that was not an electronics gaget or larger item This steripen treats most drinkable water without tablets clorox drops or other additives It uses UV light to make most waters drinkable For example there is usually plenty of water in flooded areas but none that is really drinkable unless it is boiled treated or plain bottle water the water gets all foul by mixing with other nasty stuff that can make sick or even kill you As long as the water did not mix with chemicals than you may have a chance with the SteriPen I have been using it testing it on rain water melted ice water I am happy to say that even with my sensitive GI no problems I even carry an extra in makeshift emergency kit 
5 0 This lightweight helmet fits comfortably while keeping my head cool After too many years without a bike I finally decided it was time to buy one for commuting from work Since the bike cost more than I planned for I wanted to get a good helmet at the lowest price I started by trying on lower priced helmets but just didn t get a comfortable fit When I got to the Influx the fit felt good A month later I m still happy with my new helmet To get a proper fit the straps must be properly adjusted The five simple steps are detailed in the owner s manual complete with diagrams Basically one wears the helmet in its proper position adjusts the Cam Lock adjustors pull the chin strap tight set the geared positioning system GPS and test the helmet s fit It is recommended that after an accident the helmet be replaced as damage is not always obvious Bell offers a crash replacement policy for purchases in Canada and the US costing 35 in the states Excessive heat can damage this helmet store in a cool dry place when not in use Heat damage is indicated by uneven or bubbly surfaces This lightweight helmet provides the protection I need fits comfortably and keeps my head cool The Influx has proved to be a good purchase for me PROS Comfortable fit Vented to keep you cool Provides protection CONS Removable visor can block too much field of vision at times 
4 0 long term use I have had this product for over two years and it has not failed to hold on to my bike yet However my only issue is that the heavy duty plastic straps that hold the bikes on have started to snap off I have lost 3 of 8 straps and there does not seem to be anyway to replace them short of using a home created version NOT SAFE The vendor does not appear to be available on the Internet or sell replacement parts as I need 
4 0 Solid product I have now owned one of these for 5 years is a decnet product It can sway as some have mentioned that is a use for bungie cords 60 br 62 I have used this product fully loaded traveling 500+ miles each way several times and thru the mountains with no real problems The retainers are now showing some age and cracking so I am looking for replacements to contine using the product 
5 0 Love this bike rack I was very afraid to purchase this rack reading some of the reviews but I did anyway and I love it Very sturdy rack as long as you follow the instructions to the T Now I have a two inch hitch I don t know if that means anything or not But I would recommend this rack to anyone 
5 0 Works great After reading all these reviews I was not going to get this bike rack but did anyways And I m very impressed if you follow all of the directions to the T you will have no problems This bike rack is very sturdy I could stand on it and not be afraid of it breaking In spite of what the others say about wobble it does not for me Now I have a 2 hitch and had to use the adapter For the price you can t beat it 
4 0 Smooth Ride Great Inflateable Front and Rear Tires I had searched long and hard for a bike trailer stoller but nowhere could I find mention of this product s front tire So I am writing about it first the front tire is rubber and needs to be inflated prior to use just like the back tires Overall this is a great product for the price It fit my budget and safety concerns The manufacturer details and many reviews say you do not need tools to assemble so it is very easy to put together I found that while it was simple to put together attaching it to my bike was a bit of a challenge You need to bend the tow bar to fit in the coupler on your bike which is difficult the first few times The bug rain cover is tight the first few times as well or it could have been the way I was attching it to the velcro as I was streching it from one side to the other However I think it is good that the material was stiff in the begining as it tends to strech with time and use My son loves to kick his feet up against the screen where the velcro attaches the top and front together it seems to be holding up pretty good The trailer itself is wide and I could not fit it through my door This is largely due to the covers around the wheels I do have an older house so back then they didn t seem to be concerned with door width Most stores have the automatic doors which are more than wide enough I did go to a movie rental chain and the trailer just barely fit I only have one child so bringing the handle bar for stoller is easy but seems awkward if two children are riding in it I have seen reviews mention both children have plenty even with cargo The product comes with a safety strap for the handle bar when using as a stroller not pictured in many shots I ve seen and has brake straps you hook around the tires also not pictured The belts inside are not your typical 5 point harness as the shoulder straps lap belt and crotch straps do not connect in a single point The lap belt must be put on the child first and tightened then the shoulder straps are adjusted to the height of the child and tightened then connected to the crotch strap The shoulder straps are slightly paded but I haven t seen any other bike trailer in this price range that have better padding or any whatsoever I also found out that bike trailers are just like cars every year they have new models so the previous year s model goes on sale If you are going to be an AVID biker who will alternate biking and jogging daily on dirt trails or beaches or will be taking your child ren on weekend excursions through the mountians or rough terrain then this probably isn t the bike trailer for you But keep in mind the next version up is priced that way too the next cheapest I found was over 350 for just the trailer the bike attachment was almost 200 and the stroller kit was just as much 
5 0 Great Stroller Very Nice Stroller Good quality and easy to use turns great Fits two children easily 
4 0 So Far So Good I have had this trailer for 5 days and have used it 5 days in a row 3 days as a jogger stroller and 2 days as a bike trailer It is easy to set up and take down Yes it does take a little time but I am getting good at it I don t feel like you need to be strong to do either We live in an apartment and have to carry this item from our back patio through our apartment to the front so being compact and light was an issue for me since I will be the one mostly using it I am glad we went with aluminum as it is light It does fold down nicely and even with the wheels on I can still get it through the apartment without hitting furniture Pros As a bike trailer it pulls smoothly Easy to put on my mountain bike I feel it is made well and safe My 2 yr old seems comfortable in it and loves the pockets for her treats drinks There is even a compartment for my backpack It is simple to transition into a jogging stroller As a stroller it is light and easy to push until Cons It seems there is not enough weight up front so the front wheel wobbles uncontrollably which makes it impossible to push I have to lift it and then set it down again to get it to go straight I end up jogging with the front wheel held up which is not fun However I guess I could buy a jogger stroller that was really meant for jogging but they shouldn t promote it as a stroller if you can t push it I am going to contact the company and see if there is a way to fix this problem The 5 point harness is no different from other trailers I have seen They do seem flimsy and are a little stiff to attach to the ring Today I got home from a ride and realized the flag was missing I am guessing it flew off when I was going down a hill I hope the canvas holds up There are already two very small holes where the flag is inserted and rubs The rubber on the clasps for the stroller handle is already coming off All in all I am happy with the product for the price Just a few concerns as mentioned above I am not a hard core rider but do intend to use the product frequently so I hope it holds up It seems sturdy and well made but time will tell 
5 0 Happy Babies I bought the trike for my nephew as a Christmas gift I got it baring in mind that his older brother was getting a real 2 stroke fourwheeler from Santa It arrived well in advance of Christmas even though I purchased it a mere two weeks before the holiday The assembly required could have been done by trained monkeys He loves it although his little stubby legs are a bit too short to reach the petals still His parents are now forced to cart it back and forth everywhere they go because Bren refuses to be parted with his trike 
4 0 works great What I like most about this practice net is the easy pop up and twist take down They say it is good indoors too but you will need room Probably best for basement it is bigger than it looks on the box 
4 0 Indoor outdoor golf net This is one of the best nets I have bought It is very easy to set and take down and it sits up without needing any spikes in the ground It great for the garage 
5 0 Wonderful comfort for those long days in a chair I purchased this chair because I sit for long periods watching soccer games and tournaments My back ached from the the portable chairs due to the lack of support in the lumbar section This chair has eased my back pain and the table attached to the chair is wonderful It is easy to carry very comfortable and I recommend this chair I have also used it camping and for tailgating at football games 
5 0 A marvelous tool This kick board is as advertise sleek looking yet quite functional It fits into a regular backpack unlike many kick boards so it s easy to carry 
4 0 heelys i wanted a pair so badly and when all my friends started getting them i wanted them more they are the coolest shoes the removable wheel should be easier to remove though However they are really cool and my pair are coming soon but heelys still rock 
4 0 Great Rower I have never had the need to exercise thanks to great metobolism Recently I decided it was time and began my research to find a piece of exercise equipment for my home At first I was sold on an elyptical but I have minimal room and they take up a lot of space Then I happened upon this rower and based on the reviews here I thought I d give it a try It took me roughly 45 mins to put it together without much effort I have started using it and couldn t be happier It s easy to use and you can either push yourself or pace yourself For storage it doesn t stand up on it s own but easily stores under a bed or against the wall I would highly recommend this product and look forward to years of use 
5 0 Intense Rowing Machine The Stamina 1205 Precision Rower is one of the best I ve ever used My doctor insists on a rowing machine to strengthen my back muscles I have rather sever scoliosis and keeping the back muscles strong inhibits the increase of the curvatures This is a wonderful machine and well suited to building the muscles I need to maintain my health 
5 0 Stamina 1205 Precision Rower Great machine adjustable for different fitness levels and easy assembly Not too heavy and stores under the bed Wonderful addition to my home gym This single machine works several muscle groups for a great full body workout that does not cause injury to joints I love it 
4 0 Serviceable for the money Overall pretty good machine for the money The seat is pretty uncomfortable It might be okay for up to 10 minutes I think it d be better suited for someone 5 4 to 5 8 because I am 6 and the range of motion is not optimal 
4 0 Great rower I bought a used rower years ago and came to work it several times a week I m a busy person so I don t have time for a sophisticated work out routine I just want to work one machine for both strength and aerobic training Rowing is great for this purpose When I broke my rower I started shopping Unfortunately even used rowers are over 100 I struggled with this model versus the smaller ones that stand up vertically for easy storage I couldn t find any reviews on this that addressed the storage question Finally I chose it because it didn t look like I could break it from normal usage whereas the kind that fold nicely seem flimsy Pros This machine is very sturdy It s solid stable and does not rock at all when in use It is amazingly quiet The only sound is the whisper of the pistons I can use it with the TV on normal volume The seat is very comfortable I sat on it for 30 minutes the first time with no discomfort Cons It does not fold collapse or stand up vertically It just sits on the floor It would be very awkward to try to store it under a bed Don t lift the back end too far or the plug for the timer will bend This is why it only has 4 stars The front bumper pads are just stuck on You can t drag it backwards without them popping off The back ones also just sit on there but they face sideways so they won t come off The instructions were difficult My wife and I kept flipping back and forth in the manual to figure out to which bolt each step of the direction referred The work out was great I really like using this machine I only wish I had a better place to put it when I m not using it 
2 0 nice to look at but no good to use I bought one a while back The Blade is not very sharp for starters and needs much work to get it sharp BUT the handle sucks Once I reground the blade I actually used it camping and hiking After using it to chop branches and the like the handle began to wiggle about On checking it out I found that it was held on the the hilt with a small screw and GLUED in place I ended up dumping the knife and got THE REAL THING Now this was in 1995 and I ended up in Arkansas and bought the real knife from the makers of the knives in the movie It at the time was a 800 00 knife All hand made etc and very strong Held up very well and now sits in a case on the wall You do get what you pay for 
5 0 very good this product was shipped just as it said it was with no surprises would recommend th 
5 0 FUN Personal Accessory and Water Bottle This is an upscale designer water bottle top of the line and so much fun The designs Of Sigg s water bottles are gorgeous from the plain solid color bottles to the ones with intricate designs They are simply beautiful I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns thinking it would take more work to maintain These do necessitate regular cleaning I clean mine every day but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun Sort of like my rings glasses and watch I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory reminding me to drink more water making a statement about my values and expressing myself with a special design Yes all in a water bottle Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality made of light aluminum on the outside slightly insulated and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles They are light durable and perfect for any activity Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles just like from the tap Sigg bottles come with several different types of tops I bought the screw top because I don t like sports tops and I don t mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink It is totally leakproof which is important to me The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner I get comments on it all the time What s that I love it The sports top version is ok I just am not a fan as I don t feel like I can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top However for convenience you might prefer it For children there is a cap type top All are leak proof If you are ever unsatisfied with the top you can buy a screw top separately to fit your Sigg bottle Sigg makes their personal water bottle in 6L and 1L in this style I have both I use the 6L for sports activities because they are smaller When I won t have to carry the container I like the larger bottle Sigg also makes a smaller 3L bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people You can buy Siggs in alternative sizes too such as 75L 4L for kids 6L 5L You can occasionally find this bottle in the 1 5L size also Search Amazon for the perfect size Pick a style and pattern you like as this bottle is a personal accessory and should reflect your style The colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on Amazon They are expensive but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health so they are well worth it value wise for me Highly recommended 
4 0 No annual subscription The Sonocaddie is a basic but very accurate GPS range device It does not show the shape of the green or give your position in relation to the fairway or green So if you are in the trees on the right it will only give you the straight line range to the icons shown in the three columns It is very simple to map or edit your own course if it is not in the on line database or you want to change one that is The distances to the front center and back of green using the big green feature are very accurate If you need a meat and potatoes GPS range device with no frills or color then this is the device for you No annual subscription fee is just gravy on top 
4 0 Easy to use Golf GPS Rangefinder No Subscription Needed I just purchased a SONOCADDIE GPS Rangefinder and after going to their website to download my favorite courses the only thing I was able to download were the holes with handicap and para ratings So that meant I was forced to go to a course and attempt to record signicant course landmarks as well as record front and back locations on each green Turns out this process was a whole lot easier than I thought it would be After posting records for about 3 holes I circled back and was really impressed with the system accuracy speed reliablity and readability of this cell phone sized unit Some other key features include the ability to hold settings for 20 courses You can find other GPS units that my be easier to read or include more data relative to scoring or just recording your round for your foursome but I don t think you will find one that is any simpler to operate Not having an annual subscription was another plus for me 
4 0 thick firm support albeit smelly out of the box The foam rubber had a strong sour odor when I received this but after I aired the pieces for several hours outdoors the smell diminished enough that I can do yoga on it without wondering if I am killing brain cells The pieces lock together easily and tightly though the seams strain when I do a down dog pull strongly on them Edge pieces are provided to enable you to construct a neat tidy 3x4 mat with smooth straight edges Handily they re the same size as the colorful foam tiles of my baby s playmat so I can use them to extend his mat into a nice large area also The shipping cost was higher than I expected but the item itself was on sale when I bought it balancing out the purchase value 
4 0 The Little Knife with the BIG width The Cold Steel Spike Tanto is a lot of knife for a reasonable price It is viciously sharp and will remove arm hair quite easily It has a width across the spine of the blade that is unmatched by any knife its size I have ever seen Virtually indestructible The case is excellent if plain This knife leaves very wide wounds in steak I think stitches would be the only way to close the wounds On the down side it doesn t hold an edge very long and its handle is very short and I wear a medium glove Overall this is a knife built for the sole purpose of self defense It is small to make it easily concealable and comes with its own neck chain It is a knife that won t let you down when the going gets tough used in its intended purpose it should be virtually indestructible and wickedly efficient 
5 0 Best forearm workout This device is the best device for working out both your dorsal and ventral forearm muscles I still find it surprising that almost no gyms have this simple yet incredibly effective device 
4 0 no assembly instructions Columbia s Customer service no help Cute boy s bike We are pleased with style color fit However Columbia only provided a general manual on safety fit and technical information on adult bikes they sell Nothing specific on how to put this bike together Most of it was assembled when it arrived hardware in the allotted holes and we did assemble the handle bars training wheels etc Now we just have to do the fine tuning of tightening handle bars with special hex tools tweaking breaks adjusting fenders so they are centered If we had an instruction manual for the specific bike we would be able to make sure everything was assembled correctly When I contacted Columbia s Customer service the only thing they recommended is that we take the bike to a bike store and have a professional assemble I asked if they have an authorized dealer in my area they can recommend especially if something were to fail under the warranty down the road The CS rep said no any bike shop could do it I asked if they send out manuals to dealers and if so maybe I can receive a copy The response was dealers put together bikes all the time and any of them should be able to do it If I bought a 500 mountain bike yes I would probably want a dealer to assemble However in my opinion a 12 inch children s bike should be able to be assembled by competent parents who have a good set of instructions If it s recommended a professional dealer put it together it should be noted on the description in BOLD letters so I know what to expect before I buy 
5 0 WOW I bought this item thinking it was cheap It turns out that i got a different holster than the one shown above the one received was even better it even included an extra mag pouch on the holster it fits my 45 perfectly so i dont think that a desert eagle or anything bigger will fit i d recommend this item to anyone since its such a good dea 
5 0 Awesome holster I bought this a helmet and a leg holster thinking wow its cheap and i bet it is cheap It s great quality stuff It looks better than the image itself 
4 0 Satisfied Cutomer I am really happy with it for the price It was a bit tricky to get adjusted but not as hard to figure out as they say As long as you know those two straps on the bottom are for a belt It seems well built although i havnt had a chance to test it out in extreme conditions yet One thing to keep in mind is it might not be the best for smaller body types I am quite thin and it took quite a bit to get it to fit me I still dont think it fits the way it should but at least its comfortable Ill probably end up modding it to get it fit better SMALLER PEOPLE MIGHT BE BETTER OFF WITH A THIGH HOLSTER 
4 0 LOL oops THe first time i saw this i thought it was a bra = but once i got it it was awsome i like it cuse u can wear it under a coat and pull out pistols like in the movies 
4 0 Lack of Info Ok so I bought this thing and shortly there after realized there was no size listed on the page I got lucky and it works for what I carry However I wish for items like this they would give a little more info It wasnt really all that hard to figure out Very comfortable as well 
4 0 A Little Tricky I admit it s a little tricky to figure out at first but if my 55 year old mother can figure it out then I m sure someone who s been on the police force for 30 years should be able to also For anyone thinking of buying this the long velcro straps hanging down are for your belt After you figure that out you should have no problems I wish it would fit a little more snug but maybe I have some more adjusting to do Over all it comes in real handy 
4 0 Good holster for the price I ve been using this holster for about half a year now and I haven t had any problems with it yet Once you figure out how to attach it to your belt its actually pretty comfortable I did have some trouble figuring out how to wear it also hehe 
5 0 Love this machine Great machine with excellent results Quiet and smooth so there s no problem watching TV while you work out 
5 0 Great Choice I enjoy rowing on a lake when I have the chance and I ve also used the much more expensive concept II type rower I had planned to get a wind resistance type rower like the concept II but when I read the reviews on the Kettler Kadett I decided to give it a try even though I had used a piston type rower before and hated it I m very happy with my purchase The Kadett really is like rowing a boat the motion is very smooth and it is very quiet Assembly was very straight forward just read the directions and look at the pictures to verify The workout is first class and a nice addition to my nordic track 
4 0 Provides a good workout I bought this rower about 6 months ago after comparing different ones Decided to splurge on this as I thought it would give realistic feeling and be durable Overall I like the rower it s built solid and has smooth operation It takes 1 2 hours to put together Unfortunately we were missing a small but important part had to call customer service called on a Friday and got the part Monday In the meantime I was so impatient that I went to Lowes and found a part that would work so I could start using it immediately The only cons about it are the straps for the feet they do tend to come loose after a little while could probably be easily fixed with something else The only other con is the placement of the feet I do wish that I could adjust them a little bit in terms of position Otherwise I ve enjoyed the rower and think it will last many years 
5 0 Terrific Rower You Won t Be Disappointed I bought this particular rower based solely on the great reviews it has received here at Amazon and I was not disappointed This is a fantastic rower It really and truly does mimic a natural rowing motion AND it is very quiet when in use You can listen to music or watch t v and not have to have either one driving everyone else out of the house while you workout I find the rower extremely relaxing for a workout I am a 40+ female and I assembled the rower by myself in under two hours That included putting the rowing handles on the wrong side the first go around Do what everyone else has suggested and lay all the pieces out The hardware is very efficiently packaged in a segmented package so you only need to open the parts you need as you go through each step It really couldn t be any easier to assemble I bought mine through Amazon and the only gripe I had was that Amazon required a signature on delivery and I was not home the first time so that ticked me off because I wasn t aware of the need for a signature Just be forewarned about that if you aren t usually home when your UPS deliveries arrive If you re into rowing for fun and exercise you will love this Kettler Rower 
2 0 Cheaper Elsewhere I found it 30 cheaper on another site I liked the reviews here and shopped around and found a better deal Once it arrived it was a great machine Took an hour or two to put together not a big deal I took it slow and patient and everything fit properly The quality is excellent not thin tinny parts but solid machinery It s whisper quiet so you can enjoy television while rowing It s small when wide open and the arms fold back even farther for easy storage The only problem is the data panel the booklet instructions are in some inscrutable language so I never learned how to use the buttons on the panel That s ok though because it gives you elapsed time and number of reps and I don t really need a lot more data when I m rowing Also the data panel kind of slides on to the top of the machine and sits between your knees If you bump it while rowing it can get loose or pop off But overall this is an excellent machine well worth the money 
5 0 A great rower with a few minor problems First this is a beautifully designed and built machine The rowing action is smooth and closely resembles the feel of rowing a shell It is quiet and can easily adjust to people of differing heights While the machine does have a large foot print when in use it does easily fold into a compact size for storage or to simply clear floor space Due to the quietness of this device it is a joy to listen to music or watch a movie while working out Other exercise equipment I have is too noisy for this As others have stated it is easy to under estimate the amount of exercise you re getting Even though I often end an hour of rowing feeling like I really haven t done much the feeling in my legs when standing up afterwards lets me know that I ve had a good workout Assembly was time consuming but not really difficult As other reviewers have stated the parts are of high quality finish and the fit is excellent The three minor problems I ve encountered were easily fixed 1 on a smooth cement floor the machine tended to drift during a long work out Carpeting or a rubber pad under the machine fixed this 2 The hard plastic handles become slippery when wet with sweat Wearing a pair of cotton work gloves resolves this problem and has the extra benefit of protecting your hands from friction with the handles 3 As shipped the foot straps tend to work loose during exercise This is due to an assembly problem at the factory When the straps are properly positioned they don t slip To fix this problem remove the two screws one in each foot plate that hold the straps in position While you re at it you might want to reverse one of the straps so both buckle to the outside of your feet When you tighten the straps position them so the back of the buckle touches the foot plate This leaves the end of the strap going through the buckle pulling along the same plane as the buckle To loosen the strap pull the end of the buckle away from your foot increasing the angle at which the strap enters the buckle The straps loosen during exercise because the factory setting leaves the end of the strap pulling at an angle to the buckle A very slight change in this angle is sufficient to loosen the strap Note that I didn t try to replace the two screws Replacing the screws with the buckle properly positioned may make it easier to tighten the straps Despite the minor problems mentioned above this is an excellent machine and well worth the expense It clearly deserves a rating of five 
4 0 Kettler Kadet LOVE IT You will too I ll break this review into parts Shipping 1 see previous review horrendous disaster paid for a new machine rec d a trashed used one Sent it back UPS Received 2 New machine via DHL The box was torn AGAIN and some parts came out DHL tried to dump it on the porch but caught them fleeing the scene Everything was new and wrapped in plastic this time so I decided to inspect carefully and see if any damage was done I believe the box damage occurred when DHL picked it up by the edges of the lid This is a heavy box Inspection I unwrapped all pieces and opened the plastic small parts bags Only slight scuff marks were present on one piece of the machine Laid all parts out on the floor and checked them against the parts checklist All parts present and accounted for Assembly After parts inspection it took me 2 5 hours DO NOT use your power screwdrivers as I was tempted to but you might want to get your own socket wrench set and a Phillips screw driver The tools included are Allen wrench a nut socket wrench spanners and a couple of little rods to insert through the spanners I thought these were parts originally The directions are primarily in German with other languages including English or GB for Great Britian Assembly instructions are pictures which can be confusing Cut out the parts list page and keep it as a reference so you don t have to flip back and forth Important Keep all connections loose before proceeding to the next step If you tighten the nuts and loosen them you break the locking feature and Kettler says this is a safety issue Tighten all nuts and bolts BY HAND to feel how firm the connection is Also there is a left and right as well as an up and down to things Study the diagrams carefully The quality of the parts is phenomenal The nuts and bolts are machined beautifully and gleaming No cheap pot metal just fine German steel Ja You don t have to worry about cross threading or stripping everything fits perfectly Caution Pinch points in the arm piston area during assembly do not cut your fingers like I did After assembly I tried it out for the first time it was like heaven The motion is similar to what you see Dr Jarvik doing on the Lipitor commercials during the news where he s rowing across the lake You feel like you re flying and it s whisper quiet What a great stretch It felt fabulous go slow at first to assure the proper rowing form Keep your back straight read the book If you re tall like me 5 10 this is the machine for you Also my boyfriend who is 6 5 and German has PLENTY of legroom to spare when he uses it too Also resistance can be adjusted by turning the pistons it s a little tricky be sure to install with the number 1 on the top The computer has loads of features but haven t checked them out yet After usage I folded the arms up It s very compact when folded I don t see how one can stand it against a wall when folded but I have a small dedicated room for gym equipment and I can push it against the wall in folded position on the floor Allow 65 for the full extended wingspan of the machine when planning floorspace Overall I love the machine I wish Kettler had provided photographs of the finished machine rather than drawings If you don t want to mess with the footstraps loosening during workouts get some black velcro to add on I plan on doing that One final note There is a warning printed on the rowing arms I asked my boyfriend to translate it from the German Here is basically what it says Don t use the rowing arms as a means to support yourself weight as in getting up because the machine can tip to the side It s so nice to have a German around the house You won t be disapointed if you buy this machine I would buy it new rather than used I think you ll love it as it has that true sculling motion as opposed to the back and forth of the cheaper types 
4 0 The rowing motion is like heaven I initially tried to order my Kettler Kadett from a company called Mercantila a k a Rowingmachines com It was a complete disaster and nightmare including some false advertising trying to cover up some mistakes on their part which caused about a month of delays some horrible customer service or lack thereof some false charges and a lot of headaches Eventually enough was enough and I wound up ordering it directly from Amazon which cost me a few bucks more but was well worth it The machine comes mostly disassembled and took about an hour and a half to put together There were a few confusing moments as the instructions are only pictures and no text so making sure you have the right part takes a little extra focus It came with all the tools necessary except an allen wrench which was necessary for one small thing In terms of overall quality it s very high I m not concerned about this thing breaking nor does it rattle or have ill fitting parts That said the housing for the computer is a little wimpy and doesn t attach very securely to the main body as I ve knocked it off a couple times A small piece of tape at the base has kept it firmly locked into place since Some people have complained about the location of the straps on the foot plates I actually find their location ideal although they do tend to loosen themselves during a workout I made a trip down to the store and bought some velcro which I sewed onto the straps It took 15 minutes to do and I now have the best foot straps in the world The best thing about this machine and the reason I bought it is that it REALLY DOES in fact mimic an actual rowing motion When I close my eyes I can actually believe I m on a boat on the water which makes my workouts much more pleasant So for anyone with any doubts you can in fact believe the hype it IS like rowing a boat Additionally all the action is very smooth The seat is very sturdy and comfortable and it doesn t wobble The arms are also smooth and the grips spin freely One other reason I bought this machine is that I m very tall and the Kadett adjusts to accommodate my size It does this by placing the footboards on a center beam that slides inside the central housing This beam can be adjusted allowing my incredibly long logs to get a full complete extension without the seat hitting the end of it s track Although it takes up a lot of space during use due to the outrigger style oars it does fold up to the size of a traditional hydraulic rowing machine in about 30 seconds I keep mine leaned up against a wall and out of the way in an adjacent room and as it s not very heavy it isn t a big deal pulling it out every morning One problem I did discover is that the numbers on one of my adjustable hydraulic pistons is misaligned So it was a minor nuisance to set the resistance initially as I had to do it by feel In preview the Kadette appears to be overpriced compared to virtually all other hydraulic rowing machines But it really is a completely different kind of animal in terms of the rowing action that makes it worth the price tag It still suffers from a slow start as the pistons come up to temperature like any other hydraulic rowing machine but the rowing motion is like heaven 
5 0 Best thing I ve done for myself in a long time The Kettler Kedett rowing machine is an amazing piece of equipment I unpacked mine last night and despite missing a washer and having to wade through 90 minutes of assembly instructions I was impressed from the very start From the solidity and the perfect fit of the parts it is clear that this machine is the product of German engineering I haven t seen anything so well designed in years Each part fits well tightens nicely and still rotates or slides with ease The machine is sturdy sits well on carpet or hard flooring and easily folds into a compact shape when not in use A workout on the Kadett is better than any workout I ve ever experienced aside from rowing or kayaking The motion is very realistic with nothing to distract one beyond the small chirping of the pistons and the occasional knock of the seat against the front of the rail It is easy to close my eyes and imagine myself rowing down a quiet river The entire experience is more like meditation than exercise the perfect way to start or end a busy day After a 45 minute workout I wasn t sure that I had really gotten a particularly strenuous workout Then I stepped off the machine and realized that my legs were like rubber It was that subtle I highly recommend this machine to anyone looking for an alternative to the ordinary The full body workout provided by rowing is a beautiful thing The price is less than most elliptical trainers the unit weighs only 66lbs and it gives your arms a workout too I can t say enough good things about this machine Happy rowing 
5 0 Perfect Coolest bike rack month ever works very well and fits many different types of bikes 
5 0 excellent backpack luggage When I travel I always travel for a week at a time and stay at a condo where there is a clothes washer So taking a lot of clothes is not nessessary This backpack is large enough for 3 skirts 1 pair of capris 6 summer tops 1 zip up hoodie 1 beach towel bathing suit underwear 2 pairs sandals and a bag for personal care products The small detachable backpack is perfect for the liquid bath products and extremly convenient when checking through security at airports By having the two zipped together before bording it is one bag therefore you can have an additional carry on When you get to your seat just un zip the little pack and they both fit in the over head bins and you keep the third bag at your feet The airlines have lost my checked luggage on two different trips taking the joy out of traveling So when I found this piece I knew I would not have to check luggage again unless I wanted to I did not use the big bag as a backpack but I looked at the straps and they are made with quality materials and I know I won t hessitate to use it in that cappacity My daughter is planning a trip through Europe next year and has already asked to borrow mine Shhh don t tell her but she is getting one for her college graduation 
5 0 a great stove the crux has been the perfect canister stove so far heats quickly stays on the canister and packs down ridiculously well 
4 0 great product perhaps a little too much for your average bike overall I am very happy with this product However the lock is indeed quite heavy and I feel the added security is not worth the additional weight The security cable is a nice added feature Although I am not unsatisffied with the product I might suggest getting a lower model instead 
5 0 Great protection and quality I bought this to keep my bike s in my possession when going to the mall bars stores etc There isn t much to say other then the U lock is very hardy and heavy and the cable is a good thickness as well It is also nice that the U Lock comes with multiple keys and the cable comes with a velcro strap to help manage it when riding The visible combination of U Lock and cable alone is probably the best deterrent although if put to the test it looks like they would hold up well Almost all surfaces of both parts are rubberized so they ll resist scratching your bike s paint The clasp to hang the U Lock seems somewhat iffy but I haven t had problems yet Overall if you want a strong U Lock with a cable to keep your front wheel or seat this is a great combo at a pretty fair comparatively price 
4 0 bike lock kinda on the heavy side and big but I mount it on the front fork so it worked ou 
5 0 don t know how we ever lived without it This treadmill is rugged ideal for larger folk weighing up to 300 lbs It is simple to set up and can be used right out of the box no assembly required One of the best features of this treadmill is that it has extra long handlebars which make it appropriate for elderly users as well as younger ones We ve had ours for more than a month and we ve used it every single day since we got it The belt will migrate from side to side if the treadmill is not set on a totally level surface but that s about the only problem and easy to fix My mom almost 90 years old likes it just as much as I do It s a great workout P S shipping is only 19 95 and worth every penny It came via air on Fedex and arrived two days after I ordered it 
4 0 Not bad It s easy to use and there wasn t any assembly required You just basically unfold it and it s ready to go It would be more movable with wheels but it s fine The only thing I don t like about it is you have to adjust the tread every once in awhile It slips to the side sometimes other than that it s great 
5 0 keep things hot At first I loved this thermos for the size and ease of cleaning But everytime I use it I love it more It keeps coffee hot for hours Over 7 hours after filling this thermos with coffee it was still hot enough to burn my tongue It also works great with cold liquids I had ice water in it one afternoon and the next evening when I went to open and clean my thermos there was still ice I was amazed I recommend this product to anyone 
4 0 Budget Zen I almost got Giro Zen But the high price made me think twice Then I came accross this Hex It is not as perfect fit as Zen to me but still comfortable It has similar features as Zen with a lot less price It even has better looking then Zen in my opinion Highly recommended if it fits you 
5 0 Swords Very nice looking and sharp but sword isn t very well balanced Overall I really like these swords especiall since they were very cheap in price 
4 0 Good Alternative Weapon But This is a fine weapon for the average citizen who is not inclined to carry a knife or handgun but it cannot be as effective as a cane or a police baton two other alternatives to consider The cane is perhaps the most innocent seeming yet it has reach advantages over the kubotan and will deal a most damaging strike The above review is a good one but please ignore the advice about sharpening keys and using the kubotan as a flail This is unlikely to provide any real stopping power to a determined attacker The kubotan excels as a loadfist weapon so use it to enhance your hammerfist and punch strikes You can also use the point to stab your attacker s body points and bony targets like the back of the hand can be excruciatingly painful when struck In other words use the kubotan like it was intended to do so Nowhere in any traditional yawara training is it used like a mini flail like the above poster suggested 
5 0 Awesome Thank you so much for delivering the sword on time Great product and awesome speed 
5 0 Greatly Exceeded my Expectations Wow I had to admit that this is indeed a very great sword Most people are selling this sword for 89 99 dollars this sword is only 45 and it is the SAME sword as the other ones for me the shipping was 20 dollars so that makes it 65 total Some people think that since this sword is half the cost of the other ones of the same kind that it might be kind of shabby and poorly made This is not true My sword is perfectly made and it was in pristine condition when I got it The only problem was that there was a small scratch on the sheath but it is so small that it s not even noticable unless you get your face really close to it I highly recommend this sword to ANY sword collector not just Bleach fans If you ARE a Bleach fan you have to get this Seriously you have to get it Do NOT waste your money on the ones that cost twice as much 
4 0 Great value I got one of these about a month ago and have used it several times now Overall I ve been pretty pleased with it Assembly was easy despite the marginal instructions I ve been pleasantly surprised with how sturdy and smooth the machine is Given that I paid less than 200 bucks and got free shipping I had some concerns in those areas As other have said the digital display is nothing fancy it shows time calories distance etc and the machine lacks high end features ultra quiet fan highly adjustable resistance etc But it s relatively inexpensive it works and I enjoy using it It s not the greatest rowing machine in the world but I doubt you ll find a better one for the same amount of money 
4 0 Lives up to its reputation Great rower for the price If you do not want to spend the money on a water rower get the Integrity 3000 I found the assembly easy and straight forward I have used it near daily for a few months and it is sturdy and solid even with my weight The mechanisms are smooth and comfortable Once you get the fan going the resistance works well The display could be more accurate and informative However even without it you know you are getting a good work out 
4 0 worth 200 It s relatively easy to assemble although I did smash my finger pretty good while attaching the elastic cord The resistance is not great even if you pull really hard so it does take longer to feel the burn with this rower compared to others BUT it is only 200 and you CAN get a good workout if you put a little extra time in 
5 0 Great buy Hi I ll try to make this short sweet and to the point Why I Bought it I like to workout about 4 5 days a week but I live in LA and it s sometimes hard to get to the gym if I work late or if there s traffic Also my neighborhood is not so nice so I prefer to avoid jogging at night Enter the Fitness Quest Integrity 3000 Air Rower Assembly If you can assemble Ikea furniture or a coffee table from Walmart then you can assemble the rower You put in about 4 pins and then hook a strap from the rower to a bungie cord under the seat Finito As far as tools go despite what the instructions say all you need is two wrenches Use a socket wrench about 10 at Target or Walmart and you ll be done even faster Quality The rower is of surprisingly good quality for the price It s made of a two piece aluminum frame and feels sturdy At first I was a little skeptical about the chain connecting the rower handle because it looks really small and cheap o But after a 30 minutes of hard rowing I could tell that the chain was more than adequate One reviewer on the Target website said that the chain exploded into a million pieces while she was rowing Maybe she had a faulty chain who knows All I know is that I can row 150 pounds on the weight stack at the gym but there s no way I could shatter that chain simply by rowing As a stress test I even rowed as hard as I possibly could and the rower was fine Performance The performance of this thing is really great The resistance level and smoothness is as good as the cardio rower I use at the gym This is an air rower so the resistance increases the harder you pull Additionally you can increase the resistance by wrapping the tension strap around its base one time before connecting it to the cord under the seat The seat slides very easily and the foot pads swivel to allow your ankles a little more freedom to move Also the rower folds vertically for easy storage When it s folded the rower is about 4 feet tall and takes up about 2 square feet of floor space It easily fits in a closet or in the corner Although it s too wide to fit under a bed Value Great value My buddy has a rower that costs twice as much and the difference is hardly noticeable The performance is great and if you buy the Amazon item you get it tax free and with free super saver shipping I looked at a couple of other rowers mainly piston rowers and nothing even came close to this level of quality and performance for the price Issues The only negative thing I can say is that it is a little noisy even for an air rower For those of you who have never used an air rower the resistance is created by a big fan which makes a whoosh whoosh sound when you row The noise isn t terrible but it prevents you from hearing the TV or radio clearly even with ear phones Summary So all in all I think that this is a fantastic value The quality is great and the performance is fantastic I highly recommend this product 
4 0 overall good board very few bounceouts overall a very good board the only reason 5 stars wasn t given was because when darts are pulled from the board a dust seems to come out with them and can make a bit of a mess in your case 
5 0 i m no pro but this board is great this is my first bristle board so i don t have much knowledge for comparison but i would definitely reccommend it the wires are super thin and are white to help visibility due to the thin wires i can t remember the last time i had a bounce out after a year it still plays really well i did have to modify the back stops a bit so that it would stay tight against the wall and thus remain quiet 
5 0 Great Dartboard Very satisfied with this dartboard The absence of staples the thin wires and the excellent bristle surface make this hard to beat 
5 0 Great board I have played on many boards and this is one of my favorites The bristles are tight and the lack of staples on the rings keeps shots from flying off the board I really like it 
4 0 Cycle for life This is a great fork mount Not only does it look slick but the easy installation and taking your bike on and off the rack is a piece of cake The locking fork mount keeps the bike secure The only problem I ve had is lifting up the clamp sometimes it s closed so tight that it makes it hard to open 
5 0 Super Easy I have only borrowed these tents in the past but finally bought my own The 12 x 12 is actually a 10x10 awning with legs that spread to 12x12 The shade is so easy to put up and the carry case with wheels is super strong You can even put the shade away with the awning still attached A great shade awning 
5 0 Quick Easy Quality I bought two of these canopies to use at an outdoor craft festival after my canopy rentals fell through Purchasing two of them turned out to be cheaper than renting anyway so it actually made more sense to purchase When they arrived they came in nice wheeled carrying cases for easy transportation They went up very easily once I figured out the mechanism which took all of 2 minutes and remained standing throughout the 6 plus hour festival They are sturdy and well made and ultimately I highly recommend them 
4 0 Nice shade tree I am well pleased with this product which is real good construction The joints are what makes it great but be careful that the side brace arms point in instead of out when you put it up to keep from breaking the joints 
4 0 I m pleased with the caps I am very pleased with the swim caps I found on Amazon and look forward to using Amazon during the holidays Thanks you 
5 0 VERY ADEQUATE Good solid quality I have my treadmill on it The mat protects my carpet and it cleans easily Good investment at a decent price 
4 0 50 x60 Home Gym Mat Revew The mat is good however I would recommend a mat that is wider 
5 0 A Useful Product This product stretches the tendon at night while you sleep The pain I used to experience when walking right after rising is greatly reduced after wearing my Thermoskin Plantar FXT I pull it tight enough to feel a slight stretch I am very pleased with this product Also by day I wear shoe inserts by Heel That Pain 
4 0 Simple straight to the point HR monitor Simple yet very effective heart rate monitor I got it for over a month replacing the dBase HR monitor for the gym I ride bike quite a bit so I got the Polar S720 initially I thought it was way too much for a simple HR monitoring If it wasn t for the relatively high price got my for 69 when other brands offer for 40 or less the S120 would get my five star 
5 0 Awesome for the person who likes cardio Great features Love the design Easy to set up and use 
5 0 Exactly what I needed After spending many years using crude methods of determining heart rate pulse counting perceived rate of exertion during many different forms of exercize I finally broke down and considered a HRM I am nearing the end of my marathon training first one and have become more concerned about my proper pace for the race and for training This monitor Polar S120 has been the perfect training aid in that I can easily record and view at a glance my pace for each mile and whether I am training in the proper zone for each run pace long recovery In the past I had always simply timed my runs and figured out my pace after the fact now I get real time feedback It is the best tool for my running no question I am glad I didn t spend more money than I needed to In my research for this monitor I found that not many will record laps miles in my case For runners this is very important The fact that it will only record one session at a time is not significant to me because I will transfer the info into my training log right away and that is less time consuming in my opinion than to look for cord and upload it into my computer If the watch logs too many sessions I might get lazy and not record it in my own journal which is important to record other aspects of a training session that the monitor cannot record whether you are coming down with a cold other current stresses such as work kids traffic dogs which surely makes my heart jump a few beats Another helpful aspect is that I can toggle the info in each of the three lines If I want to do intervals I can set the count up or count down timer for the time I want for each interval and have that showing on the center line or lap time or split time or even the clock It is easy and helpful The manual may seem difficult at first but you really need to just play around with the watch while reading the manual Get your important settings out of the way first just get comfortable and it will be easier to understand Very happy with my choice and even happier that I didn t spend way too much money 
4 0 Works Well This monitor has the basics along with some advanced features I like having the alarms when I go out of my set training zone The logic for the set up of the different screens takes some getting used to just keep using it and it will make sense I had one workout where the heart rate skyrocketed and didn t read quite right otherwise it has worked perfectly I use it for biking and running The only reason I didn t go for the 150 is because I already have a bike computer that I like 
5 0 Invaluable training tool Best bang for the buck of any model After trying many heart rate monitors I decided the S120 provided the best array of features for my needs I also considered strongly the S150 however I don t have as much information available instantly speed distance time heart rate etc as I do with the S120 and my CatEye Cyclocomputer The S120 lets me target my heart zone and helps keep it within my training range for the day Also when I am done with my exercise set I get a report on date length of exercise average heart rate and maximum heart rate Unfortunately the S120 has been discontinued I haven t found any in the current lineup that come close to providing the features I find most useful One warning I d like to share is that when the batteries need replacement send them to the factory service center I think there are three in the US I bought one on ebay that was used and after a swim I noticed the crystal fogged up I sent the unit to Polar for service and the PC board on the unit was destroyed because the battery was replaced incorrectly Yes Polar battery replacement is pricey but it is certainly less expensive than replacing the whole unit as I will do now And yes I am going to buy another S120 my third one in all 
1 0 Igloo cooler It would be greatly beneficial for you to include the measurements of the coolers you advertise I find it necessary to find the item at another location to obtain the actual measurements Measurements are always important to boat owners 
5 0 A very fine yoga block This block is just what I wanted for my yoga practice I use it at home and I also bring it with me to class It s the perfect size and it s sturdy even though it s a foam block as opposed to wood Certainly a fine block and a great price 
5 0 Good quality item Super easy set up and take down Compact and appears durable Good to have the cloth pillowtop which is like a thin mattress pad I would recommend this product 
4 0 great knife just too big I recently decided I wanted to retire my current swiss army knife a wenger standard issue I thought it would be cool to move up to a knife that had a few more functions but still not too many The Centurion had a regular phillips screwdriver and a flat awl unlike the standard which just had a small flat head that could handle phillips screws and the awl without the sewing eye This Knife is HUGE Which was my main problem I wanted to have a knife that I could carry in my pocket and not weigh me down This knife was too large for my taste I would have needed a sheath to carry it in and I m not the utility belt type I ve already got a leatherman super tool and if I wanted weight on my belt I d just wear it on there The blade was much larger that my standard living up to the folding machete claims but the locking blade and locking bottle opener screwdriver are nice features That being said this is a nice knife The blade was sharp it was very light and it felt comfortable in the hand I wasn t crazy about the composite scales they did feel kind of cheap compared to the alox handles of my standard so I don t know how long they would hold up over a long period of time This knife is more suited for residing in a pack for outdoor activities like hunting fishing hiking or camping but it is just too much for a every day carry item I ve also read that in some areas the blade violates concealed carry laws In conclusion this is a great knife but not really suited to my purposes 
4 0 Excellent Product The blade is heavier slightly thicker than the little red knives and the size feels good in the hands Great to throw in the glove box or the small tool box I can t vouch for the long term durability of the synthetic handle material it feels light but appears to be strong I wouldn t want to chop wood with it but for small jobs like boxes it works well I haven t tried the screw driver tools but they are nice to have in a pinch 
5 0 dannideniese2002 I bought this as a christmas gift for my husband He absolutely loves it It s a great knife 
5 0 good grip I gave this as a gift and he uses it all the time The molded grip fits just right and the tools are useful without making the knife too bulky 
5 0 Great Knife for the Price Although I am overall satisfied with the knife the appearance is somewhat disproportionate feeling What I mean is that at first glance the main locking blade seems a little dainty slim and frail but upon further inspection you will see that the blade is plentiful thick and the metal feels strong and hardened well I attribute this to a simple design oversight that pairs the new curvy body with the old straight blade design Some curve and design in the main blade which the new one handed opening eyelet designed knives by Victorinox implement would make the overall feel more satisfying to the eye Overall construction has a well designed feel that is expected with Victorinox but I am not sure that a locking bottle opener is totally necessary even if the large flat screwdriver head is on that tool The blade is razor sharp right out of the box and feels good to hold in your hand A sheath would have been a nice addition even if it meant to add a couple bucks to the price but that might just have to be an aftermarket purchase for those requiring one For the price this knife is a great buy 
4 0 Swiss Army Knife I m not very familiar with knifes but it looks good to me I just think the appearence of the knife could be a little better 
5 0 Very Nice Knife I am pleased with this knife The main blade was sharp and the other tools work well I think the handle feels on the cheap side I was expecting the knife to be smaller I didn t read the description carefully Overall I would recommend this handy knife 
5 0 Perfect for Me Over time I ve found that I can t stand treadmills elliptical machines stair climbers etc But for some reason I can sit on a spinner stationary bike for 30 minutes not care about time so I decided to get a trainer for my mountatin bike instead of a dedicated stationary bike I searched the net for a week decided that I wanted one with variable resistance I chose this one got it for about 140 shipped with the riser block the handlebar shifter The unit is designed well It holds my bike well The resistance levels are very adjustable when combined with the speeds on my 21 speed mountain bike I can easily fine tune the tenstion level from effortless to very difficult One thing to mention I have knobby mountain bike tires As others had said about trainers the units can be noisy because of the tires Mine was fairly loud but didn t bother me However since my wife works out at the same time she found it annoyingly loud After the first 30 minute session my tire was noticable worn there were rubber bits on the floor The trainer will wear out terrain tires I got a comfort tread tire for dedicated use on the trainer It is much quieter but not silent My wife is much more pleased with this tire as she can hear her MP3 player or the TV while she is working out 
4 0 Great Trainer Great Price I have only had one issue with the trainer my tire slips spins faster than the trainer at times as I increase my pedaling effort I need to make a few more attempts at adjusting the pressure as this might be my fault Otherwise it s been great Came assembled very easy to setup and adjust The adjustable resistance is great Combined with the 14 speed you get a huge range of resistance from very easy to quite difficult This is my first trainer so I don t have any baseline to compare it to but I would recomend this to anyone especially novice intermediate bikers who have long snowy winters to deal with like we do here in Michigan Great Product 
5 0 Compact staff was not PACKED compact The product was great and fortunately did arrive ok This was the second pole of this miodel and I searched quite a while to find a supplier I was happy to find it on Amazon It is the most compact staff available and it works great as a camera monopod HOWEVER apparently the packer did not realize that it needed to be folded up for shipping He tried to ship it wihtout compacting it see picture It was in a HUGE box and during shipping the tip wore through the box and was sticking out at least 6 inches Your packing staff needs more instruction on this item 
5 0 Tracks compact travel staff Great product Sturdy light and easy to use Worth the price 
5 0 Excellent Whistles When you need enough to go around these durable whistles do the job 
2 0 Not good This item was purchased as a gift and I was very unhappy when I received the item The box it came in was very bent up and the top of the box would not even close properly The flashlight was missing the cord to hang it from and it was hard to get to work after following the directions I would not buy this product again 
5 0 A light that shineth into the darkness The quality on this item is acceptable It looks like it will hold up well I have never actually had to shake it because it gets shaken so much during delivery that the battery in it is pretty well charged up As far as brightness I would say it is about as bright as a AA battery flashlight Everyone should have one for emergency because it is always ready to go and you do not have to go looking for batterys for it You have light so you can go looking for a better flashlight I did look around on the auction sites and found one they were selling for a slightly better price It does make a good gift because people have not seen them before They are usually real happy and say they will put it in the glovebox or whatever 
5 0 Aluminum vs Wood If you find yourself having to use your kubotan chances are it will be in a critical situation Traditionally kubotans are made out of a durable hardwood However I chose to get one made out of hardened aluminum for added reliability Hardened aluminum will not break in the event that you have to use it to put pressure on someone s wrist I think it s safe to say that the person s wrist bones would break before this little metal rod does A friend of mine who studied martial arts used to carry a wooden baton like this one If he still carried them today I am convinced that he would choose an aluminum one though MY FRIEND S TIP Here s a tip from that old friend of mine The keys themselves are a part of the weapon And you can make them more effective which will increase the damage from the baton Take some keys that you no longer use Any metal key would do but try to find different sizes About four of them would do Take the keys to a grinder and sharpen the teeth of each key Now put the four keys in the keyring along with your regular keys Face the sharp keys in opposite directions Meaning two should face one way but the other two should face in the opposite direction The idea is that when you swing the baton like a flail the sharpened keys would cut into the attacker s flesh The keys are faced in opposite directions so that you can do major damage regardless of which direction that you are swinging CITAN S EXPERIMENT Please keep in mind that you can also cut your hand I tried this technique I wore a pair of leather work gloves and swung against a wooden post The sharpened keys bounced back and hit the back of my hand Without the gloves my hand would have gotten badly cut For what it s worth I swung against a large watermelon and the keys didn t bounce back though I don t have anything else to add here except maybe it might be good to swing against an attacker s fleshy parts to prevent the keys from rebounding I m not an expert though But it was fun trying it on a watermelon 
5 0 Do not underestimate Come on what good is a 5 inch stick on the street The answer is plenty Many people who would turn their noses up at a pocket stick wouldn t hesitate to defend themselves with their knuckles You might see people like this walking around in bandages splints or casts because hands are soft with small bones and heads have big thick bones and are full of teeth But even the cement heads of street criminals don t fare well against hard metal A good hammer fist with one of these will cause even a tough guy to see fireworks and canary birds As I wrote in a review of another pocket stick Let s not kid around This may be touted as a nonlethal weapon and it may or may not look better for you if it turns up in a search or in court than say a knife or a gun but the purpose of this or any effective weapon is to harm an attacker until he cannot attack anymore It can injure maim or kill just as surely as a bullet just not so easily So before you bonk someone s coconut with this little item make sure you consider the moral spiritual and legal consequences This brings up another vital point Salesmen martial arts instructors and your lawyer may be well advised to call this a defensive weapon Fine but out there in the world there is no such thing Calling this a hesitation stick and showing judo masters using it as a submission tool for fancy joint locks just distracts from what you will be doing with it if God forbid the need arises And that is bashing a criminal assailant until he is unable or unwilling to continue his assault preferably before he ever gets one shot in on you Assisting you in this purpose is the pocket stick s handy size and shape You can stick it in a back pocket like a pen and have it out and attack with it quicker than any weapon I know and the chances are relatively good that your attacker will never see it and will literally not know what is hitting him This is especially advantageous if two nasties are closing in but haven t struck yet You can hit first and then see if the second punk wants to step over his buddy to face one on one odds While he s thinking it over you can run As you can see this is not what is usually called a defensive mindset I d take the keyring off because it s in the way I really don t see the point of hanging keys on a weapon Is it supposed to make us think it s not really a weapon so that we feel better about ourselves No thanks Anyway mine s in my back pocket next to my wallet 
5 0 Great for travel I bought this for an international trip It was GREAT for the 9 hour flight I put it on my seat and was really comfortable for the flight The size was just right for the airline seat too Then we spent much of our trip on a tour bus which had hard uncomfortable seats So I used it again on the bus It was great either as a sitting cushion or for my back It didn t work for lumbar support but just to pad my back in the bus seat Of course the fact that I could roll it up during travel was perfect 
5 0 Smith and Wesson Flash The product is great Small bright easy to hold a tad heavy but not enough be an issue I recommend it A good defensive product also 
4 0 Larger than anticipated Larger than I thought Too large for my needs Had difficulty assembling due to strength issues need more compact privy Great when size unassembled as well as assembled is not an issue 
4 0 Cabana Shelter Worked good for a shelter to put a porta potty for the ladies of the camp but was not strong enough to hold shower bottle We used a 4 gallon bag for showers but tried filling 1 2 way The shower bag was still way too heavy We had to deal with some crazy wind and the shelter survived It laid down a few times but stood back up when wind laid a little I am happy with the purchase but will probably build a rack out of PVC pipe to support a shower water bag 
5 0 Great Outdoor Bathroom Shelter is well constructed and can be securly fixed to the ground so you are not exposed to the world when a breeze comes along that attempts to blow it away A folding rack placed in the interior keeps clothes off the ground It has a small interior pocket large enough for soap and small shampoo bottles Overall a well designed item 
4 0 Good produce a little small though Good shelter tried it out as a shower this weekend Only problem was dressing after a shower no room for keeping clothes dry Good head room thoug 
5 0 Great product On those hot summer days these bandanas really do help a person stay cooler I love having them when I mow the lawn and the weather is miserably hot 
5 0 Great headlamp This is a great headlamp I am a sheet metal worker involved in new construction and have used several headlamps Lighting is always a problem in the latter half of a job when the walls have been sheetrocked and the lighting has not been turned on Whether looking for a tool in the gangbox or searching rooms for material having the headlamp on my hardhat is a definite plus This model is either on or off it does not have colored beams it does not have flashing modes stuff that may be useful to somebody but not in construction 
4 0 Fun but not as much fun as the bigger ones The light is better for using as a personal source of light The other larger ones I got are GLARINGLY brighter and lots of fun 
5 0 Good Value This product is very good for getting a golf specific workout if you don t have very much knowledge of workout routines and exercises I saw it and scoffed but figured i d give it a try I found out that I was definitely not in as good a shape as I would like to think I havent checked recently but last time i looked all the stuff that comes with it without the cd would be around or over 60 bucks anyway Two thumbs u 
5 0 Great For Kids This Soccer Ball was a great idea My daughter is 6 and play soccer and all of the girls on her team love the ball The parents have asked me where I got it from because their daughters want one too The kids love the ball so much that it makes them want to do more stuff with it This is a great ball for the younger kids 
4 0 This ball is a lot of fun I got this ball because I want to lose weight and get in better shape I also think it s fun to bounce on This Bell body ball comes with a foot pump and a video led by Mindy Mylrea I like the video a lot and have been using it with the body ball regularly but the pump needs work Ours broke before we finished pumping up the ball so we had a hard time getting it completely inflated I think one of the valves came loose Other than that though I ve really enjoyed using this product Bouncing on the ball makes me feel like a kid again and when I work out seriously with the ball I can definitely feel the progress This is a cost effective way to get back in shape 
4 0 Decent ball but a little larger than advertised Though advertised as 65cm once fully inflated I measured it as 71cm This isn t a problem unless you are in between sizes like I am I have a relatively short 31 inseam for my 5 9 height I probably should have opted for the 55cm Otherwise this is a decent ball It holds air adequately I only have to top off with air once every few weeks I also like the neutral pearl color which is much better than the super bright colors of other balls out there 
5 0 Relaxing the back I bought this to stretch my back out Works just fine 
5 0 No problems No problems to report I got this for my husband use who is 5 10 and about 180 lbs He hasn t had any issues with it so far Haven t measured it to see how large it inflated to but it seems to be fine 
5 0 GREAT KNIFE THIS KNIFE IS WELL MADE I RECEIVED IT AS A GIFT FROM MY BROTHERS THE COMPASS DOESN T WORK WELL BUT THE KNIFE IS GREAT IT WAS MADE WITH GOOD QUALITY 
4 0 Came fast great quality Came like a week after i ordered it combat ready blade came with some survival stuff in the handle matches fishing line + hook stuff like that The only problem is the compass in the handle was rattling around the box before i even opened it I glued it on with ease 
2 0 HUH Why not just take up belly dance This machine uses some of the same principals but you ll get a safer better total body workout belly dancing Check your gym for classes or buy an instructional DVD 
4 0 Its wonderful It really twists your entire body especially you feel it near the abs and the stomach it s worth buying 
4 0 Doing the bally twist The Bally twist board is better than I thought I ve only had it for a few days but I like it a lot It s easy to use and feels pretty sturdy Do I recommend it Yes if you want a cheap and easy way to exercise 
4 0 meant for people who exercise This stuff is packed with energy So if you don t workout be very careful when using it as a meal replacement It s not the best tasting and somepeople maynot like the texture but i ve grown used to these bars and they ve been an essential part of my exercise routine when i haven t had a meal for a while before the activity Do not store these bars in warm areas like your pocket while hiking on a hot day they will become sticky and disgusting 
5 0 Great running socks for a low price I ordered 6 pair for me and 6 for my husband He loved them so much I ordered another 6 pair for him and 6 for myself I wore them to run a marathon on Maui and had no blisters at the end of the race They got soaked everytime I went through the aid stations and my feet never felt wet They are very comfortable no seams to bother me Some pairs came with what was called grab bag logos I don t know what the logo s are and really don t care cuz who looks at sock logos anyway 
5 0 Great Buy Compare the quality of these socks to the 7 11 A PAIR not for 6 pairs at the local running stores The only draw back is the mfg gets to choose the colors Still a great buy 
5 0 Excellent quality This was a very good deal on Coolmax socks I will definitely purchase them again 
5 0 Jansport makes a terrific product I ve used Jansport bags since elementary school and continue to use them to this day I ended up using this particular bag not for books but rather as an alternative to a traditional carry on piece of luggage Its also comes in handy for the occasional overnight stay at a hotel where a normal piece of luggage wouldn t be practical My only compplaint was that Amazon s method of ordering was not very user friendly when it came to picking the color I selected black w balck suede but eneded up recieving a color I did not choose black w brown suede It still looked fine and I kept it rather than go through the hassle of returning it for the correct color 
5 0 Definately the right back pack I got the back pack in time but I selected the wrong color so I shipped it back and got my money back no problem there either 
5 0 Awesome Backpack JanSport Backpacks w the suede leather bottoms are great They last a super long time My husband had his for well over 15years using it from highschool to college to my son using it for school We have tried several others for my son daughter but have found that although the price is higher for a JanSport it is worth it for the amount of life we get out of them Great product 
5 0 This is a wonderful backpack I bought a similar backback almost 3 years ago Jansport with leather bottom it only had one backpocket though It lasted me up until last month the back pocket started to tear near the zipper at that point I wanted to replace it with the normal Jansport backpack without the leather bottom but when I went to the retail stores to check them out they didn t feel like quality of the one I had before I m so glad I bought this one to replace my backpack It is such a sturdy backpack It s even better than my previous backpack because it has an extra pocket in the back and the pockets are larger The texture of the backpack also feels stronger The price on amazon is also very good I saved a great amount over buying at the mall Perfect for a college student even with a full load of books 
4 0 Excellent for Keyring but don t lend I m replacing my handy dandy little Signature knife after 4 years Nothing matches Victorinox quality The blade in the knife and scissors cut through the toughest package tape Though small this knife is not a toy However DO NOT LEND THIS KNIFE OUT TO ANYONE I made that mistake and the first time it came back without the pen and the second time w o the tweezers Under normal use I never found those parts fell out or were easily lost I can only guess that they were tempting to play with and one friend wanted to see if the pen was replaceable it s not and the other just used and lost the tweezers After 4 years of frequent use the casing is starting to break so I m getting another My only complaint is that I have to remove it from my keyring when I fly 
5 0 Best Price Found I shopped around for quite awhile this was the best price I found This is the same football that is sold in sporting goods stores when you can find it in stock for at least 30 more 
4 0 To cute to pass up It is a cute little gadget not always a super picture BUT when it is tuned in it is awesome for being so small 
4 0 Absolutely cool but reception so so This TV wrist watch is more like a wrist TV with a rudimentary time date piece at the top The TFT active matrix color that s right color screen measures about 1 5 diagonal There s no speaker on the watch instead you listen in via the included special earphones The earphones are special because the cord also acts as the TV antenna so in order to watch TV on this thing you must use the included earphones I got mine from a website called shentech dot com I m not affiliated with them in any way Just sixty nine bucks only You should know that NHJ went bankrupt last year that s why the TV watch is on clearance now What a pity It s so cool Yeah it s really cool to be able to watch TV on a watch The TV runs off a built in LiIon rechargable battery which can last over an hour probably close to two hours Recharging the battery takes around 90 minutes when connected to the AC You can also recharge the battery using four AA batteries or you can power the TV using AC or four AA alkaline batteries The TV watch really comes in two pieces the TV unit and an ugly plastic base with wrist strap attached But NHJ also includes a neckstrap very thoughtful of them as watching TV on your wrist can get tiring The problem is reception is just not that good No you can t hook up cable or a DVD to this You just have to live with over the air OTA broadcast signals The earphone antenna is rather weak in picking up the signals It helps if you are situated close to the TV broadcast towers or live on high floors The reception is also very direction dependent and sometimes if you hold the earphone cord in your hand it may help Overall the reception on the TV is quite disappointing but works if you are willing to experiment with different positions The TV tuner can tune in to channels 1 to 64 but due to the reception limitation you proably will just get a few channels to look acceptable For me the Jerry Springer channel appears the best so I can watch 2 hours of Jerry Springer on my wrist every day Not bad Anyway this is absolutely the coolest gadget in the world and the price is really great Just don t expect warranty repairs if yours breaks 
4 0 The Best and ONLY TV Watch I m up and down with this thing but it s still the best one out there It charges via a docking station that plugs into an outlet That s a 90 minute charge for one hour of viewing That mini docking station can also be battery fed and connected to the watch to make for a much longer viewing experience It fits just like a normal watch and takes up just as much space The headphones double as the UHF VHF antennae so if you hate those two little buttons that keep falling out of your ears as much as I do you re kind of out of luck in trying to use your ultra cool stereo headsets Until I figure out what to do next I just fit the buttons inside the headset cups and it works fine The reception and the headpieces keep the elusive fifth star from making it s appearance here If you think you re going to watch your favorite shows in a basement or on the train forget it Otherwise all local channels show up sweetly and crisply with only the most minor intermittent fluctuations 
5 0 Great service and good product It is larger and heavier than it looked on line It is able to hold my grandson s wooden sword he uses in his karate class 
5 0 Dragon Sword Stand I purchased the Double Dragon Sword Stand for my 16 year old grandson He is into all the Japanese and oriental items and dragon items our one of his favorite He was very pleased with the stand and thought it was quite unique It is displayed in his room with the sword we also purchased for him 
4 0 Great detailing I bought the stand for my son s dragon katana and it works beautifully The detailing on the piece is outstanding It could use a little more weight in the base for balance when in use 
5 0 Aero Pilates Pro XP555 Reformer I have been doing mat pilates at home for 2 5 years and really wanted a reformer to make my workouts more fun or at least interesting I first purchased a reformer from Costco for about Horrible quality and no one would answer the phone for the 10 days that I called them Took it back I purchased this from Amazon after some research into both quality and price The free shipping made it an easy decision although it did take over two weeks This is a very sturdy piece of equipment It does not fold or collapse so you do need a lot of space for it I am happy with the quality of the unit One of the DVDs that came with it was poor quality I called the 800 number and they replaced it quickly with no questions I would definitely recommend this for someone who is starting out in pilates I don t know about experienced reformer users since I am not one I can tell you that after 2 5 years of mat pilates 3x per week I am finding the level 1 workout challenging which is a good thing I think 
5 0 Excellent Product For Price A very solid and well built substitute for the more expensive reformers Although there are a few differences in the convenience of certain features or rather the lack of them for me they re quite compensated for by the large difference in price between these and the ones by Peak Pilates Balanced Body and other companies producing traditionally designed and built reformers a difference of hundreds or thousands of dollars depending on the other model My few minor issues 1 The metal T bar does lower out of the way althought there are only the 2 adjustments up and down It also doesn t lower or rise easily I had to thump mine into place 2 The headrest also adjusts although again to only 2 positions up a couple of inches and down 3 Winding the ropes around the hooks on the sides to adjust their length for various exercises is a bit time consuming The more expensive reformers have much more easily and quickly adjusted nautical type cleats 4 The padding is adequate but not as comfortable as yet again the more expensive models especially for me the shoulder rests 5 The footbar does adjust angle either straight up or angled back forward but doesn t lower completely out of the way Instead you remove it when needed Like when you want to use the included jumping board actually a nice little trampoline accessory Also this isn t an issue for me but it might be for someone else this reformer uses 4 heavy duty bungee cords for resistance rather than springs The bottom line is that with this reformer and the box accessory I bought separately I can do almost every exercise in Ellie Herman s Pilates Reformer book without feeling like my reformer is wobbly unstable or a distraction in and of itself And I saved a lot of money For those of you wondering there are only 3 exercises in that book I can t do with this reformer The Rocking Swan and the Grasshopper because the footbar angle doesn t lower down far enough and the Round Back reverse knee stretch and its variations because in that exercise your hands hold the frame of the reformer and of course the Aeropilates doesn t have side frame boards to hold Hope this helps 
5 0 This is a great piece of equipment I cannot believe the difference that the manta ray makes for my workout It evenly distributes the weight It is totally comfortable I haven t had a bruise since I started using this I also like having my own to use at the gym My gym has the foam ones that smell pretty bad You can t go wrong with this device 
5 0 Great product This thing is great for doing squats The shape conforms to the neck shoulder trap area nicely and actually distributes the weight across your back more evenly much moreso than those round pads or the bar alone Very comfortable on your back so you can focus on pushing the weight Another thing I really like about it is that once you center the pad on the bar it pops right on and off you know for sure your body is centered under the weight so you re not teetering The plastic is flexible and soft enough so that it s comfortable and it s super easy to clean 
5 0 Simple and perfect It is light weight enough and does exactly what it is meant to I m very happy with this purchase 
5 0 Great Reiki Table This table is great for Reiki The table is sturdy and light weight making it great for traveling Since I do most of my business in my clients home I was looking for a table that would be easy to load and unload into my car 
4 0 good table Good quality comfortable easy to fold and unfold light weight good value The legs are rather lightweight so would probably not be good for heavy use by heavy people But for me it s great 
4 0 Works for me This table works just great for me I do Healing Touch and the people that have used this table say it is very comfortable 
4 0 Good massage table if it fits your needs I found this to be a good table for my personal needs at a fabulous price I shopped all over the web and this is definitely the best deal It s lightweight because it s a little short and skinny I prefer it short and skinny so I can store it easily in a small room Check the measurements to make sure it s long enough for what you want I like extra extra smooshy padding so I added a cheap foam pad from Walmart over the table and put a twin size sheet over that but you wouldn t have to do that if you like a regular massage table feel I don t use it as a portable table so I m not sure how convenient it would be to take down and up It is probably better as a personal massage table not as a professional table I have a larger table in my office where I work Hope this helps 
4 0 Therapy to Go I have used this table for 9 months with my very busy mobile therapy business It is a great table because of its light weight and slightly smaller size The face slot is comfortabe but my only complaint is the foam as it does start to compress after heavy use I would be a good table for personal use and for moderate professional use 
4 0 Good jogger All in all it is a good stroller My only complaint would be the seatbelts They are a little weird especially for a toddler 
4 0 Nice stroller and a good value I ve had this stroller for a couple of weeks and so far I m pleased with it My older kid is 3 and the younger one is 3 months Both seem to like it I ve had a single seat Bob sport utility stroller for two years and here are some comparisons that might be useful The InStep is much cheaper I got it for 80 paid 200 for the single Bob I think it s a better value for the money though the Bob is clearly better built and probably more durable more on that below The InStep is much heavier even taking into account the single vs double frame The Bob has an aluminum frame while the InStep uses steel I ll need to be careful not to leave it out in the rain as I have done with the Bob The InStep has an inferior construction to the Bob fabric is thinner appears less durable quick release on the front wheel is of lower quality consequently it takes more work to adjust the wheel to keep the stroller going straight the Bob s is more like what you d find on a quality bicycle with fewer centering issues On the other hand I prefer the InStep s quick release mechanisms for the rear wheels to the Bob s the handbrake doesn t work as well as on the Bob perhaps due to the InStep s greater weight perhaps not The handle is plastic though quite solid It s easy to use from either hand though it s oriented to the left one the canopy doesn t curve downward as it does on the Bob As a result the kids tend to get some afternoon sun in their eyes even with the canopy in place I ve fixed this by safety pinning some fabric down from the edge of the canopy The InStep s parking brakes are separate from the hand brake and engage using cogs attached to the rear wheels whereas the Bob s parking brake just locks the handbrake This has the advantage of 1 being more secure and 2 not loosening the handbrake cable over time The disadvantage is it takes slightly more effort to engage than the Bob s handbrake lock As noted in the other reviews the InStep s seats are very reclined even at their steepest settings however my kids don t seem to mind this at all In fact for sleeping the InStep may be more comfortable The seats themselves are smaller than the Bob s but that s to be expected on a duallie of this size Speaking of size the InStep is obviously much wider than the single seat Bob It won t fit through narrow 30 doorways but that s exactly what I expected based on the published dimensions which are similar to other dual strollers It fits just fine in the trunk of my car VW Golf when I remove the wheels One advantage of the increased width is a more stable stance on sloped terrain On some of the steeper driveway aprons I find the narrower Bob near its tipping point not so with the InStep The ground clearance on the InStep is much lower than on the Bob When I descend tall curbs the bottom often scrapes a bit But since the bottom is free to lift up unless you re in the habit of carrying heavy stuff underneath there s no real damage The InStep has shock absorbers nice but they re much stiffer than the Bob s Perhaps they d be perfect for two heavier kids but with my kids combined weight = 40 lb it seems a tad too stiff The little pouch attached to the handlebar is a nice addition on the InStep missing from the Bob As noted by other reviewers the straps on the InStep take more work to secure and remove The Bob is clearly superior in this regard though I don t see it as a huge factor given that I strap the kids in run for an hour then unstrap them The Bob has three 16 wheels whereas the InStep has a smaller front wheel I was a bit concerned about this when I bought it but after going running with it several times on pavement I see no problems with the smaller front wheel If anything it makes the stroller slightly easier to pack into my trunk For off roading the smaller wheel and low ground clearance might be a problem but that s not a concern for me right now Overall the InStep was a terrific value and I would highly recommend it for the right price 
5 0 Really durable Wonderful machine I find this a great way to work out or to warm up before lifting weights at the gym This machine is the kind you find at health clubs It s extremely durable and sturdy 
5 0 Lots of fun practical convertable 1 or many speeds Everything I always wanted in a bike without having to rig it up myself This bike is made for a wide range of uses including mine I like to use panniers and this bike has rack mounts I love a single speed This bike has rear facing track style dropouts thus I can have one gear on each side of the wheel and easily change from low to high gear without changing the chain length This is not really the case with converted horizontal dropout frames Other non track single speeds on the market look like fun but lack the pannier mounts The large tire clearance is super fun The first time I really noticed it was when the bike path was congested and I took off across the grass Now I use this bike to carry me to and from my research site 3 miles down a primitive road and over two creek crossings So much fun And with the aforementioned rack I can carry tools out and samples back with ease And the price for this price you get a complete bike No self assembly required For those of you unsure about purchasing and committing to a single speed check this out this bike comes with a set of screw on gear cable guides and a screw on rear derailleur hanger so that if you so desire you can convert it into a multiple speed bike in the future This is nice to know although I am not sure why anyone would want to deal with this Once you get this thing going and loaded up with 50lbs of gear however you might want to avoid mountain passes unless you don t mind walking or hitchhiking 
4 0 worked very well We purchased these for our vacation to hawaii they worked great we have snorkeled a few times and these are DEFINATLY worth the money instead of renteding them the masked fogged up a little but not too bad the bags to carry them in were also very handy 
4 0 Great snorkel set I bought this set for my wife for our trip to Cozumel Mexico and the split fins seemed to work very well A big plus was the carry bag it is very spacious includng a special pouch for a water bottle on the outside The only drawback is that the mask inluded with this set seemed to have a bit of a limited viewing area in comparison to others out there and my wife did have some suction issues with it 
4 0 Break In and Works Good I am new to snorkeling and was going to Aruba and Curacao on a cruise I had previously bought a mask elsewhere due to concerns about fit on my moustache I tried the set out in a local pool a few times before the cruise The first time I used the other mask and I wore socks under the flippers to prevent chaffing The snorkel seemed to flood with every lap When I kicked harder the fins came loose I quit after 30 minutes or so The second time I vigorously blew out the snorkel when it started to flood and it stopped flooding Also I used the Madera mask with lip balm on the moustache and it worked fin I still wore the socks and still had the fins coming loose when I kicked hard to swim fast rather than just crawling but I lasted about an hour When I went to Aruba and Curacao I abandoned the socks and the fins did not come loose when I kicked hard The snorkel stayed dry and I continued to vigorously blow it out after diving and that may have helped The bag worked well as a bag in the hand and it can be worn on the back I rinsed the equipment and let in dry in the bag when I was on the boat All in all I found this to be a great value for someone starting out such as myself 
5 0 Great value Great value for the money I was looking for a set with silicon mask and found this bargin Tried it in Hawaii and satisfied with performance I am going to get my kids their own set for a planned trip to Hawaii 
5 0 Sturdy Finally a back pack that won t fall aprt the first month of use Large storage area fits books lunch pack shoes and all the extra stuff my 8 year old has to have with hi 
4 0 bolster very sturdy and the service is great The size does not stack up with most of the other bolsters so mixing brands is not recommended 
5 0 Awesome I have had my watch for two years now and it is by far my favorite outdoor watch I make regular use of all the features Compass Once calibrated it is accurate within 1 degree of my GPS I used it exclusively to complete an all day orienteering event and numerous camping trips without complaint Altimeter The altimeter despite the proprietary zero drift technology will drift over time as all barometer based alitimeters will On a four day hiking trip in Colorado I set the altimeter at a known elevation and it worked flawlessly for the whole trip Based on map readings and GPS the watch was never more than 200 off on a trip that regularly ranged from 10 000 to 14 000 Another feature not mentioned in the manual is an alarm system that goes off whenever you attain an altitude of a famous mountain For example when I hit the altitude of Mt Fuji the alarm sounded and Mt Fuji scrolled across the face You will have to set the altimeter to a known point for it to be accurate As a helicopter pilot I have flown numerous times with it and it is fairly accurate but the sampling rate of 60 seconds is kind of slow you can change it but I don t seriously use it in the aircraft and 60 seconds is plenty of time when you re hiking Temperature Like any wrist mounted temperature sensor the watch will react to your body temp This watch has a feature that allows you to compensate for this by lowering the temp by a known factor I have mine set at 8 degrees so it is relatively accurate on my wrist This is the only watch I have found to have this Barometer Accurately shows trend data no complaints Alarms I like having numerous alarms and the alarm is sufficiently loud to hear while hiking in 30mph winds with the watch under layers of clothing The watch also has a feature to shut off the display after 1 hour of no button pushes This saves battery power and my battery display shows a full charge after two years of consistent use The manual is not very clear but the interface is user friendly once you play with it The titanium bezel does show some wear but the mineral face is as clear as the day I bought it and I am extremely hard on watches Overall I am extremely pleased with this watch I think I will buy a second one when the first one bites the dust 
2 0 A major disappointment from Nike Before I bought this watch I did a lot of research on the offerings from Suunto Polar and Nike and finally ended up choosing the Lance 4 watch for my cycling specific activities And I have to say my disappointment began within 2 minutes of opening the shipping box Here are the three major ways this watch and Nike itself have failed me 1 This is a complicated multi function instrument But if you re expecting a detailed instruction manual forget it What you get is an elaborate pictograph that illustrates which buttons to push It skims over the setup procedure and many of the most important functions and omits many features entirely 2 Relative to the above complaint I contacted Nike customer service about the setup Since I m a cyclist I was particularly interested in the altimeter function and dismayed by how thin the manual is The instructions say you can select a 60 10 or 2 second sampling rate of the barometric pressure in order to determine altitude What it fails to mention is what the ramifications are for choosing one over the other Is one more accurate Does one use more battery power We ll apparently never know because Nike s customer service failed to answer the question While they admitted that they had received several complaints about the manual and were considering writing a new one they simply sidestepped my question about the altimeter function in their email reply 3 And then there s the performance of the watch itself In most cases it s impressive that is in every case except the one for which I purchased it the altimeter On my group rides there are always at least three other people with altimeters A post ride comparison of altimeter results always puts their readings within 3 percent of each other The results from the Nike are at least 20 percent off That means the altimeter results are not to be trusted While the watch is attractive that s why it earned 2 stars instead of just one and has an excellent band it simply doesn t give me the accurate altimeter results I need And since the altimeter results are so far off I can only assume that its built in weather sensor also based on barometric pressure is hugely flawed too With the manual being as light on information as it is with Nike s customer service either unwilling or unable to shed any light on the watch s usage and with the flawed performance of the altimeter function I can only say that this watch represents a major disappointment It may meet Nike s standards for fashion but it fails my standards for performance 
4 0 SUIT WORKS BUT VERY SMALL IT IS A LARGE AT BEST THE SUIT IS FAIRLY WELL MADE FOR THE PRICE HOWEVER BE FORWARNED IF YOU ARE A SMALL ORDER MEDIUM OR IF YOU ARE A MEDIUM ORDER LARGE SIZING IS ON THE SMALL SIDE IT DOES WORK WELL 
5 0 Drink Water Make sure you drink a lot of water It makes you sweat This suit is useful if you are an athlete and need to weigh in for something I wouldn t use it all the time because you lose water weight and you need water to feed your muscles It s not going to make fat disappear just water 
5 0 Does what it s supposed to do This really does act as a combination Roman Chair Sit Up Bench It will give your abs a good workout and you have control over how much intensity you want to do and still keep good form It s also half the size of my old incline bench which I used to misuse to make it like a Roman Chair so it fits in my new apartment easily Regarding the instructions the drawing on the cover of the instruction booklet makes you think that the leg holders are attached inside the frame but if you look carefully at the drawing of how to put it together and even double check by looking at the photo of the bench on the Internet it goes on the outside 
5 0 Fun toy My 8 month old nephew has loved this toy since he received it when he was around 5 months old He doesn t drop it as much as other toys because it is so easy for his little hands to hold 
5 0 Great For New Baby Great for the stage when a baby can t really play with toys Because the tubing is easy to grab a hold of my seven week old baby can easily grab on and shake it around If I put this just within reach when she moves her arms around she can grab it involuntarily I make sure this is on our blanket at every play time 
5 0 Great early toy We bought the Winkle when our son was three or four months old We actually bought it a at childrens art museum He picked it up in the store and played with it immediately It quickly became his favorite toy He loved that he could easily grip and hold on it was a good car toy too This summer we were visiting Grandma and his six month old cousin picked it up and wouldn t let go We have searched all over the place for another Winkle I am thrilled that Babies R Us has found the toy and is now carrying it I hope your little ones enjoy it as much as my son has 
5 0 Great toy Our son loves this toy He is absolutely fascinated with it He loves reaching for it and will actually put forth quite an effort to do so He is teething right now and it must feel good on his gums because he instantly puts it in his mouth and will not take it out He has a very strong grip and will actually put up a fight when we try to take it away from him This is a big hit 
5 0 A HUGE hit Yet another big hit from Manhattan Baby My girls LOVE their toys This one is routinely shaken and chewed on The simplicity of their baby toys is ideal gets baby s attention The little rubber tubes are tough haven t come off the rattle center no matter how hard the babies pull on it It s very safe We LOVE these toys 
5 0 Awesomely versatile and safe I received this toy as a baby shower gift for my daughter It was one of the first toys she could play with The rings are small enough for her to grab without hurting herself another rattle toy I had was hard plastic and she tended to bonk herself with it and can also be used later for teething The toy is also quite light She loves the bright colors of the rings and the little rattle cube in the middle Overall this is definitely one of her favorite toys Unfortunately the toy got lost during a trip out and we like this toy so much I am going to buy another one 
5 0 Great Playability I spent 30 years in the tennis industry frequently introducing rackets and I believe this racket incorporates many features that maximize playability Suggest Babolat s 17 gauge Hurricane Pro but keep the tension down so that string can grab the ball Well done Babolat 
5 0 A nice racket Well this one is definitely a solid weapon Now I feel a real weight that allows me to fight much more aggressively comparing with my previous Head Liquidmetal Fire 
5 0 Excellent for scratches If you have bamboo floors I highly recommend this stuff It will erase all of the tiny scratches that seem to accumulate so easily on these floors It works pretty well at masking deeper gouges but it isn t perfect Someone looking will still be able to spot the gouge but it s usually good enough to get your security deposit back And yes the price of shipping is more than the price of the product but it s not like every hardware store carries this stuff I checked my area and no one carried it so I ordered it online Even with the shipping costs it was still worth it

4 0 Great product But the bench is in pretty good shape for beginners to intermediate athletes woulda got 5 stars but one of the bench s parts came bent and me and my brother had to pound it back into shape with a Maul could have been shipping but the box was not crushed and the metal in this part is very strong I still like the bench it is cheap in price but gets my workouts done
