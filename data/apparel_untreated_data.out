disappointed I want to start by saying Fred Flare shipped this product very fast And the transaction itself was very smooth I do however have extreme problems with the product itself The product is not leather its nylon and it sort of looks cheap The inside material is sued but that s only the lining for the base of the wallet Also The wallet part is very hard to use You cant really put too much in the wallet The credit card slots are a little too snug and there is no place for my I D The wallet included a small note book but it also doesn t fit in the wallet I was very excited about this product but now I feel duped The pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality and that it was user friendly but it s not I do not recommend this product 
Cute But Way Disappointing I have to say that I was disappointed when I opened up the package containing my iPod wallet It s cute but not 60ish cute First of all it s not leather it s nylon The lining is indeed suede but the photos in the product listing are misleading I m keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back etc isn t worth it It does the job but it wasn t what I was expecting I feel ripped off 
Camo Fatigue hat I am sorry but I did not like it nor will I wear it as it is too big looks funny on me I wish I had not have gotten it 
What s next The swastika A red star I bet this won t sell well in eastern Europe 
Buyer Beware Perhaps it is my own fault for not reading more closely or failing to question the somewhat ambiguous product description The fact is I thought that I would be receiving 84 plastic stays 3x28 28 each in 3 different sizes At 8 00 that seemed like a reasonable deal for plastic collar stays What I got and I confess that the product description could be interpreted this way was a total of 28 stays in assorted sizes When you add in the 4 00 I was charged for shipping actual US Postal Service postage on the package was 1 84 this really is a poor deal compared to other available options About 43 cents for each plastic collar stay A bad choice 
Not very pleased THe pants that I ordered for my size were very small They weren t true to size at all I would not recommend this item to anyone 
Design flaw I ordered the black one According to the photo provided it was supposed to be black with white seams but when i received it it was all black Once I put it on it fitted perfectly But it is simply too difficult to put on even though it is the right size 
Suit was too small Suit was too small not enough information available on the site for it I called Amazon but even the customer representative was not sure the size I bought the suit as he suggested but it is too small 
Swim suit grab bag the swim suit was so unsatisfactory looking that I didn t even try it on it was blue striped with a totally different blue strap that didn t go with the main color of the suit Very poor choice for a grab bag Taught me not to use grab bag shopping from this company 
Advertised and not in STOCK IT was advertised and NOT IN STOCK so I was unable to get it 
Ouch I have had plenty of pairs of Doc s but these are not the best for me they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in As soon as I put them on and took ONE STEP there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease It does not look nice and I am ticked about that plus I didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces it looks dorky Plus I have a manufacturing flaw in them Inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck Hopefully the next model I get isnt like thses or they are going back Putting up with these for now 
Awful These body suits are awful When I first saw them I was really relieved that I had found something that would be good for the summer months I put them on my twins after a first wash and the velcro closure scraped up the insides of their delicate little legs The suits were the appropriate size and were washed according to the label I am so disappointed and angry It was a waste of my money 
NOT CLEAR Nice looking picture but what are the dementions of the thing It looks good but is it 4 X 8 or 12 X 8 Sure would be nice to know the size before I buy da Trol 
second one also gave up on me at the plastic clip I bought two of these bags so far both have failed at the plastic fastener one arm just snapped in no time the bag itself is ok but the plastic parts on the belt are really cheap I wont buy a third one 
Lambskin leather belt bag I give the order processing an A+ due to receiving the product within three days The bag on the other had leaves a bit to be desired While the material used is soft the inexpensive zippers are difficult to operate with one hand 
Took too long The actual bag itself was great However the time frame it took to recieve the bag was not I ordered this bag and three weeks later it came I had to go buy a bag to take on vacation kind of defeated the purpose 
Not worth even for this low price Very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers Relegated to cleaning after just one use 
Bealls of Florida The shirt fits well good style good shirt But Bealls of Florida sucks as a retailer Their customer service is rude crude and unrefined Even the supervisors of Customer Service suck they don t return or accept any items back So BEWARE you better be damn sure that size fits ordered product before Because Bealls of Florida will not let you return the item for different size or style I will not shop here again I repeat I WILL NOT SHOP HERE AGAIN THIS PLACE SUCKS AS FAR AS A RETAILER

Champion Cotton Tagless tee x large white why not to buy If you are a small frame person or a short person these will work fine for you The white is thin and you can see through it so i don t reccomend buying white on this brand The t shirts run very small A size x large fits both of us very big on most brands but this brand was so tight we could not even get it on so these run very small They are also short 29 inches is short for a man s t shirt If you are tall i would not recommend this t shirt The t shirt is soft not scratchy and the style is nice We only had problems with the sizing and of course the white being so thin that it is see through

Worst Quality I wore this shirt just once It s almost transparent Not worth it even if you get it for free 
Poorly organized customer service I received an email from txshirts stated that I should direct all inquiries to csr txshirts com I did this on two occasions and received no reply Customer service finally contacted me only to ask why I had left negative feedback on Amazon They stated they never received any email from me Their gym shorts were not as described The description said covered elastic waistband Instead I received an uncovered elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin Their response I should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back But who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised 
Camo Fatigue hat I am sorry but I did not like it nor will I wear it as it is too big looks funny on me I wish I had not have gotten it 
What s next The swastika A red star I bet this won t sell well in eastern Europe 
Not durable Very cute I always get compliments but I wear them only every so often and the bottoms are all ripped up you d think I wear them everyday I m just upset I paid over 60 for shoes that will BARELY last one season 
Created for a dance studio not for walking in the streets of Manhattan I purchased these about 3 months ago They have very little arch support and very little other support elsewhere I have been wearing them perhaps 2 3 times a week to the office and home They are already ripping in the back I wouldn t recommend them however I do get many compliments about how cute they are 
Embassy Leather Products are sub par I purchased 3 different Embassy purses last December None of them were the quality I had hoped for and none were used as the gifts they were intended for In this case the price should be a clue that the bags are cheaply made and not nearly as nice as they look in the pictures used I would not buy from this company again 
Cute shoe but not practical I purchased these shoes for my upcoming wedding because I have a hard time walking in really high heels They are extremely cute but the satin ribbon ankle strap doesn t hold my foot firmly in the shoe When I walked around in them I could feel them flopping Also anytime I raised my foot to simulate my fiance taking off the garter there was too much gap between my foot and the shoe So just be aware of this if you decide to purchase this shoe For the price this is not worth the buy 
Suppport ok but material abrasive The jock has good support but the material used is quite abrasive The elastic and threads bite into your skin If you use this one for sports you will constantly be distracted The feel of the material used is very rough against your skin esp at the waist 
This product was greatly dissapointing I really really didnt like this product at all I hated how it fit and the side ties are annoying very hard to keep them tied Also i m petite so the dimensions of where thems were supposed to be were way off The product would be much better if it came in auctual sizes as opposed to one size fits all 
size is not correctly labeled I usually wear size 7M However This shoe of size 7M is way too small I have to return it to AMAZON and pay the shipping fee for the return by myself I will advise anyone who is interested in this shoe to by 1 size larger than the normal size you wear 
Bad design Haven t worn it yet to test the quality however the structure is all wrong One leg is more narrow than than the other I could barely fit my leg into it and the waist is really high 
Passport Cover Not what I expected for the price and the color shipped was wrong Even though I contacted the seller have received no response 
The Size Is All Wrong I loved the bathing suit the first time I laid eyes on it so I purchased it I m actually small but I do have thick thighs so I got a medium But when it was delivered and I tried it on it was too small I should have gotten a large The medium made me look like I had these big love handles So please whatever your size is make sure you get it a size bigger But other than that the bathing suit is great I m just going to have to loose the love handles 
Not meant for a thin 6 year old Our 6 year old wants to be a policeman when he grows up He could not wait to get this belt We had purchased the police uniform earlier The first time I ordered the belt it got lost in the mail so he had to wait almost a month to get it When it finally arrived he could have wrapped it around his waist 3 times it was so long It is made of very thin vinyl and does not hold up very well to having holes punched in it It is less than 4 weeks old and probably won t make it through the rest of the month 
No contact after return of item I received the trousers in a timely manner They were what i expected although they did not fit I returned them a month ago and have not heard a word from the company 
Not so good This pillow is an inflated U that fits around your neck One of the problems is it has a rather sharp plastic edge around where it touches your neck This can get pretty irritating the longer you use it Fortunately it is dirt cheap so then I guess you get what you pay for 
Comfy but so so color looks different in Pic Shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige Which leads you to think the color is mostly white The true color is neither There is absolutely NO WHITE in these shoes I purchased these shoes because I needed some white off white shoes NOT beige shoes No I did not return them it s too much of a hassel to return things so I kept them and I have worn them once but do not like the color at all The style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain The materials are an excellent quality If you like beige earthtones you will like these shoes 
Poor Customer Service Our company ordered these shirts from the Texas Shirt Company While we were happy with the quality our order was missing 2 shirts Over a nearly 2 month period we sent emails and called customer service to let them know but their customer service representative insisted that they were accounted for as if to say we were not telling the truth If you don t care about customer service then perhaps you might want to use them because the quality and pricing are good but if you want to be treated fairly then pick another company 
Too thin to keep you warm too bulky to haul around I purchased this item to keep my wife warm and cozy for the 12 hour flight to Japan However it was way too thin to keep her warm After using it for about an hour we ended up packing it back to the case and use the blanket given to us by the airline Since I spent over 40 dollars on this blanket I couldn t even throw this away I had to haul it around for the entire trip I do not think it is worth 40+ dollars 10 dollars blanket would do the same or even better job than this 
Christmas disaster This was a nightmare order I paid extra for expedited shipping to assure Christmas arrival Package tracking log revealed that the shoes were not even shipped until AFTER Christmas Disgraceful and unforgivable to have to tell my 7 yr old grandson that his gift didn t make it The shipping cost as much as the shoes and this company should be ashamed They are also impossible to reach Amazon couldn t even get them on phone Thank goodness the shoes fit I can t begin to imagine what a return would have been like The product is great 
adidas Men s a3 Gigaride Running Shoe Cyber Metallic Blue 14 M These shoes look great but are horrible running shoes The soles are solid plastic and do not flex at all on impact I do not have knee problems but my knees hurt after running in these shoes They may be a good walking or all purpose shoe but do not plan on running in them I returned them and plan to try something else 
I never received this item I ordered this wool wrap at the beginning of December and never received the item I am disappointed that this seller is ripping people off and plan to report the fact that my money was basically stolen from me If people can t be honest in their transactions then online buying will eventually die out Two thumbs down 
CHEAP BEWARE BEWARE This is a little girls camisole and CHEAP looking 
Look Closely Look closely at the picture of the white top It actually has red around the top and on the straps To those of us who don t want ugly red zig zag thread 
Not as comfy as most clarks Shoe has a high back that kinda cuts in to your heel I love Clark s but not this pair 
Don t Bother I got this bra thinking it would be great for rigorous sports and my 38DDD chest Think again Go for the the ENELL sports bra I bought a size 3 and it is perfect No bounce whatsoever I was amazed don t bother with this one 
Don t waste your money big busted gals I am a 38 FF and I was hoping this would help hold me in while running NOT This bra is no better than my 18 hour bras and is double the price I m still in search of the bra that will hold me in This one is going back 
larger than I expected This shirt was larger than I expected I got a 2x because i m a 12 14 but it was way too big Also the pink was a lot brighter than pictured 
disgusted paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon this store NEVER AGAIN 
stiff uncomfortable after 4 washings I have ordered Intimo silk boxers in the past and have been happy with that purchase So far the fabric in these cotton boxers is extremely stiff and they have not gotten any softer even after 4 washings I will continue to wash these in hopes that the fabric will soften enough to be comfortable enough to be worn I now know why I pay 15 00 for two pair of Jockey s 
Decent fabric horrible band couldn t notice the fit The fabric is a little stiff at first bust softens to a acceptable level after a few washes The elastic band around the waist of these boxers contracts to the point where it wrinkles up the fabric After a few hours of wear you have the indents of the crinkled up band on your skin and it feels quite uncomfortable While cheap and nicely packaged these things suck Spend some money on decent underwear 
Disappointed I received the night gown tried it on and actually hated it The built in bra was loose as was the top and there was just too much fabric up top The straps are too wide The rest of the gown was okay although it too seemed too drapey and long I sent the gown back 3 weeks ago now and have STILL not received a refund I am very disappointed with the whole transaction product 
Beware of sizes The sizes listed do not print on the invoice Instead Army Navy uses codes When they send the wrong sizes then they blame you for not selecting the right size and want a 15 restocking fee plus return shipping 
Disgusted Quality was terrible undersized or seconds Later I saw the same product at a discount warehouse for 1 3 of this price I would not recommend these to anyone I paid and have been waiting 6 weeks for my credit Amazon must protect buyers better or lots of business will go elsewhere It is only when problems arist that the true color of the marketing company comes to the surface I am disgusted with this product 
Waste of money The shoes weren t the color that I wanted them to be To me there cheap and are over priced The quality is not good They can easily be scuffed Am definitely returning them 
a bit disappointed the shoes weren t quite what I thought they would be although for 40 bucks I probably shouldn t have been expecting the highest quality pump They looked a bit cheap and on top of it all they were too small for me There was no return slip in the package no number to call no way to send the shoes back to make a return so now I m stuck with 40 dollar cheap looking shoes that no one but my little neices can fit into and they re a bit too young to be dressing like ladies of the evening My fault for buying shoes at a place called Hollywood Heelz I should have known better I will say this though I like the thin heel and the shoes came in a timely fashion If I could fit them I d give them a 2 2 1 2 for that alone 
Too Small These tops were cute for my 7 10 year old neices How in the world did they justify putting a size 2x on these things 
Runs small The material s good but the suit runs way too small I ordered the appropriate size based on my measurements but all my wobbly bits are poking out I don t think I could wear this out in public Not for curvy women 
never received I never received this item when I was promised it so it was cancelled and my account was credited 
Morgans long johns Authenic Thermals Not the best fabric Scratchy and See thru You get what you pay for on these 
These boots suck I bought these because they cost less than Uggs But there is no comparison My old Uggs ruled were totally comfy and warm I bought these because I didn t have the money for Uggs and they said they were sheepskin When I recieved them they looked and felt different The fur was not curly and fluffy like the Uggs it was relatively short and not as soft I called Bearpaw and complained and they assured me that they were not synthetic But after several calls the owner told me they are not 100 sheepskin they are blended with merino wool which is NOT stated anywhere on Amazon or their website Also I am a designer decorator and I am very familiar with fabrics and fibers and I still say they re synthetic I returned them at my cost and am waiting for a refund You get what you pay for I probably could have bought a better pair at Payless What happened next They promised me they would refund my money if I returned the boots at my cost instead they sent them back to me with no refund Nice 
too much fuzz these socks are okay but after one wash they were covered with so much fuzz and didnt look good so the next pair i washed it with hand and dried alone to avoid the fuzz also they are too warm socks 
size fits none I received the wrong size and color I returned the product and was told that a refund would be credited to my account I am still waiting was told that amazon forbids seller to ship a replacement item 
Not the same QUALITY SHOES WAS NOT EXCALTY THE SAME AS PIC SHOWN ON WEB SITE IT WAS KIND OF USED 
Item backordered and could not get it in time for Christmas as promised I just found out that this shirt back ordered after I was promised by Amazon BEFORE I ordered it that I will receive this item before December 23 I just now received notification that this item was shipped on the 24th and I had purchased it on the 15th This means I will not get it until after December 26th Because I bought this shirt to go with some camo pants for my sister I was only able to give her pants without the shirt for Christmas She had to leave back across country and I am forced to send this shirt to her How embarressing Obviously it is Christmas time and if you re going to have a storefront on Amazon com you better get extra stock The worse way to keep a happy customer is by backordering on Christmas and ruining a family member s present Beware folks you may not get this item when it says you will 
Sizes run small I actually had to send this back cause of the size They run really small 
Cute but impossible to keep on These shoes were very cute as I thought they would be from the pictures But because of the sides being so short they were nearly impossible to keep on my feet when walking especially when going up stairs I returned them after only wearing them for 1 day 
Cheap for a reason Very poor quality falling apart at the seams Also really long 
Not Made in Italy made in India These shoes are no longer being made in Italy but in India The quality of the material utilized and the construction is cheap and nothing like they used to be I have worn this same style of Bostonian Marco for several years and was completely satisfied This is a cheap imitation of what used to be a great comfortable well constructed shoe Return to having them made in Italy 
Not made in Italy If you see the description made in Italy be careful They are made in India I have written to amazon to let them change But if you still see made in Italy be careful Everybody knows the difference 
sparks and smoke this adapter nearly caught fire the first time I used it watch out 
Doesn t warrant a 1 So cheap the seams weren t sewn up all the way Am returning 
Don t waste your money The photo is quite deceiving This suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap shiny and is horrible to the touch My three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness Spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit 
NO SIZING INORMATION THIS HAS BEEN THE COMPLAINT OF OTHERS I SEE BUT THERE IS NO SIZING INFORMATION FOR THIS PRODUCT AND CONSEQUENTLY I CANNOT PURCHASE AS I DON T KNOW WHAT I M GETTING 
too narrow Get EE if you get these The D is very narrow and thefore uncomfortable 
Gorgeous color but poor quality The tie does have gorgeous color to it but when the description says good quality its a little off base 
It fit the purpose of a one time use tie It didn t meet my expectations It was flimsy and wrinkled and looked messy 
Don t buy I just received this item and now I have to figure out how to return it This clock is a piece of trash I never could set it correctly Each time I set the time it would advance the day when going to the normal function mode The setting button are not protected or disabled when the clock is closed Even it it worked properly it is very dificult to set If you buy this clock you will regret it 
Defective item I ordered two bras and both were defective The left side strap had been sewn twisted and there was no way to correct without cutting and resewing 
wasn t satisfied I have returned the shirt from amazon macys I did not like it and I am still waiting for my refund I purchased it in January Where s my refund I will not buy from companies that don t offer free shipping I was charged to recieve it and also to ship it back Ms Michelle Watso 
NOT zip front Beware this item is NOT a zip front hoodie as the item description says It is a pullover 
Very Cheap The other reviewer is spot on These are pretty but not truly mirrored and they broke after only 4 weeks use I bought a pair of aviators at a gas station that was made of much sturdier materials for half the price Definitely not worth the 16 
Pretty Cheap They re pretty but flimsy Very light construction The lens is not really mirrored so if you attempting to hide your eyes forget it It would be better to spend some real money and get a more professional pair than a cheap Chinese knock off Gave them two stars simply because they are good looking but cheap and they feel that way on your face 
quality s gone down the tubes I have worn Jockeys for almost 20 years but the quality has gone downhill dramatically in the past few years The fabric covering the elastic waistband wears out very quickly and the underwear is for some unfathomable reason heavily perfumed I had to wash them at least 5 6 times to get the smell out Plus some of the elastic on the bottom was too tight and some was so loose I couldn t wear them and they were all the same size Very inconsistent quality I do not recommend these anymore 
don t bother buying this item Bought one for my new ipod nano a total disappointment Very poorly made Only glued together not stiched up It already started to go apart You won t be able to connect your headset because the hole below the case is a bit too small Plus there is no belt clip or anything attacheable to one s self when walking or working out It looks pretty but that is all 
different styles the 2 bras i ordered were they same style it even said so on the labels attached however they both look and feel different the white has a lot more padding a rounder shape and the lining is tearing away from the padding part of the design The navy bra had a more pointed shape and less padding which is what I wanted in the first place I was also disappointed in the sparse stock that was on had in addition I had to wait an extra 2 weeks for one of the bras to come in because in the ordering screen I was not informed that it would have to be backordered not happy with my overall experience 
string of dissappointment The one size fits all doesn t fit my slim body and the item looks made in China if you know what I mean Rather try the double pearl thong or black single pearl thong They look much classier than the transparent beads with nylon string of the string of bubbles panty 
not a good product All I have had with this product is problems the clip in the middle kept popping open even when it the wallet was close and my money would fall out so i ended up removing the cheap clip and useing it for what ever don t waste your money 
Lovely but POOR color quality These were a gift at Christmas and were a deep burgundy color they do appear to be well stitched however after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don t look like a match anymore the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much 
I Wont do it again I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy I made a mistake by buying i 
not that good I saw the reviews and ordered the bag the first impression was it looked pretty good I was happy if I had rated it at that time it would have been 5 stars The problem now is the threads have come out at couple of places on the front I had to trim to remove the hanging threads There are double stitches on the bag the clip just above the calpack symbol has come out I suppose the ring which holds it has cracked don t ask me why I did not send it back it costs 10 bucks which is one third the price of the bag which does not make sense to send it back It has started to give me the feeling that there is a price to pay for anything that is cheap The next time I m going to branded bags it is worth the price I guess On the other hand the rest of the bag seems to be ok except for the defects on the front of the bag mentioned above if u r lucky u could have got a better bag 
Word First I tried these pants on in my size and I looked like Kramer in that episode where Jerry dares him to wear jeans It was ridiculous I went back to the store and bought them a little bigger and they are the best pair of jeans I ve ever owned 
Not what I expected Very disappointed in the cheap quality and dull color It doesn t look as nice as what they show on the internet I returned it for a refund 
Hanes Product advertised and then after paying for them they were not available Tied up money for over two weeks before refund credited back Bad experience 
Misrepresented Only the front of the bag is actually beaded and the quality poor The original price should have been 5 or fewer to be reasonable This would make a better toy for a little girl than an actual accessory 
Dissappointed I ve had this coin purse not even 2 months now and I ve only used it about 7 times Unfortunately the ZIPPER broke already I couldn t believe it 
Not so great I purchased this item judging by its comfort factor All s well except the buckles do not have pins to hold the straps in place The straps slip off occassionally causing the shoes to come loose 
Turpentine smell I ordered a pair of black cotton mary janes and I had the same problem with the turpentine smell I was prepared for it because of reading other reviews and was willing to take my chances for the price I wonder if any of the other colors or fabrics had the same problem I washed them in vinegar water immediately after buying them and it helped some but they still stink I m going to wrap them in a clear plastic bag to transport them on the plane and hope they don t make my other clothes smell and I m still going to wear them and hope nobody else can smell them 
ick Even for only 12 these weren t worth the money They came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine or some other noxious chemical and now at least 2 months since I have received them the smell has not dissipated They are extremely stiff so even if they didn t reek I still wouldn t wear them b c my feet would be in tatters by mid day I guess that s what I get for buying cheap shoes 
Poor shipping service I was able to track the progress of this item and it took almost two weeks AFTER the order request hit the warehouse for for the item to be shipped I also paid for 2 Day shipping and once the item shipped it took 3 days to get to me 
NO FLY Really there s no fly Also item shipped is not item pictured 
Not as advertised The main thing here is that the bag shipped with out the strap I bought it for my wife to carry all that stuff to work With out the strap it does not work I requested another one got it no strap On the plus side is the bag looked and felt as pictured and the packing was if any thing over done Gre 
Cute but not comfortable I just got my pair of sandals I regret I didnot read the customer review before buying Although very cute and trendy sandles but are very uncomfortable 
Good quality This is a very pretty high quality leather shoe The wedge heel is very steep and the toe is narrow If you are going for looks only they are good If you want any kind of foot comfort skip it 
Beware of Andrew Christian Initially I was going to order several items from Andrew Christian until I saw their shipping prices at checkout 2 shipping on EACH 4 tee shirt was more than excessive they were going to charge me 20 shipping on a 42 order I canceled most of the items only ordering a belt and a tee Shipping was still 50 surcharge Received my order yesterday and found that the belt is defective The buckle is on backwards no it s not reversible plus the material of the belt itself is damaged by a frayed hole It isn t worth the shipping cost hassle to send it back I ll probably just throw it away but I did learn something I will never deal with Andrew Christian again I you choose to please pay attention to the shipping charges when you check out you may decide to revise your order 
ITS A SHIRT I LOVE THE STYLE FABRIC FIT EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE BUT IT IS A T SHIRT I M 5 2 AND IT DOESN T COME PAST MY HIPS 
Not what I expected The shoes have sparkles all over and don t serve my purpose I ordered them to use them for work but returned them because of the sparkle A nice shoe to use during the night 
Would have returned I bought this for me but the size ran small and it is not of a very good weight I have a daughter that they did fit and she wanted to wear them under things so she became the proud owner The shirts are not by any means high or even good quality 
size is not accurate the material is nice but the size is too small I usually wear size XS for tops but for this tee the sleeve is too short 
Pass on this item These underpants are too bulky and puffy My daughter was very uncomfortable wearing them 
Poor Customer Service I ordered a pair and they were too big so when I asked for a RMA number to return and get a smaller pair they said they could only snail mail me a UPS Lable one month later it did not come Each time to emailed customer services they said they could only smail mail it and not email it to me whereas I know it is do able Bargain Outfitters can as well as can Online shoes So finally I paid 15 to send the boots back on my dine and no doubt they will not reimburse me for my I not only had to pay shipping to get the boots but also they will no doubt chaarge me a re stocking fee I will never ever buy from The Sportsman s Guide again 
Not What I Expected I ordered 4 toddler long sleeved tees in the same size I thought When I received the shipment all 4 tees were different sizes even though they were all labeled the same size I have returned the items since the tees run two sizes too small and the workmanship is questionable which translates into that I will not be able to give this item to my loved one for Christmas 
Horrible product I would not recommend these hats You definately get what you pay for The sizes are not true to fit and they are cheaply constructed even for a 6 00 hat I basically threw it out The sad thing is I spent as much in shipping as I did on the product 
Very flimsy I wish there was a rating of 0 This was very flimsy and the armband is just slightly larger than the slot provided The armband cut through and tore the back completely off I am returning it 
it was so cool they sold out I would have loved it if they sent it but after over 2 weeks of telling me that it was in stock on it s way the company fessed up that they were out of the color that I chose The other color that they wanted to sub looked pretty bad so I cancelled 
Too long not like the pic I had ordered The pic that I ordered showed a knee length half slip Instead I received 3 long half slips from Her Room I cannot use the long half slips and I sent them back Also I had bought them with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and couldn t find where to apply that so the cost was put on my visa Thanks Jeanne Alle 
So big This wallet is so big for passport and don t fit my documents from Brazil Maybe is good for another country s document 
very displeased this product never made it to destination it was purchased with pants to match which were pin striped and didn t and it was never sent to the recipient nor was i invoiced so i am currious if the seller plans to at this point or even if they intend to send the correct pants all i know is that with everything else being late for shipping durring the holiday and the wrong products otherwise i will not purchase from this seller again 
Straps hurt Straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro they are too short I tried to add velcro but that didn t work I had to give the shoes away The strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable Would not recommend if you are on the heavy side 
Tacky not cute There s a fine line between tacky and hip and these slippers are not it These slippers looked much cuter in the picture than they do in person Also the only thing between your foot and the floor is a thin piece of rubber y fabric They re not made for warmth All around disappointing 
Unfulfilled expectations I have seen others wear these slides and I know Adidas usually supplies an excellent product I did read the other reviews that warned of a need for breaking in the sole nubs and wearing socks during that process However I ve worn these slides for 2+ months and they still make the soles of my feet tender unless I continue to wear socks I am disappointed in the slide but I will stubbornly continue to wear them Maybe some day they will be broken 
TERRIBLE SANDALS THESE ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST THINGS i HAVE EVER BOUGHT SERVES ME RIGHT FOR BY A SANDAL WITHOUT EVER HAVING TRIED IT ON I WALKED AROUND THE BLOCK FROM MY HOUSE WITH THEM AND BARELY MADE IT HOME THEY HURT THE BOTTOMS OF MY FEET SO BADLY I MAY NEED TO TAKE AN EXTRA DAY OFF OF WORK THE PART OF THE SANDAL WHERE IT MIGHT NORMALLY BE FLAT AND CUSHIONED HAS SHARPENED PLASTIC SPIKES KNIFING THE SOLE OF YOUR FOOT TAKE YOUR MONEY AND THROW IT RIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE AND SAVE YOURSELF THE MISERY OF EVER HAVING WORN THESE SO CALLED SANDALS AND I LOVE ADIDAS 
Ear Muffs They were very cheaply made Thank goodness they were just for little girls I would have been embarrassed if I d have ordered them for a gift for someone I know I shouldn t expect alot for 5 but I d have thought they d be better than they were 
Clarks Cumin Slide I love the cotton color just the right shade for most beige and some white slacks The show style it the most unconfortable of any Clark shoe I have have There is something strange about the left shoe it give me a blister everytime I wear it 
I wish I could return it It looks great but the lace in the back itches so bad that I cannot wear it 
too big all around Boots run about a size too big and unfortunately it cost 20 to return exchange 
Cute but didn t stand up These boots were super cute and earned rave reviews each time that I wore them out although each boot split along the outside toe sole after approximately 10 wears These splits although tiny allowed my socks to get soaked when splashing through our giant West Coast puddles I still wear them but now only for fashion instead of function 
I d rather have poison ivy in my mouth And poison ivy in my mouth wouldn t keep my hands warm These things itch like hell I know they re wool but shut up I think whoever made these had to steal the wool No wonder they felt so bad Get it Steel wool Ugh go away 
HORRIBLE I bought these for my younger than three month old son he didn t even move around alot and in the morning the fabric that the snaps are attached to would be ripped off from the shirt I ended up having to throw them all away or keep sewing them back together I do not suggest that anyone buy these 
they look cool I wear boxers but boxer brifes look sexer so every one start wear boxer brifes that way you wont get pantsed or get a wegie 
Item quality and vendor s customer service unsatisfactory The sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body My husband is 6 178 pounds so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit but this one looked like a stiff kite on him BE AWARE The items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money and only after I had filed a complaint with Amazon Amazon acted quickly to post the credit 
disappointed The item looks cheap I ordered a medium size but it was 2X bigger than the regular size Ugly 
little disappointed i quesss for the price you cant beat it but i think it should have said patch leather or leather pieces also the size runs larger than regular coats xl was really more like an xxl but like i said for the price you cant beat it i really should have invested more and got a better coat thank you dlan 
Not So Much Didn t like the way these boots fit The souls were really lumpy and you could feel it when you walked They also looked really wierd on they flattened out really wide and felt like your foot would slipp off of them sideways Returned them and paid for the shipping myself 
Might as well go barefoot instead I broke through the toe on the second wearing Lousy product 
Which ones are for 9 or 10 or 11 I keep tyring to find shirts that are for these prices 9 10 or 11 where are they How do I find out 
bait and switch super low price advertised on select sizes and colors oh and u have to add to your cart before you know the price 
Yes it stretches but This shirt is too tapered in the body and sleeves and feels very confining The people who like it must be quite thin indeed It does not wrinkle because of the high percentage of polyester but it doesn t breathe very well either I am giving it 2 stars only because of all the color choices though why someone would want a dress shirt in some of the available colors is beyond me For the price you can do better even at someplace like Target 
Broke after 1 month Easy to install We used it for less than a month and it no longer rotates you can still hear the engine running but no movement Hardly any use at all maybe 10 times We tried taking it apart to see if something simple was wrong and the screws are set so tight you can t open it to see the inner workings I have never received a bad item from amazon before I am very disappointed with this product 
Do not buy Embarrassing These pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all If they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these I have lost the 3 pairs I biught to the self same calamity and always in public Please save yourself the trouble By the way the Lee version of these pants also do the same thing Be afraid be very afraid 
Not like they used to I had bought these for my boy thinking they had a fly front much like the mens versions I wear They are my son s least favorite underwear mearly cause he has to pull the front of them down in order to use the bath room He s only 6 and when I had trained him I tought him to use the fly on the front of his underwear In my personal thoughts are that men s boy s underwear has a fly in the front for need use unlike that for women and girls whom don t require it 
WORST PIECE OF JUNK I EVER BOUGHT TOO BAD THERE WASN T A RATING OF 0 STAR THIS IS THE WORST PIECE OF JUNK I EVER BOUGHT FIRST OF ALL WE WERE LOOKING FOR A BRAND CALLED SPORTS AFIELD THIS ITEM FELL UNDER IT WHEN WE DID A SEARCH WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS SOME OFF THE WALL BRAND THEY WERE PAPER THIN BUT THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WERE WARM BEING IT WAS FROM AN ARMY AND NAVY STORE WRONG THEY SERVED NO PURPOSE AT ALL WERE NOT WARM AT ALL WE WASHED THEM PER DIRECTIOS ON TAG AND SHRUNK SO BAD I DON T THINK A 2 YR OLD COULD FIT IN THEM DO NOT BUY JUN 
it s okay i didn t like the material of this skirt especially the black and white one i don t like it it s feels it s for old ladies 
comfy but weak I was glad to have finally found the right pair of boots but it didn t last long Not even 3 weeks after I bought it it already has deteriorated Given that I live in Seattle rain seeped in really easily and the sole pads started breaking It was like wearing melted cardboard 
Not good socks I wore Gold toes years ago and remember them as very high quality durable socks I discontinued using them because i started wearing different styles than the crew white standard Now after trying these fluffies i think i remember why i stopped liking the gold toes perhaps they sold the co or came under new management in anyt case these socks have no stretch in the elastic making them basically worthless yippee 
Ya They look good Got to be the toughest piece of leather a cow has ever produced I ve literally never had a pair of boots that need THIS much breaking in and I own LOTS of boots Makes me not even want to to wear them 
Not a happy camper When I ordered this skort the description didn t say that it was a childs size So I complained to the site that I bought it from I asked that my shipping also be returned because they didn t specify that this was a childs size I wasted my money on shipping for an item I wouldn t have ordered if I had known it wasn t an adult sized item They didn t return my shipping 
Not the right product When this product came it says girls not a woman s size I m a petite woman 5 2 105lbs and the medium was too tight for me like a jr s size or girls size as the tag states Now I have to spend sending this product back 
Nice thought This bra is definately not for the over B cup set The openings are too big and you d be better off wearing nothin 
useless item had a hard time using this thing first it tore the loop off my tie trying to fit it in the clip then it cut my button off the shirt sliding up and down the shirt I went back to using my tie bar and tack 
collar points frayed I wore this shirt for one day every other week and after five months the collar points have worn through and the white material underneath is showing through It s a blue shirt so I can t wear it to work now Unacceptable in a shirt of this price 
displeased When this product was ordered it was to be a 9 1 2 Wide when it was recieved it was a 9 1 2 Medium We live in South America and they were brought by some friends and now we have shoes that don t fit in a different country 
Loose It has a very loose fit and I feel a little silly but pulling it out of the package I totally forgot how exactly this thing should look on me It is made like a very unflattering potato sack sadly 
DOESN T WORK I got it a few weeks ago Although the light turned on in the charger indicating the electrical socket is good my shuffle only briefly flickered its charging LED light I played around with it but it seems it can t maintain contact and charge despite many attempts over several days I gave up and simply use my usb charger with the stable base hooked up to my laptop 
Good underwear not so good boxers I must say you are getting a very good price and these are very comfortable You also do not notice anything irregular However I ordered these to use as boxers that is to wear them around the house Not a good plan These are very thin plus the fly is very narrow All in all not very useful for my intended purpose 
Have not Reccived Them I have yet to reccived tham so I can not review tham till I reccive them Thank you Robert But 
Cheap 25 cent toy Not only charged 8 99 for it 6 99 for shipping Its a cheap plastic toy But my grandson begged for it and against my beter judgement I ordered it Save your money Its worth a buck if that I cant believe they have the nerve to sell it and not expect complaints for this garbage Shipping is a complete rip off and I will never order from this company again 
intimo satin sleep pant The garment I received was labeled large In fact at best it is a small The material and workmanship was good but the product was simply mislabeled 
didn t work The tape didn t stick well plus the packaging was misleading the box said it contained 2 bras which you really need when the tape on the first one fails you can try the second I threw it away 
Beauty Bra Backless strapless adhesive bra style 7000 in nude I thought this product was going to be easier but i have found it really dosent work the tape dosent like to stick to your skin and i think the sizes are off i wear a 38C and so i got it its like whereing a b cup not a c well i hope this info helps people Sher 
Wow did this shrink I washed this garment according to the recommendation and it shrank about 2 sizes to the point I can no longer wear it Bummer after just wearing it once 
Item not as advertized Item was called Fleese but was 80 cotton and looked felt like a regular sweat shirt To return an item to them they give you free mailing but they will deduct 5 95 off the refund for S H After calling them about this they agreed to give us a full refund But the refund will not show up until after 2 or 3 billing cycles I doubt that makes many consumers happy Champion makes a fine line of products but I will never deal with them on line agai 
I feel like Peewee Herman These compression shorts are nothing like the other pair of hind I have Aside from the low grade material and poor stiching the waist band rides up around my chest It looks like they were designed for someone 7 feet tall 
Color is way darker than it appears I bought these for my husband and the color said rinse so I thought regular jean color In fact they were so dark that they almost look black I have washed then about 5 times but they won t fade 
Very bad product I am vey unhappy with the sales professional in Nautica outlet stores I had a very bad experience at Nautica store outlet stores The customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional They basically said they don t really care if they lose one customer other customers will still buy if that is the case why are prices slashed by 50 it is because people do not want to pay the full price I do not think I will ever buy from Nautica A few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company 
poor quality zipper doesn t work it s very poorly made zipper didn t work when it arrived and when I tried to pull it thread was torn apart and beads fell cheap stuff shouldn t have ordered it 
A little on the short side I usually wear a men s medium waist for athletic shorts Umbro Adidas Nike and they usually fall just above my knee lengthwise Just to be safe I ordered a large The shorts barely made it past the midpoint of my thigh and my legs aren t overly long The waist fits well but if you re looking for a pair of workout shorts I d skip these unless you like to show a lot of leg 
not wha I order Was not the same boot from the pictures Got very sad when opend my packet 
Umm Yeah The writing was peeling off this badly I can t let me child wear this I threw it out 
Never received I was informed in October that the item was no longer available and my account would be credited I think maybe I should check my bank statement for that time 
Daytona luggage This luggage did not last for even one flight It was torn in the corners and the handles were broken I did contact the company and was given a full refund though 
2 SIZES TOO SMALL i got the largest size they had size 10 and my toes were crunched in they fit my mom just barely and she s a size 8 i wanted to get my money back for it but it d probably be more money just to ship the incredibly small slippers back then it actually costed to begin with 
alright already Am I the only one sick and tired of this t shirt Give it a rest already I can t browse without seeing it the dead horse is beaten to oblivion 
Keep in Mind I love the t shirt because I loved the movie but just note that if you are typically bothered by restrictive neck lines and arms this may present an issue for you The areas you see in the navy color have a tapering fit 
Not that good I bought this wallet for my niece and then ended up returning it The quality is poor The wallet is really hard to use because the compartments do not open all the way Also the wallet actually looked fake not sure if it is because the XOXO is upside down You cannot tell from looking at the picture 
Cheap but you get what you pay for The wheels on the bag lasted less than two months The bag is now basically unusable 
Very tight fit This was my first online shoe order I figured it would be pretty safe since it was a slip on I m usually in a size 11 or 12 so I ordered a 12 While my feet are pretty wide I ve never had to purchase wide shoes These shoes were incredibly tight They were long by about an inch but the width was unbearably constricted They reminded me of squeezing on a pair of tight rock climbing boots I really had to squish to get my feet in The result was so uncomfortable these are going back I wouldn t have expected this from slip on shoes It gets a two instead of a one since the quality appears great 
Thin flimsy definitely not worth it I purchased two scarves and in the first washing the thread in the hems unraveled producing a ragged fringe all around These bandanas are thin flimsy and not worth the time or money 
Betula Sandals I have several pairs of genuine Birkenstock sandals The Betula sandals are clearly inferior A light grade of leather is used for straps which makes them impossible to slip my foot into T H Grov 
Cut and fabric is not flattering With a title like swirl skirt you d expect the fabric to be able to well swirl But the fabric is stiff and not very comfortable Plus the cut of the size 12 at least was awkward giving my tummy a bubble that wasn t even there And the last thing I want is for my tummy to look bigger than it actually is So I don t recommed this item 
Could be a nice buy but I ll never know I ordered the jacket pictured but I received an entirely different Bernardo jacket Customer service re ordered for me and I got the same incorrect jacket I wouldn t bother ordering this unless customer service assures you that their inventory glitch has been corrected 
I don t love this blazer You have sent me a model different from for the one that I asked I live in Chile there is no way of returning it 
not very durable I liked the boots in the first couple of weeks they are very warm and comfy however they are not at all durable after a month of use the soles had holes My freind who had them experienced the same problem They are great feet warmers when the weather is dry but they are not waterproof 
Jockey Briefs I ordered classic jockey breif which I currently own but the new units received are approximately 2 taller on each side when compared to my current briefs both labeled Jockey Classic 
I used to wear this I used to wear lame ass Y fronts when I was a kid and my boring folks did all the shopping I made the switch to thongs after I got a girlfriend and she made it clear that I had to ditch the grandpa undies So I did and gladly There s no way I could go back to this maxi sh t anymore I tried one of my old pairs a few months ago and they look freakin HUGE I m talking fat guy big You don t realize how big they are until you try modern stuff So here s my advice if you re still putting up with either boxers or briefs throw them in the trash right now and go buy something smaller You ll be happy you did 
INCORRECT ITEM Very disappointing I ordered STRETCH jeans I paid postage to get them here only to find out they are not STRETCH jeans I called cust service He spent enough time with me and another department to find out that these jeans must be mismarked and if he Bealls cust serv sent me another pair I would get the same thing In order to get money back I had to return the item Now I ve paid postage again and Yes I did receive the 12 99 credit for the jeans but what about the postage This was not my fault The item was INCORRECT Your Return Policy indicates that yo uWILL pay the postage so if you need to see a copy which I also put in the return box of what I ordered please feel free to contact me I printed it out so I can fax it scan it email it or snail mail it or however you would like to receive it Please return the shipping costs that I paid for a product that apparently mismarked thanks Debbie Pearson P S I see the title description has been corrected to show that these ARE NOT stretch jeans wish I would have known so that I would not have to be writing this review If no satisfaction is given there will be no more purchases via amazon but especially not Bealls 
Wrong Item The wrong item was mailed to me I checked the order after I recieved the item to make sure it wasn t a mistake on my part and it wasn t I recieved an armband for an iPod nano and I ordered an armband for an iPod video Luckily I was able to sell it to a friend of mine instead of having to send it back 
Not a great wallet for the price This is a nice looking wallet but the internal design leaves something to be desired There is an internal flap used for credit cards etc that makes the wallet too thick even if you don t fill it with cards I am tempted to cut it out it is stitched to the inside to make the wallet less cumbersome The credit card slots are also too tight so you have to pry the cards in and out and run the risk of cracking or splitting the cards There is a nice display for your license with a small hole cut in it so that you can push the license out with your thumb when needed it is also in a tight slot 
Disappointed The fabric texture and color were extremely cheap quality It looked faded and unattractive I had to return it for a refund Don t bother if you like good quality and nice clothes 
Run VERY SMALL to size I ordered a 7 5 M which is what I always wear in a shoe I couldn t even get my foot into the shoe I can tell you that it was way too narrow I don t know about the length because my foot wouldn t go in I had to return them I wouldn t buy another pair of Daniel Green s until I knew for sure how the sizes really run 0 Stars 
Baaaaad Customer Service Ordered a pair and they lost my first order Had to contact amazon to help Finally got order and pants were too small So had to RE order larger size Got pants in SAME size as last Wrote back saying I know have TWO pair of pants that are too small First they denied sending wrong size then later wrote back saying they did make a mistate and that new order in correct size was on its way with postage lables to send pants back Well a month later still have not recieved pants or lables Have wrote half a dozen emails asking for a reply and help NO REPLY Never had such POOR customer service 
What a mess Company sent me two of one shirt and this shirt I ordered 3 different shirts This shirt is large in size but very short Not what I had expected Asked the company to fix the problem with the shirts as they were Christmas gifts for my daughter I received a fill form two weeks later with no correction to the problem 
The Gripper Oh My It enhanced my rolls instead of hide them It did not help having the bones sticking out above my butt which was very noticeable Not worth the money charged for it 
not that good The Zen cover didn t work that good I had to cut off one of the flaps that covers the buttons because it was not made right I ended up taking the cover off and don t even use it anymore It s not worth getting 
Harry Potter Costume Light and Sound Wand The sound works but the light does not 
Not worth the money and a disappoinment for the child Ordered the wand for x mas and took it with us on vacation When Santa came to the carribean the wand did not work No light no sound and cheap plastic that did not thrill anybody 
Returned items I ordered these items in mid June and my credit card was billed on June 22 However I discovered two weeks later that despite your having billed my credit card for items being purchased from Andrew Christian the order had never been sent to them I was then assured that the order would be completed promptly I told them I needed the clothing by July 19 otherwise I would not need the items at all The order was not given to UPS until July 17 with an expected delivery date of July 21 Consequently I directed UPS to return the order unopened The handling of the entire mess was slopppy and the billing of my credit card two weeks before the order was even placed was unethical and shameful 
Not so comfy I bought these for my mom as a gift thinking hey they re cheap isn t all shearling good Not so much The insides of these slippers felt similar to burlap They were very sturdy Not so comfy They also ran about a size smaller than I ordered I m a size 7 and the 8 s were a little small for my feet 
skimpy I had high expectations for these socks given my previous experiences with the brand The socks were too narrow in the foot and too tight around the ankle They are not comfortable to wear and overall a big disappointment 
not what i ordered i ordered this buckle the one shown in the pictures and i received a different buckle a red white and blue confederate flag not the knife buckle 
Hairigami Very hard to use maybe with a lot of practice it would get easier Don t buy if you are planning to use immediately This is where is I got very discouraged Just haven t had the time to play with it so it s sitting in the box 
Not Impressed I ordered these pajamas for a xmas gift for someone that loves Happy Bunny The pj s were cheaply made and the pants were very short it didn t say anywhere in the description that that were capri length They were definitely not worth the price 
Black lace top long gown The product is as described and I m sure for some ladies the product would be great However for whatever reason the stretch lace bodice was irritating to my skin and the material was more see thru than I desired The product is well made with no defects 
Not as cute as the picture This cap was definitely not as cute as the picture Loose threads on it Looked cheaply made and this was bought as a gift I wouldn t recommend this item It definitely cost more than it was worth 
Buyer Beware I m not sure what product every previous purchaser received but the case I received doesn t cut it for the 60GB It fits in so tighly that the case depresses the buttons so that the user can not push them I do NOT recommend this product for the 60GB I suppose we Zen 60GB owners must resign ourselves to the fact that only those stupid skins will fit our players 
Pretty but unwearable This is a beautiful sandal but the shoe was made from really stiff and ungiving material The footbed was uncomfortable and not a good fit or feel to it The price is right but there are so many sandals with gemstones to choose from I decided to return these sandals 
Size matters For slip on slippers no hands required these do not pass the test The small lip in the back does more harm than good I ordered 1 2 size large and it was not enough If you have high arches go 1 1 2 sizes larger or look elsewhere The synthetic upper was more sweaty than comfortable 
Not Happy they have my money i have no shoes I placed order on 10 10 I called Blue Blood racing the shipper because i did find any shipping info on amazon and was that as of the 10 16 that my order had not been shipped I that it would be shipped that day I was told that I may get my item 10 23 or 10 24 Horrible customer service The shipper also told me that there was some kind of problem with my shoe that is what took so long but i was not contacted and told that there was a delay in receiving my item I will not order from Blue Blood Racing again 
Give me cotton please I took a chance on these shorts sight unseen and unfortunately I gave them away after trying them on The fabric is some sort of icky synthetic and feels terrible 
These are way to tight Per the description it sounded like these would fit snug Well they fit too snug feeling very cramped I have a 33 inch waist and ordered the 32 34 waist I m used to boxer briefs made from cotton This was the first time that I ve got polyester boxer briefs Unless you like um really tight you might want to go to the next size up or just get cotton briefs I m throwing these away 
Nice material but that s about it I had got these for my husband for christmas Nice material however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height so we had to return it 
I want My Money Back These pants were washed one time following the washing instructions they were not put in the dryer and they shrunk not only around but lengthwise I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn t have any problems I look forward to your reply 
Uncomfortable Bra This bra is one of the most uncomfortable bra s I ve tried It s seems to be made cheaply and digs into my skin I would not recommend it 
What the hell Who would ever wear this monstracity First of all you got no color no padding no pazazz This shirt makes the garbage bag I wear look like a royal tunic It is also from a company called Jerzees and it s not a jersey What up with that Michael Jordan is probably spinning in his grave 
Crucio For the price this product should receive the Cruciatus Curse ad infinitum The material is all synthetic I was expecting a wool blend though the ad said nothing about what the hat and scarf were made of the relatively loose weave means it will not last as long and one of the tassels fell off the scarf after just one wearing I dislike being taken advantage of just so I can make my daughter happy She is disappointed as well It was a lot of money to pay to get the Hogwarts crest on a patch that wasn t even fully embroidered J K Rowling should be upset that English Woolens with which this product will be associated by people who are not in the know will acquire such a poor image because of the greed of the licensing people 
Damaged Harry Potter Scarf The Scarf arrived with several holes in it My daughter was very dissappointed crying and wondering why Santa sent this to her We ordered well in advance before Christmas but the set arrived too late We were never notified that there would be a delay in shipping A few days before Christmas it arrived It was too late to do anything Amazon should improve the quality control of vendors before it allows them to list on their site 
WAY TOO SHORT These are supposed to 3x boxers that means they should be made for a big man Well they fit my boyfriend like little boy boxers they were about 2 inches long They were horrible for him He threw 2 of them out My advice DONT GET THESE FOR A BIG TAL MAN THEY LL MMAKE U FEEL LIKE A GIANT 
Steve Madden Women s Bair Thong Espadrille These shoes look great on however are extremely uncomfortable They run VERY small in size I went up 1 1 2 sizes from what I normally wear in SM brand I would not recommend them as shoes you would wear for more than an hour at a time because the thong portion cuts into your skin and the arches in the heels are so high that they put alot of pressure on the ball of your foot 
ecologically friendly labor UNfriendly I do like this t shirt I liked the organic cotton and the general style But I will never buy American Apparel again Not only are they VERY labor and union unfriendly their ads exploitive of young girls I mean I can tolerate some of the young models in general but these are particularly young girls in amature porn looking situations but a friend s daughter had a particularly unsavory experience working in one of their stores I know I can find a cosy organic shirt elsewhere ick 
painful this bra was a terrible waste of money the wire on one side stabs me constantly the other side is fine it s obviously defective 
Why stop at 13 I have a pair if clogs from Europe that I wear in the operating room I need to replace them They are European size 50 So what s the deal You don t make your shoes in Men s sizes You think we all have girley feet Get with it clowns Real men occasionally wear clogs too You can t make a size 16 
Not typical Nine West quality I have worn these shoes less than 5 times and the leather detailing has already worn away The shoes look cheap not typical of the nine west brand I would not purchase this item again I thought I was getting a good deal but have simply added to my collection of boots that can be thrown on to do yard work 
Incorrect product information It clearly states for the shell material 100 nylon The price and the nylon shell was the main reason I bought the jacket The jacket is completely polyester The tag says Shell 100 polyester and Lining 100 polyester Returning it would be pointless I m very disappointed in the accuracy of the information 
ain t got no soul sole Acorn changed the sole of the slipper from a flat comfortable sole to an uncomfortable rubbery poor traction giving and painful sole I rather have cold feet then wear this slipper 
No Idea what you are talking about I did not order any red drawstring backpack There is obviously a mistake somewhere I gave this One Star because there was no other way to send this to you Someone is tinkering with my account Ronald Kalica 
broken already I love these boots and get a lot of complements but the strap broke already Can I send them back 
Rise is too short These pants are fine if you have a very short rise but I can t imagine that they would fit most people I will be returning my order 
Red Flag on this Navy Cardigan The sizing on this cardigan is way off I ordered a women s medium and it looks like a child size large The sleeves are about 4 too short and the overall profile is far too small To make matters worse I ordered it as a X mas gift and by the time we opened presents we passed the 30 day return window and I m stuck with a bad product 
Killer espadrilles Tommy what were you thinking Although they are lovely to look at they are absolutely the most uncomfortable shoe bar none The shoe bed is too small to accommodate the average foot and they slip off when you walk I even tried a smaller size thinking that was the problem I was wrong Take this design back to the drawing board and start again 
Not great For the money I spent on this bra it should be a better bra all around It gives a classic torpedo shape to the breasts does not offer any lift and is pretty much unwearable 
Easy to use hard to remove We had purchased another hair beader where you placed a clasp at the bottom of the beds to keep the beds from falling out of your hair The idea of this product where you could place a single bead on your hair was very intriguing My daughter was excited when she opened the box and she had decorated her hair with multiple beads and it looked nice The problem started when we attempted to remove the beads from her hair The directions tell you go gently pull the springs apart and slide them from your hair Well we pulled the springs apart but to get the beads out of her hair we needed to destroy the bead because the hair was tangled in the springs None of the beads could be reused and my daughter is afraid to use the product again because it pulled her hair when we removed the beads She has very long hair with a lot of wave so I guess if you had short straight hair this product would be fine for you 
ANKLE PAIN I bought these shoes a few months ago because I liked the style of them I wore them just about everyday A couple of people started telling me you walk kind of funny in those shoes They caused my ankles to turn in I was having ankle pain and my doctor confirmed it was from the shoes The support curves of the shoes are poorly designed I ran into another women wearing them and walking the same way I asked her about them and she said she too was having ankle pain I contacted the company who said I could mail them to the company at my expense and they would inspect them If they felt it was a manufacturers defect they would replace them with the SAME product Little good that would do ALSO If they felt it was not a defect they would just send them back with a note explaining their decision Don t waste your money and cause yourself pain too The company may say they stand by their merchandise but they don t mean it 
Poor quality I don t think these Skechers are made out of leather so I m very disappointed I thought I was purchasing a quality shoe from a reputable manufacturer but with such a low price it was too good to be true 
cheap IS CHEAP sometimes you get a good bargain cheap price for a good quality shoe this case is a classic you get what you pay for cheap price for a CHEAP shoe 1 this shoe is very heavy for a comfort shoe 2 no arch support whatsoever The rubber is almost too thick 3 i have SERIOUS doubths that this is a leather shoe feels like CHEAP VINYL AT BEST 3 days into wearing them and it looks like my shoe is going to rip in half any minute this paper like vinyl leather is pretty thin and cheap looking this is by fat the worst pair of skechers i have owned this is my 14 pair 
Tags not as described not leather While they are certainly bold and noticeable and have a handy security flap on the back to cover your personal information they aren t even close to being leather I don t think I would have bought them if I saw the cheap stitching and smelled the strong vinyl stench beforehand Not really worth the price and definitely not worthy paying the extra shipping charge from the seller 
Cute but not for walking I bought these shoes for work to wear with my scrubs with socks I had to return them due to several issues The inside lining was too slippery I went for a brisk walk and my feet slid so much inside the shoe that they felt like they were on fire from friction Tightening them did not work as the top of the shoe tore away the skin from the top of my foot leaving open sores Even when walking at a normal pace the shoe kept sliding away from my heel when I stepped Thirdly the sole of the shoe is very narrow it felt like walking in ice skates These were very cute and may be great for biking but not so great for everyday walking 
Naughty Monkey Women s In the Bomb Flat Tan color looks very synthetic cheapens look of shoe Also very wide fitting 
cute and adorable BUT THEY HURT these will give you pain I bought these shoes because they looked rather cute in the picture and considering they weren t just a 5 pair of shoes i thought they would be somewhat comfortable if not doable to wear BUYER BEWARE these shoes will cut your heels they run a little small so i suggest getting at least a half size larger if you want to do anything BESIDES sitting and looking pretty DO NOT buy these shoes I walked for less than 2 minutes before they started tearing and blistering my heels they also are a little tight on the toes so if you have a wide foot these definitely are not for you i have to admit they are darling and cute but they are NOT WORTH THE PAIN 
Tips e more like Tipsy You d better be stone cold sober when you wear these shoes as the sole isn t flat but goes up on the sides making balancing very difficult Why in the world they would make it this way is beyond me 
zipper pull tab troubles accustomed to the zipper pull tab being on the right hand side all my other zippered garments come that way this turfer men s endurance shell jacket has the pull tab on the left side which makes using it feel majorly awkward would not buy again for that reason this shell is otherwise nicely made 
lesson in magnets opposites attract likes repel One of the pairs of magnets that is supposed to keep the flap closed are oriented in such a way that the same polarity face each other Genius Not The result the flap would not close and leave a gap that just keep on repelling each other grrr One more thing only the screen is protected by a clear plastic The wheel is not 
ick didn t like these infact theyre so ugly i havent even tried them o 
Disappointing I never wear this top after having purchased it The stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them The shirt itself hangs very awkwardly I prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and therefore isn t very flattering I think I ve worn it once and will probably donate it soon Generally I have been pleased with Adidas products but this shirt did not work for me personally 
Bulkier than expected I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband and while I wasn t expecting the best quality in the world because of the price I was still a little disappointed The company did a wonderful job of packaging shipping the product even the buttons were individually protected I paid for expedited shipping but they still cut the deadline close so I was nervous about it arriving in time The lining on the inside is thick and bulky so it isn t as streamlined as the pic implies and tends to make the leather bulge a bit in places It was lumpy looking even in the box Removing the zip out lining doesn t change this there s significant padding in the shoulders It s also a shinier leather than expected Sizing chart seems a bit inaccurate I ordered a size larger than he normally wears in coats which is a size larger than his regular clothing but it was still too snug in places lining or not Overall though I d say I got what I paid for if you don t count the unusually high shipping charges Even standard shipping and handling charges were unusually high compared to other companies 
Highly disappointed I bought two of these hoping to use them as sashes in a bridal event and quickly returned them Since it took over two weeks for delivery I am uncertain as to the efficiency of the return refund The sashes are not the quality that I thought was represented by the term charmeuse and are thin and gauzy They came in a large padded envelope with a total wt of under 4oz much of that must have been the packaging A quick refund will restore some trust in this vendor and the transaction 
Chairs Manufactured by this Company are Defective I purchased six of these chairs in August for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting They were all made by this manufacturer North Pole and had different NFL logos on them I only bought one through Amazon the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues At the first game of the season my chair Steelers broke At the second game of the season two more chairs Bengals and Broncos broke They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded They all broke in the same exact place the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked Therefore 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3 5 hours Needless to say at 25 30 each I would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere 
Don t Waste Your Money The quality of this product cannot in any way compare to the genuine Apple iPod covers It is very flimsy does not fit correctly does not come with a belt clip and most importantly leaves the display area wide open to scratches and breakage That s right there is no plastic or glass protection for the display area There is a reason why this product does not cost as much as other iPod covers That s because it is of poor quality Also when you calculate the cost of the cover plus the cost of shipping it you do not get a bargin As a matter of fact if someone gave me this product for free I would not accept it because like I stated earlier it provides no protection 
Poor Customer Service At This Store The product would have been great but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes I requested XL Long pants They sent size 3X pants So they are completely unusable and do not respond to my emails I would never order from them again 
Awful These are paper thin cotton and feel rough They may soften if washed a few times but the fabric is so thin they may also disintegrate A big thumbs down from me and I m usually a CK underwear fan 
What a joke paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon this store NEVER AGAIN 
Disappointed This bra was well made fabric very soft but the sizes were way off Cup is cut to big it would be difficult to wear a scoop or v neck top as the cup covers to much of chest area Would not buy this brand again or style again even for 7 each 
Inferior product design I bought 2 Lilyette Embroidered Minimizer bra s here and both of them broke within one week I have never had such a negative experience with a product before Where the straps attach to the cup there is no strength in the attachment they broke right away Since I don t know how to get my money back or an adjustment this cost me approx 60 for a loser of a purchase My suggestion Don t waste your money on this one 
Not comfortable I really wanted to like these but they just won t stay put It s not a thong but it will be after a few hours of wear I usually love DKNY products so I am disappointed 
bears shirt The product was unsatisfactory because of how large it was My son exchanged it 
Horrible service at Amazon com I never wanted to write one of these but I feel I have to I bought these boots they were great but one size too big So I tried to exchange them Amazon doesn t do exchanges apparently too difficult On top of this the price doubled after I bought them so now if I want the boots Amazon will not honor the previous price This is something that any dime store would do but apparently one of the world s largest online retailers couldn t This is very disappointing and I would never recomend this company to anyone ever quite the opposite 
IMITATION Item is not authentic Kenneth Cole is all I wear and those shoes are not Kenneth Cole 
Amazon shipping rip off If you return items Amazon will charge you for shipping both ways whether the product was satisfactory or not Don t buy from Amazon 
give it a pass I bought this watch from REI The first one s electronics gave it up on the first night when I connected it to the PC On the second two the plastic housing started separating That s right I had to return the watch THREE TIMES the 3rd time I just wanted my money back Also it seems you have to hold your wrist up facing the sky if you want a reading Too bad the watch sounded so good 
Suunto X9i Please do not spend your time and money with this wristtop I received with battery problems it does not charge completely and suunto does not have the proper tech service available to fix it You have better and cheaper options such as forerunner 201 or 301 or the timex trail runner The suunto signal detection is quite weaker and when hiking grand canyon the unit remained most of time without capturing signal at all 
Some Clown Named Tony I am an honest seller and I insure 100 satisfaction to my customers I can also ship out a better quality beanie visor hat for you Please withdraw the feedback JTF Trading Don t bother I bought a better product from OldGlory The feedback stays People should know what they are buying Me Not a problem 1 feedback doesn t hurt us at all because all of our other customers know about our products and our excellent customer service JTF Trading Well I guess all I can do is you other customers know what a POS this hat was That and I had the hassle of this guy emailing me after I thought I made it clear that the matter was closed Try OldGlory for a better deal and a better product 
HOHUM I M JUST NOT TOO CRAZY ABOUT THIS THING DOESN T QUITE FIT RIGHT OR LOOK RIGHT AT LEAST I ONLY PAID 5 BUCKS 
Not the type hat I expected Thin cloth aweful insulation factor does not look good on me 
don t bother they are very shiney and but not very comfortable at all and the arch is funn 
just not good I ordered these for my 21 year old daughter who attends Juilliard They looked terrible because they were shiney The worst part is that the company will not allow a return or exhange 
Too damn tight I have a 33 34 waste I bought the medium size because it is advertised to be fit for 32 34 waste The thing is too tight It almost blocks circulation to my legs Plus the fabric is not entirely pleasant to the touch I was mostly disappointed with this product You can find a much better value at this price 
They shrink Big I have usually found Jockey underwear to be a value in that they generally last a long time which makes it a little less painful when you have to pay the premium price that appears to be controlled no matter where you find them sold However the last couple of their articles that I purchase through Amazon namely the Pouch Trunk Underware and A style under shirts appear fine out of the package but shrink to about half size when laundered I wear a medium size 32 waist medium build and purchased the same in both products And both of these products are painfully small after laundered I tried to wear them anyway hoping that they would stretch out to their original size as the day wore on But they were just uncomfortably too short and tight By the way I laundered them in cold water just like I do all my clothing 
Back to the Drawing Board Sling is a misnomer for this gimmick think tourniquet and you ll be closer to the reality There are several buttons and eyes on the sling to adjust the fit I tried every configuration and they all felt too tight A snug fit would be more tolerable if the thing stayed put but my experience was the same as that of other reviewers the noose slipped off after an hour or so of walking around Despite the problems with the strap I like the briefs My recommendation is to buy briefs sans strap The sling technology needs more R D before it s ready for the Big time 
Not quite what I was expecting The Sling Support feature on these underwear is practically useless My testicles always slip completely out of the sling before I ve had them on for even an hour If these briefs enhance a man s profile at all it s because they re so darn tight it has nothing to do with the Sling Support And talk about low rise the top of my crack is exposed even when they re pulled all the way up I m in pretty good shape but if these things shrink in the dryer I won t be able to fit into them anymore My advice anybody ordering C IN� briefs should go one size larger than what he d normally wear 
Caution Awkward fit and screen print I ordered the 50 s Style Rockabilly Polka Dot Dress in a 1X I am a full sized woman with a small waist and a well endowed chest The cup size for the 1X looked to be about a C cup at the most I sent back the 1X for the 3X in which the cupsize looked to be a D the dress has no support what so ever in the chest area so a bra is a must for heavier chested women The waist and back area was way too large in the 3x I was not only displeased with the fit but the quality of the material is poor as well The dots are screenprinted on so after a few washes they will begin to crack and fade it does say handwash but even still some of the dots are already lighter than others I m giving the dress two stars because the style of the dress is really nice and if you can get it to fit the right way its not a bad price at all but it s definitely not a dress that your going to have around for a long time 
Looks cheap Bah this skirt looks weird and cheap It is not sewn on the bottom just cut 
The baddest choice of buying I bought this shoes with the hope to give a surprise to mi wife my surprise was that the shoe size dosent match I m really pissed off if you gonna buy this piece of junk beware with the size 
DO NOT ORDER FROM AMAZON OR MACYS I ordered this product for a friend s bday since I got these same boots and loved them I waited weeks and weeks for her to call me and tell me how much she loves them Except it NEVER happened I was told the product went out over 2 weeks ago I call amazon and they tell me to call macys I call Macys and they tell me to call amazon I ve been told the item went out and must have gotten lost in the mail Then i am told the product was never sent out cuz it s been backordered and that Aerosoles cancelled the order Although now i ve told my friend she s getting these boots and now she s not I ve also been charged for these boots over 2 weeks ago and have made half a dozen calls to amazon and macys and had to explain this whole story to 10 different ppl and spent over 2 hrs of my LIFE trying to get this resolved Do yourself a favor and go buy this at the store or directly w Aerosoles I will never buy anything from amazon or macys online again WORST customer service ever and I am SOOOOO pissed right now 
Buyer be aware The color you think you purchased might turned out to be completely different I recently ordered a blue one From the image I was expecting a light baby blue skin But when I finally got it it s a dark navy blue It looks nothing like the one shown Also it s constantly attracting dust I am very disappointe 
cheap attache This was something that I could of bought at the flea market for 20 bucks and it cost me 60 with shippng The leather is cheap it is so thin that they lined it with batting to make it feel thicker Buyer beware Would not buy again Bottom grade leather 
Butterfly This is a very styling money clip however it is not like a big paper clip It opens like a butterfly then closes together with the strenght of the magnets It feels that your money and other cards might fall off I m not sure if the magnet could wipe of your credit card information 
Cheap thin fabric poorly fitting This is very cheaply made from very poor quality fabric The styling is not good and the fit is poor It does not resemble the photgraph I would pay at most 5 00 for this dress 
Top leather scuffed on first wear The shoes look and wear great However the leather is pretty weak I think I must have kicked a table leg or something on my frist outing in them Now the tip of my left shoe has a quarter size scuff on it I will have to try to cover it up by oiling it Obviously I don t think this pair will last long at all 
Where s the ankle elastics Classic sweatpants have elastics around the ankle to keep out of your way for biking and now spinning I hate this new style where the manufacturer saves money by imitating fashion jeans leaving the elastics out and letting the ankle cuff drag on the floor Dangerous for working out and certainly not classic 
TERRIBLE TERRIBLE BRA WHAT I MISTAKE I MADE THINKING THIS WOULD WORK OUT FOR ME TERRIBLE FIT NOT MADE FOR DD CUPS OR FOR THAT MATTER ANYONE OVER A B CUP VERY DISAPPOINTED 
Not what a expected I didn t like this item very much because it seems to have terrible quality It already came with a loose thread But it fits good 
Quick Delivery Good Quality product Dilvered quickly in time for Christmas Sweatshirt was great quality 
delivery took 2 long it took a week and two days for my pants to arrive i bought another item from amazon the same day and it arrived in three days My experience with this company s shipping wasn t good 
Improper Size I bought 3 fleece with different size but the Size of the fleece are not proper Though it says Medium Large XL everything was in same size and the length is not proper as the measurement mentioned 
Quality sucks Even though I bought these for 9 99 I still somewhat regret it The quality of the jacket is really poor Every parts of the jacket is poorly constructed from the pockets to the zippers While wearing it the jacket smells like paint or what they used to bleach the colors on I hope the smell gets out after washing I am a little concerned whether the colors will rub off easily when I wash it and onto my other clothes 
Quality is below par I am a bit disappointed in the quality It looked like a possible reject off the factory line There are threads uncut and the velcro was sewed wrong in one of the side pockets You really should not expect too much You may find something better quality in some of your local cheap department store chain 
flawed design IF YOU ARE A WEIGHTLIFTER OR BODYBUILDER THE YOKE PIPING WILL CUT INTO YOUR LATS AND PECS UNLESS YOU BUY A LARGER SIZE THAN USUAL THIS RESTRICTIVE BAND MAKES THE JACKET RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE THE VELCRO ISN T QUITE RIGHT EITHER THE MATERIAL ITSELF IS NICE TO THE TOUCH BUT THE DESIGN IS FLAWED WASN T WORTH EVEN THE SALE PRICE 
not supportive for larger sizes I was looking forward to this being a great nursing bra I loved the cotton one hand closures and the lack of underwires It felt and looked great when I tried it on but after a few hours of wearing it had the classic problem of riding up in the back Eventually I gave up wearing it at all I bought mine in a boutique where I was professionally fitted so I had the right size 34F I d recommend a Bravada bra for larger sizes they consistently fit great and stay put 
Not effective as a backpack While you might like this bag as a shoulder bag the adjustable straps do not work well as a backpack 
Very uncomfortable shoe This shoe looked nice and stylish but turned out to be very narrow even though I ve ordered it in size wide and uncomfortable Also had some glue marks on it I had to return it 
Off color This coat was listed as camel but when it arrived it was actually tan Even the tag says tan I was disappointed because it was the only Christmas gift that I had for my husband I never would have ordered a tan Also the coat fit like a whole size larger I had to return it and it has been well over a month and I still have not received my refund 
Too Large Had to send back I just mailed those back this past week to Beall s in Florida However when the mailman took it from my mailbox I am 83 and no car he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it There was l 71 due So I put 5 39 cent stamps on it which would have been 1 95 However the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I had put on it I called the post office and fortunately the postmistress believed I was being honest and told me to send it back with the mailman He wasn t a happy camper but I did send it back and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips they were okay but by that time I had changed my mind about them too Also I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it Jeanne Alle 
low quality It s true that you get what you pay for The good thing I can say about this product is that the price is right But the quality was low and the fit was poor HOwever if you are strapped for money then they are certainly wearable But get a half size smaller than you usually would get 
Foxy 01 33 4 Pointed Toe Clasic Pump These shoes were not put together very well The bottom of the heal part broke of and was bending inward from the second I put them on If I had the choice to buy this breand again I would not These shoes were very over priced and not put together well at all I am very disappionted 
save your money This jacket is worst outerwear that I have ever seen although the image might look good in here My size is usually between medium and large I ordered size medium However when I received and tried it on I end up look like wearing XXX large jacket Also the craftmanship is very poor the jacket feel uncomfortable and not smooth due to its uneven cut and badly sewing I hate to return anything that I had order online because I have to waist my time to go to post office and I have pay the shipping and handling fee Nevertheless I returned it yesterday Please don t waist your money on this order it s not worth it at all 
Christmas gift The problem I have with this purchase does not involve the product but rather the company that I purchased them from I had these shoes sent to my son as a gift Unfortunately they were shipped with the ink filled security button still in place so he was unable to wear them and since they were an online order item it has been an extreme inconvenience to make a return The company sent another pair of shoe with the instructions that they would also send a pre paid mailing label so my son could return the original pair When I spoke to my son last week he had not yet received the return label I am waiting now to see if my credit card has been billed twice for this item I am very unhappy with this purchase 
TOP IS MADE LIKE A MATERNITY TOP AND POOR QUALITY POOR QUALITY AND FLARED LIKE A MATERNITY TOP IF YOU ORDER FROM LANDS END THRU AMAZON AND THE ITEM GOES ON PRICE BREAK SEVERAL OF THE ITEMS I HAVE ORDERED HAVE GONE ON A PRICE BREAK LANDS END WILL NOT AJUST THE PRICE YOU WILL NEED TO SEND THE ITEM BACK PAY FOR MORE SHIPPING AND THEY WILL RE SHIP THEY DON T CHARGE FOR SHPPING AND THEY ACT LIKE THEY ARE DOING YOU A FAVOR THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL EVEN TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE ORDERED FROM THE DIRECT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL DO LITTLE FOR YOU SINCE YOU ORDERED IT FROM AMAZON AND THEY WILL TELL YOU UNTIL THEY AND YOU ARE BLUE IN THE FACE THAT THEY CAN NOT HELP YOU BECAUSE IT WAS ORDERED FROM AMAZON GOOD LUCK 
Havent RECIEVED IT YET Product was supposedly shipped 1 4 07 and still do not have i 
Bad Pair of Shoes I saw this pair of shoes and thought that they were very cute however when they arrived they had smalls stains on over the front of the shoe Very Very disappointed I will return the shoes and never order anything from this seller again 
Shoe Review I was very disappointed with the pair of shoes that arrived They appear used and have a small stain on them As a result I will not be wearing them or ordering shoes online again Lesson learned 
MInus 100 stars Can you say P A I N This is what Steve Madden shoes are Pain The soles must be made of cast iron The upper materials must be made of the roughest of rope or some material meant to be deliberately scratchy and rough I am convinced that this Madden person HATES WOMEN If it were in my power I would track down Steve Madden and force said person to wear their own shoe designs Only Standing Walking and Dancing even until they committed to making shoes that are fit for human beings to wear without any pain 
Absurd design makes this item useless I ordered this item with the hope of finding a new home for my ever growing collection of credit cards grocery store cards insurance cards club cards hotel cards airline cards you get the point I was disappointed to discover that placing more than one card in the wallet prevents the Accardion from collapsing enough to zip close I can t imagine how such a defective design would ever have made it to market Unless you want a really large leather case for a single credit card I would not recommend this product 
Detaches itself when you don t want it to Sadly this well designed item doesn t work for me It comes detached from its clip while I m exercising and plunges to the floor dragging my headphones off 
Item not has advertised I was disapointed with this jacket It was advertized as cashmere When I received it the label stated it was recycle cashmere and it did not look or feel like cashmere I was very disappointed and I returned the item 
Cashmere Got the jacket 65 Wool 25 Nylon and 10 Recycled Cashmere When they say Plus Size they mean it s the W size 
Hanes over the calf tubes The socks are very lightweight probably would be ok for summer use but not for work or books They were just ok I would not purchase agai 
Sizes run small I had to send this item back because it was to small The sizes run small so beware 
never got the product i never recieved the product the order was cancelled by the sende 
Runs small and cut lean I bought this for a woman who is a small size eight one of those people who is just a touch too big to wear a size six and normal medium sized clothes usually run very loose Not this tiny shirt It looked all right when she opened the package but when she wore it it made the kid look as if she had flub It was inexpensive enough that I won t bother returning it but the item although well made was sized so small as to be useles 
way too long The pajamas are way to long They look like they were made for someone 7 feet tall 
See Through Trunk The trunks look great as long as you don t get them wet because once you get them wet they become see through I guess that could be advantageous for some but i was looking for something to wear on public beaches 
Not so cute KC In my previous review very happy to receive my KC shoes but to my surprise these were a disappointment Very cheap looking there were some visible defects noticed right away too small and the bottom of the shoe looked worn Tribeca s are my favorite KC shoes but again if you wear a 9 go a size up for a better fit and comfortability Good luck shoe shoppers 
Leather Case Very Disappointing WARNING Can not use button features to operate Zen player because leather case is way too tight You can hardly get the player into the case so no amount of time or breaking in period is going to fix the problem Sadly it s like having a pair of shoes that are so tight you have to remove them so you can walk 
Okay for keeping it IN but not for using You can use this case for storage which is what I do now It doesn t allow me to click the buttons the bottom two since it squeezes it already and it s down so I can t access them Overall it s ok for just keeping your player in there I really recommend an invisible shield it works better than this case for sure This case is a bit bulky but it s alright if you don t mind taking the player out to press the buttons to change songs and put it back in Sometimes when you put it back in it will accidentally press one of the buttons which can be annoying and pretty much is Basically if you want a case to keep it in this isn t too bad but another product is better for sure Either my case was jinxed or they are all like that 
Looks great but not functional I purchased this case after getting tired of waiting for Creatives leather case to become available As far as appearance it is well crafted When it comes to functinality it stinks Here are the problems I have with it 1 there is no hole for the microphone 2 the hole for the headphone jack is not lined up properly 3 the charger and sync adapter brick can t fully engage the player because of the leather straps so it is easily disengaged by the slightest movement This is ok at home but try using this in the car if you want to charge while you listen it falls out with every turn you make This case was not designed with much thought about the functions of the zen player 
Good product if given a good one I bought this for christmas and i receive it with a large scratch rite on the hard screen where the screen is i email back to see if they could do something and they never answer back Very rude 
Unlisted boot review I wore the boots one time and it will be the only time The boots are nice in appearance but very very uncomfortable The material is so hard and did not give I even wore socks and that did not help I would not recommend this boot if you are looking for comfort 
great looking but not functional I loved the look of the boot The price was great I guess you get what you pay for They run a size small There is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location You break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off Believe me I tried I really wanted to keep the boots based on the look Once on they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all I am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe I tend to be pretty easy I just could not make these work Sorry 
Nice This is the only Haynes T shirt that does not bunch at the back of the neck It is light and drapes well But it is too light for printing 
Zipper problem I purchased this as a gift for a teenager She told me that it is difficult to zip as the fabric gets stuck in the zipper It is being returned 
spandex and cotton blend in the most unfortunate blue I can t imagine who could pull off these clown pants They re unwearable What was Hanes thinking 
Did not like product but satisfied with return The product was not quite what I expected but I got a quick return to my satisfaction Happy shopping 
OW I bought this from a different vendor and started working out with it immediately interspersing it with my usual cardio workouts I usually lift weights have no prior injuries and consider myself in pretty good shape as well as pretty used to working out and using proper form I played a college sport etc After a couple days of using this product my neck and shoulders started spasming and were so stiff that I could barely move them regularly It was clearly not from the amount of weight since i am used to using much heavier free weights included Perhaps I was doing the exercises incorrectly but that seems like a real risk with a video like this 
BE CAREFUL MY BACK IS KILLING ME Sorry to give such a bad review but I can t in good conscience give a better one I did this workout one time with the 8 lb ball and have not been able to do any kind of exercise since I am entering my second week of taking pain killers for my messed up lower back There are several segments including ab work where the ball is held with straight arms and moved from the down position to up over the head as well as twisting side to side While doing these moves I kept thinking that they really did not seem sound for that much weight Sure enough by that evening I was dying Perhaps they d be ok if you used the lightest weight ball I am in good shape and have actually been doing the P90X extreme workouts I am accustomed to using 20 40 lb weights and do Tae Kwon Do and I do not have any back problems I snatched this up when I finally found it for a good price and did it on an off day Just be forewarned it is really easy to hurt your back with this workout I LOVE ALL the other Firm workouts but will never do this one again Additionally when I received this from Amazon the ball was misshapen the DVD case was broken from the weight of the ball They immediately sent a replacement which was damaged in exactly the same way 
Not what is is advertised to be This bag is so cheap looking I am embarrassed to use it When I saw it online it looked identical to a US Luggage bag I bought at TJ Maxx which was stolen So I was very excited to find what I thought was the same bag on Amazon to replace it When I got it I was shocked at how cheap it looks The handles especially are plastic leather and just hideous The return policy through eBags is such a hassle that I am just going to keep it and use it for bringing my laptop to and from work but I will still need to find a better travel laptop bag I m very disappointed If you re looking for a professional looking laptop bag this isn t it I should have known better for the price but like I said I thought it was the same as the other US Luggage bag I had which was gorgeous and I loved it Oh well 
i don t know why but it is an ugly dress it doesn t look like the pic maybe it s my shape i have wide angular shoulders but it is very high on the chest which made me look a little granny like 
Memory foam remembers to be squished flat I was so disappointed in this product I bought the ad hook line and sinker thinking that the memory foam was a great idea that it would give me bilateral plantar fascitis suffering feet some long awaited relief After about 2 hrs of wear the foam is completely flat which leaves the formerly snuggly slippers sloshing around on your feet and you flapping about as if walking on cardboard SAVE YOUR MONEY These are awful 
No brand no directions no value While this product appears very nice in pictures and upon arrival it does not function to transmit the IPOD via FM frequency It can hook to the IPOD cradle the IOPD and charge the IPOD but it does not transmit The product was made in China but has no other company information to search for techincal assistance or return While I could probably process back through Amazon and the seller it is not worth my effort All in all a complete loss of cost and shipping for this product 
Bad choice this device didnt work properly at all i lost my money on this purchase sorry but that s how i feel 
Broke before I could use it Plugged it into my wife s car Set it listened to 1 2 of a song then went to remove it to try it in my car The plug part broke apart in cigarette lighter leaving part of the plug in the jack Returned it Satechi sent my refund quickly 
Great I love the color and the flexibility of the material It doesn t slip out of your hand and the cover gives full protection 
disappointed I expected this bag to be much more comfortable but I have to constantly pull it back up on my shoulder just as often as other handbags However I do like all the compartments for organizing 
Somehow not as good as Birks They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks I sent the size 44 back which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks is it the Boston and got the 45 and it STILL feels small The upper is ok the shoe isn t the best made thing but is adequate it s just the size thing that bothered me 
Disappointed Does not say on amazons site that these are shipped in narrow widths only Supplier does not carry the wide ones Birkenstocks are normally wide unless you specify narrow widths Not here No exchange possible Now I m stuck with shoes that don t fit and midwest sports couldn t care less I won t ever order from them again 
not sure how it rates never got to see it because shipping company carelessly left it on my porch and someone stole it along with other items contacted seller and u p s both told me basically I was out 45 00 tryed to report it to amazon but they intentionally have no contact info on their web site live and learn won t shop amazon again thanks 4 nothing amazo 
Not durable and you can buy it in many places Well it is a cool product and good idea to use But the bulb was broken in first 3 days We put the second one on Dont know how long this second one will last We used it only few minutes in the morning when we need to get some cloth out of closet Also it is not on line product only I found Bed Bath Beyond has it and CVS has it They sell 9 99 Without extra bulb But still misleading to say online only 
Don t waste ONE dollar on this piece of junk Maybe just maybe someone will buy one of these Stick Up Bulbs and maybe just maybe the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out I thought to myself buy another one because maybe this one was defective I bought three more every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use It s a great idea but a worthless piece of junk The spare bulb Useless as well Don t waste a dollar on this junk If I could have found the receipts I would have gotten my money back 
does not last This light worked for one day I should have known better because in the past I bought a tap light and it worked for only a few days too Don t waste your money 
Pfff I have a small head and it makes it look huge Maybe if i had a big head it would look alright pfff 
Holes after only two months I got both my sons these socks and really liked the performance thickness etc However it has been only two months and several of my three year olds socks now have holes in the toes the heels and you can see the fabric wearing thin and about to have holes at other places My 8 month olds socks are fine however he doesn t give them the wear of a three year old So if you have a baby these socks are great If you have a preschooler very poor choice 
Nice Logo poor material Turn around time to receive item was good Material of the shirt was sub par very thin for the price 
Very disappointing These jeans were so very disappointing After hearing about PDC many times I was excited to own a pair But these jeans were made of cheap uncomfortable fabric and the style just doesn t work I won t be buying PDC again 
Runs Very Small My son runs true to size on most clothing including Childrens Place but the PJs run very small and when I held them up to each other the different patterns were sized different At 5 months he is still wearing 3 6 mo in most PJs but already grown our of Childrens Place 6 9 mo PJs I bought several pairs and some of them he never could wear Buy a different brand unless you can go to the store and actually try them on 
These Boots Are Not Meant For Walking In theory this boot seemed perfect added some height came in perfectly wearable colors was made of real leather the price was unbeatable BUT yes unfortunately a big but like everything else which seems perfect it was perfectly flawed I did my research read the reviews and ordered a boot half size bigger than my usual But still was super tight across the ankle and top of my feet totally crushing my veins I m a big shoe collector and I can recognize a design error when I see one Surprisingly that it came from this brand usually so quality reliable These boots are not meant for walking If you want to take a pretty picture in them they might fulfill THAT purpose 
Foxfire 22 pocket vest Good features include many pockets Bad feature is the poor quality of the vest lining As a result the two pockets where I carried car keys developed holes after a couple of weeks Avoid this product if you intend to carry keys in the pockets 
not satisfied I thought this case would be like the ipod cases I have seen that look like they are actually part of the ipod it is not The case does not fit properly on the ipod and slips off the top leaving room for damage The belt clip is difficult to get on and off and the stand doesn t work well Overall I would not recomend this product 
No Poor fit for 80gb stick on film to protect video face is a joke it s cheap but save your money on this and buy something better 
Okay for the Price It is a comfortable little t shirt dress for 9 bucks Be careful because the sizes run small If you get it buy a size larger than you normally would 
You re kidding me I bought this as a surprise for my wife When we opened it I thought that 1 we were shipped a pillowcase by mistake or 2 they hadn t finished it Edges are raw and unfinished It is a complete waste of money because returning it will mean that the shipping both directions will cost me more than the dress cost I understand that you get what you pay for but this was a piece of garbage This dress in the picture is OBVIOUSLY pinned and pulled back to give it any shape whatsoever The picture does NOT accurately represent this item at all This will fit like a potato sack folks I notice that the raw edges are now listed as a feature Ahem In a recent e mail exchange with them I was told that their words now quality is a subjective issue They have pestered me to change my feedback and I have challenged them three times now to point out any inaccuracies in my feedback and I would absolutely recant them In their defense my money has now been refunded Now anybody want to buy a pillowcase with three holes in it worn for 90 seconds It would have been off sooner but my wife was laughing too hard to get it back over her head Wish I could rate as a zero 
barely serviceable Save yourself the trouble and get the BRAIDED 3 line latex hose type of clothesline Want suction cups rings snap hooks etc Buy them for pennies at a drug store The problem with this clothesline is that you can t make your clothes stay in position with only 2 lines they slide down to the lowest point in the middle The only way you can keep clothes somewhat separate so that they ll dry is with a braided line period 
Bad Sole The sole of the my shoe started to wear out only after three days of use I won t recommend it to anyone 
ok really tight at the front for 30 i guess i cant complain but this are not good looking or comfortable shoe 
Not worth your time and money I was going to surprise my girlfriend with a nice just because gift When I opened the package I was really disappointed The color of the item was more brown than eggplant and the quality of the fabric was like stitching shop rags together Now I have to return the item because it just looks bad The problem with returning is the non refundable 7 50 to ship to me and the 5 95 I have to pay to ship it back to them I also have to take away a star for receiving the item late and having to hassle with their customer service department who couldn t find my order 
no good shoes bad shoe for sure it is not for running but want a cheap shoe for some dirty yard work this may d 
Fake Shouldn t Amazon address this in some way If it is real I would buy it if it is fake and the previous poster certainly seems right on that score shouldn t this be off Amazon s site I think it becomes an issue of Amazon s credibility 
This vendor is not an authorized distributor of this bag I purchased a bag from this vendor thinking that by being affiliated with Amazon that they were legit I got the bag and thought it looked fake The vendor told me to take it to the nearest boutique The boutique confirmed that it was NOT authentic so I am returning the bag I got from Moda Party and feel cheated by the high price paid for a phoney unauthentic bag 
Not as comfortable This shoe isn t as comfortable as my other Keds shoes It also doesn t breath as well If you have a tendency to develope hot feet this wouldn t be a good purchase for you It also needs the new insoles that the newer Keds shoes have 
They must think we are stupid So I ordered this shirt and I got an entirely diffent one the packing slip had the right order The shirt I received was long sleeved crew neck with a notch in it Ans when I called them the person I spoke to was not the least bit shocked amazed or even willing to send the right one she just said send it back think twice unless you don t mind making trips to the post offic 
Lovely but POOR color quality These were a gift at Christmas and were a deep burgundy color they do appear to be well stitched however after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don t look like a match anymore the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much 
I Wont do it again I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy I made a mistake by buying i 
Passable Second Wallet This wallet is fifty fifty The inside is great and holds cards as a wallet should The outside well the UNCOVERED metal clip does not press against the leather so you need about 10 folded bills to get the right thickness to close the gap between the inside of the clip and the leather less than 10 bills and expect the bills to separate from the wallet in your pocket ok but not good in the open Maximum number of bills about 20 folded Occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used The metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers If the clip is facing out before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse other objects So I started facing the clip in resting against my thigh not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh But facing in is very awkward when seated like driving Definitely not designed for back pockets Why Buy As a second wallet one should have at least two wallets to separate credit cards IDs so all is not lost if one wallet is lost stolen Put the small bills and one or two ONLY small limits credit cards in your back pocket wallet pull the back pocket one out for the bandits and run away with this other wallet on you As a gift for any guy romantic or non romantic 
WAY Too Small A year or so ago I bought several of these on sale They are poorly sized I have 4XT far too tight for a big man like me to wear comfortably Maybe you could order several sizes too big to get a good fit but unless you want everyone to see every roll of fat I d avoid buying these 
Bostonian Men s Tahoe Oxford Black 14 W The shoes are true to size and very comfortable But only 3 months after purchase the sole and the upper leather are starting to seperate Really expected a better quality 
Thought it was bigger Just too small for wat i needed it for had to went and get something else bigger to use 
Slippers fell apart I gave these slippers to my mother for Christmas and they do not hold up well The first pair came apart in the wash and the second pair hasn t been washed yet but they re already coming apart also Not a good buy 
Do not recommend They totally fell apart after wearing them 2 or 3 times I expected more having paid nearly 20 for a pair of slippers VERY dissapointed 
the worst slipper i have ever bought after only one week use at home the sole was completely broken the worst quality slipper i have ever seen 
I did not purchase this shoe I didn t purchase this shoe I ordered two pairs of another Dr Scholl s that day You must have an error in the records 
POLYESTER NOT COTTON This item is not 100 cotton Rather it is 100 polyester 
Misled on search results We were disappointed when we received this because it showed up in a search with silk robes and pajamas and I guess I assumed tht it was silk Rather stiff and uncomfortable 
wouldn t buy again Very nice feeling robe and fit well Although I only had it 3 weeks and one washing and the seams on the lapel started coming undone My wife is now making me one instead 
Plastic I purchased this expecting a high quality Satin robe but what I received was a run of the mil polyester robe Yes it is shiny but it feel like plastic Sadly this will be returned 
Stuart Little he ain t We have a big smiling rubber rat in the state store where I work but he isn t nearly as menacing as this sucker In fact s he s kinda friendly This guy s a beast blood red eyes sharp claws looks like he d take your throat if you slipped and fell in the bathroom No ordinary broom neccesary here friends no what you need is a can of mase and a nightstick Buy this guy set him in the windows of a dark room and call the cops God knows they need some useful stuff to do at night besides drink coffee and play video games Would get more stars but he s damn expensive 
don t bother the box it came in looked like it had been torn apart by a pack of wild dogs when i received it fur was falling off of the coat as i pulled it out of the box i tried it on just to see if i d like a replacement since it was not in perfect condition and it was NOT cute on i immediately returned it 
Jipped Originally ordered a COMPLETELY different model armband for 15 bux GOT THIS ONE we ll see if my 80 gb video will fit doubt it AMAZON bad call on this seller son 
Not for the 5th generation This case is actually made for fourth generation models and although it is being advertised as being for the fifth the case is too big for a snug fit It works but I didn t spend this money for something that was advertised as being made for the new Ipod Real scam 
Not worth the money This is a cheap and flimsy armband NOT THE ONE IN THE PICTURE There are much better on Amazon for less money 
I ordered a bathrobe but got a tent The fabric of the bathrobe was wonderful Egyptian cotton but the bathrobe was huge It was more like a tent than a bathrobe It was an anniversary present for my wife size 8 and the bathrobe was one size fits all as long as you wear a size 18 I was very disappointed that I could not have ordered at least a general size large medium or small 
Lands End Price K Mart Quality The phrase more efficient sourcing means that Lands End is now buying these in China The pants arrived with a strange smell fishy odor the fit was odd and after one washing the fabric looked bad They went back ASAP I bought khakis from Lands End for over a dozen years until this recent product change Notice the past tense Ownership by K Mart Holdings is definitely making an impact on the company 
Don t last very long The cheaper variety at Walmart 8 92 versus 19 and up No Boundaries brand is better for me due to the fact that they are harder and more firm more like a Birkenstock cork sole which I also find very comfortable for me anyway They do last longer too and are not affected by heat in any way Walmart also has a real color explosion going on You can get some really wild color combinations which give the shoe have a little personality for those occasions when you feel the need to express yourself So for the cheaper price Walmart offers I feel the value and quality exceeds the more expensive brands out there If you are looking for a firm Birkestock type sole the No Boundaries brand Croc is a shoe in no pun intended 
Don t wash your crox I washed em and they shrunk up so small I can t wear em anymore bummer 
Gave me blisters I would not reccomend wearing these hose for very long at all The silicone bands which hold them up were burning my legs by halfway through my wedding day and left me with blisters on my wedding night 
Fast delivery but qulity did not meet my expectatio The fast delivery and reasonable price for these shoes almost make me ignore the not so perfect pair of shoes I received They look like some floor model and somewhat tried on with part of the heels on both shoes cut off resembling rejects I am sure I will not show them off much when I wear them 
Cheesey If you like cheap furniture you ll love this boot The slave labor used to make this boot was wasted 
I Wish I Had Not Bought It At Amazon The robe does not fit me I wanted to return it got a return item number got busy and did not get it in the mail soon enough They have a strict 30 day return ploicy Nordstroms does not do this I could exchange it there Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules I will go elsewhere next time 
Marilyn Satin Dress I received the wrong size originally The company was prompt in sending me another dress however I received a third dress which I refused by mail and I am trying to get my credit card adjusted The dress is lovely 
Green shuffle case I thought the case was nice looking but when actually using it I was very dissapointed The case is not secure at all it keeps sliding off If you have the little clip on iPod shuffle I do not recommend the aluminum case 
Cashmere sweater The quality was very poor it was very wrinkled and to thin for a mens winter sweater I send it back 
Feels Like Paper I was very dissatisfied with this purchase The material feels like paper and the seams were all crooked Then when I returned it I got an ugly email Keep looking for the price you can find something of much better quality 
Disappointed with the service Never got to wear this Lingerie at all Mailed item back for exchange due to a wrong size recieved but no one got back Sent several emails to check on item for exchange but in the end got a reply saying that they will credit the amount back to my credit card Sent another email to emphasise that I requested for an exchange instead of refund but no one got back Very Very bad servic 
Cheap Not worth the price at all The bead work looks very cheap The color does not look the way its shown in the picture Decided to return it the moment I opened the box 
not as nice looking as the photo I received this item as a gift and was disappointed when I pulled it out of the box It s okay but not as cute looking as the photo makes it seem The beads on the hem and chest look nice in the photo but are rather cheap looking It looks like something I could make myself Very cheap and plain looking 
bad product it doesnt fit well the joystick doesnt function right with it on the buttons are difficult to use the product was poorly mad 
Not Happy with product My son wripped his right away trying to put it on his psp he said it was hard to get to the buttons to play 
The size don t match I ordered this items in size xx large for my 20 months doughter and there are huge Maybe will fit when she will be 4 or 5 although she looks normaly for her age 
Betula Licensed by Birkenstock Black Suede Clog Size 37 Disappointing I wear size 37 Birkenstocks and these are one half inch shorter than my other clogs 
Negative experience After wearing the Betula Birkenstocks for about an hour the snap button kept coming undone near the buckle Happened pretty much every 10 minutes when i walked Midwest wont take them back since i wore them 
Warm Comfortable The length of the jacket could be a little longer bairly hits the belt 
These Are Great Hey I m twelve years old and I just want to tell all of you other boys out there that you really need to try these They feel really nice on the skin and they don t bunch up as easily as boxers and boxer briefs do They also give really good support to your penis They keep it in one place the whole day without the discomfort Boys ya ll all seriously need to try these undies out They re awesome 
if you like wegies and being panted get these Dont buy parents on less you want to have to remove your kids under wear from there butt s or if you want to tie a chain and lock around there pants so they dont get panted so dont but these because removing under wear can be award 
So where can you get the panty pictured i too have been searching for the panty in the picture i ordered 3 of these and the main difference is the amount of fabric at the highest part of the leg there should only be a 1 2 inch of fabric but there is more like 3 inches yuk b has anyone been able to locate the panties that are pictured the ones that we all seem to love and want please email me personally if u have found them sheemna yahoo co 
NOT WHAT I ORDERED Like every review before mine my order was wrong as well The picture is incorrect and needs to be updated I waited a long time for these items and was disappointed to find a misleading design yes it s a real hassle to send them back and wait for a refund I strongly feel that if Amazon was really concerned with customer satisfaction then they would have taken care of this issue sooner Is this just another big uncaring corporation This experience has tainted my shopping experience and leads me to not wanting to shop with Amazon for anything again 
Not as pictured I ordered these based on the picture a high cut brief These are not the ones they sent me and now I have to pay to return them Rip off Zero stars 
Item not as pictured My wife has purchased and worn this style for many years however the items received were nothing like the picture The pictured item was exactly what she wanted lace waistband AT not below her waist and high cut leg openings the delivered item was an entirely different style with an entirely different and unsatisfactory fit She d opened all the items to check them individually before discovering that items had to be unopened and in the original shipping packaging in order to be accepted for return 
Underwear The item that is PICTURED is the item that I wanted and ordered However the item that is described and that I received Halfpant is NOT what is pictured What is pictured is a hi cut pant I did not realize this until I received the order and was greatly disappointed I had to send everything back You are misrepresenting what you are selling by having the incorrect picture of the item I actually would give this 0 stars but the computer would not allow that 
Quality matches price This was a poorly made product Even when left still on a table North took about 2 min to locate something unusable for most people who are out on the run and need to know where North is NOW Also it advertises a thermometer on the packaging but there wasn t one I could find I ended up returning this for a full refund 
Fluffies don t hold up Based on the prior reviews I fully expected to like these Unfortunately I don t and won t buy more They don t stay up I don t have particularly large or small calves and don t have that issue with my other athletic socks Oh well buy and learn I bought both white and black and they are equally disappointing 
Very Uncomfortable These socks have an excess of thread bundled at the corners of the toe seams If this sort of design bothers you as it does me then these are not the socks for you These socks cause a lot of discomfort for me 
Not very quality I would not buy this sweater It is flimsy and not very quality feeling The price was too good to be true 
Red Wallet Review I found the wallet to be cheap looking and MUCH smaller than the picture lead me to believe To call this a wallet is a gross misrepresentation of the actual product This is more of an insert to a wallet consisting of a few card places and a small zippered pocket I wasn t pleased with the purchased expecting quite a bit more the 14 I spent I can go to Target and get a wallet for less that what I paid for this one and it will be a FULL wallet not a sorry wannabe 
poor quality After one washing the letters were all rolled up I was able to pull the rest of it off and now it is just a grey onesie The quality of the graphic was horrible 
Very poorly designed The upper portion of the boots which is supposed to hug your calf is ridiculously huge The shoe portion fit I have relatively normal sized calves and I was swimming in these boots I immediately returned tham 
Big mistake These underwear were supposed to be size 34 but I could barely shimmy them up over my legs The fit was so tight that I could not wear them even though all my other underwear is size 34 and fits fine They are also made of a very thin and flimsy grade of cotton and the fly does not provide enough overlap to keep everything where it belongs If you must try these buy them at least 2 sizes larger but you would do better with another product 
Awful and uncomfortable Awful fit I usually love wacoal petites because they are generally a perfect fit for me HOWEVER the mesh on this one is terrible because it rolls At first I thought it was the size so I purchased another and found the same issue Steer clear of this model 
silly goose slippers finally arrived and i was a little bit dissapointed construction was cheap goose fill was light and overall flimsy if you want to wear it twice then thats what its worth 
Very Disappointed I ve purchased several of these bras in the past from Qvc as their ad states and was surprised to see it so cheap here Though I was suspicious I ordered one anyway Not surprisingly the cups puckered when I tried it on Never had this problem with any ordered from QVC When I inquired about returning it I was disappointed to find they have a no return policy though not posted anywhere I could find easily I believe this company sells 2nds though does not advertise that fact I will not purchase from this company again and I am now leery about purchasing through Amazon in general 
too sheer i bought this product several weeks ago they looked nice but they are extremely sheer they ripped right away which was very disappointing 
No LUV from Luvable Friends poor quality I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old Luvable Friend s onsies are awful The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies And the velcro doesn t even stick They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old Lastly even the shirt tag stinks It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son Shame on them for making such a cheap product shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review 
Don t buy these shirts I bought a bunch of these shirts because I saw the good reviews At first I was happy they fit perfect then I washed them once in cold water and they shrunk more than I ever seen shirts shrink in my life My medium shirts became XXS I wish I had a 8 year old son because he would be the only person that would be able to fit in them now 
Deluxe Check Book Cover Found the item to be poorly designed Did not fit my checks or recorder Item is useless unless you use checks with side tear 
Nicely slimming but straps don t help much Like the last reviewer said it s tricky to put on using the little straps that go around your bra that is a FACT A front closure bra might help some Even though I finally and after a lot of cussing got the straps around my bra the garment still gapped underneath the bra on both sides of the back strap which is right in the middle That is the only place in the back there is a strap to hold the whole back of the girdle up Then there is one strap under each arm that goes around your bra there It pulled down on my bra there causing scrunching There is one strap in front in the middle too which I don t need to use The directions say to attach the Spanx straps to the bra and step into the garment RIGHT Much easier said than done For it to stay up properly in the back I think it needs straps not only right in the middle but also to the left and right of the middle in between that and the under the arm ones I can t really use mine A waste of money I already removed the tags and can t send it back I have another Spanx that is the same but without the little straps and I can t use that either as it does creep down in the back Unless you don t MOVE that is So altogether I have spent about 150 for Spanx stuff I can t use There must be a better way to fasten those straps maybe sturdy SNAPS or velcro or something and they should fasten right to the TOP edge of the garment as it is they hook half an inch down on the inside and that causes the top edge to tend to roll out and cause bulk there Not happy 
Things Went Wrong Have purchased from this seller in the past with zero problems This time was different They sent the wrong shorts I paid the shipping to send them back I asked please send the right shorts They credited my account an amount smaller than I paid And that was that Certainly not satisfied 
cant review it because it was never shipped I received an email from amazon asking me to review this item I had purchased This item never arrived from Macy s I emailed them and they said they would ship it immediately and I would have it in ten business days 3 weeks later I still didnt have the item I contacted them back and was advised the item is no longer available My account was reportedly credited but poor service on this item 
Sizing is misleading beware I found these shoes by searching the women s option for running shoes The name may say Unisex but there is no indication that the sizing is 100 male Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size When the shoes arrived here they were huge I tried to return them but Amazon considers this to be MY fault and planned to charge back any shipping promotions and coupons against a possible refund I had done very well using a coupon a sale a buy 80 worth of shoes and get 20 off instantly promotion and Amazon prime so my refund would be less than nothing That s right if I return the shoes I owe money Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women s section of the site might be men s shoes instead Yeah that seems fair 
Nice looking but A beautiful checkbook cover that even has a pen holder But the problem is when I put the checks in regular sized the cover will not lay flat Perhaps it will after awhile but I ve never had a checkbook cover do this before I can t recommend this item 
Shirt runs VERY small I purchased this shirt for my golfer mom for Christmas and had to return it I bought an XL because she normally wears a 16 but the shirt was about the right size for me an 8 The quality seemed to be fine but the sizing was very misleading 
nice leather god awful construction The leather on these gloves is soft and supple and they re warm thats about all that I can say that is good There were scuffs when I got them the stitching was ripping and finished itself off soon after and the fingers were different lengths on each glove avoid at all costs 
I Wont do it again I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy I made a mistake by buying i 
hot little corset i bought this dress because i thought it looked so good on the model in the photo but i should have taken into consideration i couldnt see the front The boobs on the dress were very weird and pointy and the ties up the back looked awful It might be good for someone with a different figure than mine but i think my boyfriend would have been more amused than aroused if he had seen me in it 
Not the best quality but a very kind company It was very kind of the company to refund the items when i had to send them back But the quality of the shirts where not the quality i am used to have when i buy orginal Van Heusen shirts 
Very Disappointed This was my second time ordering a Dickies jacket and being disappointed I will not do it again The zipper gets stuck on a flap of material almost everytime I zip or unzip it I contacted Andrew Christian over ninety days ago by e mail and I was ignored Today I decided to send him a message through Amazon and found out it was to late I thought that the time limit was 180 days I like everything else about the jacket but this problem has cost me a lot of time and frustration there must be a better brand for my money somewhere out there 
Kenneth Cole Reaction Women s Cos I Stretch Boot These boots where definitely a disappointment from Kenneth Cole They did not resemble leather in the least They looked terrible on me maybe there is someone out there that they would look good on 
Not exactly as pictured Be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards I bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards my ID and some cash Hence there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet From the picture it looks as though the business card side is just a slot Whereas in reality it is actually a pouch like most of the other card holders Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother which takes up quite a bit of space the leather itself is very low quality and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it Furthermore on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China I mean China is great and all but if you re on a date and you say Hey let me pay for this and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China well you are pretty much a schmuck I cut mine out with a pair of scissors but there are still some remnants So if you like being low class by all means buy this wallet I personally don t care about my wallet very much so I am keeping it and going to use it but I almost returned it It is most definitely a solid 2 stars Hope this helps 
I Wish I Had Not Bought It At Amazon The robe does not fit me I wanted to return it got a return item number got busy and did not get it in the mail soon enough They have a strict 30 day return ploicy Nordstroms does not do this I could exchange it there Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules I will go elsewhere next time 
Color Not The Same i bought a green ipod scok thinking the it would be that same as the picture they show at the top of the page but it ended up having a lighter green than what they showed and what i wanted 
This is not genuine Ipod sock Even though it works just fine like Ipod Ipod sock it s quite disappointed that this is not a genuine one It s acceptable thoug 
Whole thing runs small I ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie There s there s zero stretch in this it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big Since they re short from crotch to waist anyway it doesn t much matter The top fits better since you adjust it The cut is still quite poor and again there s no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders It s one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust It s another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem If you re narrow through the hips shoulders or bust this combo will probably be a nice fit If you re curvy you might want to rethink this It s a shame since it comes in plus sizes Maybe I should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit IMO 
NO SUPPORT UGHHHHHHH ALSO DIDN T LAST I had purchased this bra it was recommended by a fitter so I tried it on it felt comfortable enough I am a 36 DD after 3 wearrings all I did was sag it did not hold it s shape and I hand wash all my lingerie This is the worst bra and very pricey Makes you look wide not a very good garment for me anyway TRY THE CHAMPION 1123 for the ultimate support and comfort great t shirt bra there is also a racer back by wacoal that is great also This one I hated and I had purchased more than one just wore them till they DIED and they DIED fast I truly beleive in the BALI bra VF is good to after 6 months you have to replace all bras anyway why spend more than 40 00 Thanks hope this helped 
No product to review I returned this bra to exchange for size the day after I received it in October It is now January and I have not yet received the replacement I have called several times but to no avail I can t give a good review of this product because I haven t actually gotten to wear the bra 
Pretty but petty Buying this was a mistake This bra lifts up exposing half my breats which is visible under a shirt The straps are not comfortable it s cuts deep into the shoulders it should be atleast padded Def not what I expected from this product The material and pattern is the only thing I liked it has a sexy look to it 
HORRIBLE AND HORRIFYING FIT AND QUALITY I had several of these shipped to my Mum in law s in California for sending to me in France where we work and live Because of a decent delivery speed and her thinking they looked OK I gave them a rating of 5 Stars Today after even having BOILED them in water hoping for shrinkage I am sad to say that nothing happened They are horrid to wear I oredered a medium size and the fit is that of XXXXXXXL DO NOT BUY THIS HORRORS I wish I could get my hard earned money back as now I m wondering if I was the brunt of a joke in Nightmare Alley You ve got to be con artist to sell these things 
Not impressed I did not expect the Jockey to not show any lines but there was absolutely no difference between these and a regular pair of bikini These should be renamed Jockey Show Everything Bikini 
Pashmina shawl The shawl is very thin not good quality I suspect it is not cashmere at all but some kind of a mixture of cheap wools The color was supposed to be expresso not even that promise was fulfilled it is a much lighter brown I do not recommend this shawl at all 
Failed Although merchandise arrived quicker than promised and the color was perfect the socks didn t even last through one baseball game lousy product 
Having troubles getting my item exchanged Returns and exchanges are very slow process has taken a month so far 
OUCH These shoes are cute but not practical at all I generally wear high heals 4 inches and even more but these are the most painful shoes I have ever tried on I ordered these and the peep toe sling back version These are really narrow in the two my foot feels so constricted in there they totally cut off your circulation And forget about even trying to walk in these Very poorly constructed The peepttoe slings however are great fit true to size and are comfortable 
Not true to size I think that these shoes are very sassy but I ran into one problem ordering them online they aren t true to their size I always wear a 6 1 2 but after putting these on my feet were asleep after about 10 minutes Order wisely 
Not as expected they were not as heavy weight as stated to me they seem more like a regular t shirt and the size seems to be a little smaller than norm after first washing they really shrink I will not buy any more

Not recommended I purchased 5 of the Anvil SS Henleys in assorted colors not long ago Out of the box they were good quality After 2 washes however they have shrunk drastically to the point that they cannot be tucked in anymore My personal opinion waste of money 
Different color shade of leather Was disappointed with the color of the shoe because there is a difference between the left and right shoe At first i thought the wrong models were packed in the box But no it s the shade of the leather that is different left shoe is darker than the right shoe Being in Singapore it will be expensive for me to ship back for replacement I had the shoe delivered to my Brother in law in L A who brought it back to Singapore for me 
I Wish I Had Not Bought It At Amazon The robe does not fit me I wanted to return it got a return item number got busy and did not get it in the mail soon enough They have a strict 30 day return ploicy Nordstroms does not do this I could exchange it there Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules I will go elsewhere next time 
Not that great I just bought 5 pairs of dickies everyday scrubs from another online company and was very disappointed I picked Dickies because they were cute cheaper than most and seemed like they would last The colors are really nice but the light pastel colors are almost see through I tried them on and was able to see my patterned underpants through the scrubs The ankles are tapered not obnoxiously so but definitely tapered The medium bottoms have a HUGE amount of extra fabric in the belly The fabric is rough and feels like plastic 
Very disappointed I have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats I m very disappointed This is supposed to be a reversible coat However the hem of the black side is too long Consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed And it does not look good at all The company needs to revise this pattern 
Maidenform Lace Tanga Pants These were a waste of money They were not properly designed to cover ANYTHING much less my backside even though I did order what SHOULD have been the right size I realize I have a lot to cover but I ordered a size that was supposed to do the trick I ve still got a pair in white that I haven t even opened And won t It would be a waste of energy 
terrible quality cheap looking jacket Coat was of VERY cheap quality The fur around hood was matted No way I would wear or recommend this coat It went staight to Good Will I guess you get what you pay for Unless it is free you are paying too much 
Not what I expected After seeing the photo and reading the other reviews I thought this would be a good buy I m not really thrilled about this jacket It s a flimsy rain jacket and not a stormbreaker It doesn t have that good quality lining that gives jackets that heavy feel This is something you can easily find at Walmart on sale for 9 99 
XL WHATEVER I must not have read the fine print This shirt MUST be a childs size It just fit Then one wash and way too small How can this be considered an XL 
Not recommended I bought this Speedo because I like its new strechy fabric and the handsome design The biggest problem is that the 1 inch wide elastic band can not stay flat on my waist after a few uses I own several Speedo swimming trunks this one is the worst If the band can be improved I will rank it at least 3 stars 
Late Delivery Paid for expedited delivery and it showed up four days later then anticipated 
Land s End is alienating its loyal customers I agree with what others have said about the re designed Sport Knit Pants I had been happily buying the tapered leg cotton sport knit pants for at least a dozen years when Lands End decided to start making them with a wide straight leg instead presumably because some customers had requested the newer look Maybe I m wrong but I think most people who are looking for the latest fashion aren t going to suddenly start shopping at Lands End And it seems to me that if a few customers are requesting a new style the company should make a new ADDITIONAL product in that style rather than re design a product which according to Lands End s own descriptions was a perennial customer favorite I returned the new pants and this formerly loyal Lands End customer is now shopping elsewhere 
They shrink they fade no matter what you do I bought 5 pairs had to return 1 because the legs were different lengths The 4 remaining were much too long the ends of the pants were under my heels I knew they d shrink but despite washing them in cold water and drying them on medium or low they barely reach my ankle bone I like my pants longer than that And they ve faded to navy blue even though I used Woolite for dark laundry Nothing else has faded as much as these pants Also they re lighter weight than they used to be I used to be able to wear these all winter long in southern New England and they were warm enough for just about anything Now the wind whistles through them Sorry Land s End I ll try LL Bean next time 
Disappointed I have purchased these beloved sport pants for years The cut of these pants has been changed with this order The quality of the cut and fabric is much lower now I returned the item 
IF IT AIN T BROKE DON T FIX IT I ve been buying Land s End Sport Knit Pants for over 15 years Land s End clothing for much longer They ve redesigned these COMPLETELY and are doing this to all of their women s pants Don t be fooled into thinking you ll be getting what you used to order Also this resizing redesigning of women s pants is systemic LL Bean is discontinuing their similar Perfect Fit Pants and having all of their pants knit or otherwise resized redesigned Here s just a few of their improvements Among the changes The waist band height width has shrunk from 1 5 inches to 1 0 inches It now rolls Fun not Next the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches = 5 inch relaxed when not being worn to a whopping 28 to 29 inches It was great fun to put on the ones I ordered and even after washing them I thought I must have changed bodies overnight The waist just hung Dare I put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down When I tried walking in them that s exactly what happened and I was constantly having to pull them back up I had to pin the waist to keep them on That s not all the changes They ve enlarged the bottom legs by FOUR 4 inches No more slightly tapered leg The front rise has SHRUNK from 12 5 to 11 5 If I wanted my belly button to show I d go pull out a pair of my 70 s hip huggers The back rise has INCREASED from 15 to nearly 16 inches Did my rear suddenly increase in size I think not They claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7 3 oz old was 6 7 oz The ones I am returning are LESS substantial especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can t with my old ones Next it seems they have also extended the inseam length It was 32 inches on the old sport knit pants before washing about 31 5 after The ones I received AFTER BEING WASHED had inseams measuring nearly 33 inches Finally as if I wasn t feeling self conscious enough about my bod the pants have been narrowed in the hips and thighs Do you get the picture The waist sags and rolls The seat is major baggy My belly button shows They have to stretch across my hips so there s those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crotch They are sucked tight to my thighs then ballon out from my knees to the feet They re too long so you can t even see my feet I spent 30 minutes on the phone with a specialist at Land s End and she couldn t explain why all the changes That s also where I got all of the above NEW specs Also spoke with a specialist at LL Bean and their NEW specs are identical I spend so much each year with Land s End that I get a gift and card at Chrismas from them So I m not a casual purchaser of their product BUYER BEWARE AND GET THE NEW SPECS BEFORE YOU BUY A PRODUCT YOU THINK YOU KNOW AND CAN RELY ON YOU CAN T IF YOU ARE A LAND S END or LL BEAN CUSTOMER CALL THEM AND COMPLAIN THEY VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST THEN HAD TO BRING BACK THE OLD VERSION SO IT WASN T BROKE Land s End was always sold out or back ordered on their sport knit pants SO WHOSE DIM BULB IDEA WAS IT TO FIX THEM 
ordered long sleeve got a short sleeve Good short sleeve shirt but I ordered a long sleeve 
car player review Broke within 12 hours of purchase very cumbersome and non flexible for different types of cars Wouldn t recommend 
not as good as it looks I bought this for my husband We tried it in one car and it kept getting stuck in the lighter socket and the end kept coming off it wasn t screwed very tightly and couldn t be screwed tighter In the other car it fit in the socket all right but every couple of minutes you had to adjust the radio station and even then the music came through fuzzy Also if you turned the car off it doesn t remember which station it was tuned to We are going to return it to Amazon but I m not sure how as I don t think they have an option for returning it as the product just isn t very good If you want something cheap and are ok with it not being particularly reliable then this is for you but for hardcore music lovers I suggest savinf up and investing in a better product 
Poor Quality I bought this shirt last yr for my husband It lasted about 6 months Much pilling those horrid dots all over the fabric and seams coming un done After about 3 washings it looked like I had bought it at Goodwill used I wouldn t even give it a 1 star rating Plus you will get advertisments in your snail mail from this company FOREVER Their advertisments photos cater to gay men Get ready to see some very unusual attire Not that there is anything wrong with that Loved that Seinfeld episode 
Chuck The slipper seems to have some craftmenship In my case they seem to run about a half size small Who wants to wait for a pair of slippers to stretch I wish I had known this in advance they look good in my closet though 
No shine I ordered both the cherry and black Deer Stags through Sportman s guide com When I recieved the shoes the cherry was polished and new looking The black pair was dull and had no shine Instead of returning the product as should have done I tried different ways to put the gloss and polish on those shoes All attempts failed Very unhappy with product I have learned my lesson 
useless Save your money and lock your luggage with cheap lock ties Our TSA lock was cut the very first time we used it Turns out the ENTIRE terminal has only 1 set of key so screener just don t bother have the time to unlock this approved lock 
Narrower than other Adidas of the same size I bought these shoes on a whim from Amazon and was very disappointed and returned them I normally wear size 10M from Adidas as I do with my Metrum shoes and SuperStar IIs Yet with these shoes size 10M is WAY TOO SMALL and quite painful They were returned If you order them make sure you get a larger wider size 
terrible shoes I got the shoes for a while and I must say it was a total disappointment The look and heel were ok so does the GTX XCR However there is a major problem the shoes won t hold your foot The opens for the shoes lace the tounge are too big so the shoes won t hold your foot intact This is potential big problem if you really want to hike with it since your foot will just have extra fraction due to the insecure of the foot in the shoe Hate it ever since I put it on I have total of 3 pairs of GTX hikers now and this one is the one I regret to out money in 
Incorrect color sent Don t get me wrong these are nice high end shoes however I was sent an ugly red color instead of the yellow displayed on the products site Nowhere on the products site was the red Outdoor Plein Air color shown as a choice 
amazon misrepresented item incorrect color was shown on the website it has since been added but it wasnt at the time of my purchase 
Great when on ear Great concept but they slip off my ears way too often Often enough that I stopped wearing them 
A big disapoinment Ok I don t why this bra is available in any size larger than a B cup because it just does not provide the needed support for women with a larger bust I see that is available here in 38 DD and I shudder to think of anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing It s comfortable enough to be worn around the house under jammies for a little support when just relaxing but if you are looking for something to hold you in place through the day this bra won t do it The front closure just doesn t allow for any lift or support Unless you possess a smaller chest skip this one 
Blank Apparel is awful I bought a sweatshirt from them the tote was a freebie and too small for much use anyway Customer service was awful They sent me the wrong size a man s size not the woman s I was searching for and the photo had a woman wearing it She must have been an Amazon I returned it the next day and they REFUSED to accept the return saying it looked worn 
I should have kept looking The shirt was beautiful Notice I used the past tense verb was After hand washing it twice the hem came out the front tie fell off and the side of the lace ripped open It found a new home in the trash 
stupid sizing This is a beautiful dress but it would not fit me or most people I know 36 bust 33 waist and 41 hip FAT FAT FAT What about us tall slim people 
not as pictured I ve ordered from this seller before and the dress I recieved from the previously was perfect While delivered promptly this dress was not as it was pictured The bodice of the dress is barely ruched at all and ends up giving the appearance of being lumpy and ill fitting unless i wanted to put several hours into altering it it s basically too unflattering to wear 
Not worth it I got this because I thought it was a good deal but the clothes weren t very cute and weren t good quality I gave them all away I don t recommend 
Very disappointed I purchased these sox for my husband who has Parkinson s Disease and has trouble putting on sox The disease has limited his finger dexterity The sox came in a package of six pair I opened the package and we tried to get them on his feet It was difficult as the sox did not stretch At the end of the day I had to help him take them off After washing them I found they shrunk so much he could not wear them at all I looked into returning them but because they came in a six pack I could not do so I ended up giving them to a charity This is the only time Amazon has disappointed me I decided to only use Amazon for books not other products 
I couldn t believe these were Clarks I have several pairs of Clarks shoes that are wonderful The Lalita is very uncomfortable They are stiff and the sides that come over the foot are stiff and rub I was truly disappointed 
do not hold up I bought 2 of these least year First the ID info came off enroute then the green rollup part came off coming back Will not purchase again 
Okay socks should have stuck with cotton This my first pair of 100 nylon socks The problem I have is that my feet cannot breathe in them My socks are wet after a full day wearing them I guess I ll just have to stay with cotton I ve never had that problem before with cotton polyester socks They do stay up above my calf all day long though 
Cheap Thin Scratchy This set is made of thin scratchy cheap fabric There is no shape to the gown AWFUL 
Save your money and get real Birks I bought a pair of these thinking they were only different in upper strap material The footbed sole is not cork like true Birks but some sort of composite rigid Birk straps are softer and Birk corkbeds are more cushiony I wore them around the house to see if they were comfortable and the footbed became marked just from an hour or so Too bad because after that I knew I didn t like them I tried on a pair of Birk Granada the style this is based on and immediately felt the difference While these are about 30 50 cheaper I would have rather spent more on the original Birks I think these won t hold up as long and don t offer the same comfort Also you can have real Birks repaired so they never really wear out Black version has large Betula on side in white 
Strap breaks on first use Extremely disappointed in this bag It wasn t even heavily loaded just some folders with papers keys phone make up wallet On the very first use the strap broke before I even got home Also the stitching is coming loose Also the strap is not leather A big waste of money 
Plastic bag I didn t pay much for these so I had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect Wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag They repel water from the outside just fine but they also keep it in They might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them but that is hard to do In a pinch go for it otherwise invest in something better I certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them 
Read the sizing chart I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit I ordered 2 suits through amazon com but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28 which makes it very unconfortable to wear So becareful when ordering Look at the manufacturer s sizing list VERY SMALL LETTERS to find the right size By the way I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer s sizing chart Not a happy camper 
Nice look Not so nice feel I purchased two of these sports bras based on brand price and product description This is a very uncomfortable bra for runners The seams chafe and it does not wick away moisture The slow shipping didn t help my opinion either It is a nice bra for less active endeavors 
I returned these shoes One shoe did not fit properly also didn t think the sole would be comfortable for all day walking 
Disappointed I purchased these sandals thinking they would be comfortable and because they looked like they were made of leather They are more like a vinyl material and are stiff and not attractive They will be returned 
Review of Naturalizer Shoes First of all they look cheaper than I thought they would look But the most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable across the TOP of my foot In other words the straps at the top rub against the top of my foot and caused blisters I am hoping that if I keep trying to wear them the leather will soften up and become easier to wear 
Magic wand I guess you get what you pay for the wand was cheaply made and the shipping doubled the price of the item It reminded me more of what I would find in my cat s litter box than a magical device 
POOR FIT In my case the boots were not quite true to size and definitely not wide enough My feet ARE size 14 and EEE width but some EE made on wide lasts can fit The boots that I received were marked 14 EE but wouldn t even allow my feet half way in I wish they fit because they look good the quality is good and price unbeatable However I lost 8 50 at the UPS when I sent them back 
wrong item no service I received wrong item but there was no service after that 
It is a shame I take no pleasure in this review I just received March 2007 my 3rd pair of Vasque Sundowners I d used up my GTX Sundowners 4th pair of Vasque boots that I ve had for about 3 years This is the first pair that squeaks I like good shoes and I like taking care of them I had always been proud to wear Vasque but the quality of these is just not that great The leather is thinner and is dimpling so they even look cheaper It s a shame I wish Red Wing another brand I ve enjoyed in the past had not acquired Vasque It is the end of a great tradition 
shoulder pads I ordered a small it is huge and has shoulder pads that are on my elbow 
Reminds me of one of those leather kits i had when i was 10 My mouth dropped when i received this item the inside is like raw material and the piece that holds the money down is not easy to use For clarity it has 2 outside pockets and no inside pockets 
A good Review The bra came well packed speedily and it is very like the picture and description The fit is good 
Nice looking but falls short Verynice looking however I had to return mine because the plastic separator that keeps your writing from bleeding through to the next checks carbon copy was about a quarter inch too short and did not cover the date on the checks It was also a bit on the thin side so even if it did cover the date I m not so sure it would keep someone who write s a little harder than the norm from getting bleed through writing Side note would be a little nicer looking if the corners were rounded instead of square but would have kept it if the other hadn t been a problem The service was excellent from Belt Outlet Arrived in a normal amount of time Very courteous when I called and explained why I would be returning 
Not bad but not what I expected The scarf is out of good material and is the size and color stated I have two problems with the scarf 1 I thought sheer meant sheer 2 I expected the edges to be finished hemmed 
Disappointing Christmas Present I purchased this scarf as a Christmas present for my daughter in law It was so cheap and thin it was mailed to me folded up in a 9 x 12 envelope I had to go out at the last minute and purchase a scarf at a department store I would have been embarrassed to give her the Pashmina scarf It was a wasted of money 
ITCHY I want to help overseas products but this advertises itself as cashmere IT ITCHES MY NECK Cashmere does not itch Color was not represented appropriately 
Generic problem with amazon s photographic displays The views do not show the belt and buckle I cannot tell from the photos if the buckle closes in the middle or is offset to the side Why does this matter For me it s vital information When I m backpacking I carry my glasses camera pen notebook in a fanny pack Of course the backpack waistband buckle is in the middle over the navel If the fanny pack buckle is also in the middle then the two buckles interfere with each other A few manufacturers are wise to this conflict They make fanny packs with the buckle closure offset between the left hip bone and the navel The two waistband buckles do not interfere with each other I won t be considering this product because I cannot discern the photograph 
Horrible quality These bootie slippers are terrible They don t EVER stay on there s no anti skid on the bottom and are cheaply made I would give these 0 stars if I could it was a complete waste of money don t bother getting these regadless of how inexpensive they are 
Slip right off These booties are very cute and soft but they just slip right off my son s feet They do not have a way to secure the tongue part of the bootie when you cinch up the velcro and as soon as baby moves their feet the tongue part just pulls right out Not a good value for the money 
pretty good Good socks nice material but on the second day of using them one sock had a tiny hole in it They are knee high and stay up provide good warmth in the cold weather 
2 5 Stars Ibought these socks for the purported thermal heating qualities I was still cold Just a regular average socks easy to wash and dry so great for travelling nothing more 
Never Recieved This item was cancelled by Amazon because of a price mistake that they would not honor after taking my order very poor customer servic 
Very hard to keep clean Well I guess the title says most of it I am not happy with them they turn a dark brown just walking across the yard so I have to put them in the washing machine with bleach A LOT Then the place where the laces go at the top are all frayed I ve tried to was them by hand with bleach so it wont fry but it dosen t work they look the same as before But they are comfortable I also like the high arch in them They are pretty when they fist come out of the box but if you are planing on doing any outdoor actives I wouldn t recommend them 
so far not so good See Update I received my new shoes this afternoon and took a test run I didn t really buy this a3 for its functionality but rather the look I thought the honey comb and the color combination look kinda cool However I DID NOT at all feel being propelled through every foot and the so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff I even poked it with my hand oh man it s hard I also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness but all I did feel was my feet stomping hard onto the cement BTW if your feet are wide and flat like mine it s going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes UPdate November 15 2006 It s been 2 months since I ve been wearing these shoes and I ve changed my opinion them Once you get use to the a3 sequence they are actually quite comfortable The honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bouncier now Maybe it takes time to soften up the material and make them more flexible 
Lovely but POOR color quality These were a gift at Christmas and were a deep burgundy color they do appear to be well stitched however after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don t look like a match anymore the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much 
I Wont do it again I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy I made a mistake by buying i 
mixed reviews While the suit fits and looks great my wife had a problem with the fact that the manufacturer placed a label on the outside of the suit It s really the placement that bothered her There is a black tag sewn into the middle of the rear seam which from a distance looks like one had an accident in their trunks Thanks but no thanks These shorts are being returned 
Players Nylon Boxers These are made of a nice material and good for travelling However the inseam is so short that they make no real sense in wearing As soon as I sit nothing is really being covered With a longer inseam these would be awesome 
very bad Extremely poor quality cloth Very bad color It looks used Never ever buy any items from this vendo 
strange sizes and poor quality pants were strangely short and bodysuit extra long also there was a tear in the sleeve of the bodysuit the quality of the fabric is poor it served my short term purpose but i wouldn t purchase this same product again 
Took a chance cause they were cheap I ordered a pair for my husband and was very disappointed the 11 medium that I received was probably as wide as any EEE width I have seen and whats worse these just sort of look cheap I returned them and I will avoid buying this brand agai 
Sorry It broke right away I bought this as a gift and my friend has informed me that after two weeks of use a pocket ripped so we will be returning it 
Denim Bib Overalls Sizes run small Zipper is short and so are the over the shoulder straps which does not allow for much adjustment I should have spent a couple bucks more and got Dickies or another brand 
Sleeves too long The sleeves on this fleece are very long I have a 34 sleeve and a medium nearly covered my entire hands Not practical if you want to play any sports with this fleece I returned mine 
ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE I ve been buying these t shirts for 20 years without issues About 9 months ago Calvin Klein changed the manufacturer These t shirts are nothing but crap now They are short and wide instead of the generous cut they used to be and they came out of the wash after one washing looking like a wet tissue with loose threads The price hasn t gone down just the quality Please don t get ripped off do NOT buy these shirts Here is another case of American immorality at it s best Let s cheapen the product so my pocket gets bigger at the expense of yours 
They hurt your feet I got two pairs of these for my kids and they could hardly walk after wearing these Unless the bottom of your feet are tough I would not get these 
I want My Money Back These pants were washed one time following the washing instructions they were not put in the dryer and they shrunk not only around but lengthwise I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn t have any problems I look forward to your reply 
slip sliding away At first glance you ll think these are great but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt 
Poor Quality Worse Support I love the Bears It s impossible for any Bears fan to not love Walter Payton With that love I ordered this jersey and it shipped to me from FansEdge The shipping and billing was very speedy and with little delay I had the jersey delivered to my doorstep It went downhill from there As soon as I opened the package I noticed that the GSH George S Halas initials had been sewn over and was broken Very disappointing I called FansEdge and they were great on the phone and sent me another jersey While waiting for the replacement jersey I wore the defective one By the time the replacement jersey came the iron on stripes on the sleeves started to peel off I figured it was just a defective jersey and opened the replacement one It was exactly the same way So either FansEdge received a batch of jerseys that were of poor quality or Reebok is maximizing their profit margins and overpricing a cheaply made jersey with one of the most incredible athletes ever name on it After asking and waiting 2 weeks for FansEdge to check their supply of jerseys to see if they were all like this with no reply I cancelled my order I am still waiting for a refund This has been over a month now With the poor support of FansEdge and what appears like a poorly made jersey I cannot recommend anyone getting this If you absolutely want one I recommend buying from a brick and mortar store 1 
Not what I expected The boots were not what I expected The pictures made the books look different then they actually were They were exremely wide and the sizing was off 
definatly not what I thought Did not fit well AT ALL WAY too big around the ankles every step I took the boot would start to fall off They were the right size length wise and all just way too wide above my ankle They were about half as tall as they looked in the photo which was very disappointing I sent the boot back at my own expense the same day I would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first then ordering it off of here for cheaper 
Cool Shoes My tween daughter loves these Saucony Jazz shoes They are comfortable and stylish This is her 3rd pair I m glad that I found them online They are both old school and stylish 
Poor Quality I have worn Jockey panties most of my adult life and witnessed the quality slowly deteriorate over time The product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching Two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them I shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings Given the cost of panties and other similar products you d think the quality would be decent However Jockey isn t the only company out there with a substandard product I guess until I can afford to spend substantially more for panties I m stuck I will only pay sale prices 
Low quality and fit too tight Looks great on the web don t think many would buy it if they could examine it in person Shame colors and style are excellent just let down in quality and fit 
Pads fall out The pads inside the bra fall out every time you wash it 
very disappointed saw these on sale at Macys on the rack no box figured why not they felt good But when I tried them on at home the girlfriend started to laugh quite hard she said I looked like penguin butt and I have a waddle I m going back to other boxer briefs Personally I didn t find them comfortable at all and I like this style A F DKNY CK other jockey i ll stick to those 
This product is typical in that it has a tight waist band I am in great shape However I cannot get over that so many men s underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches The idea of Medium as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards My body fat is low I am not profoundly muscular bound As is common in men of my age lower back problems are not unusual I have a 32 waist Is that not Medium sized I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether One size fits all doesn t work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems The draw string is fine It allows flexibility So what if your pants fall down It seems to be the fashion anyway Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary uncontrollable constrictions Also these boxers don t hold up well to any kind of washing They looked like crap after the first time I washed them I wish I could get a refund because I won t wear them again My life partner told me they looked like old men s underwear That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry I am not a mean hearted kind of guy So I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again 
thin yoga strap This strap is thinner than those used in yoga classes It is sharp on the arch when held there for poses I would not purchase another one 
Product Poor Seller Great Within two hours of recieving my complaint the seller refunded my money without requriing that I ship the product back For that I am thankful and appreciative and can recommend the seller I have no idea what was up with the product As I noted earlier I just recieved this product and it has the overwhelming smell of petroleum literally like the smell that comes from an oil truck delivering fuel oil to your home I bought this for a child and would never dream of giving it to them I am contacting the seller to request a refund If I succeed I will note that in the review and increase the star rating 
Cute but Uncomfortable Cute shoes but extremely uncomfortable I am not sure that I will get much wear out of these shoes I know my size but I starting to think they sent me the wrong pair I am so frustrated with Amazon where shoes are concerned This is the 3rd pair of shoes I have bought that does not give me a good fit I suggest that you buy a 1 2 size larger than you normally wear but you will then probably run the risk of the shoe later becoming too big it s a catch 22 
It didn t work I was impressed by the look of this bag It really looked like it would seal the contents well Unfortunately it did not I tried several times and each time the contents of the bag were soaked Fortunately I tested it out with just some cash for a day at the pool and only ended up with soggy money If I had put my cell phone and watch in the bag they would have been ruined I DON T RECOMMEND IT 
Nice Looking gloves These gloves should really be called Simulation Leather They are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather I wouldnt feel comfortable riding a Motorcycle with these if you hit the pavent with them they d probably just vaporize 
Ridiculous sizing I got these for my son before he arrived in the 0 3 mos size blue They weren t even blue they were purple And they were so big they fit my 14 mo old but the arms were too short for her to wear them either What a waste of money 
You can buy the same for less or do better with my suggestions I was astonished at how flimsy the poncho turned out to be I mean at almost 25 invested included shipping I was expecting better quality Well it s very thin made in China and has plastic snaps The so called polyester lining just adds to the heat that s generated I ve owned many ponchos through the years and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period The reason involves the way it s cut What I ve learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn t lift it up or out and allow the elements inside Next you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time So a good lining or a breathable system is required If you re just going to use it for short bursts in the rain then you can get a cheap 10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere However if you camp a lot or will be out in the elements you need better The best poncho I ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner This solves both of the problems I mentioned because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat 
Never received it I wish there were 0 star Although these sandals are very beautiful but never ever even try to buy them After searching a lot for buying a present for my sister s birthday I found this sandal and I decided to buy I ordered it on March 9th and after 20 days still I haven t received them I am getting my money back Not only I have wasted my time but also I should rush to find something as a present which is by the way toooooooooooooo late Conclusion These sandals are very beautiful but NEVER fall for them 
Plastic Prada bag Plastic = cheap I actually sent this bag back immediatley after opening I knew it was going to be plastic which was fine with me I could use it in the summer at the beach or by the pool But the description said it was trimmed in geniune pig skin leather When I recieved the bag there was no leather to be found on the bag The trim was some type of weird plastic aswell It was the cheapest and most fake looking bag I have ever seen I couldn t believe that Amazon was selling this product for 200 I love Amazon and everything they have to offer They really shouldn t put there name behind this product anymore Any faithful Amazon custom would be shocked and appauled to recieve this on there front step I know I was 
What happened to my order I don t recommend you make purchases here I spent 61 on these items and have only recieved two There has been no explanation as to what happened to the rest of my order or my money Patiently I ve waited for over a month for my items to arrive and nothing 
socks Not as expected too short nothing special for the price took forever to receive about 3 weeks 
No I still got a pantyline I still got a pantyline with this strange and frustrating 
I have a question On the advertisement these sandals were shown in green If they were available in green I would be interested Please advise Thank 
No strap too tight Poor product No strap comes with this case Too difficult to get the iPod out for updates whilst trying to pull out iPod can be dropped Front view cover is smeary and scratched Buttons are difficult to re snap No need for other voting on this just a poor product 
Not for small people The fanny pack looks nice but the belt did not adjust to be small enough for my hips I am a 5 6 120 lb small boned female The company offered to exchange it however did not offer any others with cell phone holder Now I will have to pay return shipping plus 4 95 restocking fee to return this item I did not see the information to learn of this fee before my purchase and am not happy to learn it now 
Very comfortable but very light for a work boot This is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now even appearing in one episode of Leave It To Beaver in the late 50s and on the cover of one of Simon and Garfunkles albums of the late 60s I ve owned several pair of similar boots by other makers including Red Wing Some comments which apply to this style in general and not just Wolverines Pros The wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing working on concrete or walking long distances on hard surfaces Also the non agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn t track into the house after doing chores outside The moc toe tends to breath through the seams so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot dry conditions A great boot for the desert and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers Cons The wedge sole doesn t offer much traction for serious hiking on steep loose surfaces which I ve used them for but for which they really weren t intended Gravel will roll right out from under them None of the several brands I have owned were water resistant at all Walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily We used to say Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains So perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the Pacific Northwest Specifically the Wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box They have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support The color was actually more of a brown clay rather than what I would call tan The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good actually better looking stitching than my Red Wings However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot thinner even than in many suede sneakers While my ankles were covered they didn t feel at all supported or protected After considering for a couple of days I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon The Sportsmans Guide They had provided a return shipping label in the box so I taped the box closed applied the label and took it to the Post Office I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package and a notice of a credit applied to my account So while I m not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received I do give good marks to Sportsmans Guide for a quick and relatively painless return I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6 Farm and Ranch boot with wedge sole also available through Amazon For further details please see my review 
Heavy weight I was mislead by the advertisement The shorts are skin thin and don t have pockets in them Quality it is ok for what they really are pijama shorts Maybe it is my problem cause I am not a native English language speaker maybe not 
Cheap not worth it The plastic screen on this case was very hard to keep clean and very easy to scratch so the view quality was horrible Also the case was WAY to tight and was difficult to get the 30GB Video iPod in and out 
the worst ever I had to send this item back twice and still havenot recieved the correct product never order anything from Best Price Center the owner denied being the correct contact after I spoke with him multiple times at the same number 
OUT OF EAR EAR BUDS I purchased these ear buds to replace those that came with my 80gb ipod expecting them to at least be comfortable I can t judge if they are more comfortable or not because they won t stay in my ears long enough to decide Even when I m sitting still on the sofa they fall out none of the sizes work for me If falling out of my ear isn t bad enough the sound is not even half as good as that produced by the stock ear buds Very disappointed 
Oops I Purchased this to replace my husband s favorite keyfob from American Eagle which was almost identical and lasted ten years incidentally This one fell apart after two months Time for a trip to the local leathersmith 
Fingers too short These gloves are very soft and seem to be made well but they have a big flaw the fingers are too short Ordering up a size may not solve any fit problems 
comfy silppers These slippers are typical of Daniel Green products beautiful comfortable and affordable Thank 
Hole in pocket Hole in pocket not completly sewn Charcol heather shrank 2 sizes Blue shirt pocket was placed almost under the sleeve 
Ligtning Double Strap Sneaker Review We could not use these shoes The tongues on these shoes are too short and we had to force them on They were even a 1 2 size larger than our grandson wore It was a big disappointment and waste of money Save your receit 
Not true to size I bought this pair of shoes because the look really good but the shoe doesnot run true to size I bought an 11 5m and had to return it because my instep could not enter the shoe Be very caefull when buying I suggest buying half a 1 size bigger than your average size 
not enough colors The scarves were good quality but I should have paid more attention to previous reviewers on this gift the pack had about 5 or 6 black scarves and a couple other colors nothing like the picture save your dough on these scarves 
Never received the merchandise I never received this order and they have not responded to emails regarding order status This left me without gifts for co workers over the holidays I am out the money 
6 blacks 4 reds Extremely dissapointed in the colors I received Out of 10 6 were black 3 red 2 shades 1 pink I could deal with 6 blacks and 4 different and I mean different not all red toned colors but not with what I got Useless I m upset beyond words Will never buy from this seller again and will not recommend to anyone I know unless the seller comes through and fixes this 
NO LACES I COULDN T BELIEVE IT MY SON OPENED THE BOX OF SHOES TO FIND THE SHOES CAME WITH NO LACES HE WAS SO UPSET THAT HE WASN T ABLE TO WEAR THEM RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE IT WAS DEC 24 EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY CLOSED AND NOTHING WOULD BE OPEN UNTIL DEC 26 AND WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO PAY FOR SHOE LACES I M GLAD YOU SENT ME THE E MAIL BECAUSE I D LIKE TO SEND THE SHOES BACK WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A BRAND NEW PAIR WITH LACES AT A BETTER PRICE 
get what you pay for I had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while I type they keep the office I work at at very cold temperatures These gloves seeemed perfect because many fingerless gloves don t have fingerless thumbs but these gloves do The cost was only 2 99 for a pair of black or navy gloves I ordered the black pair Well the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing there are many stray strands at the fingers they snag easily They are warm and I would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily But I did only pay 2 99 for them so I guess it s a case of you get what you pay for 
He unleashed his provocative side all over the neighbourhood now we re getting divorced and it s all YOUR FAULT Male Power Sheer Bong Thong i hate you 
Shapeless Leggings Really uncomfortable I wore them twice and then threw them out They sagged like a sad pair of tights you used to wear when you were little And they became transparent like they were going to rip at any moment Not worth the 5 I paid 
rip off This review isn t really about the flip flops because theyre great Why would you buy them here for 5 61 when you can get them at the store for 2 50 each 
3 Months and no shirts sent yet and no refund I ordered these White Tank Tops and 3 colored Tank Tops I have never received these White Tank Tops and have requested a refund and requested another size they had in stock and have received neither I have sent emails requesting this and still no resolve 
BooHoo I bought this dress for a trip I m taking in one week Should ve known better You get what you pay for that s for sure This dress arrived balled up in a USPS bag It didn t look anything like the picture shown on this site more like a slip than a slip dress And here s the kicker it was RIPPED Had two large snags on the back of the dress I m sending it back and they BETTER not try to charge me shipping I m PO d to the max and who knows if I ll find a dress in time Grrrr 
Negative I bought 2 sleepers sleeper had holes in the arm pit area and the other sleeper had a whole where the neck trim should of been sewed on A real waste of my money 
Cute but These shoes are cute but 1 They are made wide 2 the heel is a little bigger than 2 3 They are uncomfortable to walk in I think I could find a better pair at Wal mart if I had to The company charged me tax on their shipping charges so they get a BIG TWO THUMBS DOWN for that 
Item returned I had to return this item because the shoes where too big but other than that everything else was ok with the products I received 
Uggs ugh These boots were the worst ever They were grossly missized and not as depicted The back of the boot had a tape with embroidery up it that was mysteriously not pictured when ordering When returned the company refused to reimburse shipping even though they acknowledged that this was deceiving Never again 
Poorly made These gloves are a little itchy the profile states that they are fully lined however the insulation does not extend to the finger openings so you have wool around each finger some people don t mind the feeling personally it drives me nutty It s a present however so we ll see how he feels about the material My main gripe however is that the stitchiing is incredibly poor Right out of the package the velcro stiching is coming loose and the velcro is starting to pull up The black stiching connecting the leather pads to the glove part is laughable It s an overstich and most of them look like they ll start to loosen at anytime causing the leather pad to come off There are different colored threads poking out through seams as well They DO look nice from afar and seem warm I only tried them on quickly but for the price yikes 
Keds Kate Stain Rest Sneakers Shipping was quick The shoes are comfortable and stay clean longer When soiled they clean up well Some wide widths are good but these give just a little more room than most The little extra width was more than welcome when on a recent trip I was doing alot of walking the feet were really swollen I am pleased with the shoes so far 
Please Help i never receive my stuff I never receive this ITEM i want may money back or replace my order 
Dont like The sleeves are long and the shirt is short I dont know about others but that is NOT how I like my clothes Wont look to good with low rise jeans At least not with my average body I dont weight 95 pounds 
These are NOT leather as stated in the description These boots are very cute and comfortable However they are NOT leather as stated in the description They are clearly labeled ALL MANMADE MATERIALS on the inside of the boot Since they are now marked down so low they are a good deal but the price I paid is not worth it for non leather boots 
dissatisfied This order was most unsatisfactory I received the shoes with the security device attached I had to take the time and trouble to send them back to have the devices detached I have yet to receive them I would advise customers to avoid orders 
Afraid for buyers I purchased what I thought were deals from 2 seperate vendors and was very disappointed To get a pair of decent fitting sweats you have to pay the price and you won t regret it I hope this advice helps 
terrible out of stock but didn t say for days then too late and no customer service on weekends at even before xmas 
more comfort elsewhere I bought a pair of these Calvin Klein hip briefs at a local retail store last year I found this pair of underwear to be very tight and uncomfortable I m large up front and I found the crotch area to be quite small and thin The pouch is also to small I am a briefs man myself but these are not as comfortable as most briefs I can say though these briefs are good for wearing under low rise jeans I would rather wear the Calvin Klein trunks or a pair of boxerbriefs instead of the hip briefs The trunks are more comfortable for well endowed guys like me If I had to choose only between these underwears or none at all I would rather not wear any underwear at all 
Started off great I loved this bra when I first got it a year ago It gave me great support it looked great and I was the happiest with a bra that I have ever been My girls are in the F range so it has been difficult to find the right size A year later the girls are headed south and the bra has no support left in it I am really disappointed in the quality after paying almost 70 for one bra They are on a great product if it could stand the longevity of time One year just doesn t work for me 
Great comfort Poor quality I absolutely loved this bra when I first put it on but after only a couple of washings the metal underwire broke through the fabric and started poking at my underarm I thought it was just a rare occurence but I bought a couple more of these bras and the same thing happened everytime They cost way too much money to only get two or three wears out of them I am so disappointed in the quality of the underwire 
Nice material but that s about it I had got these for my husband for christmas Nice material however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height so we had to return it 
pretty but not very comfortable This bra works okay but the material is really uncomortable The lace cups isn t feel like flour sack material 
SAVE YOUR MONEY This is a disgraceful garment I am not kidding when I say that the sweater is less than 1 MM thick The best description that I could give you is tracing paper It is virtually see through When I put it on for the first time all of the tags ripped off as it is poorly constructed There is also an obnoxious Z on the left chest area Very tacky This will be in the very back of my closet until I get around to donating it or throwing it away Miserable Miserable purchase 
Lasted exactly one winter They are warm and comfortable while they last All of the sheep skin inside has fallen out there is a hole where my big toe is inside the slipper The outside of the slipper still looks like new It is sort of depressing they only lasted 3 4 months 
Quality Control I bought these based on a previous review After wearing them for 3 days the stitching on one came apart Maybe the quality control person was out that day I returned them and got a full refund 
If you pay for cheap slippers that s what you get Not Happy at all with these slippers Do not buy them They lasted 3 4 week and then he inside was shot 
Would you like to know what it feels like to have your feet in a vise These slippers are without a doubt the most uncomfortable things I ve ever put my feet into The concept is good but the shearling lining is so thick that you would definately want to order the next size larger That might solve the length discomfort but there still isn t sufficient heighth comfort They felt like an all encompassing vise squeezing my feet so tightly that I had to remove them to gain relief Very uncomfortable 
good shoes BAD EXPEDITED DELIVERY those are a good shoes but the delivery provide service is the worst i buy the shoes dic 15 06 in expedite service 1 3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail bad deal to me 
DIdn t last long I bought these at Target for my sons My six year old wore his two months until they fell apart Not too long in my opinion 
hard to balance in very cute but have a funky balance wobly and on the verge of falling over not comftorable poorly designe 
Cute Boots but OUCH Really cute boots but the back zipper made my heels feel as if they weren t supported and about to slide out The 4 heels force your feet into a near ballerina toe pose and I had to take these off after half a day My next step is to try some insoles for them and maybe that will help 
So so I had this bag on my wishlist and got it for Christmas I wanted it for when I take daytrips to the beach I am really disappointed with the size It s pretty deep but not very wide at all No way I ll be able to take everything I need to the beach in this bag Still I ll be able to use it for other things 
Nice material but that s about it I had got these for my husband for christmas Nice material however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height so we had to return it 
I want My Money Back These pants were washed one time following the washing instructions they were not put in the dryer and they shrunk not only around but lengthwise I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn t have any problems I look forward to your reply 
NOT HAPPY THE COLORS OF BANDANNAS I ORDERED WERE NOT THE COLORS I RECEIVED THE INVOICE SENT WITH THE BANDANNAS DID NOT CONFIRM THE COLORS I ORDERED SO I DID NOT HAVE PROFF THAT SEVERAL ERRORS WERE MADE BUT I KNOW WHAT I ORDERED I WAS CONCERNED AFTER PLACING THE ORDER BECAUSE THE COLORS WERE NOT STATED ON THE CHECKOUT PAGE BUT SINCE I HAD ORDERED THEM BEFORE I THOUGHT THERE WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM 
Incomplete order I ordered 16 bandanas at the last minute for my dance team s competition but I only received 12 in the mail The packing slip said 16 and I was charged for the 16 It was too late for me to order more and the color was too rare for me to find in the stores Would have given only 1 star but at least they sent it to me on time 
Demagnetizer I purchased the DOPP Money Clip and Card Holder for a specific Vacation Cruise It is nicely constructed but two negatives were exposed One It will only hold about six bills and Two it demagnetized my room Key Card twice over eight days Realizing this could also demagnetize my regular Credit Cards I removed them from the Card Holder I am reluctant to use the Money Clip again 
Really regretting the purchase Even though I favor leather every once in a while a pleather product comes along that I really appreciate Well these boots sadly are not in that category The pleather started cracking after I wore the boots x3 the lining was poorly cut to begin with and started unraveling The sad part is that for the amount of money that I spend on these boots I could have bought a pair of leather ones after x mas 
Giants wear this jacket I am solidly a size medium but I was swimming in this jacket I think it is more of an XL I d say the medium is for someone 5 10 and 250lbs 
Lousy Design There was no picture of this selection so I guessed it was a ringer type t shirt Instead it was a white shirt with ugly red contrast stitching I never wore it but gave it to Goodwill 
Never Recevied Dress I ordered this Dress on March 6th I recevied an email from the company saying that it would ship by March 8th On March 16th I receive an email saying that they are out the size I wanted and my order has been canceled This is unacceptable from a business I should have been notified by March 9th that the dress had not been shipped I have less than 24 hours to find a replacement dress Thanks alot 
Don t bother I was very dissappointed by this item It arrived folded into a 6X6 square bag and was very creased when opened It will take considerable pressing to try and get it out The fabric is too stiff and doesn t drap well The length isn t long enough to drape over your shoulders and wear as a wrap The return policy makes this purchase not worth the risk 
Lacks quality control Very nice prints but the quality of the briefs is not good To top it one of the briefs was even damaged I guess the maker doesn t have a quality control department Overall a bad buy 
Horrible Fitting Beware the size is not true size fit My small turn out to be something that fits like a LARGE from some other brands this is not a small it s loose fitting and it s a straight line cut it s really BAD it s so disappointing everything doesnt holds in places it doesnt look like the photo at all the materials is nice but the fittting is beyond horrid Dont buy this dress unless you are really curvy and if you are a medium you need a SMALL for this dress and it will still fit loosly on you that s how big of a dress this is I m returning it 
cinderella s ugly sister size 9 5 fit like it was an 8 I wear a 9 typically and could barely get my foot in and was unable to walk in them at all without pain I ve bought Steve Madden before many times and know they run slightly small but this pair was ridiculously small and I suspect perhaps mis labeled 
Cute but uncomfortable and size runs small I only gave the shoes 2 stars because they are cute Other than that they were quite unusable I usually wear a size 7 but I could not even get my foot into these shoes and they are quite hard Had to get rid of them 
CUTE BUT NOT COMFORTABLE I acutally saw this shoe on a young lady who matched them so well with her outfit I even complimented her on them I liked so much how they looked on her that I took the time to locate them online Amazon I ordered them with much anticipation that I would also look cute in them Needless to say looks ARE deceiving Perhaps they felt better on her than they did on me but I felt like I was squeezing my feet into a pair of hard plastic I was disappointed If there s nothing I ve learned being a woman in her mid 30s I come to realize that there s nothing like a cute but comfortable pair of shoes 
Whatever These shoes are not as cute as they appear the heel is really 2 5 the material is cheap the fit is too wide the shoes are uncomfortable to walk in etc etc etc On a positive note it s the type of shoes that can be worn with a pair of jeans or a cocktail dress Be warned the company claims that all their shoes have 2 heels when they don t and they charge tax on shipping charges 
Not What I Expected The footbed on these clogs is very comfortable but buyer beware the buckles are attached with staples through the suede and come undone very easily in my case after two wearings The seller s return policy is such that once the shoes have been worn outside they won t take them back I had to sew the buckles back on In my opinion 100 shoes shouldn t need to be repaired after two wearings The suede is also much darker than the picture still a pleasant color but not what I expected when I ordered 
poor after 3 months college campus wear my daughter bought these herself because she couldn t afford the real birky s she bought them in august 2006 now november 18 2006 the soles are worn out and the buckle just broke yeaterday wasted pair of shoes anyone have any ideas for good affordable shoes similar to birkys pat mother of msu college freshman 
much smaller then i expected This bag is much smaller then i was expecting the zippers do not open shut easily I was very disapointed 
Ann Klein good shoes but not this one I have purchased AK in the past but this is the first time i was disappointed The shoe felt cheap to me and not very sturdy I would not recommend this shoe to anyone 
Poor craftmenship the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face However the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that I first used it It hasnt torn completely yet Nevertheless I would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon I wouldnt suggest this produc 
Not what I expected Wow the headband on this skull cap is cutting off my circulation It is way too tight for casual wear Also the fabric on top is almost as thin as panty hose and your hair will poke through if you have a buzz cut like me If you re not an athlete then don t buy this skull cap It s meant primarily for bald football players to wear under their helmets 
Size too big fabric is bad I ordered 4 of them because they were on sale But all of them are at least 2 size bigger than they should be In addition the fabric is bad There are tores in all of the edges 
Jersey is rough and uncomfortable This is a nicly styled jersey that could use a fabric or fabric finish makeover The plain polyester is rough to the skin requiring the use of an undershirt to prevent chafing The collar is cut high enough to cut across the base of the neck leaving a nasty burn mark A cotton cotton blend or silk would have made a better choice of fabric making this an unbeatable jersey for many uses 
Not worth it This bra has an akward fit I had to return it A better bra for low cut clothes would be the clear strap bra from victoria s secret 
By far the most painful shoes I ve ever worn I bought these shoes and wore them to my first fitting By the end of my fitting my feet were throbbing red and pinched Literally my pinky toe was purple I bought my true size but I still don t think these shoes would ve been wearable even with a size larger They must just be REALLY narrow 
This item was everything i didn t want The advertising of this product on your site is kind of deceiving because it doesn t properly show it From what I saw on the Amazon site I thought the wallet will be much bigger Amazon doesn t give measurements of the product and there are not enough pictures of the it Basicly it isn t worth it to buy a product if I m not sure of how it looks like Now I have a wallet that my husband does not want and I can do nothing with it I feel that I wasted 25 00 
Doesn t fit Cute designs but they shrink I have to stretch the sheet back out after washing it and when I attempt to put it on the mattress it flips up 
Not Great I am a 44DD I am having the hardest time finding a good bra I ordered this one and I am a little dissapointed The underwires in the front poke out and make it look like I have these bones sticking straight out of my chest Everthing else is ok no complaints other than the underwire not laying flush with my chest bone 
Tear Away Pants Ordered gray they shipped black Since it is from Canada i m not even going to waste return shipping charges Minor inconvenience yet still folks I ordered Gray Pants are also NOT new the tags are ripped and torn it looks like return or wholesale merchandise I feel cheated angry but mostly just disappointed For shame people for shame 
Babydoll top Need to use a belt definitively Does not look like the picture If you do not use a belt you will seem like wearing a pijama instead of a top 
Not like the picture The color is very pale and not very much not as vivid as the picture Also from the picture you think that it is high quality and fine threaded but the threads are large and not so apealing as the picture shows Good customer support though I couldn t return it because of being a gift 
Great looking shoes terrible quality These shoes are very comfortable look great but I had a terrible problem with the ruggedness of these shoes I am an avid hiker and climber and bought these shoes for the reasons that Merrill is known for ruggedness and great outdoor shoes After only owning these shoes for a month I noticed that the leather sides were cracking away from the sole This happened on both pairs of shoes and soon there was 2 holes in each pair The insides ripped from slipping them on and off I returned the pair to the store I bought them at and got a new pair The same problem happened These shoes are very cheap and very expensive Do not buy They look great but unless you are planning on displaying them only I would stay away from them 
Just Wasn t What I Thought This boot looked so much better online For this boot to be by Nine West it looked very cheap I was very disappointed with this product that I returned it but I m still waiting for my refund 
Fair for the Price These boots look good on the first wear I bought the black patent boots and after one not so wild night they scuffed and had sveral little tears in the material If you need boots for one night for that perfect outfit these will suffice 
Elastic is too tight The elastic in these shoes makes them too uncomfortable to wear Otherwise the quality of the lace shoes is good I d wear them if the elastic didn t dig into my foot I have small feet too 
Poor design Poor design and fit such that after 4 5 wears the front of both shoes wore out into a hole Not recommended 
just wierd fit i love the colts but this sweatshirt is supposed to be a large it is the wierdest fitting sweatshirt i have efer seen the shoulders are to big and the neck is to tight i wear a large but i cant wear this shirt because it looks so awkward 
Thin The sweater I received was extremely thin I had expected something more like an LL Bean cardigan which I dearly love I was wrong What do I do now Roger Hampton 503 293 5655 ov10abronco juno com 
Pathetic After six months of little use the inside heal fell apart on both shoes The fabric is made poorly and will cause blisters on your heal once it quickly deteriorates Do not buy this shoe 
Not at all HAPPY The stockings were not in the package and there is no good way to get in touch with the company that sold me outfit in the first place My girlfriend was disappointed and I felt like a fool when no one even took the time to return my call I will not do business with this company again 
ouch again This product worked well in holding up a strapless bra but after a few hours my skin developed a blister underneath the tape I would rather risk the wardrobe malfunction than have any more blisters so use this product with caution 
Horrible Horrible Must go through hell to return it too they won t give you back the shipping to send it to you just the cost of the item Do not buy Do not recommend 
disappointed i had a good experience with 80s purple last year so when i needed prop glasses i knew where to look i got my order the glasses were scratched and the frames were damaged i called and they said they would send me a replacement right away i was quite pleased it has been over 3 weeks and i have not received them i have called and emailed them several times with no response not even picking up the phone i plan on contesting the charges on my card and will not be shopping here any mor 
Awfull Service Order placed by 7th of July didn t arrived by now No sunglasses No money No response from the seller The most awfull seller I have ever co operated with I wish I would not ordered this nice glasses from this dishonourable seller Think twice before placing an order paying money 
Total dissapointed This is saled as a baseball shoes but it is for american footbal But the mistake goes more long because the photo included shows a baseball shoes how you can observ in the marks of the sole 
AWFUL I could not believe the quality in these shoes HORRIBLE The material feels and sounds like cardboard or paper They have an awful smell and are uncomfortable I bought chinese shoes in china town for 2 they were wonderfully comfortable still smelled funny but they were awesome these are not 
DON T BUY THE HAIRAGAMI IT IS A HORRIBLE ITEM IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN THIS HAIRAGAMI A NO STAR RATING I WOULD HAVE AND TO THINK I WASTED ALMOST 20 FOR THIS JUNK IT SNAPS UNEXPECTEDLY ALL THE TIME AND ALWAYS WHILE YOU ARE TWIRLING THE HAIR IT TOTALLY TANGLES THE HAIR IT IS A NIGHTMARE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CHILD S HAIR MY OLDEST 12 REALLY WANTED THIS HAIRAGAMI AND WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED SHE TOLD ALL HER FRIENDS NOT TO BUY IT 
lightweight Material extremely thin and almost transparent when it is held up to light It s very dissappointing for an Izod product I would have returned it had I not bought it for my 82 year old father whom discarded the packaging 
Misleading The pants are not Juniors they are Women s pants that go up past your waistline when you wear them 
A month later NO DELIVERY How lame 30 days later no shipment no delivery Very disgusted Information about shipment Ship Method USPS Tracking Number 910 Status In transit Order 103 Shipment Date Jul 17 2005 Destination West Hollywood CA United States Estimated Arrival Jul 26 2005 Date Time Location Service Area Checkpoint Details Jul 19 2005 US Carrier notified to pick up package Jul 17 2005 05 19 00 PM HEBRON KY US Arrival Scan 
Inconsistent sizing Cheap construction I realize this isn t an expensive bra but I expected it to at least FIT I ve never ordered a bra that was sized this crazy The band was way too big and the cups were way too small Needless to say I m returning it Save your money ladies On top of that it took almost a month to receive it because it was out of stock Even though Figleaves displayed the item as IN STOCK This is the third time Figleaves has done this for Amazon items I think I ll skip buying from them in the future 
Review The mask is WAY too tight either that or I just have an abnormally big head which I don t think I do It should be adjustable and it s not Would not recommend this 
Get what you pay for The battery function didn t work Discovered poor battery wiring inside I might try troubleshooting it myself with an ammeter and some soldering I m not surprised by the crude construction from a 11 item However the hand grips themselves are worth the money No more cramped hands 
Used We received this product in a clear plastic molded container however there were no instructions at all nor was there any label We immediately thought this must not be a new product Not knowing exactly how to attach it to the PSP or detach it one of the clips has broken We also have more questions can the battery inside this charger be replaced If so what kind is it I think we ll be returning this product 
HORRIBLE When I got ordered these shoes I was so excited because the picture looked so nice Do not be deceived by its looks I saw it in another store and I tried it on for fun The shoe fits poorly and its actually really ugly I would definitely not reccomend it to any one 
not a good clock I bought this for the flashlight feature You have to press and hold the button in a clumsy way in order to keep the green flashlight on Also the only way to have the clock light up is if you have the alarm on The buttons on the front are cheap and don t seem like they ll last very long 
Not what you expect You have to wear a thick pair of socks in order for the slipper socks to fit properly They only fit properly for one wearing stretch all out of shape until you wash and dry I have fleece socks from llbean which are wonderful and thought I would try these You get what you pay for applies to this product 
Horrible socks These socks were thin large and horrible They had no elastic in them to keep them up and they fell down frequently Absolutely worthless 
Item received not as shown Bait and Switch I received the Smart tool Dynamo instead of the Illuminator Very disappointed because I ordered 5 for Xmas gifts and do not have enough time to reorder 
False Advertisement Illuminator is shown in ad but a generic brand was shipped to me The light wasn t as bright and it wasn t made very well The crank was cheaply made and the button that you press didn t work every time 
cheesy I was very surpised at the poor quality of these stockings I have purchased Leg Avenue before and found them to be excellent however these were like fifty cent bought off the back of someone s truck brand As a matter of fact I ve bought better fifty cent off the back of the truck stockings Leg Avenue is now off my list Of course if they priced them three for a dollar now that might be worth the price 
Capris This product was disappointing Not at all what was expected and sizing was way way different than expected I guess they will make a nice gift for my 12 year old niece since that is the type of body that a womens large will fit 
stinky socks I wore these once and got a huge hole in the toe Should not happen at nearly 6 a pair and a logo of GOLD TOE 
FALSE ADVERTISEMENT These socks are advertised as seamless toe socks They are very thin and they DO have a very uncomfortable seam in the toe Not only does the seam press into the toe but you can feel the inner seam of the shoe itself Terrible product 
Not worth the money I was very disappointed with this bra I would definately not recommend it If you are looking for a good and supportive nursing bra try the Maternelle bra instead This bra looks sexy but does not offer the support and coverage needed for a nursing bra at least not for a size 38DD 
incorrect sales listing this listing isen t correct item NTS1 is a nylon tank top shirt not a t shirt 
No cotton I bought this bra because the ad says 100 cotton There is no cotton in this bra It is 86 nylon and 14 elastane If you want a cotton bra this is not for you 
NOT street shoe size Although the description of these booties says they run true to size they do not I ordered a full size and a half larger than my daughter s regular shoe size and they were still too small for her to put on her feet Now I have to pay more shipping for an exchange Not a great transaction experience 
NOT GOOD ENOUGH This bag was not what I expected The leather was cheap and it wasn t really big enough to fit much I would not recommend this bag if you want it to hold a lot of items paper 
Poor jacket Do NOT buy I have the same jacket in black but I bought this from elsewhere What a rip off it is It is made in china and the feather keeps on coming and on a given day I had to remove atleast 20 25 of the feathers since they peek so much I doubt how long this is going to last as eventually it will be a skinny jacket without the feathers Do not BUY 
serious feather loss This jacket is extremely poorly made I have it in black but I should say black and white because there is so much white from the feathers peeking through 
Cheap When I purchased this I was under the false impression that the idea of a silicon skin was to provide the unit with some shock protection in the event that it were to get dropped The skin is so thin that it does nothing but keep a little bit of dust off of the buttons The belt clip is made of brittle plastic and broke the second day that I used it Don t waste your money spend the extra bucks to get something that will last a while 
I expected more When you buy Natori you expect the best But this product just isn t up to their usual high standard Most disappointing is the elastic used at the leg and waist openings For 20 dollars they should be awesome They aren t My favorite panty right now is a Nordstrom brand boy short that is really comfortable and costs about 10 bucks I haven t seen them online but this is worth a trip to the store 
Sized too small waste of money I have found Gerber brand clothing to be disappointing The don t stand up to laundering very well in that they shrink quite a bit They already seem small for the size on the label but it gets worse after you wash and dry them even on the delicate cycle My 6 week old was already wearing onesies and sleepers sized 3 6 months It s worth spending the extra money for a better brand such as Carter s 
Very thin and light This is an okay jacket The padding in it is okay Sizes tend to run a little smaller than normal There is no liner and you will get cold riding at night Overall the jacket has only 2 layers and if you hold it in front of you you can see through the mesh Spend a little bit more and get something that will hold up 
crocs I thought I was on the same page as crocs when I ordered the PWClog It confusing I thought I was ordering a sale on Crocs They are not Crocs 
shoes i was very disappointed in the shoes i were them to work and within 1 hour then strap on them broke i love the way they look but not the quality of them i would take them in every color made if they were worth the money spent on them 
You do not send me this t shirt Why I do not know But be more carefully anbout it 
not what I thougth I ordered For starters this shirt is not a lighter royal blue like it is pictured it is a very dark navy blue Very dark Also the sizes run big Every t shirt i own is a size Large this shirt is a size large but is WAY too big Be warned 
Way Over Rated Not a great shoe at all Although very cute Crocs are not good shoes They are a cheap plastic shoe that is over priced and NOT comfortable at all I bought a pair for my two year old daughter because of the ease to clean them and because they are non slip She did slip in them many times and the worse part is that they gave her huge terrible red blisters on the side of her feet They are the right size but I just think they are not made well Don t go for the hype They are a useless shoe 
DONT LISTEN TO OTHER REVIEWS TOTAL JOKE first of all they dont even go up TO the thigh they attempt to sit right above the knee second THEY DO NOT STAY UP AT ALL WHATSOEVER I was sooooo embarrassed i went out with them on and every ten seconds I was pulling them back up I am 5 3 and I weigh about 125 I m average these are a joke price IS too good to be true DO NOT BU 
Thin and cheap feeling I purchased this item thinking that it would make a nice gift but upon receiving it found it looks and feels like something from a dollar store and it s not even worth the dollar Very cheezy item 
Too Small Ordered mens 6 5 for my son shoes are sized a womans 6 5 say mens 6 5 on box and shoe I m going to have to pay 6 50 to return them for a larger size Don t waste your money Buy NIkes 
Good Weight but Quality Suffers My review appears to be inconsistent with the others Weeks after I received my jacket I had to take it to a seamstress to have stitching repaired in several places This is not following heavy use but wearing the jacket one or two days a week walking to my car and from the car to the office In addition the metal snaps should be replaced with buttons for a better look When considering the cost of the jacket shipping and repairs I should have to gone to Macys and purchased a nicer jacket 
credit Waited weeks and still waiting to date for a credit Very unhappy with return policy Wondering if I ll ever get my credit 
Crazy Measurements I just received this dress today Not only was it cheaply made there are rhinestones missing threads and it doesn t flow smoothly the top of the dress will have you falling out all over the place if you are in any other position than standing completely straight Also the support is badly made I have a very small bust but I don t think this would compliment anyone who isn t built like Barbie Definitely wouldn t recommend It looks great in the picture but it s not being modelled on a real person 
Total crap boots I thought I was going to save a few bucks and buy my next Combat Boots from Amazon to get the cheapest price The seller was totally fine however the boots were total crap The leather was unbelievably stiff and hard so I thought I would just use a ton of leather conditioner about 15 applications and I don t think it made a difference I put the boots on to try and break them in lost cause there but in addition nearly half the eyelets came right out of the lether first or second time trying the boots on I would have returned the except I had shined and polished and oiled the boots so much Don t buy stick with Altama or another Military Issue brand boot I am sticking with my Altama pair I have had for 7 years 
Buyer Beware First of all they didn t sent me the pictured panties but boyshorts in a weird blueish psychedelic print Butt ugly Second they are from a flimsy mesh fabric that looks really cheap and declasse Returned right away Very disappointing 
Sight unseen wallet Not very good pictures or description Wallet was smaller than I expected Quality was OK not competitively priced 
Don t buy unless looks dont matter So I just got my shoes after waiting two long weeks what a dissapointment I open the box and immediately I see what appears to be a defect The inside of the shoe like on your right foot the left side not the right was covered in little black dots that were smudged all over the grey area including smudging on the asics logo This was obviously a manufacturing defect seein it was the same color as the logo which was also smudged Also the shoe glue was leaking out the back of the shoe Poorly done last time I will ever buy ASICS shoes again 
Received an empty box I can t say much for the shoes but Amazon goofed up on this one They shipped out an empty box Luckily UPS caught it and sent notice to Amazon for me 
BEWARE Seller will not honor prices listed then if you leave seller negative feedaback AMAZON WILL REMOVE IT Do not trust seller ratings they are false 
Very Small Lookslike it would be a nice product but it s only for very small babies up to 12 pounds and 23 inches My baby is very long and just doesn t fit wish Target Amazon would have been more upfront with the sizing 
One Size no indication of the One Size is XL We have not opened the package The item is advertised as one size Without a notice that the one size is not One Size fits all It is XL Grand Plus for those that speak french My wife wears a size 2 or 4 Obviously this was a waste of money 
Do not buy This hoodie is very poorly made I bought a blue version and I had to return it after washing it in COLD water on GENTLE It faded substantially changed shape and the threading came loose Not recommended 
Too thin not bad design These garments were so thin as to not do many of the things one expects of underwear 
not the material I wanted It won t help you get dry it s more of a robe to hang out I had to return it and the seller was really nice and gave me a refund 
Not so good These bras do not hold up very well I started wearing them in June after the birth of my son and I have already had to throw both of them away six months later 
support I ordered this nursing bra after looking at several and reading other reviews on this product I received the product in good condition and in an appropriate time frame That is where the only star I am giving is coming from I am concerned with having a good supportive bra I have fairly large breasts and do not want to be sagging to my knees in 50 years This bra is the farthest thing from supportive I had to cut the straps and re sew them to make them shorter so I could even where it The material is soft but thin and stretchy I have never ordered a clothing item over the internet before and I will not again 
MOST HORRIBLE BRA I HAVE EVER BOUGHT I have been a 34 size for my entire life and this bra fits terrible the fabric is stiff and so uncomfortable I could not wait to take it off Champion should stick to making sports bra do not buy this bra or you will suffer Plus it looks much thinner in the picture it is really thick it feels like a maternity bra UGH 
What can you expect form a 10 pair of sunglasses These broke within the first 3 days of use 2 screws for one lense came loose and the other lense started to crack near where the screw insert is located 
Shipping Problems On Sept 17 I ordered a cashmere wrap I finally got the company s attention when I placed a negative review on this forum I was told if I removed the review after recieving the item I would be credited for shipping The item arrived Oct 16 As of today November 20 my credit card had not been credited I emailed the company and was told the credit should appear in four to five days 
WAY WAY WAY too small OK I am not overly modest and 95 of the shorts pants I buy fit when I purchase and XL size These shorts are made for anorexic bean poles If you have thighs legs or even a tiny bit of junk in the trunk forget it These are designed for 16 year old girls not men Shipping is also super slow 
shoes The picture of the shoes was deceiving Did not want ankle strap You could not go by the picture Which is how you do online shopping Returned the shoes 
Report Wedge Buyers be aware that the picture does not show the correct shoe The real shoe has an ankle strap Also the shoe seemed to run a half size smaller I had to return the shoe and lose out on shipping costs 
Everything was good except The skin is fine and all the extras were nice The one thing I really needed was a good elastic band for the arm This product does not have a good elastic band It s too thin and not durable enough 
Too narrow These boots look very nice but unfortunately it is way too narrow and I have narrow feet My whole foot felt squashed Back to Amazon it goes 
cheap pool shoe This shoe is like having a hard piece of plastic under foot 
Too small These socks do not fit the sizes specified The elastic is so tight that you can hardly get them on your feet I gave them to my 12 yr old son and they were too tight on him also I threw them out This is the first and last time I will buy those socks The Reebok sneakers are great though 
Rockport Slip on I wear a lot of Rockport shoes Almost exclusively I was very disappointed in these shoes They are the same size as all of the other Rockports I have yet they are too small 
who makes these shoes Same as the capezio jazz shoes Way to small for normal people None of the kids 48 could fit into the shoes in the sizes that where recommended All had to go up at least 2 3 sizes larger and almost all needed the wides Very frustrating Makes me want to start my own dance shoe business not for profit 
Hanes Toeless Hosiery Not comfortable The thong between your toes is too thick and too tight If you are looking for toeless this is not the way to go Try DKNY hosiery instead Expensive but worth it for the comfort factor and they are very durable 
Missing piece When the product came it was torn and had one of the three pieces missing I called the seller and they said all of the purses were missing one piece I would not order from this seller unless you are not worried about all the pieces 
Worst sneakers ever I wish I could give them 5 stars I got these to replace a pair of New Balance 999 that I had for almost 10 years thinking that the quality of shoes that cost around 170 should be really good I couldn t be more wrong The lining of these shoes started falling apart a just after 3 month of wearing them and not even every day Stay away at all cost 
Desription is not correct i thought this purse was cute but upon receiving it i was disappointed the purse is black with silver buckles but the stitching is a gold color and does not go well with the rest of the purse also i have tried to return it and have not been able to get a hold of anybody to help me 
Disappointing Unfortunately The other day I excitedly tried this bra on at Walmart I couldn t believe I could possibly purchase a strapless bra without going to a specialty store Unfortunately the bra does not appear to be made for those with fuller figures despite its claims Depending on the company I am a 38 DD or 34FF I tried this bra on in a 38 DD I was impressed with the way it molded to me but was unimpressed with the support Basically under a shirt I sagged as if I was wearing no bra at all That is not the effect I want when I go strapless Only Goddess seems to have the ability to create full figured bras that give the same support in strapless bras that you expect from the strapped variety 
Nice but small Bag was well made but too small Can t put much in it Nice well made leather bag If it was three times bigger it would be a perfect 
Time To Find A New Favorite I was excited to get my first pair of 992 and was certain that they would be every bit as good as the 991 however I had many of the same negative experiences other reviewers have had The shoe is hard uncomfortable and much wider than the 991 My foot slides around everywhere I recomend buying these shoes only if you are buying them for thier looks and then only after trying them on first Don t be mistaken by thinking you can just buy a 992 in the same size and width that you wear in a 991 
992 S are a horrible shoe beware make sure you can return them I absolutely agree with Brett A Warner these replacements feel horrible They don t have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991 s on I bought them at a local store which did not take returns So they just sit in the closet If you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will I wear a 11 1 2 
Do not buy these shoes for running I have run in a pair of 991s for the last 5 years I was disappointed to hear that the 991 was replaced by the 992 I purchased a pair of 992 hoping for similar comfort and fit The 992s are nice to look at but the similarities stop there The fit is horrible even after going down from a D to a B width The cushioning I ve come to love in the 991 is simiply not there in the 992 I had a New Balance representative tell me point blank that he wouldn t recommend the 992 for running at all What is that old adage If it s not broke don t fix it Did New Balance even test this shoe before implementing it 991 lovers beware this shoe is not for you I guess the quest begins for a new running shoe 
Best Jeans Nevah Big for the size advertised not fitting as snugly for pear shaped gals Hoped it would shrink since I m a perfect 6 and it didn t Disappointed 
CUT VERY SMALL this is the SMALLEST extra large I have ever bought my daughter is 125lbs and wears a size 2 dress and it s SUPER tight on her this was very disappointing to say the least if you normally wear a small in other things I would suggest you buy the extra large in this The quality of the material is GREAT that s what made me even give this product a 2 
Very Disappointing I purchased the non premium kit 9 99 with a Silicone skin case cover and 2 screen protectors one for each screen but it is the same case The problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery twice as slippery as the Nintendo Lite without the cover We thought that washing them in Dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness but that didn t work After handling the cover your hands have a slippery residue on them The other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection not impact protection The screen covers that come with the non premium kit are ok I guess but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised trust me the screen was clean I purchased 2 kits and I had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort I do not recommend this product at all 
No LUV from Luvable Friends poor quality I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old Luvable Friend s onsies are awful The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies And the velcro doesn t even stick They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old Lastly even the shirt tag stinks It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son Shame on them for making such a cheap product shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review 
Do not buy this if you are large chested I was excited to FINALLY find a black nursing bra This bra fits horribly Do not buy if you are DD E cup This bra is uncomfortable and doesn t hold your goods properly 
Amazon s price is way out of line on this item While I can t agree with the other reviewer RE the quality of the 560 jeans it seems excellent to me having owned six pairs over the last two years which I wear to work every day and certainly as men s jeans I don t think they re out of style I do have to say Amazon s price on this item is far far out of line You can find these same jeans online elsewhere for 38 with free or cheap shipping meaning the cost is nearly 20 less than what Amazon is charging 
OUT OF STYLE OUT OF STYLE All the girls make fun of me for wearing Levi jeans They say it is a sure sign of being old and out of style The fit quality durability and comfort level do not seem to be as good as they were two decades ago There is definitely a noticeable difference and not a positive one The price far exceeds the value OVERPRICED 
Slip off Slip ons These slippers are very comfy and fit true to size However the fabric part between the toes is not anchored to the solid part of the slipper It s sewn to the terry lining covering this solid part and when I walk the slippers fall off my feet I will not purchase these slippers again 
Disappointing This seller fails to state that the snap is in the inner lower corner of each cup which is probably why its so cheap When I opened the package and unsnapped the cup the entire snap fell off When I emailed Alys s customer service they said only unopened merchandise is returnable Needless to say I don t recommend this bra 
Doesn t hide nipple protrusion I really wanted this product to work but it really didn t help with my problem I always have erect nipples no matter what and this really doesn t fully flatten them or make them less noticeable with t shirts etc 
These don t work I was so disappointed in these I am full busted 38DD and my nipples are sensitive and show through my bra and shirts all the time I used a band aid and it did a better job These provided no help at all AND they REALLY HURT taking them off 
Don t cover my pokies These didn t do the job as far as keeping my nipples from poking out so much They do have great adhesive Also no good if you are trying to hide the darkness of the areola because they are pretty small I used every pair just thinking I was putting them on poorly but everytime I was a pokin 
Not so good The nippits didn t really work for me and they were painful to remove 
Unbearably itchy I love toeless hosiery but these are the most uncomfortable pantyhose I have ever worn If I m sitting down at all the backs of my thighs start to itch so horribly and it gets worse when I stand These are awful I can t stand it The only good things I can say are unlike some toeless pantyhose I have worn in the past the toe thong does not bind and the lightest color actually is light enough for my skin tone but it is so not worth the itching Also they run rather large the material doesn t have nearly enough stretch and they bag around the ankles and knees I m only 5 feet tall but out over 120 lbs and the smallest size is still too big I ll give Hue s a try and I might even spring for the Donna Karan toeless panythose but I won t get these ones again 
Its going to break it tore apart while running and smashed into a million pieces look at tuneBelt They have one that fits pretty good 
disappointed in quality I was disappointed when I got the shoes and one of them was made with inferior suede and very thin I emailed the company I bought them from and requested an exchange return many times They never responded and I ended up keeping the shoes as I needed them for work I would not purchase from this company again 
I wouldn t buy from them I wouldn t order from Andrew Christion again I ordered three shirts more than a month ago They sent only two and never responded to my emails Where s my shirt 
ughhhhhhhhhhhh I was givin this case for christmas and I thought it was great for the first month then I took it off to get some dust off the screen and my screen was totally scratched and it also scratched the space above the click wheel and below the screen I am a total scratch freak but still I was really mad WARNING if YOU don t like your iPod scratched DO NOT get this case 
DO NOT BUY THIS CASE I purchased a iPod video and the case has scratched up the screen around the outside On the inside of the case they ve got some ruff edges that will damage you iPod screen If you d like scratches on your iPod screen then purchase this case but if you d like to keep your screen from being scratched then STAY AWAY FROM THIS CASE 
Where s the butter the crocs butter turned out to be a sponge with a light infusion of some sort of oil which you rub on the shoes I have used it about three or four times and I don t feel it will last much longer What there was of it seemed to work well but it seems rather a waste of money considering the amount of actual use 
Not worth the money I purchased the Crocs Butter thinking it would be something special just for Crocs shoes As soon as I opened the package I noticed the Crocs Butter is just like any other shoe buffer cleaner with the black sponge I already own two shoe buffers one of which I received free with purchase from a local shoe store Needless to say I returned the Crocs Butter since it s not worth 4 95 plus 10 shipping which I was not refunded What a crock 
Not what I expected These were not as expected there was no cap to cover the holes where the wheels are at so if he decided to take out the wheels there was just an open hole He has problems using these too 
Nine West Efney Sandal This shoe is extrememly uncomfortable The straps at the toes run right across so your pinky toe gets seperated and will get caught under the toenail I won t ever wear them again 
Has weird arms The jacket we received had weird arms they had a hole for the thumb and then another for the rest of the fingers Great for skiing or snowboarding but for casual use in Florida winter wasn t very practical Columbia in general is a company I swear by 
Too Much I realize anyone admitting to wearing a 3X is in trouble in the conservation of fabric but this manutacturer must be very generous The garment was SO LARGE I could have made two out of the one unit This certainly was an error in sizing or I am smaller than I thought I hesitate to purchase from this retailer because I can not trust their product sizes and sending stuff is expensive and a hassle 
Hate this bra I hate this bra The elastic band is NOT soft and rolls up as the day wears on Shoulder straps are skinny inadequate Only good thing is that it is low cut I prefer my 12 nursing bras purchased at Wal Mart I only wear this one if those are unavailable or my shirt is low cut 
No Headache Midsize Purple Visor The mid size is actually quite large Had I to do it over again I would just get the original size because that would be sufficient I like a bit of sun but just not in my eyes I found that when wearing it in a boat with the wind at my face as we traveled it stayed on very well That was a concern that I had since many visors flip off in heavy wind currents I did get a slight headache from it but not as bad as other visors The visor part seems to be a hard plastic with a light cloth material covering I chose purple and it is a beautiful shade The bows that go around your head are made of some soft comfortable material and they go farther around your head than other standard visors 
Nice Looking gloves These gloves should really be called Simulation Leather They are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather I wouldnt feel comfortable riding a Motorcycle with these if you hit the pavent with them they d probably just vaporize 
False item description by seller As much as seller might like this backpack to be 11 by 8 5 by 6 5 the one I ve got is surely not that big 10 x8 x4 at best and as a result of this it is totally unsuitable for me since notebooks would absolutely not fit into it and judging by the size the seller decided to advertise was it what they were aiming for The material is ok so is the craftsmanship but the fact that they lied yes l i e d about the size just completely spoils the whole deal A great dissapointment 
just ok i have had my bag for a couple of months the liner on the inside has already ripped 
these are HUGE i always wear a small so i bought two pairs of these in a small and neither fit they fall right off my hips 
If the shoe fits I ordered a 11 5EEE size slip on shoe Despite the labelling in the shoes they felt more like 12 5EE In other words too tight across the arch and so loose on the heel they wore like flip flops Unfortunately the only way to truely measure the wearing comfort of shoes is to wear them which voids the company s product return policy Anybody want a worn once pair of shoes cheap 
Horrific The top was very roughly finished The end of the blue part that crosses the chest did not stay in place because the seams on it were very rough so I had to take the whole part out because it made the top look more crooked than it is supossed to be The top got COMPLETELY ruined on the first wash I followed the instructions to a T during washing but still the blue on the top ran and I had to throw it away The skirt is still fine after washing it twice but I would not recommend this outfit to anybody 
Not even Vanity Fair I love Vanity Fair Their bras just fit me perfectly When this bra arrived I quickly found it was not Vanity fair Not only that but it was made of the most rough and uncomfortable material I tried it on in hopes it may fit It was the most uncomfortable bra I have ever tried on Not because of size It was bulky rough and obviously inexpensively made The tag said something along the lines of Made in Hong Kong 
Two different shoes The main shoe photo is not the shoe that is sent with your order Amazon had said they would rectify the error although it looks like the main photo still shows the shoe with the circle buckle and the shoe that is sent has long ankle ties and a different strap entirely 
Pantyhose had snags when they arrived First time I ve ordered a product from Leg Avenue and it ll probably be my last I opened up the package and the pantyhose already had 4 runs in one of the legs before I even tried them on What a waste of money and if I would pay to ship them back for another pair then I ve already put way too much money into what should be an inexpensive product 
You get what you pay is always true The glasses look fine from a far distance They are produced very carelessly Given that it s on sale the quality can not be as high as normal However it should not that bad 
good buy but I thought the price of the glasses was too good to turn down so i decided to go through with the purchase When i received the product they looked very cheap and poorly made Throughout the first day i had the glasses they broke in the bag which was in my pocket I then tried to fix them and finally realized they could never be fixed 
Misrepresentation I was disappointed with the shoes when I received them On the website the shoes looked Gold in color and were described as Gold but when I received the shoes they were beige I am sorry to say that I could not wear the shoes 
1 Star For Deceptive Placement These are NOT RAY BANS They should not come up when I do a search for Ray bans Get your cheap CRAP out of my search for GENUINE Ray Bans 
Too much girlfriend I got two problems with this here lingeree 1 That model at the top of the page is sparkin hot how come it never looks the same on my girlfriend EH False advertizing if ya ask me Their shold be a law that all lingeree models hafta weigh 250 and have a bit of hair on their legs like my woman does Or a warnin label Objects inside this lingeree are uglier than they appear 2 I paid 14 95 and there aint enough there to blow yer nose on My suggestion go for the crotchless OR the bustless OR the fishnet but all three is just not enough lingeree and too much girlfriend 
unsatisfied My son picked out these shoes for basketball He liked them at first and gave them time to get broke in but the outsides of the shoes had no give Most shoe will form to your foot these did not At the end of third stripe you could feel a big ridge on the inside of the shoe We had to buy a different pair of shoes that formed to his foot better Nice looking shoe but not the greatest fit 
uncomfortable I have been wearing boyshorts for ages and I gave these ones a try because they were on sale and were really cute The fit is HORRIBLE The seam down the middle constantly rides up into very uncomfortable places I mean the whole point of a boyshort is to not have to pick wedgies I even bought them a size larger because some brands tend to fit a little snug 
i got ripped off i ordered this product from general_discounters and I have tried for 4 wks and still I have not gotten a response from them and I havent received my order As far as the actual cologne it is nice but order it from that company and you ll not get to smell it because you wont get it All other potential buyers of this cologne beware of the seller and make sure if its 4 days or more late contact seller 
This sword picture is a real foil It does not match description I am not happy with what I got in the mail today I thought I was getting a real used fencing foil Instead I got a kids plastic fencing sword Sending it back ASAP to get my account credited for sure Why is a real sword picture used to sell a kids fencing foil 
Is there a zero star I bought this item because it said optional belt clip The belt clip is only optional if you opt to leave it on and not use it You cannot opt to take it off I would not call this belt clip optional I would call it will ruin your new phone case if you attempt to remove it which is what happened to me mere moments after taking it out of the paper envelope it shipped in 
On Your Feet Women s Fritz Flat Embellished Thong I wish I did not order this one The picture looks nice but when I got it today I really got disappointed When you look at it closer the wood beads sequins and the cloth are very cheap looking I wish they used nicer sequins and glossy beads 
Company does not actually stock this belt I ordered 5 of these belt buckles The company sent the wrong items 2 times before finally admitting they didn t actually have this belt I needed the belts for a deadline and if they had told me the first time that it wasn t in stock I could have ordered it elsewhere 
True is the stitch that digs These tighty whiteys are close to being a perfect everyday bikini However as another reviewer noted there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin I m normally a 32 waist and the pairs that I own are for my size medium 32 34 Streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam but I ve also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this Maybe buying the next size up would work but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and I like keeping em close to home 
Uncomfortable I bought some of these I find they have a large seam on the right side which digs into my skin and is quite uncomfortable Other than that they are OK but because of this I mostly wear these inside out 
Low quality uncomfortable Look a little harder if you want an alternative to boxers and bland briefs The Elance is poorly made and designed Jockey is barely evern trying Look on the web guys there are better choices Jockey s Elance and the similar department store knockoffs of womens underwear are lame 
More trouble than it s worth I am not leaking so I don t need those annoying papery pads but I would still like a little padded protection so I was hoping this bra would do the trick Well it served that purpose alright but it was a pain as far as nursing went The clasp was difficult to release with one hand The cup could not be completely pushed out of the way during nursing making it annoying for baby and making discretion difficult Worst of all the underwire gave me a rash This bra may work for some but not for me 
Felt like I had a wedgie Like a permanent wedgie these kept riding up my crack I don t recommend these at all the liquid metallic look is only useful if you re going to be a male stripper Otherwise you ve got liquid metal up your crack not very appealing 
Very comfy but ugly You can t beat this shoe for comfort but they re definately cuter in the picture I thought they made my feet appear extra long and the heel didn t quite seem to fit the shoe I returned them 
Pointy I agree Cup had too much left at the end and all I can say is pointy 
it sucks the bra cup itself is too big for my chest and although interesting to look at because it looks like a bra women may have worn daily in the 30 s and 40 s it is not at all comfortable blah and i love vanity fair so its disappointing for sure 
Poor Design I bought this hat for my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas She loved it The downside the elastic stretch band on the inside of the hat was so tight that the hat would not sit on her head without popping off We would have returned it but it was Christmas morning and my granddaughter was thrilled with the concept of having a cowgirl hat We ultimately solved the problem by cutting out the elastic band and the hat now fits just fine I guess the elastic band is supposed to make the hat fit various sized heads but it is beyond me how the hat would stay on anyone s head 
Don t like this at all This hat is not suitable for a small child It is WAY too big and the material it is made of is too hard and stiff If I had been there when it arrived I would have sent it back 
Cute with capris skirts pants but kind of uncomfortable I have these in black and while I find them to go with just about every outfit I wear to work I wish they were just a little read quite a lot less uncomfortable Firstly the insole provided doesn t seem to fit the inside of the shoe properly Almost like it s too wide My foot is neither narrow nor wide so this isn t something I typically notice about a shoe There is an arch but because of the weirdly shaped insole it doesn t provide any support The zig zap strap is a really cute feature that I love but it just adds to the uncomfort of the shoe You can tighten the strap to keep your foot from sliding around inside but then it cuts off circulation and leaves painful imprints If you leave it too loose then you leave your feet pretty unstable All in all a versatile mary jane with good looks but no comfort 
VERY uncomfortable These slippers are anything but comfortable Besides the sizing being to small I felt like I was putting my foot into a kid s slipper The width is way to small to be comfortable on anyone s foot and the inside material is also anything but comfortable 
The WORST purchase I have ever made It is ironic that you would send this to me I can not tell you how excited I was to purchase these slippers I had bought everyone in my family UGG slippers for Christmas Everyone had cozy slippers but me SO instead of paying over 60 I found this pair of Warmbat on amazon I researched the brand and thought they may be a good match I received the slippers as amazon promised in a timely manner The next day the right slipper fell apart the stitching and the bottom of slipper fell off I was upset and sewed them and glued them The following week the left slipper fell apart I did not want to go thru the process of shipping back the slippers they were 29 00 SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed Please forward to WARMBAT 
Indian Print Cotton Full Length Ladies Skirt There was no draw string waist and it didnt fit complete waste of money Yeah I realize they do returns but usually companies send you packages and slips to return merchandise with fast and efficient and there were neither Didnt fit actual description was off and ships within 24 hours means 24 hours after whatever point being I didnt get the package for like 3 weeks when I was out of town and didnt have time to return it Ive bought skirts at a quarter of this price and they were made of much better material and didnt take 3 weeks to get to me Just be smart 
Not good enough F This is a piece of garbage It s cute looking and just barely will fit just your DS and maybe a few games and the cleaning cloth but as far as any kind of long term travel functionality look elsewhere The charger doesn t fit in there very well which I don t think is an unreasonable demand for a handheld device carrying case I was able to squeeze both my DS Lite and the charger in there for awhile but recently the zipper broke and I had to split it apart to get to my stuff and now it s useless If all you want is something to carry just the DS in this is a decent option Otherwise forget it 
Poor fit I purchased this item for my granddaughter who is 13 for use with her Nintendo DS Lite The case does not fit at all and I have had to search for a different type of case to fit her game 
Not worth the money This carrying case was a terrible purchase The zipper broke within hours and the Nintendo DS Lite doesn t really fit into it very well I was very disappointed My six year old used his own money to buy a G Pak case which is a much better case for the Nintendo DS Lite 
Items not yet received Until today 01 09 2007 I did not yet receive item Hi Cut Brief 7_8701_1176 XL Light Beige nor Bali Lace Trim Moderate Control Hi Cut Brief 8044 XL Light Beige both purchased on 11 30 200 
getting impatient the product was received on 6 18 When I tried it on I found it to be too large Utilizing the return form included with the order I completed it and returned the item via UPS on 6 20 I m still not sure about the return policy When I hadn t heard from The Uniform Company after about 2 weeks I called them I was informed that they did in fact receive my return but the size that I needed Large was not in stock and it would be 4 to 5 days before it could be shipped I m still waiting When I get the product I can properly review it 
Not what i expected I just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs from another online company because they seemed inexpensive durable and came in many fun colors I was sorely disappointed The colors are pretty but the material is crummy Its rough flimsy and feels like plastic The pastel colors citron cool mint etc are almost see through and definitely show patterned underwear The tops run quite large i wear a 6 8 on top and the medium is VERY Roomy i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again 
Never got my item I ordered a pair of scrubs for a friend to be sent to my P O Box but the seller used UPS which won t send packages to P O Boxes so I gave an alternate address I ve never recieved the scrubs for my friend I ve sent e mails inquiring about my order and haven t recieved any word back I ve been cheated out of my money 
Not really a cover up These cover ups are very thin a scratchy material not very comfortable to wear in the hot sun The colors are pretty but the size is not really conducive to cute styles and wraps They are cheap good thing because I can t imagine what to use them for I d return them but the postage would cost more than the item 
Not enough information I was a bit dissapointed i know its my fault i didn t pay to much attention to the tag that is not the color they show the one you are ordering it SHOULD be the same thing you re looking physically the thing you re gonna buy i saw this beautifull gray orange stripes and got GREEN WHITE STRIP�S its very easy to put a picture of the product regard 
maternity shorts just didn t like the way they turned out medium size ran way too big for me too I didn t know how to return so I just kept them 
Not Recommended Although the dress may seem to fit the ideal dress from the movie How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days the cut of the dress leaves extra fabric right under the area of the bust This made me look awkward and did not fit well Don t waste your money on the shipping that you will have to pay for when you return it as I did 
Not really good for plus women Nice stretchy material but too short and I m usually a 16 18 The G string is not even close to plus size don t even bother 
Item quality and vendor s customer service unsatisfactoy The sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body My husband is 6 178 pounds so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit but this one looked like a stiff kite on him BE AWARE The items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money and only after I had filed a complaint with Amazon Amazon acted quickly to post the credit 
Straw Paper First let me say that I was VERY impressed with the shipping speed of this hat which was nice because I bought this as a last minute gift Though with that said there is a BIG difference between straw and straw paper This hat is straw paper I m afraid to see what will happen once this hat gets wet from sweat or rain I really think Amazon should improve this hat s description 
Not received I guess that I cannot properly review this item I never received it This is the second time that I ordered from this same company Anderson Christian with almost the same results The company billed my credit card upon ordering and then sent one e mail saying that the items that I ordered are on back order I eventually cancelled the order Due to the fact that I live overseas at the moment I order a lot of things online I will not be ordering from this company again 
Sizing Be careful this runs REALLY small I got the 18 24 for my 14 month old and it would fit better on an average 6 month old Otherwise it seems of nice quality 
My Husband s Christmas Present Sorry Honey I bought these slippers as a present for my husband for Christmas I can t return them because he wore them for a day These slippers were so badly made that he is wearing his old slippers The shape of the sole on the right foot is the same as the left Don t waste your money 
One size my If your loved one is a beautiful 5 7 130 lb slender lady like mine forget about this piece of clothing If however she is a 5 1 180 lb gorgeous petite girl this might just be the excitement inducer you are looking for You ll have lots of fun first trying to put it on her then trying to use the slits which are in all the wrong places and then finally to remove it from her body without injuring her or yourself Fun that will come after that is purely optional 
Defective These look and feel good but the little nobs do break off pretty quick ruining the shoes completely Do not buy them 
defective merchandise The little knobs in the sole of the sandals started breaking off soon after I got the sandals I have had these sandals before and this didn t happen Maybe they redesigned the sole with narrower and thus more fragile nubs All I know is they are junk 
Disappointed I bought these shoes to do aerobics in They look good and are comfortable but only to walk in There is zero arch support and when I walk in them I feel as if my feet are flat on the ground There is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics My old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones but I can t use the old ones The gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes They are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt I am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location Now I have to look again 
Not what I expected The scarf itched my neck smelled funny and was not the color of ivory It was beige It is not cashmere It would not itch if it were cashmere 
Looks good on picture but I had to return it immediately when I opened the box On the picture it looks more blue than purple 
Don t buy these scrubs Unfortunately the pockets are small the fabric is poor quality the seams already have started to split after wearing it twice Overall poor quality I would not recommend these scrubs I personally will never buy from this company again On a more positive note they did get the right size and shipped promptly 
cute but not a good fabric These undies look very cute but they don t breathe and well let s just say that wicking moisture away rather than trapping it is what one should expect in underwear 
PRADA S THROW UP ORANGE Look it s on sale Usually 800 00 now you can get it for only 150 00 And you won t find anyone else wearing this original Make your drunken friends dizzy with envy Spill anything on this shirt it has already has every color in it and no one will notice the spill Worth every penny As a bonus you can also wear this shirt while hunting 
Disappointed in Quality I purchased this skin to accompany my daughter s new mp3 player We managed to tear the skin first thing out of the box even though we were being careful or so we thought I expected higher durablity 
Barely there is right I agree with the other review I love the tag free feeling but that was about all I liked about this bra The fabric seems really cheap After maybe 6 washings my Barely There CC Tagfree was feeling flimsy and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill For what they charge for even basic bras these days I definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months I would not buy another one of these unless they significantly improved the fabric 
Not buying again Had only 4 wks poss washed 2x and hung dry and underwire is coming out of side and poking me 
Not what I ordered The color that I received and the color that was online was not the same I shipped it back Had to pay for the shipping and handling and insurance myself Tried to resolve through Hungry Lion but they claimed the color was never shown online when it was Hungry Lion did say I would get a refund on the item Still have not checked to see if I have received credit yet Still waiting for my statement 
terrible terrible These slippers are not a bargain They fall apart within a few months and then you need to buy another pair again Don t buy em They re junk 
No Arch Support I bought these slippers because the description specified arch support but in fact the slippers have none In the photo the sole of the slipper appears to have a raised arch area however this turns out to be only a styling effect where the sole wraps the upper there s no structure under it at all The quality of the slipper s upper is lower than expected it appears to be entirely sythetic despite the description of wool blend Also one of the soles was not glued in properly and fell out after I put my foot in the slipper the first time The rubber sole is substantial though heavier than I like to wear in a slipper All in all I regret spending the money on these 
not really happy with scrubs In general I don t think much of the manufacture of the scrubs that are sold for medical professionals I thought Dickies would be the best but found they are mostly like the others After I received these I ordered Dove Apparel which are more expensive but thicker of material and sturdier of make 
wife not happy she said it was not very good and ended up not wearing it at all 
Terrible I bought this from Motherhood and hated it It is too narrow and so puts a lot of pressure on your hips and pelvic bones which any pregnant lady knows our bones are already moving and don t need more help The mother ez belt was fabulous though I wore it for the last 4 months Forget about this one though 
This is not Gore Tex apparently there is an error in the item description these are not gore tex and are just about as waterproof as a seive I new they probably were not waterproof when I put them on and saw my socks through the mesh upper but desided to test them out anyway stupid me 
It hurts my heels I would not buy this product again It hurts my heeles badly because it is so narrow at that end 
Purchase never received The item is not my concern I still have not even received it 
This product is typical in that it has a tight waist band I am in great shape However I cannot get over that so many men s underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches The idea of Medium as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards My body fat is low I am not profoundly muscular bound As is common in men of my age lower back problems are not unusual I have a 32 waist Is that not Medium sized I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether One size fits all doesn t work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems The draw string is fine It allows flexibility So what if your pants fall down It seems to be the fashion anyway Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary uncontrollable constrictions Also these boxers don t hold up well to any kind of washing They looked like crap after the first time I washed them I wish I could get a refund because I won t wear them again My life partner told me they looked like old men s underwear That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry I am not a mean hearted kind of guy So I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again 
WASTE OF MONEY VERY VERY WEIRD fit Too short too wide tiny ankles very big and loose above ankle 
WAY TOO SMALL I ORDERED A LARGE AND ASSUMED IT WAS ADULT SIZE THIS LARGE WAS LIKE A GIRLS SIZE LARGE VERY SMALL SIZING I RETURNED THE SWEATER 
Not recommended I bought these shoes and they only lasted four months The leather sole was REALLY slippery and never did make it easy to walk with them on By the last month i had them the sole had totally separated from the upper I thought Florsheim shoes were good maybe years ago but not now These shoes are NOT recommended at all 
Florsheim Men s Victor Slip on Black 7 5 EEE I am so disappointed Its with is narrower than stated but its lenghth is longer than stated around 1 size 
Arrived unglued were immediately returned Don t buy these I used to love Florsheim I still wear an old pair of Comfortech s but I got a bad pair of these 
Strange looking Visor This visor is square in shape instead of oval I have never seen a square visor before It looks very strange Also it is not comfortable as it is supposed to be it is uncomfortable at the location where the sides hug to my head I will not be wearing mine 
Very Narrow I bought this shoe and had to return it because it was so narrow I couldn t get it on and I don t have a narrow foot 
Disappointing for Crocs I love all other Crocs styles but was very disappointed in the Prima They are too slim and look odd and stretched out on me They also tend to slip off in the back as I walk yet the other styles fit me perfectly Great idea but they should have worked on it more I can t wear these outside the house 
foam lacking The foam padding does not have enough consistancy It stays compressed with in a short period of time Not recommended 
wrong size Ordered large got youth large too small Threw out receipt before checking My bad wife now wears T shirt to work out in 
Terrible bra Ok for some reason my first review was never posted which only makes me more upset about this bra This bra is useless for me It has snaps instead of clasp which make it a two handed job to open and close not so great for public nursing And for someone who is a 34 36 B C it is amazing to me when the bra slides out of place the nursing pads fall out and my bed becomes soaked with middle of the night leakage All and all I would not recommend this bra 
Broken Used the jump rope maybe 3 4 times and the handle broke off you would expect a quality jump rope for the price but don t count on it Then again it could have just been mine 
Too sheer too small Sorry there is no way this shirt is supposed to last even your first five months runs too small and was completely to thin sheer Can be seen straight through 
Overcharged on order My original order was 1 pair of tennis shoes missing so when I had to re order the 2nd pair of identical tennis shoes I was overcharged also had to pay shipping fees again I tried several times to resolve this problem via Amazon the shipping co Bealls Florida but was basically ignored never received my refund I find this to be deceitful poor customer service 
Comfortable but SMELLY I was so happy when I found these shoes they are cute and comfortable exactly what I was looking for BUT after about two weeks of wearing them always with socks or pantyhose they started to smell terrible I don t have this problem with any of my other shoes This was SO disappointing I will either try to return them or just trash them 
Boots shipped did not look the same as on website I ordered a pair of the adult designer rain boots from Diane s Little Lambs I specifically ordered because the boots appeared to accommodate a wider calf were shorter fuller etc But the boots that arrived were taller even the color was not the same as on the website I emailed the vendor never got a reply So I went to the website to get instructions on mailing the boots back 
Not so comfortable The shoe is too narrow and the sides dig into my feet The sole of the shoe makes it feel like you are off balance I have narrow feet but the structure of this shoe does not lend itself to a comfortable wear at all 
Good idea bad execution This tie winder is not only twice the size I was expecting but it doesn t work After one attempted use the lid no longer stays on I would have returned it if the return shipping didn t cost more than the item 
Looks good but breaks easy I got these for christmas in 06 and they looked great on me Last week I took them to school and I put them in the small pouch of my backpack and at then at the end of the day i took them out at on of the sides had completley snaped in half There was no way to repair them These glasses look good but dont waste your money on these Really cheap I am very unhappy = 
Not to happy Well i am a big sunglass fan i just love them so i was excited to get these they seemed very cute well when i got them the lenses were scratched and there was stuff on the sides of the glasses this was my first purchase from this seller and honestly i dont think i will ever buy from them again 
Did not work for me Unfortunately the pads made my skin break out and gave me a painful rash I think that if they work for you they would be wonderful but if you have sensitive skin they are not for you I love the idea I am a leaky faucet and I would love an easy breast pad that worked I am sick of sleeping with my bra on Hopefully by the time I have my next child they will come up with something even more breathable 
Not so Great Socks I bought these socks to wear for work They didn t even last one day By the end of the first day there was a hole in one of the socks at my heal By the end of the week both socks had quarter sized holes at the heels I bought three pairs so I tossed out the first pair The next week I put on a new pair of socks and once again by the end of the day there was a quarter sized hole in one of the heels 
a damn shame they sent me the wrong size and didn t leave clear returning guidelines You are better off getting something cheaper because this sure as hell wasnt worth the buck 
Look like elf shoes This shoes are uncomfortable and make your feet look wide They run small They look nicer in the picture than they actually are 
Attractive but do not wear well I wore these socks once to a wedding they had a run in them within a couple of hours Admittedly it was an outdoor wedding involving a longish walk on a dirt road but it s not as if I was crashing through the underbrush I was wearing a nice outfit and had no desire to get messed up Bummer the socks got ruined so fast they were really pretty 
Not Water Proof This jacket is wind and water resistant but not waterproof I was soked through after first rain I use it mainly for wind block while biking now 
Mike You can kiss my multi colored behind Mail Fraud I believe its called texas shirt company if this is a real company never had this item to sell I m surprise Amazon com is even associating with them and mike to get this bent out of shape over a 12 dollar item you need to see someone to address your anger issues 
Not that good This product is not what it is cracked up to be I ordered it and it doesn t really work too well i think a button with a piece of elastic would be better There is not enough expansion room its just like not really using anything at all Sorry but i thought the product was not that good 
Wonder button Collar Expander Extender I did not like this product at all It is very hard to use and too small 
Deceived by looks 1 Packaging was shabby 2 The finishing was pathetic with threads hanging out 3 The quality and feel of the cloth was the worst I have ever seen 4 DONT be deceived by the pictures 5 The end product is not worth a gift or personal use nor 25 of the actual cost 
Don t bother A sports bra is supposed to keep the jiggling in check when you exercise but this one doesn t Also the construction leaves something to be desired It s very scratchy around the back of the straps and the hooks where the seams are sewn I bought two After trying them several times I gave up and sent them to charity Don t bother 
Natori bra I found this bra to be not as supportive as they claim Still alot of bounce when exercising and the material seem to be to stretchy so the longer it s worn the more it loses shape The shoulder straps I didn t find had enough support hooks for lift up I personally wouldn t recommend this bra 
What do these sizes mean Are customers to guess what is a small size compared to a large size Is the small for a todder pre schooler or teenager What a waste of time trying to find information on this web site about the sizes 
I want to know also Cannot order these as they do not say what small medium or large= I have a 6 year olde and is 60 s so do I buy a medium or a large I hate this when I want something and there is not enough information 
Would be nice to know what the sizes represent in numbers Would love to order these but sizes are not clear Does small fit a toddler is small a size 7 Not sure how to order 
Disappointed I bought this a size smaller than I thought I needed but maybe I would be happier with it if I had bought it 2 sizes smaller I really don t see how the material this is made out of can have any kind of firm control Sure it s comfortable but I was expecting some kind of control It does smooth out some but not at all what I was expecting 
Picture is inaccurate In the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable but it shows it in a smaller size than the one I wear so once I opened the box I was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome It could not possibly be worn with a low cut top which is why I bought it If you were a size 34d or above beware 
Quality Lacking This jacket is soft and almost luxurious I am greatly disappointed that when hanging the hoodie by the hood it split and tore under its own weight I think this says it all no I would unfortunately not buy and American Apparel item again They are usually sized WAY too small and now I see the quality just isn t there Greener pastures 
Nice look poor fit Perhaps a pediatrist who knows better designed this shoe s insert but I hated it It felt half there There was good cushion at the back and felt like none at the front like those orthotic deals that come on infomercials Well it didn t feel good on my tender forefoot so I sent them back On the other hand the shoe looked great I guess if you really want it shoe can go shopping for some Dr Scholl s 
not much fun to wear This cardigan doesnt have proper buttonholes just cut slits that are both ugly and will not last long The texture went bobbly after one day near the arms 
Buy at your own risk These would be great boots if you had some way of knowing what size to order I emailed Western Chief for a size chart I then ordered my son s boots according to the size chart Western Chief sent me Once I received the boots I was upset to see that the boots were over 1 inch larger than the size chart showed this is a big deal for a child s boot I then called Western Chief and explained the situation and asked to get an actual measurement of a few other sizes so I could order the correct boots I spoke with a Ms Brewer who was rather rude she told me she would have to go to the warehouse to measure the boots and she would call me back Of course that was a week ago I luckily found very similar boots at Target problem solved How could a company have a shoe size chart that is so wrong The bad customer service was just the cherry on top 
jewelry roll by lewis N Clark The item was not as pictured It is funky and of poor quality The seller did not respond when I contacted him about this 
sooooo disappointed I love Nine West shoes but these boots are not made like Nine West It didn t help that when I received them they were damaged I purchased 3 other pairs of Nine West shoes from Amazon and LOVE them but these boots stink 
VALUE For all the costs involved in purchasing the Jedi Robe it was nt worth it Shipping handling and customs charge were not worth purchasing the item I will never shop Amazon or any online store 
I lost my money I received my sunglasses last week they are increibles but they arrived in deficient conditions they have three lines on them and simply I feel that I lost my money I think that you should pay attention to the way eyeglasses are packed for transportatio 
Live Up To Promise The collar stays work as the ad indicates they will They are organized and packaged well The sizes provided accomodate all collars 
Do not buy I have done a review on these socks already which has not appeared They are not a good buy 
Rips at the seems This shoe is very comfortable unfortunately I had to send it back to the manufacturer twice the second time choosing a different style shoe because the net material comes loose from the seems where the laces are I am very dissapointed as I have come to expect quality from Merrell and these shoes fall apart in a few weeks I would recommend a different shoe as this one will last you between 1 and 3 weeks before ripping 
Not worth the price I ve owned a pair of 587s for 18 months wearing them exclusively as walking shoes full time in the summer and very little the rest of the year While the shoes are comfortable I was disappointed at how fast they re falling apart The padding around the ankle has torn there are small holes in the top of the toe box from my big toes and I was surprised to see the description of these shoes on this website to include the statement The solid rubber outsole delivers long wearing durability That s been my major complaint with these shoes shortly after I got them the soles cracked at the heel and now layers of the soles are peeling off I recommend buying another model 
sizing wrong I like how smooth it is under t shirts but the size is out I ordered my usual 34B but found it too small 34B fits in other brands so I know it s not because I ve got bigger 
Too Large Didn t like These two packets of panties were too large I also didn t like the cotton Since I had opened one packet of three I kept it but I sent the unopened packet of 3 back because I didn t like them Jeanne Allen 
2 thumbs down if you have a 60 gig iPod this isn t 4 u it is way too tight limits access to the click reel and completly blocks access to the hold butto 
The soles split after one month I was not pleased with these I bought mine at Target and within one month the soles of both sandals were cracked No refund since they were used 
It didn t work for me Maybe I m naive but I never could figure out how the hooks came out of the keycase They are spring loaded and they turn A certain combination of push or twist or pull seems necessary to get them out I got one out by sheer accident but that is it And there are no directions included So I m back to a keyring and that s not so bad 
Seller has no exchange policy Ordered shoe in my usual size shoe was too tight Bealls does not have an exchange policy whereby they will ship a different size at no charge so I returned the shoes and got credit for the purchase but not for shipping both ways 
sizes are cut small The shirt is of ok quality but the design is hard to see and will probaby wash off quickly Be sure to order a size bigger than you normally would as it is cut small Also my personal opinion is the shipping charge for this very light item is a little excessive 
It was not user friendly and then it broke I broke and chipped most of my short fingernails trying to unlock where the keys are suppose to go Once I got the keys on the holders the zipper broke I threw it away but had to scape up my nails again to get my keys off the holders 
Cheap but still useable Cheap but still useable Inside had a stained piece of paper cardboard Flimsy leather Not recommended 
Still a wedgie This is not a jockstrap It is a thong and is inappropriate for any sporting activity I tried wearing it as regular underwear but found it incredibly uncomfortable let alone not exactly hygenic No surprise that they are phasing them out of their lineup Probably the only uncomfortable underwear made by RIPS 
terrible The corset looks so pretty its a pretty material It can hold you YES it has a boning made of some crappy material after wearing it I noticed something was poking Me both ends the top and the bottom well when I take a look it looks like the type of thing guys use to fish line It hurted so bad so I tried to snip it with some nail clippers they just keep on coming and coming it totally sucks now I cant even use it without thinking of a painful experience 
me too I was getting some boning too but didnt mind This ensemble is a lot of fun to wear once its broken in I wear mine all the time 
From Portugal to China I have owned several pairs of this very boot since 1990 and the first two pairs lasted many years through winter spring and fall Each boot used top quality leather and Vibram soles I actually had the soles replaced on the second pair as they became worn out before the leather upper portion of the boot Both pairs were very comfortable and durable with a look all to their own My third pair which was recently purchased were not of the same quality of the prior pairs of boots The leather was stiff and upon wearing them the first time the top lacing hook pulled out as I began to snug up the laces The backer on the riveted lacing hook was defective from the factory Not being satisfied with the quality of the new boots I sent them back I did notice the country of manufacture was different on the later pair than the previous pairs Made in Portugal to made in China the quality has been degridated and am disappointed in Rockport 
Rockport sizes not normal I bought one pair of shoes and returned them they were to large Bought another pair and hoped that I would adjust to the shoe I haven t I have worn the shoes now and can not return them I plan to give them away to someone they may fit I will never order shoes again I learned my lesson I agree with the other review good quality in the manufacturing poor design as far as the size I believe rockport made a mistake with the size and fit and thats why they are being sold for a discounted price I will go to a shoe depatment and try on the shoes before I buy as I have in the past 
Disappointed Brat Boots are very very dark brown look nothing like the picture fit poorly an item that has to be fitted before purchasing 
not soft enough for me but I bought the wrong size I bought the wrong size the bra was too big but the straps dug into my shoulders that s what wasn t soft customer service returns was great though Essentials com via Amazon 
Bad Boots I bought these boots for my husbamd He only had them less than one week and the soles were breaking down I will never purchase them again 
not impressed I ordered this item on September 10 2006 As of January 12 2007 I have still not received the ordered item but the pictures of it sure are nice One star is one star too many 
Cheap Knockoff not genuine item This was NOT the apple armband they advertised it was a cheap foreign knockoff I wish I had never bought it Terrible misrepresentation of sold item Buyer beware 
Not Impressive rather disapointing I recieved this item yesterday Initaly I was very happy it changed my 8GB black ipod into a green ipod and did a rather good job of it The inner skin is a clear white ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through I would have preferred an opaque white but it did not look terribly bad with the green though blue red or any other color than green would have been better with the black I had not the inital foresight to picture this I was still pretty happy at this point The hip clip was removed right away I have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 portable speaker without taking it out of the case eureka this case did that without the clip of course The lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the iPod nano so that I would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost Well I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off Unitl I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case Now despite the fact that this is the Aluminum iSkin Duo this was not the case at all The green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look Okay that was still acceptable until I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away That was it that was the broke back camel inducement and now I am the proud owner of a case that I will never be happy with At first I had been all excited and was considering the purchase of other colors not now this in my consideration was a waste of money Hopefully I ll confirm that my ipod can still link to the cradle inspite of the clip damage the lanyard has done Sincerly Ro 
Do not buy this This robe virtually fell apart when I washed it It stained the inside of my washing machine It raveled before I even got a chance to wear it Do not buy this product I got the burgandy one I am so disappointed by this product I may stop shopping at Amazon 
Quality plush of hooded terry bathrobe Very ordinary robe compared to picture and descripton If plush means thick material this is not It is low quality thin material with a warning to wash in cold Any terry robe I have had before was thicker and better made Sears J C Penney Does not llook durable 
Not for short women These pants did not look good on me They seem built for thin people While not obese I am not a stick figure either and these just did not flatter me The material is nice though 
Should not be classified as Walking Shoes I purchased these shoes when I started working on a job that required walking almost the entire shift My feet are killing me after working for almost a month There is no cushioning in them nor much arch support 
never recieved the item i am still waiting for a credit to my credit card account the item was not available and they said i would be credited still waiting 
horrible pant horrible service I purchased these for my fiance to wear for our beach wedding in Puerto Rico The quality is horrendous the cut is for MC Hammer not real men and the company charged me over 22 00 to ship them to me and then told me I wanted them Fed EX Not true the pants were returned the rest of my order cancelled and I will never purchase anything from this company again 
2 sizes smaller than size specified This item is about two sizes smaller than the size you order I ordered a size 9 but wasn t able to wear them I gave them to my little brother who s a size 7 they fit him perfectly 
Horible Do not waist your money on this item It looks so unnatural The padding is only on the side of the butt cheeks doesnt cover the whole butt so you can definitly detect the padding I was so disapointed when I tried it on 
a complete and utter waste of money i recently purchase Better Bottom Padded Panties l was really disappointed Like most women i always wish i had a bigger and more curvy bottom but was really disappointed when it arrived the padding was made of cheap foam material and it was very visible under clothing even denim ladies please dont waste your money iam really gutted because i bought some new trosers and i was hoping to wear the padded panties underneath it 
I will be returning this item I will be returning this item to the vendor I rec d this skirt for my daughter and thought it had a colorful embroidery Instead I find the word BASKE in a mirrored embroidered image Not sure what BASKE stands for I guess it s their idea of short for Basketball WHATEVER You can t see the pic clearly I m out the shipping cost on this one What a bummer 
Stylish jacket made of bad material Thinking this jacket was made of fleece like material i ordered it thinking it was a good buy When i got it in the mail a week later i was soooooooooo disappointed The material is like paper potato sack material Its awful Like plastic I dont recommend u waste on this The jacket is stylish no doubt but the material not something u d actually wear So a stylish jacket with bad material describes this jacket best 
A paper bag While I was a little wary of ordering a jacket for 20 online I went ahead and ordered this one It seemed like it was made of durable material and looked snazzy When it came in the mail today it was stuffed in a first class envelope with another t shirt which I really like I was anxious to see what it was like This jacket is literally made of the material used for FedEx envelopes Sounds cool huh The jacket is extremely thin and feels like you re wearing a paper bag While I appreciate the prompt service of the people at Andrew Christian they will probably see my jacket returned within the next couple of weeks 
super duper huge I have Goddess bras and it seems that each style has it s own sizing The love at first sight bra fits wonderfully while this bra is about 3 cup sizes larger than what it is supposed to be 
Tight fit lining is poor The jacket is cut undersized typical of foreign makes with poor quality control The lining in the sleeve keeps coming ot at the wrist which interferes with activity Exterior shell has nice feel but overall a poor piece of work 
Complete Rip Off Very disappointing This product has less control than an average pair of pantyhose The high waist was always rolling down I wasn t expecting miracles I just wanted to smooth out my silouette while I lost the final ten pounds of pregnancy weight This product was completely useless Product has a clever name but that s it I really felt like a sucker for spending so much money on this item Look elsewhere 
Not worth the money This shoe is cut right underneath the ankle Everytime you walk the edge of the shoe rubs into your ankle and causes extreme discomfort and blisters 
Item send was not new Item send was not new Obvious that it had been worn befoe paint on zipper had worn of from use Also a rip in the design 
Me s Rumbil Lace Up I bought this shoe expecting to wear it as a work shoe on occasion however the shape of the shoe is very narrow and it doesn t seem to go with anything including jeans The comfort level is ok not spectacular In reality I don t think this shoe lives up to the Steve Madden name I can t recommend this shoe 
Vibram sole marks like crazy The Vibram soles leave black streaks all over the floors and make it so I cannot wear them at work I love Rockports in general and these are comfortable and well made as expected but they leave a trail of scuff marks 
Eh Amazon didn t tell any outright lies about this product but they certainly weren t what I expected I was expecting something a bit more durable the first night I tried to sleep in these they ripped in the back The immitation satin is so thin that it can barely hold itself together But I can t give them 1 star because they are just as cute as they look 
Not what I was waiting for All boot is made with mademan materials Then they are not as comfortable as I want With the same amount you can find a better option 
Poor Quality Cheaply Made We purchased these boots for my husband who works in the construction field mainly insulation instalation which requires him to climb in high places walk on trusses and also be under floors sometimes in standing water and other harsh weather conditions In my opinion these boots DO NOT have heavy duty rubber soles at all but cheap soles that start to rub and crumble almost immediately under working conditions There is also no arch or foot support inside the boot itself There is a piece of leather saying Made in China and that s it The tag even reccomends getting some sort of insole The worst part is that on the tag of the boot it states that you should get the next size up than what your normal boot size is The seller did not state this fact All in all if you are purchasing these boots for long term wear or work related activities I DO NOT reccomend them If they are for a teenager making a fashion statement or for a Halloween costume they re perfect 
Do Not Order from Andrew Christian We ordered this pea coat from Andrew Christian The coat which is double breasted had no inside buttons You have to have inside buttons to hold the coat evenly I sent it back as defective They were very immovable as to refunding shipping costs to me and then back to them which amounted to 26 23 They insisted that it was not defective I called five other places that had pea coats and they all had inside buttons Not reliable and not good to work with 
Don t bye Don t bye thees They don t look like orginals They are really small so it looks like glasses for children It s just waste of mone 
Too small I would definitely recommend getting a size AND width larger as these fit very snuggly 
This product is typical in that it has a tight waist band I am in great shape However I cannot get over that so many men s underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches The idea of Medium as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards My body fat is low I am not profoundly muscular bound As is common in men of my age lower back problems are not unusual I have a 32 waist Is that not Medium sized I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether One size fits all doesn t work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems The draw string is fine It allows flexibility So what if your pants fall down It seems to be the fashion anyway Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary uncontrollable constrictions Also these boxers don t hold up well to any kind of washing They looked like crap after the first time I washed them I wish I could get a refund because I won t wear them again My life partner told me they looked like old men s underwear That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry I am not a mean hearted kind of guy So I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again 
Didn t fit well and I was allergic to the adhesive Like I said they didn t fit well and I was allergic to the adhesive 
Burned out on the first use Never charged a thing I bought it to use on international travel It stated that it could be used on 220 and it burnout out shortly after being plugged in 
Made in China and Taiwan I am ex US Army National Guard and Army Reserve I did not expect to receive dress web belts made in China and Taiwan from an Army Navy store I have other belts made in USA that are heavier materials belt and buckle The belts have lasted 10 to 12 years and the buckles are still good as new I ordered 3 belts with buckles thinking I would not need to buy a new belt for the rest of my life The web material is very thin for a belt The buckles 2 out of 3 are stamped made in Taiwan and the 3rd has a sticker says made in China They are cheaply made and are likely to break or snag clothing I will not recommend this product to anybody After shipping this junk cost me 47 00 
Poor Quality Poor quality belts do not fit correctly can not be returned because it is swimwear according to policy Don t trust Skinny Dip Swimwear 
These shoes are loud I did realize that these shoes squeaked but I didn t anticipate how loudly that squeak would be I doubt my girls could hear anything over the sound their shoes were making I know I couldn t 
Don t do it I bought this item and was very disappointed when I received it and tried it on The mock crocodile leather looks very cheap the leather of the shoe is very hard and I could not wear it for more than 4 hours since it was cutting on the sides of my feet After which I threw the shoe in the trash it was such a waste of money do not think of buying it 
Poor Fit Like all the Haynes T shirts except the 50 50 these bunch at the back of the neck Try another brand

Comes to high on the belly The shorts I bought came way over my belly button Made me look like a funky old man I returned them Otherwise the sizing was good 
Good Product Very Bad Vender The iPod Mini Case self is very good from Pacific Design But Amazon made a mistake to choose eBags as their supplier I have ordered one iPod and one iPod Mini cases for my friend s daughters as a Christmas gift The iPod case was shipped from Amazon directly as usual it was nice packed and fast shipping The other iPod Mini was shipped from eBags It was bad bad and bad I won t order anything from eBags any more Here is why It was almost one week later than Amazon s shipment It was an open unpacked or returned item Amazon charges the shipping for that item even you qualify for the free shipping on your order If you don t care about all of these please go ahead and good luck I gave 2 stars is because of the product self otherwise I would give none 
Don t buy this product It s awful the S size is too big for me My waistline is 34 and in the sizing chart it says size S fits 26 36 so i end up cut it and sew it back so it can fit on me Then after 3 days of wearing it the velcro is messed up it can not attached together anymore The costumer service is an answering machine I tried several times to call the costumer service and only get the machine answer my call I can not return the item because it says its illegal to return this kind of item So my advise dont buy this item or you ll be sorry 
An amusing hat but be informed Judging from the picture I thought this thing looked like a turban It actually has no wrapped fabric but is a firmly fitting cap Hidden in the back is an elastic band that will adjust for larger heads which is attached to the edges of an ugly looking triangular gap Aside from this the coloring is too bold Old Glory will select random coloration for each customer but my selection has over twice the color variety as the one in the picture I don t see how I can wear it without attracting stares 
Cut is defective sleeves run extra long This suit fits like a true Italian size I ordered a 54 which equals a US 44 approximately It fit my husband perfectly excaept while the entire suit is cut as a size Regular length and the sizing indicates they are not longs or otherwise the sleevs ran over 2 inches longer than a regular should even though the body length was normal for a regular I think these suits are defects rejects in which the sleevs were cut too long So I would not recommend it unless you need a long size in sleeves 
not comfortable for workout This is definitely not something I would want to wear while working out Even with mild exercise the lining feels sticky and the fabric does not appear to breathe I d rather wear cotton jersey pants than this For cooler weather I d prefer something like a good pair of tights Sugoi for example 
cheaply made Very dissapointed in this outfit looks really nice in pictures but is very cheaply made frayed the first time put on 
Love Victorinox but this bag had issues I love that little white cross on red and normally expect a quality product when I buy them I had this bag for about 2 months of daily use before the two serious failures appeared In two locations on the bag the nylon came unstitched One hole along one of the side panels and the other under the handle It would appear to me that the inside portion of the nylon wasn t properly sealed Melted together to prevent the material from becoming unwoven The handle came about half way separated from it before I stopped using it This is a really disappointing thing for me because in the age of globalization quality always loses to low price and there seems to be fewer and fewer opportunities to buy really quality products without fear that it is crap with a high pricetag I would advise Victorinox to pay attention to quality assurance before people abandon their products as overpriced junk products by a company who has sold out quality for price Some of us are ready and willing to pay a higher price for a quality product 
This Needs a Bra I loved the concept of this item but it didn t live up to my expectations The top was extremely loose in the bra portion and provided no support The pants however were comfortable and I really loved them The top needs to be reworked 
Built up Camisole This camisole did not fit my purpose The idea is great but it didn t fit me correctl 
Eck I ordered this dress and when I received it I thought that it was very pretty When I put the dress on it was completely see through You could see my bandaid on my thigh I would not suggest this dress for anyone based soley on the material It s a shame because they dress is very flattering and also comfortable It would also be impossible to wear anything under this dress including pasties because it seemed to show everything 
not what I thought I have white everlast boxing shoes they are very comfortable I thought these ones were the same the difference is that the other ones have soft parts in it where the feet move when boxing The black ones are uncomfortable in the back side where the division of the shoe is They don t move well plus they charged almost 20 for shipping so I ended up paying a lot for them 
functional a the quality is not that great b the socks are not skid proof BUT its good to have 8 pairs because somehow the curse of missing socks will hit babies socks too sometimes they pull them off while takig a walk at restaraunts friends homes and sometimes the dryer eats them 
Red Sox pink hoody sweatshirt A good product and a good fit Wish the logo had been a little bigger 
Crummy front closure When I move around I sure don t need a front closure that comes undone many times a day The hook on this bra needs to be changed to a snap closure Perfect bra in every other sense but a self unhooking bra No good 
Review on ACU Polar Fleece Cap The bought 3 polar fleece caps and they are all one size fits all but either I have a big head or something becuase it doesn t cover my ears all the way As for my husband that actually has a small head it fits him fine So I guess if you have a big head don t get it becuase it will not cover your ears 
order not wanted I don t want this order when I look into this it said it wasn t available so I looked into something else If there is anything else that you have that I was to order please cancel everything because I haven t ordered anything else from you and anything that was ordered in February I don t want now Thank you 
What size is it I don t own this gear bag and I m not going to buy it even though it looks interesting Would this be a suitable carry on bag or would I have to check it I don t know The dimensions are not given anywhere I want to know more about the products I order 
missing pieces cheap no lace collar as advertised cheap nylon like fabric not worth the price 
Illuminite does not work as advertised The non functioning illuminating speckles on Illuminite products quickly disappear despite following care instructions If you pay less for their clothing than regular clothing go for it If you re paying more you re wasting your money 
Product looks good smells bad I was happy at the appearance of the bag but was extremely disappointed in the smell of the backpack I received it around Christmas time and have had it hanging outside since hoping to air out the smell It still smells making it unable to use

The late gloves I am still waiting for these two pairs of gloves which were to have been USmailed and which were predicted to arrive yesterday March 28 
TOO SMALL do not buy this i got a large and feels like a smal 
Poor construction with cloth that is too thin This garment is poorly sewn with cloth which was too thin to provide some very necessary functions for men If you just want underwear look on however if your aim is to obtain a bedroom brief you can do better for less At is unless the view is everythin 
OK I guess I bought this dress in black Good news it does flatter your postpartum shape Bad news the pockets for the nursing pads don t go where they should causing leakage Worse the color black showed milk stains after I leaked Definitely not worth the price How important is your figure when you re sleeping anyway 
This is not a follow on from the Sawtooth A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky boulder type terrain The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank and the Tigertooth does not I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe By the way I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it 
This is not real I am tired of companies making money off of fakes The U S Government did not buy their field jackets from China These M65 O D Green Field Jackets are not real They are a mid grade reproductions 
small The shoes would have been awesome but the sizes run extremely small I even ordered a size larger than normal thinking maybe this would happen The shoes are still too small 
Kind of a letdown a little I totally didn t have a problem with the seller or anything great shipping Um but the book kinda rots If you know how to tie a tie already then it might be fine but I don t The pictures didn t really help and the wording wasn t concise One sentence could be interpreted like nine ways I practically destroyed one tie definitely practice with a tie you don t care about or one that doesnt need to be dry cleaned cuz they get pretty rumpled 
Buy a longer length than usual Good flattering fit I m 5 2 and I bought a short which was perfect and long enough to wear with heels even a bit long actually Unfortunately when I washed them they shrank 2 and now I have to wear them with flats I would buy them again just in a longer length 
Sizing way too small These are nice shoes however the sizing is way small I would recommend ordering at least a size or two larger than what you normally wear 
Didn t receive it on time I ordered this to go under my Halloween costume nine days in advance and it arrived too late for me to wear it It s still in the package in my closet Maybe next year 
Cheap Soles I bought these slippers for my husband at Christmas time I thought if I spent 50 on slippers they would last a long time and be made very well I was wrong The slippers look good and the upper leather is very nice but the sole is a cheap thin foam If you bend it it snaps You would expect to find this on a cheap 2 flip flop I was very disappointed I bought my husband a cheap 2 pair of suede slippers in Walmart that were just as nice with a thick rubber sole 
These are horrible Even for 13 I expected some quality and got very little The dye from the leather dyed my feet during a rain storm The footpad was so rough it irritated the botton of my foot The leather over the toe was so rough it irritated my toe These were REALLY poor 
Just a Warning I almost fell for it then I realized how in the world are those pearls so cheap They aren t real If you are a sucker for a good deal like me think about it before you buy it It would be helpful if the item was advertised as imitation pearl thong 
no do not waste you money on this piece of sh case not only it is loose it s bad quality i just got it two days ago and the arm band came apart and i have no idea what this white thing is that it comes with it is useless what a waste of money 
This is a wicked bad idea If your name were Johnny Damon maybe But you re bagging groceries at the Star Market for 7 25 hour Is this jersey really worth a day s pay to you The chicks aren t gonna be fooled into thinking you re on the team The Sox won t vote you a World Series share Your mom s gonna throw it in the dryer and shrink the beejesus out of it and you re gonna wish you had that money back when your buddy Tommy is selling his old Malibu 
Misleading description plus sizing not true I see from another comment that this shoe was listed as having a real leather upper which is why I bought it I see now that the description has been corrected but too late for me also the sizing does not run true as the current description states I usually wear 9 5 but I have bloody blisters from trying to play in these shoes 
Make sure it s leather I ve bought the Predator Absolion TRXFG before and it is a great shoe However in this case it is clearly advertised as having a leather upper and the pair I received yesterday blue with red and silver is synthetic Make sure that if you order a leather shoe at the advertised price you receive a leather shoe You are not saving 50 if it s synthetic 
Find a better boot You get what you pay for I guess but I really don t like these boots They look fine and the construction appearance seems sound however they are NOT comfortable I have had several pairs of Skechers sneakers and expected these boots to be comfortable at least nearly so Yet the right boot s footbed is clearly not manufactured correctly as I can barely go an 8 hour workday wearing them It feels as though there is a hump under my smaller toes My foot also seems to pronate markedly The left boot doesn t seem to suffer from the same defect They also have very hard cushioning I can t imagine them being worn in a work environment requiring boots Also I ve had the boots less than a month and the laces are starting to fray where they contact the eyelets I should probably return them as defective but the extra shipping fee makes that cost prohibitive 
NEVER RECEIVED Do not buy from this company I ORDERED AND PAID FOR THIS AND NEVER RECEIVED IT 
DON T BUY FROM THIS COMPANY POOR POOR Customer Service I ordered 2 wristlets a brown and a leopard print I was sent TWO brown wristlets the return process was difficult and when I returned the product I DID NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OR THE CORRECT PRODUCT 
Need be contortionist to wear I bought this bra based on a majority of good reviews and blessings from Oprah Winfrey I am a 38DD and could barley get the bra on I have always been big busted and struggled to find good support When I was younger I was trained in classical ballet I have no problem with range of motion I still had a hard time getting this bra on Not to mention I was falling out all over the place I am very disappointed with the quality of this bra for the money I would recommend Jogbra or Chamion for less money better fit and better hold if you are big busted 
Not impressed I m a 32DD and while this bra does virtually eliminate bounce I could get the same results with duct tape Unflattering shape uniboob with the accompanying interesting sweat problems and overpriced 
DO NOT BUY THESE I bought these for a bridal shower gift They say one size fits all but they where like an XXXSmall They torn right when they where tried on VERY POOR QUALITY DO NOT BUY THESE 
Disappointed I really wanted these boots and had been contemplating getting them for almost 6 months When they came I was so excited and took them out of the box to look at them and they were stained I was extremely disappointed that the product was defective because I have never had a problem with any Amazon products in the past I sent it back and I was reimbursed for my purchase I am really disappointed I will think twice before I purchase any shoes from Amazon again 
Don t Buy This If You Want Control The title says it all This product does not offer much in the way of control and it is definitely not firm Basically you are spending 35 for a high waist brief 
They did not ship the jacket in the picture The jacket itself its well made BUT they sent a jacket with different colors and it does not look as nice as the one in the picture 
Leave them on the shelf weird looking I was so excited to find these they seemed the perfect combination of elegance and comfort They look weird They went straight back and after paying shipping and return shipping I practically have to pay them to take it back 
Not made for Size D I just wanted to let all other bigger busted women know to NOT buy this product It is made for smaller busted women in mind There is no support and barely any coverage for bigger busted woman It was a trial on my part but I hope by writing this it will help other women avoid making the same mistake Stick with the strapless bras ladies 
don t waste your money We bought this for our teenage son The handling of the shipping was prompt that is the only good thing I can say about the coat I will definately agree with a previous posting that the wool seems to be of very poor quality almost felt like The item that looked not so great after taking it out of the box looked terrible after only a week or so of my son wearing it to school I am almost ashamed to send him out of the house in the coat If it was not so cold I would tell him to go back to the sweatshirt he was wearing The item pills making it look really shabby No reports of seams ripped buttons lost or holes in the pocket however he may be worried that if he tells me about those things I will be upset with him because the coat was just a waste of money It was a major clothing item that he had picked out for himself so imagine his disappointment I expected much more of the coat than I got and I am looking for a replacement 
Not sturdy This corset is not well made at all It s made of really cheap plastic boning and the boning sticked out after just a night of wear I wore it to the club one night and by the end of the night the boning sticked through the top 
Not what it advertises Looks nothing like the image shown 3 inches shy of even hitting the knee let alone over it and she isn t tall 5 5 Keep looking 
A mistake I will not repeat This was called learning the hard way not to believe the hype and not to buy shoes on line The fit was awful there is no cushioning to speak of in the soles and other than looking good off my feet these shoes are useless 
Major disappointment I ended up giving away these shoes after wearing them one day We have a recycle area in our apartment building but it is usually used for things that are not brand new These shoes hurt my feet and had no cushioning at all against the concrete I walk on I will not buy another pair of shoes on line again unless I know the make and size from hands on purchase before 
Not sexy Men here is a tip If you want to please your lady use a sexy thong instead We love how a man looks in a thong 
Worthless Bought these to keep the toes warm will riding my motocycle in the cold weather worthless no heat detected you really feel the bulky wire if you don t put them on exactly right heavy d cell draws down the sock on your leg don t bother put the extra 25 bucks into your boots 
Owwy These shoes are hideous Who would wear them They are so uncomfortable They always give me blisters I hate these shoes Do not buy them unless you like getting blisters 
Toss away bibs I prefer the bibsters The quality on the toss away bibs is not as good the material is quite thin the closure uses a sticker that never stays closed 
Size Matters I always buy the same size and type of overalls and this is the first time ordering this pair from Dickies They are very stiff and tight fitting They should have actually been baggy on me being the size that they were 
Sizing is terrible I got this for my newborn son and it s so big it fits my husband I wish it said something in the ad about this ridiculously big infant hat 
GOOD SNEAKERS GOOD LOOKING KICKS IF YOUR KICKIN IT OLD SCHOOL LIKE ME AND COMFORTABLE AND RELATIVELY CHEAP I LL ALWAYS KEEP A PAIR OF STAN SMITH S AROUND FOR WEEKENDS 
Pretty Good These sunglasses are all right They were a little crooked but still cool 
Can t go wrong at this price I don t see the difference between these bodysuits and the more expensive ones Fits my boy just right 
Green Very nice basic clothing I think the size is fine I really like being able to find these shades of green though I have decided the lighter shade is really a feminine color This is the only brand that I can find these muted greens 
perfect I love these socks They fit great my 15 month old daughter has thick ankles and she can zoom around on the kitchen floor and not take a nose dive into things 
lycra splice solid swimsuit Finally I have found a quality brand of swimsuit I can order on line and know it will fit I m a daily swimmer who is long bodied This particular style fit great when it arrived it arrived quickly within four days shipping was free and the lycra material is the most resilient I know given the chlorine bashing my suits get Please continue to sell this particular item at a price lower than the sports stores Thanks 
TYR Swimsuit Your company was a pleasure to work with thanks I will enjoy wearing the swimsuit that I ordered 
great player very portable great picture easy to operate all the accessories you need great sound playes dvd s from sony camcorder very happy with the system am looking forward to using this camping and on vacation 
these are my first Chinese Doc Martens I have been looking for a pair of Docs for a while I know they are a new globalized company and I am not necessarily against that I am disappointed that you can t get a better range of colors I ve had a few blue pairs and a lovely green But colors are not really available now except on high tops emblazoned with the brand name An abomination for sure These shoes are very comfortable and apparently well made My single quibble with the black pair I got here on amazon has to do with the flimsiness of the tongue I like a nice strong tongue And who doesn t Whatever they saved on material here may have been a mistake On the other hand maybe the sole will wear out first or it will be a dead heat Never thought I d buy shoes online but amazon and the Doctor made it happen 
I bought 2 of these for my vacation The quality is much better than expected I bought one for myself and one for my husband prior to our Las Vegas trip Sept 6 2005 We were able to walk with or hands free because these fannypacks held all of the necessities our cell phones travelers checks keys and medicines in particular We love the spacious divided compartments I highly reccommend this product 
Just as I expected Nice shirt Well made Good price What more can I say 
Bill Blass shirts The shirts are what I had asked for They are sturdy and well made I would buy more if I needed more Well worth the money spen 
These maintained my virtuous self I love wearing those tank tops with shelf bras or summer dresses that can t be worn with a bra but the nipple issue was quite vexing I didn t feel comfortable with any nip protrusion the only disadvantage in having implants is that they tend to be a bit nipply But problem solved These things rock 
great service and quality I was having a hard time finding a cheaper swim suit so I just ordered one from the grab bag I figured nothing could be worse than my plain black swim suit Also the swim suit was delivered in half the time that it was expected 
I ts very catchy It s golden color is very remarkable It looks like real gold wonderful piece to have 
Still great shoes With a good selection of colors to go with the casual style to say I love these shoes is an understatement They are very comfortable and have grown on me so much they are about the only casual style shoes I have bought in the past few years 
Leather key case A difficult item to find in department stores Found some at twice the price in a leather goods store The Fossil leather key cases were of equal quality I purchased two and am very satisfied

Mens Collar Stays for Dress Shirts Review The collar stays are great They came in a convenient little container and now I m not searching all over the laundry room floor for the collar stays that fell out of my husband s dress shirts The different lengths were helpful because he has different style shirts and the collar stays came very quickly 
Who sewed this Okay this cap is really stylish But I think the sewing isn t quite finished There were loose threads all over my caps when I got them Not to mention the parts that weren t even sewed no threads at all 
Great addition to your wardrobe I bought some of these to wear with a drapey shirt cut open nearly to the waist and these little covers made me feel way more confident that even if my shirt slipped a little nobody would be able to see anything The nude ones were practically the same color as my skin so they were perfect They also stopped any embarrasing reactions to the cold The best part was they didn t feel weird at all 
Great aviators These are some really good glasses Plenty dark full mirrored so you won t be caught checkin out all the ladies you walk by Shoot for 18 you can t go wrong I highly recommend them And since I m a pilot it was obvious that I got a pair of these 
Wonderful product I found these at Lane Bryant and I absolutely love them I wear them under my work clothes every day You ve got to try them 
CROCS are versatile tough long lasting About 18 24 months ago we purchased a pair of beach CROCS for our daughter child toddler size 12 13 like those pictured She has used them for the beach around the pool wearing them to school on non gym days going on non strenuous walks and so forth Plus we have used them as a floating throw toy at motel swimming pools Even though her shoe size is now 1 to 1 1 2 she still wears them And the shoes are in good shape Also daughter s mother has been wearing her own pair for similar uses for about two years So we highly recommend CROCS 
Amazing I got this handbag for my 14th birthday and I looove it so much It is so perfect the best chanel handbag there is Everyone that saw my new handbag loved it and asked where I bought I actually bought it at nordstrom Everyone should have one BUY IT 
My Favorite Sleep Tee EVER I can only ditto what the other 5 star reviewers have already said I have 1 of the 41 for summer and now 2 of the 50 for fall and winter The colors remain solid after mutiple washes and the price is great for the quality of these sleep shirts Also very comfortable Highly recommend ngmackie Dunwoody GA 
fantastic shoe for bunions must have shoe for bunion and hammertoe sufferers i also have very hot sweaty feet and these are an excellent choice if you share these problems very large toe box and excellent webbing for ventilation very good looking comfortable shoes only qualification is that if you stand on your feet all day or do a lot of walking you may want to pick a shoe with more support these are very lightweight shoes but lack the support a heavier athletic shoe would offer but those type of shoes are usually harder on bunions and my feet get extremely hot in them 
Makes a perfect gift My mother is an avid world traveler and is quite particular about how she travels So I bought her the cabin cuddler for her birthday and she loves it And I quote It is practical and functional and makes a huge difference re comfort for those long international flights Big hit 
This scarf is the best I bought this scarf with a gift certificate I received for Christmas I love it so much and my kids love it so much they are buying their own It is super warm and retains it shape even after my nine year old tried it on as a dress 
Good product wish there were more size variety I m taking off one point only because these pants don t have the short medium long choice as other BDU pants do I m buying for a friend who prefers long inseam and regular waistline For other BDU pants I could have got him medium long which has waistline of 31 34 and inseam up to 34 35 For this particular style I was told over the phone that they don t carry the short medium long varieties and my only chance of getting an inseam of 34 35 would be to go for the large size which also has a waistline of 35 39 I ended up getting the large one as suggested which is a bit too wide for my friend Other than that I m happy with the product quality and the service I received 
The product is very good but Dont buy it from Andrew Christian i wrote them online several times and never not once got an answer from them i ended up buying them some other place 
The best running shoe i ve own Clever and stylish design a lot of colors to choose from and an excellent performance best sport shoe eve 
Gigaride Megadeal Awesome shoes Not necessarily worth the outlandish cost but 4 stars nonetheless I d recommend them to anyone who takes running seriously and who likes to look even cooler when doing it 
Patriots Hoodie This is a top quality item I is an 80 20 cotton poly mix double stitched seams very well made I bought a 2X for my son who ususally wears a 3X and after putting it through the washer and dryer twice it s just as perfect as the day it was delivered 
Dexter Bowling Shoes These shoes are awesome I have bowled with them for the past couple of weeks and they are just what I was looking for The color is hot and everyone on my league noticed them and said very positive things about them Thanks for the super fast shipping and supurb quailty 
Great coat My husband loves this coat He wears it all winter If you are someone that doesnt like a bulky exceptionally warm lined coat this is it He is uncomfortable in something like down because it is too sweaty but this is perfect Warm enough and lightweight and comfortable THis is the second one he has purchased 
Not bad I have been using this for awhile now Unlike some sports bras that are this supportive it s a lighter weight material construction I wouldn t say that there probably isn t something better out there and it isn t cheap but it s not bad For my peers that have this issue you know what I m talking about 
The best sport bra for bigger cups EVER Before this bra I would have to wear an underwire bra and a sports bra on top to minimize bounce My cup size is F so it s been difficult to find a sports bra that I can wear standalone Well folks I found it THIS IS THE BRA I wore it while doing turbo jam today and it was AMAZING It did better than the two bra combination ever did If you re looking for a sports bra that actually WORKS this is the one 
teenagers flip flops I got the flip flops for my granddaughter for christmas she wore her cheap ones out from wal mart and her mother told her white is summer only and no one could find white ones right now I told her I bet her I could and so I did and she loves them and so did all her friends at school we know it is winter but so far in indiana it is not bad so you can wear flip flops and tanks for now thank you for the great gift 
Nice product in a festive giftbox This is just the thing to put away for a Christmas gift Nice product in a nice box tied with a bow 
Highly recommended for pregnant pumping nursing mums I just received two of these bra less nursing nightgowns sm a robe sm m and the two piece tank pj set sm I m almost nine months pregnant and have gained 50ish pounds and despite the other review about not fitting during pregnancy it and the other items fits and stretches well while holding its shape I will wear this now and indefinitely after the baby comes it s apparent that it will fit me well after baby too The quality of the fabric is substantial enough to hold large and engorging breasts without the need for a bra It is strong but breathable and not flimsy so it slightly smoothes out quirks of the pregnant body The length is a little longer than most it slightly covers my knees which is what I wanted so slit is nice to have for normal strides walking easing out of bed hiking up to use the washroom etc without tearing the seams As the description and the other review indicates the cups can slide down for pumping or nursing I m very happy with the colors design and construction of all items Due to the volume of my order directly from the site I received a high quality FREE minky dot chenille blanket that came rolled and ribboned in a nice tulle bag I would definitely get this for other expectant or new moms 
Well made doesn t fit well while pregnant I was looking for a good nursing nightgown to wear while in the hospital after giving birth to my second child I had seen the Aimee gown before and I really liked the looks of it and the reviews seemed great After purchasing the gown was shipped via Fed Ex to Canada which means I got dinged by Fedex s customs broker costs I tried it on while 8 months pregnant to see how it fits I purchased a size XL as I am around a sz 14 pre pregnancy I have a normal bust size of 36D The gown itself is made of a nice heavyweight cotton with lots of stretch and recovery doesn t just stretch out and stay there the crossover top is really nice becuase it crosses over and will be easy to pull aside for nursing but the v isn t too deep nobody needs to see that much of my clavicle There is a slit up the side for ease of walking but it s a very high slit too high I felt The gown didn t fit well over my pregnant belly but I don t fault them for that it s not advertised as fitting during pregnancy However after giving birth I still don t think it would fit well for the first couple of weeks until the baby belly subsides a bit The gown stretches well enough to fit over a slowly declining bump but unfortunately as you walk around the elastic contracts the gown back up over your bump pulling the slit on the side higher and higher up your leg The gown itself is long enough to more than cover your bump as it retracts but it s not a comfortable feeling when that slit creeps higher and higher The bustline will be great when I m nursing easy to pull over and great coverage on the other side It fits well under the bust elasticised under the cups but I found the cups were HUGE on my breasts It fit well at the band but I guess they figure if you re a big girl you must have big boobs Luckily I m handy at sewing so I plan to take the gown up at the shoulders to fix this Overall I think this will be a great gown to wear around the house while breastfeeding after the baby belly has subsided I do plan to bring it to the hospital with me but only after I ve taken in the seams at the shoudlers and closed the side slit a bit 
Good Deal The sheets were just as described and worth the price Timely on shippng also Very pleased 
Portable Crib Sheets The Crib sheets were soft the service fast and they fit the Pack and Play mattress 
miracle sheet This sheet is great solution for difficult to change crib sheets just lay it over the top of your pretty sheet and snap it to the crib frame I highly recommend it to those who don t like wrestling the crib sheet onto the mattress 
Great Service was very quick and they were having a free shipping special so it was very well priced 
Bra Extenders 3 Ordered these bra extenders since I an pregnant and now having trouble fitting into things and they are working great Recevied them very quickly and they are exactly as I expected Thanks 
I really love it I never buy stuff like this on line I like to play with feel wallets before getting them But I couldn t find a thin bi fold that I liked so I took a chance It s great The ID feature is super handy it comes all the way out if you re wondering And the brown leather is soft and nice It is really nice for the price By the way personally I don t think it s thick at all 
Great The shoes are better then expected Everyone comments on how nice they are and where did you get them I will let anyone know to buy the 
Cute good Value for the money I had never ordered from this company before I have now ordered quite a few things from them For the price everything has been very attractive Some of the sizes run a bit small This dress is very sweet the PAPRIKA color is an orange but I ordered 3 of these in different colors Nice to wear around the house during the summer I also ordered a nice dress in EGGPLANT but it is really brown alright with me a nice dress Customer Service was very good to me and I even received a coupon for 3 free magazine subscriptions as I had ordered over a certain amount from Newport News I am happy with the price vs quality of all of their things Shipping was very speedy For these prices you do not get the quality of Neiman s Sak s or Bloomie s but you get many more nice simple summer dresses of a decent quality I think that Newport News offers good value and service for the money 
Almost perfect I m very satisfied with this purchase The jeans are great quality for the price However it was not stated that they would be the very long length that they were I had to alter them which was an inconvenience 
Very Roomy Love these boxers I stole a pair from a friend a while back and had to have a pair of my own Love the fabric and the cut not too long not too short and just the right amount of butt room 
I Bought More and Will Probably Continue I purchased one of these shirts to see what the quality was compared to the price As soon as I received it and wore it twice I went back and purchased three more The weave on these shirts is thick making the shirt very comfortable to use and I suspect will give it a long life After multiple 10+ washings the first one I purchased still feels as good as the newer ones The colors are warm I would suspect that this shirt would cost 10 15 As long as the price stays below 10 I will continue to purchase these as all purpose daily wear work out tshirt As for the comment that these fit smaller than most I didn t have that experience In Nike Reebok Gap and Rusell Athletic tshirts I wear a large I wear a large in Artiga as well and the fit is comparable to those brands with no noticeable shrinkage after washing 
Wonderful Bag I highly reccommend this bag for anyone It is a big tote which is perfect for a college campus the airport the beach really for any purpose It is reversable and I was very suprised at how durable it is great quality When people compliment the bag it allows an opportunity to share its cause which in the end is the most important part 
Trendy Mat Very Usefull I have used this mat almost everytime I ve been outdoors I haven t seen anything like it at any department store and its much cheaper than the mats at the beachside boutiques It is an awesome value for the price 
THEIR CLAIM THEY CALL THEIR SOCKS THE WORLDS SOFTEST MEN S CLASSIC CREW SOCK AND LET ME TELL YOU ITS THE TRUTH BEEN LOOKING FOR A PAIR OF RED SOCKS FOR WEEKS WITH OUT SUCCESS THEY MAY NOT BE THE SHADE OF RED I WANTED BUT THEY ARE THE BEST IN FIT AND QUALITY NOW FIND ME THE RED SHADE I M LOOKING FOR AND I LL BE EVEN MORE PLEASED Norb Reynders yes over 13 going on 7 
Great Nice soft leatherette The inside is roomy and the pic is fairly accurate for the size to body ratio The tie front detail stays so you don t have to worry about it unraveling or loosening Nice silver buckle accents on strap Great 
Perfect Tote Bag I ordered 2 for gifts and 1 for myself based on other reviews I was not disappointed The bag is large and roomy made of heavy duty material with outside pocket and has a neat little clasp to hook your keys etc for easy finding It will make the perfect beach bag for us and could be used for almost anything 
Great girl socks These are great girl socks Besides being economical they feel good wash good are very stylish and don t fall down They look great with jeans and khakis I have ordered several more pairs in different colors A true value 
Very well made boots by Nine West The Nine West Botamy boots are comfortable and really well made The leather is very soft also Even though the toe is very pointed these boots are still comfortable Amazon has a great price on these boots 
There s a reason you wear fur Genuine leather with fur lining are about the warmest things you can possibly wear An excellent choice for extremely cold winter weather well worth the money spent 
ugg or bearpaw I purchased these boots for my daughter for christmas I was a little nervouse because she wanted the ugg boots With four children sometimes a compromise is in order so when I saw these at a more reasonable price I got them When she opened them she at first didn t even realize they weren t the ugg s She has been wearing them since and I m guessing started a new trend because others have been asking her where she got them and they also like the cost In comparison to the more expensive boots she says no difference 
very pleased I was very pleased with the socks They were just what we were looking for Thanks so much 
Great all around I purchased this bra on a special for 6 50 Well worth that price i am thinking of purchasing more at the current price very comfortable and great fit great everyday bra for larger chests I am a 38D 
so comfy i ve got really sensitive feet and i get blisters really easily sometimes within 5mins of wearing a new pair of shoes my quest for the comfortable ballet flat has ended here after months of searching the heel is nice and soft but there s still sufficient support here for me that is for those of you out there with back problems it might not be sufficient i got them in the gold which is a gorgeous pale lame and am currently lusting over the black 
Awesome for 20 bucks Great buy for 20 bucks They look nice and fit well They are distressed but it is not as bad as I thought it would be from reading the other reviews They look nice with jeans and a dark shirt Pretty comfy too 
hard to fine size As manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present one size fits all it becomes increasingly difficult for those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit in anything other than the most expensive brands These shoes are well made and an excellent value The only negative is that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacer to make them narrow The heel tends to wallow a little bit in my particular case 
Excellent Kids Athletic Shoe This is an outstanding shoe It has good support looks great and cleans easily The price is comparable to any good quality kids athletic shoe An excellent choice for an active athlete who hasn t yet grown into adult sizes 
quality i was very satisfied with my purchase of these items reasonable price and am very happy with items 
love long pants it means so much to me to be able to buy a pair of jeans that fit me in length ya who Am 
Slippers I liked the timeliness that the merchandise arrived They fit my husband s feet well and he likes them The only down side is that when he tried to tighten them the leather lace broke and so now we have to try to find something like it to fix the lace 
moccasin slipper The slippers are great They do seem to be on the large side of a 15 My husband had to put paper in the toes He wears 15 in every thing else 
Super I was so impressed with the quality and correct sizing for this suit My little guy looked so grown up and handsome in his new suit Thanks so much 
Good shoes Not best for running but look very cool comfortable enough to wear for styl 
Comfortable One of the most comfortable bras I ve ever worn I own several and they re just about all I ll wear Very nice fit and good look under clothes 
So unusual I get compliments every time I wear this I took a chance because I tend to be a bit plump As other reviewers noted the sleeves do run snug But otherwise it s a great jacket at a great price The grommets are just so fun It is fully lined I just love this modern addition and it s not too young feeling just right 
good jacket I got this jacket last week I liked it for the price i paid 
Good Style Single Style good shoes I think is a nice choice to every day work 
Comfiest socks out there They look nice and feel AMAZING I bought my husband 2 and as soon as they arrived he asked me to buy him a few more They re great and the cushion doesn t flatten out in the wash 
Silk Pajamas My friend was very happy with them They are very good quality and they fit him for the most part The only issue we had was the length of the arms They were a little too long Other than that we were pleased They got here in time for Christmas and they were just what he wanted 
Good quality silk Of all men s silk PJs that I purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best The fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well After reading other customers reviews I purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size M and occasionally L It turned out too small I would recommend going one size up 
Most comfortable shoes I own I LOVE these shoes I have been searching for the right ballet audrey hepburn style flats for years I also love the price 
Great Backpack It s a very durable bag I run trails a lot and I was looking for something to carry my running items during the winter season durable as well as comfortable and cheap so I don t have to worry about ripping it The straps are padded and feel really secure on my shoulders The part that lays across your back is nicely padded and has already saved me on some nasty spills And if you need it for books the padding will keep the books from poking your back I would imagine it would be a bit hot on your back in the summer though I expect I will tear it to shreds eventually but for the price it s worth it 
These jeans are HOT The fit is great Sexy slim look and feel Slight stretch to add to comfort and hugging feel of the denim Got lots of compliments 
great convenience the price for the slippers was average no big discount but they arrived at my front door in time for Christmas That was a big plus And my daughter loved them 
Cute Bodysuits Very cute tops for a nice price They wash up good They do run a little big just so you are aware 
Adorable little bag The beading on the bag is fantastic and its very cute The color is even more exquisite in person It s just big enough to hold ID a little money and a lipstick perfect for going out at night 
nice shirt for husband my hubby liked this shirt it was a great christmas present 
Lunch cooler bags They are perfect for kids daily lunches Would like to order more but don t where to start Lost all the ordering information 
very happy with this bag i purchased this bag recently for an overseas trip along with the 20 nxt roller and i m very happy with it the styling and fit is excellent and it holds more than i expected it s comfortable to hold in your hand or to sling over your shoulder i purchased the black version with victorinox s lifetime guarantee you can t go wrong amazon com is very competitive on price on this bag and though there were a few stores that were cheaper i felt it was worth it to go with amazon if only because i trust them 
Great Value My son loved these jeans The jeans were very comfortable The best thing about them was that because my son is so thin the elastic adjustments were perfect 
Reggie Bush youth Jersey Good quality workmanship very authentic looking and sizes are easy to fit I would buy another one robert 
Perfect For My Practice Soft durable breathable fabric Perfectly flexible for vigorous practice I m glad I bought these 
WOMENS FRUIT COLOR BOOTS THE BOOT IS GREAT BUT IT DOES RUN A WEE BIT LARGE IF BETWEEN SIZES GO DOWN NOT UP IF YOU WANT A CLOSER TO REAL FIT THEY ARE FUN AND DO THE JOB WELL 
Nice It s really hard to buy scrub pants on line because everyone is different Cherokee always fits perfectly and good quality I think they should consider a wider array of sizes in petite By the time I finished hemming them I didn t have that cute slit at the bottoms They wash well and wear well 
It is real nice The item is much better than any others that I have got through out the years It should last a long time Not rip easy It feels very sturdy I think it is real good 
It will Keep you dry This jacket and pants are not the high end breathable rain gear you want on a week long backpacking trip This is the rain gear you keep in your pickup truck for when you least expect It will keep you perfectly dry You will sweat a little on a warm day but it is well worth the money for a cheap dependable and totally waterproof suit enjoy the rain and mud 
Bless my Soles I own lots of shoes but I don t wear them truth be told I detest having things on my feet I somehow think that if my feet are being smothered than somehow in some way my spirit my soul is also being somthered But if I am in a suituation where I have to have something on my feet I reach for my Birks Now if you have never owned a pair you are to still call them Birkenstocks because only the people who own them are allowed to call them Birks Birks are a sacred thing and we can t just allow anyone to call them Birks now can we If we did there would be total anarchy I own three pairs of this particular model They are all the same color and I get teased a lot because who on earth would buy three pairs of sandals that look exactly the same Well I would I have my grubby pair that I wear when I m at the beach and I don t care if they get wet or torn up by rocks if I happen to go look in the tidepools and such I have my casual pair that I wear to barbecues and church yeah I wear sandals to church what about it Jesus did and then I have my nice pair that I wear to work and events where I don t want my wife to be completely embarrassed by the fact that I m wearing sandals she still is but in my mind I m justifying the fact because I m wearing the nice ones In fact my wife usually calls the returaunt that we might be dining at to see if it s appropriate to wear sandals and if it isn t I really don t want to eat there Dang elitists I m thinking of getting another pair Will I throw out the oldest pair No You don t throw out the Mona Lisa cuz it s old do you It is sooo obvious that you have never owned a pair of Birkenstocks Are they pricey Yeah sure a lot more pricey than those Fakenstocks you re wearing but they ll last a lifetime and maybe even longer So get a pair today get two pairs heck get three pairs and no I am not being paid for my endorsement of this product in any way I firmly believe that when your feet are happy you re happy So bless your soles with a gift from the gods You ll be glad you did 
Very cute These are very cute and they fit great I wear them all the time 
good price value nicely made ordering was easy arrived in 4 days gloves fit well and good quality good buy recommend to purchas 
I wear underwear like this sometimes When I play basketball or in the past when I did Jiu Jitsu then too Anyway they keep me warm and tight like a brace in the way that so my muscels don t pull or cramp Anyway I guess they look o k too but who would see them anyway THEY RE UNDERWEAR take care and good luck 
Absolutely the Perfect Pump Careful with the Natural Leather I LOVE this shoe It s a perfect heel height classic pointed toe comfortable design with coverage enough to enclose even a wider foot Perfectly proportioned with all day comfort If I win Lotto I plan to order every color with spares in case it s ever discontinued The natural leather is lovely but scuffs easily I strongly recommend buffing with neutral polish or saddle soap oil to give it a bit of durability HIGHLY recommended even for wider feet 
just what i looking for This is not a basket short or soccer short NO it s a very very nice beach short or just to sunnys day specialy in my country With hot beaches all year and beatyfull shopping mall near you can use this shorts for both activities That s why i bought it and don t mess the shoppin 
Heaven for your feet Once while traveling I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn t rub my heel I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs very cushiony soft like walking on air Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don t get sweaty either I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home It s wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step They ve replaced my slippers mocassins surf shoes and sandals 
The Best Brand I have to say those crocs are the best they are super confi and light I recommend them 
Comfy for Days These shoes keep my feet cozy all the way through a twelve hour shift walking on concrete floors 
Super Comfortable I purchased a pair of these shoes several months ago in a goldish platinum color They were so comfortable that I purchased two more pair in different colors The straps are VERY comfortable they re elastic and not tight or constraining The shoe leather is very soft and not hard on your toes I can wear these shoes for both the AM and PM services to church where I usually have to wear a different pair for the PM service because my feet hurt so bad It s hard to find a comfortable pair of heels so when you can find them stock up on them 
Very cute purse This purse has a lot of positives going for it 1 Great design the embroidery is very intricate and detailed and looks gorgeous 2 The color is very glamorous 3 It is a deal at this price although I bought it when it was 5 higher 4 It is unique and I love it because I am unique In short I love it 
Thin skinned but sweet like a pinot grape I have arms like a gorilla so I was pleasantly surprised at the length of these sleeves They fit even my appendages nicely I followed the advice of the other reviewers and I m glad I did for the large is a perfect fit on me and I m pretty slender The material is fairly thin but not see through Overall I say this shirt is a good value 
Excellent fit I never seem to have luck shopping for bras so just took a chance on these off of another review that I had read They were a great deal and a wonderful fit I would highly recommend 
Be cautious This is a beautiful shoe by Rockport but beware it runs really narrow I even went a size up from my usual to compensate I ended up sending them back anyway So if your foot is on the narrow side you may enjoy this sandal 
Makes An Amazing Impression This isn t a review of this product so much as it s a review of the impression it makes Anyone who was in Paris around the turn of the century will remember Aubade s Lecons de Seduction advertising campaign of which the image shown here for this tanga was a part Each item of lingerie featured in the ads featured a little piece of advice to the wearer as to how she could use this item to make the right sort of impression and isn t that just what frilly little underthings like this are for Nothing has made a stronger impression on us 
Love These Shoes I followed the advice of the reviewers before me and ordered them a half size bigger than I normally would and they fit great Super cute with jeans or a sexy dress Great job Jessica 
Cute little shoes These shoes make my feet look so tiny but they are so cute I wore them with jeans and will wear them with a pencil skirt next week Turns out Jessica makes pretty good shoes CUTE 
Beautiful shoe but runs small Highly recommend shoe BUT you might need a larger size than usual I wear Easy Spirit 7 1 2 W but found this shoe too snug in both width and length and had to return 
Love em These are the first mootsies tootsies I have owned and I love em Since then I have bought another pair of loafers and a pair of their boots These shoes are very comfortable 
Men s reg 100 cott buttondn hyde pk shirt The presentation of the product is claer and attractive and the product is durable comfortable and goodlooking 
GREAT SHIRT THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT THAT I HAVE BEEN PUCHASING FOR 15 PLUS YEARS CAN I ORDER MONOGRAMED SHIRTS FROM THIS SITE 
Really nice looking shoes I gave this shoes to my girlfriend and she just love them she says they are really confortable and i find them really pretty A really good buy it is 
Perfect fit Ordering online and not being able to try on clothing can be risky but it paid off with this purchase I just wish it wasn t hand wash only 
Out Of This World I originally started wearing Hanky Panky thong panties b c my husband purchased some for me awhile back Recently I stepped out of the box and ordered the low rise thong panty and again I m thrilled I wear low rise jeans shorts etc and these low rise thong panties take the worry out of showing off my back side when I bend over or pick something up I never feel as though I need to reach back to check to see if I m giving a show or not They re just as comfortable as the others the just ride lower on your hips They re very sexy too I suggest ordering from Bare Necessities b c they offer free shipping with any 40 purchase That s three pairs of thongs you can t beat that And once you try these you ll be hooked like me and be ordering them in every color Go for it 
Great protection for my Treo I use this all of the time It gives good protection ease of use and good handling Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock However this is true of any protective skin Outstanding product 
The most comfortable bra ever made As a new 36DD can t wear underwire this is the most supportive and comfortable bra on the market For the past 5 years since my surgery I ve been searching for the perfect bra I have finally found it 
great value for money recipient was very satisfied with this blanket as PB are his initials 
Old Classic A friend suggested these shoes for waltzing around the neighborhood I will never forget that day The first thing you must know about these shoes is that they are horribly uncomfortable at first With stiff plastic boards attached to your feet you wander around wondering why you d ever wasted your money Soon however they start to mold to your feet They take on every bone every curve every nitch The next thing you know it s like wearing a glove Perfect shoes that seemed to be made just for you As they age they eventually start to smell and you replace them and repeat the whole process I love these shoes However they do not love me After years of wearing them the lack of arch support finally did me in I developed foot problems that rendered walking impossible for a few days The pain lasted months With time and care my feet are better But I can t go back to these amazing shoes My suggestion is to wear them sparingly 
Super Sandals These are wonderful sandals Tried to find flat slingback sandals in the stores but to no avail Finally did the right thing and went online Great Sandals at a very reasonable price You won t be sorry if you purchase these Very stylish and very comfortable 
warm and fuzzy these are the most warm and comfortable slippers i would recommend these to everyone 
Surprisingly gorgeous can t believe how true to size they are They re quite easy to move in and they re simple and beautiful Not at all cheap looking for the price I expected less and got more 
Great shoe I love this shoe It looks very elegant on the foot and there s a little bit toe cleavage which is always a plus But make sure to go half a size up It s a little snug in the front and it takes a couple wears to break it in 
Fantastic Shoes I love Puma shoes especially the Future Cat Low Puma is by far the best quality sneaker I ve ever had The price of their shoes is a bit more than the average but you get what you pay for They are great looking and are extremely comfortable I am so pleased with these shoes that I plan on only purchasing sneakers from Puma from now on I ve bought four different Future Cats dark shadow persimmon orange black white Chinese red white black vapour blue and black coffee white burnt olive 
Amazing Like the photo implies and like most 2 x ist men s products this underwear is sexy comfortable flattering and made of quality materials Believe me this trunk truly has a pouch A big one Its actually just the right size for me and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it filling it The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas so its really nice Of course the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this no show I had no problem with this being no show wearing my lowest rising jeans with it Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants For me this trunk was not uncomfortable given its diminished size and intent to be no show Granted in those moments of excitement things do get a little more eh crowded But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief boxerbrief trunk This pair is made of 100 cotton so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X Factor line may enjoy this feature My only complaint is that the leg openings do not cling to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon etc But that is just minor The waistband is as always a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height in keeping with the no show design May I suggest you go for the extra bold 2 x ist No Show Trunk 3133C which comes in contrasting colors same product same price just sexier I cannot reccommend this trunk enough and within hours it became my favorite 2 x ist product in my collection 
GREAT SANDALS Purchased these for my husband He absolutely loves these sandals He initially thought the little nubbies would feel strange However he got over that thought fast when he slipped them on and went tromping around the yard He uses them for a quick slip on shoe to run outdoors Wears them every day Thanks for a nice slip on Also these are sturdy though very light weight 
Exactly what I was looking for These are exactly what I was looking for I ve been wearing this type of ear muff for 20 years Everytime I break or lose a pair I spend months looking for its replacement After I received my first pair I ordered enough to last me another 20 years I hate the around your neck ear muffs so popular these days They are uncomfortable and they cost more 
World s Best Flip Flops I m in love with these sandals Although they are very lightweight they are vastly more substantial supportive and comfortable than most flip flops I may have to buy another pair If you re a half size go down not up 
I Love m I bought these because I normally can t wear a shoe without my orthodic insert These are great Very comfortable I plan on living in them this summer I bought a size 8 croc which was fine These were on the big size so I exchanged them for the next smaller size I guess I am a 7 and 1 2 so if you are inbetween sizes go smaller with the Athens Croc 
Love Them I love these Crocs They are much more comfortable than the original style and I like the two tone color combo I wear them even in the winter 
nice fit This is a great fit for a silk shirt I thought it would not be a close fit being silk but I was wrong This item fits snug and looks great on Both alone and layered I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank 
54 was great The jersey of our 54 got here for my wife in time for Super Bowl and she was very happy With the jersey NOT Grossman 
Love the Shoes My 11 year old wanted these shoes All her friends at school thought they were so cooland want a pair Plus they slip on and off so quick and are great for PE and the palyground I would buy these shoes again without a doubt Keds makes a wonderful product and I think she ll out grow them before they even think about wearing out Great value for the money 
Super Comfy These shoes are so comfy I love the no shoe string thing too Easy and comfortable What more could you ask for 
Love this HUGE bag I just received this bag today and I am absolutely in love with it This bag looks alot more expensive then it is and the inside is HUGE With a zip pocket and additional large pocket and smaller one that is perfect for my mp3 player My husband got it 100 right with this little surprise So if you enjoy a large bag that looks great on your arm this one is it expecially for the price 
M Osowski Evaluation Both our son and his wife and myself are very pleased with the undershirts It was very difficult to find the shirts that openned on the side so I appreciate them being offered on your site and will remember the brand in the future 
wears well The Lilyette Maximum Support bra is well made and wears well It holds up to frequent washings and retains its support features It is comfortable 
Perfect I have just recieved my pair of boxer briefs for my son I took A kid s review s idea and got one size smaller for my son I asked him how they felt and he said that they felt really good I asked him if they give him enough support and he said yes and he even told me I don t know why but he told me that he can get his hand down the boxer briefs and take it out without the boxer briefs streching and loosing their tightness 
Travel packs I travel a lot especially during the summer months and these packs are the best thing since Ziplock bags They are a must in all sizes for the traveler Helps things and people get stay organized an absolute must 
cute and cozy I love naughty monkey I m so happy with their shoes They don t hurt my feet 
A great comfortable pump This is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you re looking for a slightly wider toe box It looks great with a skirt or slacks My only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable and kindest to my feet I can t find my size 6 5 W in navy I have the shoe in black If anyone from Naturalizer is reading this message how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available 
Great Slippers for Post Stroke Victim I bought these slippers for my mother who is 5 years post stroke She has difficulty keeping shoes and slippers on because she has no feeling in her left foot since her stroke Also she is always cold even when it is 80+ degrees outside These slippers have been wonderful They fit her well they stay on and they keep her feet warm When she wears these out will definitly by another pair 
Great Set for Little Price Don t know where else to find a garter panty set arrived fast too for this price They say economy so wasn t expecting much but we re still enjoying this set to spice up special evenings We bought the One Size for a size 8 and it is perfect and adjusts

Good stuff Good quality jeans at an affordable price Size is just right quite comfortable 
Sale on Lee Jeans I bought these for my son for Christmas they were first quality arrived in time for christmas and at a great price 
Great stuff They are exactly what I was hoping they would be I love the contoured front pouch All the web sites I saw and read about them said you may want to order 1 size larger then normal I would agree with this unless you want a more snug fit My wife loves them as well and was quite pleased with the look and feel I ordered 4 different pairs of Unico s and they re all good quality and look and feel great 
Dearfoam Slippers The slippers were perfect exactly what I wanted The price was good and they were delivered sooner then I expected I m very pleased with my purchase and it was so easy to do Thank You very much 
Love these slippers Great slippers very comfortable I love the fact that the front is open in case I just got a pedicure And the black ones are perfect because they don t show dirt like the white ones 
Comfortable easy on off Super comfortable Provides great support coverage Love the front zipper No fighting to get over your head 
love them These boots are so warm and soft I usually wear a 7 5 and I ordered them in size 7 even though they recommend sizing up for half sizes and they fit perfectly An awesome and cheaper alternative to Uggs 
Satin Sleep Pant Very comfortable looks great makes it easy to move around in bed 
Cute product and quick shipment I LOVE my new Steve Maddens They are brand new as described and I received them verrrry quickly 
A Nice Shirt This is a nice shirt not as warm as we had hoped though The lining is quite thin It washes fairly well loses a bit of its shape but not a lot A great shirt for the fall Its roomy comfortable 
Silk Boxers They were a nice quality nicely priced and were shipped promptly I would buy this brand again 
Awesome My mother loves these pants I know they are for men but she loves the way they fit her They are stain resisnt and that makes them that much better 
Wouldn t travel without this I love this product and the rest of the Pack It system beyond all reason I ve given them as gifts repeatedly In effect they give you drawers in your suitcase and sub drawers within the drawers of hotel dressers It s easy to take out a pair of slacks without disarranging everything else The 18 folder works well for womens shirts blouses and slacks I can easily fit say three pairs of slacks and two shirts into it If you want to carry more or fewer pieces it s forgiving I use it for suit jackets too folding them in across the width of the folder I ve used mine often over perhaps 8 years and they still look like new A standard sized 21 roll aboard suitcase will neatly hold 1 18 inch folder this product two full sized Pack It cubes a small pack it sac holding travel adapters and rechargers a toiletries bag not from this sytem and a pair of shoes squeezed It also works to omit the cubes and use two 18 folders depending on the clothes being packed 
Great Bra I bought this bra because I was tired of seeing nursing bra lines under my shirts This is great I bought the L++ and it fits perfectly I am a 38DDD normally and durring my pregnancy a 40DDD was fitting too If you buy this bra you will love it just buy the correct size 
Very CATS This is just the perfect accessory for the CATS costume one of my dancers is using for our dance recital Got this in gray and brown too Took a while for the product to get here In fact I had to re order because of the delay but when finally the product arrived it was worth the wait 
Best toiletry bag no spilling of toiletries in your suitcase Love this Kept Couture Toiletry Kit I actually own two of them and give them as gifts during the holidays to my friends The bag has a vinyl liner which is extremely helpful when your shampoo bottle leaks during travel It keeps the leaky goods all inside won t ruin the other stuff in your suitcase And it s a perfect size It can hold about 10 days worth of toiletries 
I am definitely a Clarks fan I bought three pairs of Clarks from Amazon when I saw the 20 coupon and as usual scored with free shipping Clarks quality is tops and the prices were great too I got these in earth color They look really good with jeans Comfy with or without socks The soles are gonna last a while These have some nice cush to them and provide good support to my high arched tired feet 
hind compression shorts i don t have a lot of experience with compression shorts but i am very pleased with this product the fabric does not lose compression over time although i ve only had them a short time the fit is good the fabric is comfortable i ve gotten into the habit of sleeping in them and they work great for keeping you toasty i wish products like this were around during the years i played college soccer 
Great flip case for your ipod I like the flip case It is exactly what i wanted However the clip has fallen off a few times when i hit it 
ISOTONER SATIN SLIPPERS FIT IS PERFECT VERY COMFORTABLE 4 STARS WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN MARY S 
ISOTONER SLIPPERS ARE EXCELLENT These black satin Isotoner slippers are extremely comfortable and fit extremely well They are flexible enough to mold to the shape of your feet but strong enough to cushion your feet as well They are well worth the purchase 
High quality and very comfy I was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on Amazon for less than 30 retail price even on sale was 60 The jacket arrived in about a week Its nice and warm very good quality The upper torso shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear It fits great and looks good Only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little But all in all I m very pleased 
Fantastic shorts Fit well Great for all kinds of athletic workouts I m ready to buy a couple more pairs 
Great Value For the money these are a great value Unlike a comment above I have not found these short at all but average in length 
beauty and comfort love these little gems perfect at 1 size below normal size you won t want to take them off 
Teenage daughter loves them I bought these slippers as a Christams gift for my 16 year old daughter she was very happy to get them as I guess they are the in thing for teenagers in her school She loves them and actually wears them to school they are so comfy Price is high but they are well made and will last much longer than the typical slipper these are more like shoes than slippers The sheep skin wool lining is very sturdy luxerious 
Uggs I really like these I do recommend getting a size smaller I normally wear and 8 5 and ordered a 7 and they fit perfectly super comfortable 
great socks Yeh these are really great socks but what s up with James If new socks changed my life hey I need to get a little something goin on Back to the socks my favorite in black low cut workin out or hangin out 
Great Jacket I love this jacket It is lightweight but still warm enough to wear in all but the coldest weather It is also long enough to cover my rear Very good in the rain too 
Super Duper My boyfriend loves tommy socks but they are impossible to find in New Mexico and I have looked everywhere for them I gave them to him for christmas and he thought they were the greates 
Home knitting without having to knit This is a lovely fat scarf that looks like it was hand knitted from scraps just like I used to do before I got bored with knitting It s squishy and warm and the perfect combination of colors for me I just cut off the tag and people think I made it myself Don t tell Not high fashion but very warm and comfortable 
Soft and Comfy I bought this for my boyfriend It is soft and comfy It is definitely comfy for me to snuggle with And as a bonus he likes it too My only complaint is that the sleeves are little too long But overall we are very happy with the purchase 
Cute Cute Cute I love this skirt I wear it with my Live a Little denim jacket so cute I find it to be really figure flattering I ordered a size 6 and it fit perfect Nice to find a denim skirt that s a little different than the other zillions out there 
Nice Jock I like Bike swimmer jocks I think they look better and are more comfortable then the standard old jocks with waist bands that are too big and can roll and pinch you This is all you need to keep you in place They don t cover any more than they need to They re all you need when you jog I don t think anyone actually wears them swimming anymore The swimmer jock style in general is like that regardless of the manufacturer However I m giving it a 4 because I prefer jocks in non cotton fabrics like nylon polyester and Coolmax They are much softer and can whick better Plus there are now ones that look more modern and have funkier colors such as ones by Calvin Klein and Baskit Why not add to your fun when you jog 
Best one so far I ordered this bra as well as the Olga Women s Perfect Fit Full Figure black 38DDD This bra provides much better lift support and separation than the Olga I think it is because the cups are seamed I d recommend it to any woman who is petite in stature I m 5 2 and also has a large bra size I m a 36DDD 
Finally jeans that FIT I love these jeans I have 3 pair and they are the only jeans I wear Just enough stretch to be comfy but not too tight I wear a size 14 and these jeans fit me great 
For my grandson If you are a grandma on a budget it can be difficult to find useful items for grandsons I thought that this was a good buy at 7 99 for my 11 year old grandson for either his birthday or Christmas I would have given five stars but there was not a complete list of teams offered 
They are just okay These thong sandals run true to size and are very lightweight They are also a shiny patent material These are the pluses The one minus that is just a thing with me is that they come up far on my foot That is the toe piece seems a bit long I kept them because I know I will throw them on all summer to run around with my kiddos around the house I also do not think that they are really worth the price Yes they are Tommy Hilfiger but the name is all you are really paying for They are an okay shoe overall not my favorites 
sg i have purchased other hats from well known companies these hats are great for the money and are constructed well good job 
Comfortable and Sexy Stretches to fit you exactly The smooth fabric holds everything in place Contrast waistband and package support make this underwear look very sexy Highly recommended 
GREAT sweatpants These sweatpants are extremely comfortable reasonably priced and come in a variety of colors Definetly a great buy 
High quality product Good purchase I found this product to be of very high quality and the transaction of the product was great I recommend this for anyone looking for great bag especially as a gift 
i did not receive the shoes i regret to say that i did not receive the shoes 
my slippers I am very happy with my velour slippers They are a perfect fit and very comfortable I received my order promptly and plan to order again in the future 
long sleeve button shirt The shirt came fast It s a good quality shirt I m satisfied with it 
WOW This is great I measured before I put it on after I lost over 2 inches I highly recommend this 
Worth the wait Just be patient I like many many others ordered the 4811 and 4911 when I read the article I ordered directly through herroom com on 6 24 I knew it was going to be a long wait and they also sent me 3 e mails during the summer to let me know that they hadn t forgotten my order but the delays were significant due to the heavy demand They always gave me the option of cancelling my order since they don t charge my card until they ship out the order I almost did but my order finally came 9 10 and I must say that they really are the most comfortable thongs I ve ever worn I ve already placed another large order as Christmas gifts for my friends 
Fan tastic I really like this case it fits so perfectly that the Zen doesn t rattle around or anything yet all the plugs and buttons are still accessible Easy to get on and off too and looks great 
Warm feet These keep your feet warm and toastie Will want more when these wear out 
Olga does it again This is a lovely lovely bra It supports lifts and minimizes creating a flattering shape underneath clothing The wide straps are gentle on the shoulders leaving no ugly marks after long periods of wear The back doesn t ride up and the three hooks serve as a strong anchor The plunging lace neckline is invisible even under a tight t shirt and dare I say it looks pretty sexy Yes you can be well supported and attractive bless ye St Olga 
Nice bag It is perfect for my three year old to carry his toys instead of me carrying them 
Great quality and fairly inexpensive I bought it for my boyfriend for the gym He would carry all his extra gym clothes wallet keys and phone all bundled up in his arms and shove everything in the locker dropping everything along the way He really likes it and especially the extra front pocket allows him to seperate small stuff Not very many other products have that extra pocket Very sturdy material and the size is just right 
Love it This is a Great Gown for the price It s comfy soft and there is even a small bit of support for the big busted girls out there Moreover it s sexy Hope yall enjoy 
Serious hanger for serious clothes Very happy with this product They are substantial so they are quot suitable quot for a Medium or Large and not someone who is Small Delivery was fast and it was well packed Shipping was included though I didn t realize it until the end of the ordering process 
Best underwear a woman can own After i tired Jockey No Line Promise Hip Brief i will never purchased anything els 
fantastic boots These boots fit like a glove and are so sleek looking They are comfortable and a great buy A nice pair of black boots is essential to any wardrobe 
Great Bras The service was expedient and the bras fit perfectly Just what I expected and wanted 
Very Stylish for Athletic Branded Shoes I ordered these shoes the minute I saw them featured on a fashion segment on the Los Angeles morning news I have a new found love for flats and the more comfortable the better I recieved them in the mail the other day and can t wait until it warms up a little so I can wear them I m in cold Chicago They have a rounded off pointy toe which make them very flattering you could even dress them up They are more cushy and comfortable than I ever remember Keds being I ordered my true size 7 5 and these feel almost perfect maybe just a little roomy but I m not going to bother exchanging them because I m afraid a 7 may end up being too small I haven t owned a pair of Keds since high school in the early 90s nor have I tried any on since then because I was in denial of Keds being cool again so I couldn t remember what size I used to wear but I m very very happy with these shoes overall 
Best shoes I ve ever owned This is the fifth pair of Club Cs I ve owned the second in black I believe they re the best combination of durability and comfort on the market I ll undoubtedly buy another pair when these wear out 
Comfy all year long These are comfortable slippers that with composite soles can take you out on the deck to the front steps or even your driveway to pick up the morning newspaper Your feet will stay warm but not uncomfortably so They re even nice to wear when temps are a little higher because the clog design fits loosely at the heal so you can let your feet breath a little fresh air Nice value for the price 
Urbantrack shoes Love them They feel as comfortable as tennis shoes and give the right support when doing a lot of walking but at the same time they look more hip and dressier then tennis shoes 
The best pinpoint shirt out there Having sampled 100 cotton pinpoint shirts both on line and from the stores themselves my husband keeps returning to his favorite the Land s End pinpoint Without a doubt the quality is unsurpassed and its longevity is legendary Now when its time for new shirts we don t think twice and go directly to Land s End and order They also have the widest color selection and each color is true to its picture and flattering to all 
Ahhhhh All Aerosoles have that extra aaaahhh when you wear them and these are no different I ve worn them with skirts slacks and jeans my daughter teen liked them so much that she bought herself a pair I liked my black pair so much that I bought them in brown also 
NYPD Tee Purchased this for my son He loves wearing it he s a big fan of ny and the pd Fits well washes well 
fast service excellent product for the price a lot cheaper than the bridal shop fast shipping thank 
sharp looking tank top I bought this tank in red the color of the fabric is wonderfully vibrant The quality of the fabric is so nice that I wore the top to dinner with a printed skirt received several compliments on the outfit Caution This style runs about 1 size small Athletica offers excellent personalized customer service and every one of the 10 tank tops I ordered were of a quality for which some brands cost as much as 38 
wear it with Red Sox pride It s a little on the thin side for snowy or freezing weather but great in keeping the chill off when you re out and about or at the game The blue is actually more of a royal blue than navy blue but the lettering is well stitched and is the same quality used on MLB baseball caps also has the MLB logo on back It folds up easily and can be tucked into a jacket pocket with room to spare The price is great and makes a great gift 
The way shoes should be Stylish and comfy What more could you ask for My husband was very pleased 
My Husband Loves These Shoes My DH has worn Clark oxfords for some time and says they are the best fitting and most comfortable shoes he has ever owned This new pair of Clarks the Citadel Oxford is his new favorite because it is light weight casual and so comfortable 
THE most comfortable shoes that look great too WOW what can t I say about these shoes I ve bought two pair in different colors absolutely LOVE them for their comfort and snazzy fun appearance They re great at work and at play and even during outings that require alot of walking Highly recommend 
Love these shoes GREAT price I have another pair of these shoes I bought elsewhere at twice this price Very comfortable True to size 
Great Sandals beach walking etc Reef makes the best sandals the price is pretty much set no real savings here but the selection is great They may look like other sandals but don t be fooled They re TOP NOTCH 
Great shoes Buy them These Crocs are very unique They have a comfortable footbed that cradles your foot They are shaped like a Birkenstock but with closed cell foam instead of cork as the footbed The closed cell foam is very lightweight but dense so you can walk around in comfort I wear them just about everyday to work I chose the closed toe model without the holes in the top because I work in a laboratory where having your feet exposed is not a good idea The ones with open holes in the top offer more ventilation And because Crocs float in water they make great shoes for boating or kayaking They drain well and dry out quickly plus if you do manage to slip one off it will bob along on the surface until you fetch it I know that a lot of doctors and nurses wear these because they allow you to stand comfortably for hours at a time They are also great because they can very easily be washed off completely in just a couple of minutes I wear them when I am gardening too and then just wash all the mud off the shoes with the hose outside In short the Crocs are comfortable and versatile shoes Treat your feet and buy them today 
More stylish than the basic tee Raglan and cap sleeve makes it more edgy than wearing a plain old t shirt Good quality for the price I usually wear a medium but ordered the XL and it s a good fit fitted but not too tight 
not what I was looking for Size was true I just did not like the 
Very comfy These boots look good with jeans Can be loose but comfortable with thick socks 
What a bargain I love Birkenstocks and when I saw the Eaton Clog at such a low price well say no more Once you know your size you can buy Birkenstocks from anywhere I just never expected to find them on amazon com They re a little dressier style than my usual Bostons and I just love them 
Awesome Shoes I love my Birkenstock shoes They fill great I am a registered nurse I am on my feet constantly all day These shoes are great for the support my feet need They are really comfortable I will definately be purchasing more in the near future 
Does the job This was inexpensive attractive excellent windbreaker Only minor problem is a tiny bit too much fabric around the zippers so care must be taken to zip and unzip 
Amazing boots I have received countless compliments on these rain boots I love them and I guarantee you will too They are comfortable stylish and keep your feet dry in snow and rain What a great purchase 
great item This item is great study and well worth the money light weight = the only negative review would be with the company that I purchased from they did not participate in the sale the site was running Other than that they filled the order fast and was pleased with the service and the quality of this briefcase 
Soft Briefcase I am very pleased with the soft briefcase I purchased It is so much easier to handle than a hard one I would purchase another item from the same manufactuer if I need something else 
Never Received Product Unfortunately I never received the product I purchased The company claimed that they sent via USPS and I never received it So as far as the company is concerned I am out of the money I spent plus the product I have received no satisfaction 
Very soft and comfortable These jeans are extremely soft and comfortable Like most children s place merchandise the quality is nice and cut a little larger then other brands My only negative thought is that the material should be a little thicker My boys are tough on their clothes 
Great Sneaker wide and EASY to put on We loved this pair of sneakers for my 22 mo old so much that we bought it in the next size up so that we he could keep using them They are so easy to get on him and we all know some are SO difficult These slide right on while pulling the tongue They are also wide enough for his flinstone feet lol They break in well for flexibility too 
lucky me Skechers just seem to fit my feet well Lucky me These were inexpensive solidly constructed comfortable and at least in my eyes stylish What more could I ask for in a casual shoe 
Excellent I am very happy with this product its comfortable and good looking Worth buy 
Very nice T shirt quality Stretchy comfortable and made well love this T shirt Also its a slim fit and not really really long like many are right now more of upper hip length which is great if you want to tuck it in 
I love these shoes I had the worst feet I ran my first marathon in May and I was in a panic On my long runs in March and the first part of April I was going to quit My feet hurt so bad I was training on a lot of downhill runs and therefore landed on the balls of my feet Ouch I think I would have been better off to run in nothing than to wear what I had which was a top of the line shoe I was desparate I found these Asics GT 2110 Men s Shoe I m a woman and I felt 100 better I had support plus the cushion I needed for my sore feet what an awesome shoe I finished my marathon in them I couldn t have done it without them 
People who wear this hat are smart and sexy There aren t many articles of clothing that allow people to support their favorite team as well as appear smart and sexy at the same time Red Sox hats however are just such an item Go Sox 
High Sierra A T Gear Access 36 in Drop Bottom Wheeled Duffle AT202 This product is great Their are a ton of different ways to use this bag From rolling it to carrying it like a backpack I would advise anyone looking for luggage to look at this piece and no other It is great 
a great fitting panty these panties fit great wash after wash great quality and very smooth under dress or pant 
SD Chargers Gazebo The gazebo is very sturdy and works great in the sun and rain Adding the team cover is a great way to show your team pride during tailgate parties It takes a bit of practice to set up the unit but I believe that all gazebos have the same problem 
never had a pair of birks love these comfy sandals bought these several months ago at Ross Dress for Less in Oregon for 19 99 I love them I bought them in a off white since that was the only choice Love the comfort of them think the t strap stays on my foot much better than the older birk style which is too wide sloppy on my foot the t strap is cushioned so it doesn t hurt my wee toes I wear a size 8 8 1 2 depending on the brand these say 39 5 don t know if that is correct sizing or not I would highly recommend betula for very comfy quality made casual sandals perfect for the beach or casual summer wear I am a self professed shoe addict these are great for those days you want only comfort 
Hard to take off These are by far my favourite yoga pants Very flattering for practically every sort of figure but more than that they re SUPER comfy So stretchy that they feel like a second skin And the foldover waist is very flattering with just a hint of support if you re self conscious about your belly Plus you can unfold it during your practice if you feel your T shirt riding up And sheer enough so you can slip a skirt over them after yoga class and you re good to go back on the street The biggest problem with these pants is that it s hard to want to wear anything else I own some 4 pairs of these and LOVE them 
My butt looks great Most flattering yoga pants I ve ever worn I have an akward figure long waist big butt a little pot belly but these pants look and feel great Plus I ve heard the company pays a living wage to thier workers I want 10 pairs 
Clark s Wallabee Boot This is one of the most comfortable shoes I ever owned Excellent quality and fit 
wallabees are great these shoes wear well and match nicely with jeans giving you a nice fresh look they also are easy on the feet i like the suede versions best personally but when winter hits its best to have the leather 
Comfortable and very sturdy These shorts look like normal hiking or outdoor shorts but underneath they have a snug lycra lining and padding where you need it The construction is very sturdy and the pockets are a great bonus I loved the first pair so much that I bought a second pair 
Truely Surprised I was very happy with my last order It was easy to order and didn t take long to get the product My grandson was a very happy little boy on christmas morning Thank you so much for the great services I will use amazon again and tell my friends about i 
Youth Tiki Barber jersey My 6 yr old is football nuts right now and he loves his jerseys Great product and very well made Can also be very versatile worn by itself in the summer and with a shirt underneath in the winter 
Nice Jersey My son loves the jersey a little pricey but a nice jerse 
chicago bears shirt I bought this shirt as a gift for my husband he LOVES it It s comfortable fits well and looks new after multiple washings Along with my husband being happy I am VERY pleased with the service of Amazon com I ordered one item from shop com it took 20 more days then what they told me it would arrive and when I got the watch it wasn t the watch that I ordered they don t even sell the watch they were advertising To top it off their customer service was not good when I called amazon s customer service they were very helpful and nice Therefore you can understand how much I appreciated that the MULTIPLE items I ordered from Amazon were delivered in a shorter time then estimated the products were all GREAT and the service was great 
My MOST comfortable cute going out make me taller shoe These look great with jeans though I m not a fan with skirts I bought the black and now wish I could find the bronze in my size I normally wear a 9 and depending on the brand I sometimes need a wide but these I found the 8 5WW fits perfectly go figure Naturalizer runs very very narrow I love love these shoes I can dance all night without pain = They are very cushioned the top straps do not cut at all and the heel height is super comfortable more like a 2 heel I so wish i could find these in other colors in WW 
Comfortable This is the first time I ve ordered shoes without trying them on but these shoes were exactly what I was looking for and couldn t find in the department stores in my size I know the name Naturalizer so knew they would be good quality They fit perfect and the price was right Thank you Amazon 
DOPP traditional leather kit This was a long over due replacement for the Dopp kit that was given to me when I left for Vietnam Its changed very little and is still of fine quality I expect it will provide all the use I ll ever need 
exchange i am writing to u because i returned this item for exchange on size and print what is the status of my exchange thank u and hope to keep shopping your products they are great 
Gift This was a Christmas gift for my friend s husband He really liked it and said it was excellent quality 
gREATEST EAR WARMERS EVER I was asked by my daughter to get these for Christmas I got some for myself for my morning walks in 30C temps They do not muss up my hair for the rest of the day even when I have just gotten it done and keep my ears toasty warm Great product and worth the money My daughter is equally impressed 
FYI These are Adjustable These work great but its important to know that these are adjustable It doesn t say so on the box so when I first got them I thought they were way too small for adult heads and I was quite annoyed however you can adjust them once you put them on just pull very slightly and they will adjust to make them fit perfectly 
cool but small they were slightly small and a tad too stiff but very cut 
Finally a pair that fit My husband is an in between size in waist and these new jeans allow that little extra umph that he needs to be able to be comfortable in his clothing We love them I gave him two pair for Christmas and he had me to order two more pair recently seems he has decided to throw out the old ones and replace with these They look great too 
happy john after all these years buying this wrangler product this by far has been the cheaper price that i ve ran across i love it 
hanks review I was very satisfied with my purchase and am in the process of ordering more hats 
Great slacks The fabric in these slacks allow you to sit for hours and then stand knowing your slacks look neat and freshly pressed They wash beautifully and require little or no ironing My husband wishes all of his slacks wore this well The hidden elastic makes the slacks just as comfortable when you are sitting down or bending down as they are when you are standing Frankly I wish I could find slacks for women that were this well made especially at the price Hagaar offers Haagar has done a terrific job again 
Comfortable practical I have owned a pair of these a year or more and have probably laundered them 30 40 times They are very comfortable for me though comfort is highly variable for each person The material is light weight but appears of good quality and I do not detect any deterioriation At first I was concerned about the elastic which appeared narrow and weak but it still feels as strong as when new and holds fine I will purchase more of these to have in a mix of styles About the same time as I purchased these boxers I purchased a couple pair of Faconnable boxers at about twice the price with similarly light weight material One pair of these ripped recently My experience is the CK material is holding up better than the Facconable that costs twice as much I doubt these will elicit much commentary from significant or potentially significant others 
Great shoes I have a wide relatively short foot with a high arch and have lots of problems finding high quality dress shoes that fit Bostonians are the only quality shoes that fit me so I have been loyal for the last decade I can t find them in my area so Amazon is the only channel I use to get them 
Oooo Do I Really Like These Stripy Stripes You can kind of see through them kind of not The skirt is like a nifty mini the G string is not uncomfortable This outfit looks good on my girlfriends looks good on me and it ll look good on you too 
FINE SHOES When I bought these shoes I didn t know they would look so pretty I am glad I bought these shoes 
T Shirts Purchased for our 6 ft 7 son and he is very pleased with them They fit very comfortable and are long enough so that they do not come out of his belt line 
5 star Russell T Shirts Russell I really wouldn t buy any other kind Too bad they don t make concert T shirts Great material long lasting The best 
beauty AND comfort These are very pretty without too much fluff The leather bottoms are padded which helps your feet especially if your home is on concrete slab I love them 
Not your Fathers Jockstrap or yours from High School This is the standard style from the new line of Performance jocks from Bike This waistband is slightly smaller than the traditional 3 inch but very comfortable The pouch fits nice and snug giving you perfect support and the leg straps don t twist or bind Easy to launder and pretty inexpensive I got rid of my old worn out jocks and bought a few of these new ones They re masculine modern and comfortable but not something that would be embarassing putting on or taking off at the gym like an orange or blue jock A good buy Comes in a black version that is also great I ve worn for working out and just around town good for both 
AWESOME and comfortable i m 19 years old and saw these at bloomingdales the other day and decided to buy them i took them home tried them on and i was absolutely amazed They are a bit of a low rise but that only adds to the flattery and i like my underwear that way There are a bunch of different sizes you can button the sling to and once you find the perfect fit you can hardly even feel that it s there I give it a perfect score and i am definatley going to buy more of these 
Andrew Christian rocks Good quality for the great price Bought for my 10 year old son and should fit perfect Item was on backorder but still received in less than a week 
Men s BLACK Dress Vest NeckTie Set for Suit or Tuxedo XXXL This item was as I expected as far as the description it is the quality I expected and I am pleased with it However I bought it one size too large to be safe and it was so small it barely fit It fit the way I feared the 2 X would fit that s why I bought the 3 X Don t know if it was mis sized or what 
Clark s Sunbeat Sandals are tops I bought another of Clark s sandals a few years ago which is why I ordered them again These sandals were even more comfortable than the last pair There was no break in period with these shoes I just put them on and spent the day in them without pressure points or blisters I will buy more in other colors I m sure You can t go wrong with Clark s 
shoe review nice shoes cut a bit high in the back so I got blisters at first love the fabric and color prompt shipping and nice bo 
Bears Game Day Sweatshirt This is a quality sweatshirt that I am enjoying wearing during the cold winter weather I have had trouble in the past with other brands with the arms being too short or the body length being too short but that is not the case with this product The only problem with the product is that it could stand to have more elastic at the bottom but this is a minor problem The service was excellent and I will return for more BEARS gear 
price price price the price for the bundle is the best part of the whole thing doesnt carry these products they sell an adapter and then a usb cord which is what apple does for their ipods and is a rip off for money i like not having to worry with an annoying adapter when i want to charge my Zen just plug in and walk away not fiddle with the adapter to make sure it is inserted properly the case is abit annoying it catches lint like you wouldnt believe but i m not getting scratches and I HAVE A KICK STAND i use that kick stand the most its actually the main reason i bought this set the bundle actually also arrived a few days before the Zen actually did so it was sent FAST i love this get it 
10 stars I love these shoes in fact I ordered another pair in black They are very comfortable and look cute Hey can t beat that 
Top grain Leather Portfolio I was looking for an inexpensive but functional leather briefcase and this was exactly what I was looking for I have more than three electronic devices that I need easy access to and the case has three outside pockets big enough to hold my devices The only thing missing is an outside place to put a pen or pencil I don t know how durable it will be but I m hoping very For the price this is a good buy 
Comfy and sleek pajamas What a great pair of pajamas these are So soft non binding roomy and great for lounging I ve already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays Very good quality silk well sewn and tailored I m normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine 
Great Purchase Best value and very comfortable I purchased a pair and have been using it everyday from the past six months The shoes are very comfortable and look very professional Love them Strong and tough Not to heavy Has good grip on snow 
best ever These are without question the best panties for wearing with slacks No line at the leg no line accross the middle of your behind and no riding up They are also cut low enough to not show in a moderately low rise pant Sizing runs true to any other Maidenform pantie you ve ever bought Can be had cheaper at a Maidenform outlet store but still well worth the price on Amazon Buy lots of them 
Great Umbrella for Wind Rain Got this for my father He loves it Great coverage Easy to use 
Wind proof umbrella Was shipped very promptly Not the largest man s umbrella but well designed Looks like someone really studied how umbrellas can wreck themselves by blowing inside out So that this one won t 
Great pants Great pants I bought these in a variety of colors and I am very satisfied 
American Apparel Infant baby rib hat My baby is large for her age and wears 6 9 month sized clothes even though she is only 3 months old I ordered two of these hats sized 6 12 months They are way too big for my baby but will probably fit her when she is actually 6 months Hats are made of t shirt fabric and look just like the picture You do have to tie your own knot on the top Andrew Christian sent each hat in a separate envelope and they arrived on different days but within the shipping time specified 
Leather front ID wallet with money clip The leather was good quality The wallet was well constructed I gave it as a gift and it turned out better than I it looked on the internet Grade A product 
Good times Whoever said the 80 s are making a comeback wasn t lying I love American Apparel clothing especially this deep V neck shirt Just know that it really is deep I m only in my twenties but I almost feel like an older man when I wear this shirt cut lower than other V necks your chest hair is bound to hang out If your cool with that then go buy the shirt cause it can t get any more comfortable than it already is Honestly I probably won t wear it anywhere other than the gym and home but I still love it 
Please read the description before ordering It clearly says it is a MESH dress I wore this for my wedding outside in bright sunlight and it certainly did not show everything but do not expect it to be completely opaque as it is a MESH dress with delicate lining As for the quality it wore well and the frayed edges are intentional and part of the design Very fairy like and pretty and I was pleased to wear it 
American Apparel Fine Jersey Tee XL Red These t shirts fit on the small side for women not Juniors but are soft comfortable and well made I have bought 4 
Great suitcase for the cost This is a great hard side suitcase for the price It is basic and simple but seems quite durable and functional I use it for taking my folding bicycle with me when travelling and it is big enough that the bike fits in but small enough that the airlines don t charge a premium for checking it It rolls very well on the built in wheels and unlike it s smaller cousin the Oyster this rolls with much more stability due to the wide stance The only reasons I didn t give it 5 stars are 1 Sometimes the wide rolling stance is a hassle e g going through narrow gates on a subway or similar and 2 the built in locks are not TSA locks so in other words they are useless for air flight I would buy this suitcase again 
awesome colors great value have always wanted a samsonite brand but in brighter colors i finally purchased the single upright suitcase s and fell in love i bought the pink and red my kids and i will be vacationing over seas and i wanted a better quality more spacious luggage this is perfect the delivery turn around time was impeccable we ll be leaving in a few days to visit southeast asia and we got our suitcases this early moning continue the excellent customer service 
Bearpaw boots Boots are warm Cozy However the color was much lighter than pictured not the end of the world Also the shipping took longer than expected 
Great I purchased these boots for my daughter I bought two pairs for her younger sister and she fell in love with the look She tried them on at a local sporting store and just loved how they hugged and felt on her feet I would buy all colors of the rainbow if she asked 
Nursing Pajamas I used these Pajamas in the hospital after I delivered my baby and for the first 3 months of breast feeding You can wear them without a nursing bra since there is a way to to keep the nursing pads in They are also very comfortable I wore them some days all day because they really don t look like pajamas I got them in blac 
Reliable product Reliable brand of work pants in a good selection of colors is all we re asking for 
very good merchandise This is very comfy and pretty and a great price Try it you will be sold I am glad I did 
Sansa skin This product is really GREAT for this Sansa e260 I purchased Strongly recommend it this Mp3 player It helps grip bottons work better and looks cool 
great for cold winter days I bought this sweatshirt last year and it is one of the most comfortable articles of clothing I own I am a little ashamed to admit that I don t use it when exercising its so comfortable I use it to lounge around the house 
A Steal of a Dres I purchased this dress to be the maid of honor in my best friends wedding It arrived quickly looked great and was an awesome price It would be hard to beat this great deal 
They ve changed I bought these to replace an identical pair that I ve been wearing for ten years I got the old ones in London and they were made in England This new pair was made in China They have changed some for the good and some for the bad There is now more toe room which I like However both heel pads were ill fitted and loose I had to trim them and stick them back in with super glue I m starting to really break them in now and I think I ll love them for years to come They provide good ankle support and keep my feet warm Buyer beware that these boots come very very stiff and will take time to break in When I first get them I just wear them around the house occasionally until I can actually wear them out for a bit If you try to wear them too long when you first get them they will most definitely wear blisters on your feet Break them in slowly and you ll have a wonderfully comfortable pair of boots to last a long time 
Garment Bag Good quality Beautiful color However had a side zipper which my husband didn t like as much as a top zipper 
Just fine These are basically plain black yoga pants but they fit fine are good quality and have washed fine without shrinking It s hard to rhapsodise about them but they are more than adequate 
Nice quality runs small I own this halter top in black white The colors are vibrant the fabric quality is very good This style runs small so order 1 size up for a comfy fit This company s customer service rocks 
Comfortable The shoe is very comfortable along the insole with lots of cushioning you can walk for hours without your feet feeling the stress However there seems to be some inflexibility across the top of the shoe that can make pushing off when climbing inclines a slightly uncomfortable process I haven t owned the shoes very long so this may be a result of having to break them in I do appreciate the covered toe which I feel is a very big bonus for this shoe it s not obtrusive and doesn t ruin the look of the shoe at all but definitely helps during the aforementioned pushing off during inclines in that the front of the shoe stays relatively undamaged The ankle support is good and hits right at the ankle bone so flexibility isn t impeded I live in a wet climate and have never had any issues with leaking so the waterproof claim is reliable Overall for the price I m very happy with the shoe and consider it a solid purchase 
LOVE THEM my fav shoes I can wear them to dress up or to dress down the review about how to adjust the slasp was very helpful to 
Dr Scholl s ORIGINAL I ve been buying these sandals for 30 years I just love them 
Comfort with height finally Awesome shoe Very comfortable on my feet Even though it s high healed sneacker you really don t fee too much of height and none of it s negetive side affects I can actually run in this Only thing is that it looks little too casual and your feet can get really HOT wearing it I would recommend wearing thin sox I originaly brought Dark Brown in size 7 normally wear 6 or 6 1 2 size shoe but had to return it to get 6 way too big It s wider than I m used to even though I have wide feet offers plenty of toe room If they offer 6 1 2 size it would have been perfect wearing my thick sox in winter Unfortunetely there are no half sizes offered I wanted to buy Black in 6 also but 7 is too big and smaller sizes tend to go fast and there are no more option for me now 
Case Logic Compact Camera Case Great little case we have two I like the inside pocket for extra memory battery 
Great little case this case is really nice and compact there is a nice place for a card or x tra batteries inside is snuggly fits the HP digital camera protects well and well padded very nice case 
I love this adorable polo This polo is absolutely fabulous I love the length it comes down to my hips I bought it in the size I usually wear and it fits great I wore it under a little khaki jacket with jeans and it looked fantastic I can t wait to buy it in every color 
love Mango Tango again I love this Laptop Tote It s big enough ready to take to the pool 
Slippers I could not find these slippers in our local stores I had two pair that were worn out and wanted exactly the same item I ordered them they arrived and I love them It was a very easy customer friendly process 
Hard to find in stores nice shirt very hard to find in stores so it s worth the wait and the cash 
Great Quality Great Price They are a great quality comfortable boot And the price was far less than local stores The shipping at regular rate took over a week though 
Great Boots I purchased two pairs of these boots for my teenage daughter who lives in this type of Ugg like boots We looked in stores and other online shoe sites for Uggs and other alternatives but being the end of the season couldn t find her size We saw these on Amazon in her size and thought we d try them out They were definitely worth it They are just as warm and comfortable as Uggs and since the price was so good we were able to buy two pairs They are nicely made comfortable and attractive She s wears them almost everyday so they are proving to be pretty durable She is really choosy about her footwear and she absolutely loves these boots 
Great Summer Wear I am enjoying the sneakers this Summer Comfy perfect for elliptical trainer stationery bike and weight room Very stylish I love Skechers footwear 
FINALLY IF OTHER UNDERWARE BINDS YOU YOU HAVE FINALLY FOUND ONE THAT DOESN T THE POUCH IS VERY LARGE LOTS OF ROOM I BOUGHT AN ADDITIONAL DOZEN AND THREW ALL MY OTHER BRANDS AWAY 
Love love love this jacket Bought one loved it bought another one for my d i l she loved it bought one for my daughter she loved it you re probably getting the picture now I bought the next size up for each of us and it s wonderful with a shirt or light sweater underneath Oh and did I mention the incredible price 
Time Money Well Spent This workout is short but you will feel worked out when done Tina cues well and the workout flows very smoothly No awkward transitions The ball is used for both total body toning and 4 limb cardio Your core and abs get a great workout too with both traditional and functional moves I enjoyed the change of using the ball instead of dumbells Definitely shocked the muscles 
A Keeper As an advanced exerciser I am always looking for a new innovative challenge The Firm Body Sculpting Ball workout provides just that This workout comes with a sculpting ball which is available in three weights four six or eight pounds I used the eight pound variety and by the time we got to the ab work I was ready to put the ball away My arms really got a workout as did my core There are several moves that require you to hold the ball out in front of you over your head and move it diagonally across your body I could really feel it in my core after the workout Once we completed several segments of standing work including grapevine squats and lunges we go to the floor for bridge work and abs You have to hold the ball between your thighs during the bridge work which I found challenging since by that time I was sweating and the ball kept slipping away from me You also hold the ball between your thighs to do ab crunches which is difficult with such a heavy ball Afterwards is a short cool down which I thought could have been longer Tina leads and she is very fit and quite personable She cues well and gives a few form pointers along the way As with all the new Firm releases the background is sterile and boring There are four background exercisers with Allison showing beginner moves Allie is holding the eight pound ball showing more advanced moves The music is nice and non intrusive Beginners will enjoy this workout It isn t complicated and with a four pound ball you could get a really intense workout Unless you re advanced and have some good upper body strength I would not recommend the eight pound ball You could injure yourself if you go to heavy In fact I was wishing I had another lighter ball for the floor work I have all eight new workouts and I ve done three so far Of those I liked this one the best I felt I got a good workout but I wish it were longer The entire workout from start to finish is about 32 minutes long Another 15 minutes would have been great although I suspect my arms would have been totally fried if we d kept going much longer Overall I give this workout high marks It s definitely a keeper 
Comfortable stretchy well made This is a VERY sexy pair of underwear Guys if you re new to the thong g string scene this is a good place to start I recommend g strings because there s less coverage on the back which makes them more comfortable than thongs The reason I didn t give it 5 stars is because it s pretty expensive but go ahead and splurge on one fancy pair of underwear Your girlfriend will love it Mine did 
Tiedown This item was just what I was looking for I did not want a tie tack to ruin my husband s ties or a tie bar It is simple to use and does the job of keeping his tie from moving 
Gorgeous Way beyond my expectations Exceptionally fine cotton changes colors in the light great fit absolutely beautiful great delivery Thanks so much 
good company The product was delivered in a timely manner and is a good quality product 
Good product Great product works well and was shipped promptly also there was an accurate product description Thank 
Fair Price Birkenstocks I am thrilled to finally purchase Birkenstock at a price that is fair Our local retail stores mark them up so ridiculously Thank you Amazon 
awesome They are awesome only tricky part is making sure you get the right size my husband and I love them 
Awesome I am a product junkie and I never would have believed I could fit all my stuff in this bag but I did This bag is amazing and takes up so much less space than the assorted bags I had been using I am getting one of these for each of my sisters 
Best baby socks on the market As the weather has cooled for fall and winter I needed socks for my baby I initially bought little cotton socks found in baby stores and department stores and they just didn t hold up as well I have also tried socks with grips on the bottom but they were so thick my son just sweated in them The Children s Place socks are not too thick and very durable Also the non slip feature on the bottom of the socks have been tried out on hardwood floors and were the only thing that kept my baby from slipping all over the floor when he walked The other socks did not I strongly recommend these socks for your child 
Well worth it Before seeing it with my own eyes I was a little skeptical of the huge buttons After wearing it I felt they were hardly noticable I bought the brown version for 17 99 and I thought it was well worth it This jacket is surprisingly wind resistant ideal for cold weathers The pockets on either side are so huge that you can practically store a couple of cell phones in there 
A really pretty boot I love this boot It s high and the platform will make those unaccustomed a little teeter y but it s a great look The leather and detail on my pair is exceptional Green leather inside I really like these And I own 55 pairs of shoes boots know from whence I speak 
flipflops it was easy to order and very affordable and they were here quickly I want to get more thank 
wonderbra it s comfortable and stays in place all day it s wonderful not to keep adjusting straps all day I am so glad I bought it and it I got it delivered fast 
Best Case for iPpd I love this case I purchased many cases before but this offers the best protection at a very low price Thanks CoverCas 
good price light weight jacket I got this jacket when it was 50 I was very impressed at the quality and i like how it s waterproof so i can just walk in the rain with it Great jacket and i think i will be wearing it for a long time 
Lands End Oxford is the best The Lands End 60 40 Oxford is THE dress shirt to own It is the end of the line in your search for an excellent product I buy nothing but this shirt and have multiple shirts in each color made I ve worn a shirt and tie nearly every day since I was 16 years old in prep school 35 years now and the Lands End is the best I highly recommend this shirt 
Works As Advertised I ve owned this coin pouch for several months now and it has held up exceptionally well to repeated use proving to be an excellent and extremely durable holder for loose coins and eliminating the need to dig in one s pocket for spare change 
pleased in the pocket this is a nifty small appropiate change purse for men or anyone actuall 
Low Profile Marine Corps Label Baseball Cap Review Great cap quality is top notch Price is also great 
wee i got and love it however someone else s product was shipped inside the box it looked like the box came open and someone just grabbed whatever they thought came in the box the product was not mine and the owners name and phone and address on it I contacted them and sent it to them myself it was suppliments for a very serioulsy ill small boy I hope all that get things for others send it to them too you never know whose life depends on it

fancy beach tote Better than just a beach tote sturdy bag for any occasion good price 
A happy customer I m very happy with this tote bag It s huge and sturdy I ve been using it to bring books and files to and from school for marking Quite a number of my colleagues like it too 
Cute Cute Cute I really love the way these shoes look I am really picky about shoes I buy I dont like to have my toe cracks showing when I wear shoes and I was afraid that these might do that They actually do show a little toe crack but only at the end where my little toe is I wore these shoes all night on new year s eve and had no problem I also wore them all day at work and then to the mall afterwards and did have a little discomfort but not as bad as you would expect with shoes this high I love these shoes so much a have 2 pair black and red 
An elegantly sexy shoe I love the shoes they re quite comfortable even though the heel is a little higher than what I like They re a beautiful color something you don t always see and quite eye catching And they just so happened to go very well with a suit I purchased months ago As a Nine West Fantatic thank you Amazon for having them available 
Carlos Prospect Sling I was shocked to see how high the heel was and being in my 40s I wasn t sure if I wanted to find out how they felt But I had a company dinner party and wore them and was surprised at how walkable and comfortable they were I have worn them several times since then 
the BEST so far have spent years looking for a bra that feels good does what it s supposed to and didn t make you wish you could get home slip out of something so uncomfortable at last i think i m at the end of my search very comfortable great support and can go hours before i start thinking about jammies only thing that would make this bra better would be padded straps 
A Real Turn On That s What These Panties Are I brought a couple pair of these to our little lingerie party because I knew the girls would like them I ve been wearing them for over a year and I like them a lot My husband does too They look good turn him on turn me on too You can t ask for more than that in a panty now can you 
soft slippers My husband liked his slippers I got him for Christmas He said that they were warm and soft 
Fashionable Laptop Bag This bag is great Very fashionable and protective of my laptop Great side pockets and convenient pocket for cell phones 
I absolutely love this case The cool thing about it is that it doesn t look like a regular laptop case i e the bulky usually black boring case My best friend didn t even know it was a laptop case and fell in love with the bag itself It makes a great gift for any soon to be college student 
most comfortable shoes Been purchased many pairs Keds shoes very stylest and comfortable Me and my mom love them 
Military Belts The webbing was abundant and easy to cut to my needed length These belts can be made to fit anyone 
very pleased This is a very nice leather bag It has two pockets in the front that the flap goes over The pockets do not close and I have found that you can lose things out of those pockets even with the flap closed That is the only problem I can see with this bag 
Ole Timer Jersey Love the shirt This was a birthday present for my son We are so impressed with the quality that we will definitely use this Amazon site again 
good socks These are great socks In the description it mentions that they fit sock sizes 10 13 I assume that is the same as shoe size but it is not explained This however is an important point since I wear a size 10 shoe I can wear the socks and I really like them but I wish they were a little smaller One size does not fit all 
Bought these sandals three years in a row Columbia sport sandals for kids are great We ve bought them three years in a row now for our kids They hold up well are comfy and the colors are great Easy for the little ones to get on and off make getting in and out a breeze They re well constructed but the dirt starts to show on the nylon parts after a while They won t really wear out before your kids feet grow to the next size 
These are my favorite shoes I love these shoes They are so comfy and cute and Keds is my favorite brand of shoes 
Boca Classics Swim Trunk This product is fine however it was much too baggy I m not that skinny and I felt like the excess leg space made me look ridiculous There is nothing wrong with the short but I just wish I had bought a smaller size Definitely go with the smaller size if you buy this product 
Great sandals I have been trying to find low heeled sandals with a back strap and no thing between the toes so I was very excited to find these I bought 4 pairs silver bronze black and turquoise They are beautiful and comfortable I walked around at Disneyland in the turquoise ones from 9am to midnight The sizing was very true and the standard shipping was very fast I highly recommend both these sandals and Amazon com 
This is the best little bag e v e r I purchased the scarlett version of this bag more than two years ago and it s still in perfect condition The color doesn t fade when you wash it and it s the most durable bag I ve ever owned I will not refuse to absolutely cannot make me carry a purse but I carry this bag everyday The very front zipper pocket is great for change the small zipper holds my keys and cell and a host of other small items I always seemed to be losing before and the large pocket is big enough to fit several medium sized paperbacks in It s perfect for everyday use and will last forever The backpack straps are comfortable and have never broken I was so excited when I found this on Amazon and IN EVERY COLOR Before the selection was red and black only so this is fabulous Buy this bag you will love it

Very warm and comfortable I purchased these slippers in pink and not only are they super cute they are quite comfortable and very warm The sole of the slipper is slightly heavier than most but it is nice if you need to step outside or in the garage for something when it s cold out I would recommend them 
Stylish and Nice Hot Looking too These are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff Levi s My cutoffs are so faded so frayed so well you know So when I peal them off to reveal this Butterfly Lace up Panty in Black with the pick laces on the back it s like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl We only had two colors at our lingerie party white and the black and pink models but I can imagine all the colors would be nice too 
Hot Socks Amazon notes that these socks are only made from the finest yarns They mean it too These socks keep your feet warm with their wool fiber and they are very well made and last forever I especially like the way that they are reinforced at the heel and toe for lots and lots of wear Oh sure these socks may cost a bit more but you get so much use out of them that these socks inevitably pay for themselves The socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12 therefore it is almost one size fits all A big plus I also like that the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers Great I would not dry these socks at high temperatures This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot Eventually they will bunch up when you wear them and that s very uncomfortable Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature Overall you can t go wrong buying these socks They keep your feet extra warm during colder weather They are manufactured so well that you definitely get your money s worth A good deal SMILE 
I would have given 5 stars but They looks nice and fit really well however not so soft like some other Clarks Indigo 
Quality Price Fits Great quality great sale price If your lucky you don t get what you pay for 
Nice gift I ordered these robes in white and ivory as Christmas gifts for my mother and father in law They arrived quickly and beautifully packaged Last week I was told that they loved their thick and luxurious robes they feel as if they are at a spa I was concerned about the one size fits all sizing but I was told that she loved the extra coverage she s probably a size 14 16 and this is one of the few robes that goes around his expanding waistline I buy him XL sweaters I will order one for myself as soon as I am in the market for a robe 
Nice robe for the money The robe is very warm and heavy perfect for cold mornings and the just out of the shower chills that you get It doesnt quite have the luxurious feel of a spa robe and the thread loops are matted in certain areas but quality wise it is better than anything else I ve seen for similar prices The length is much shorter than pictured I bought this for my boyfriend who is 6 ft 190 lbs average build and it comes just above his knee All in all it s a decent robe for the price and he likes it

Childrens Fanny Pack Great product just what I was looking for Service was excellent and shipping was prompt Thank you thank you thank you 
Review for my Black Napa Leather Mini Backpack Purse I love the feel and multiple spaces available the only problem fear is that I have had things fall out of it when snapped and string tight I would give it a 5 star if there was a zipper option to keep items secured 
Great bag exactly how it looks My wife had one just like this for 15 years and it was time for a new one This back is almost identical and better quality Shipping was very fast and it came exactly as I expected 
Simple and convenient I actually purchased the Silicone skin case and detachable belt clip as a gift for my boyfiend He loves and it was much cheaper than the one Creative offers on their website 
smochek I LOVE these shoes they are so comfortable and you can buy them for a great price i have them in gold and im really happy with my purchase 
Great thong Agree 100 very comfy Besides making the ideal for everyday use the fabric is so soft that is very hot to the touch The look is very sexy So they are good in both sides comfy and sexy 
nice dress good price For the price it s a nice dress Check your size carefully I m normally a 29 waist in jeans usually size 6 sometimes an 8 I ordered a Large and it fits with only a little room but a Medium would have been too small Slim through waist and flares out to the sides more than I expected it to 
Best Price in Town Birkenstock clogs are the comfiest shoes During a recent trip to Washington DC I was the only person in my group whose feet didn t hurt after several hours of walking I have had several pairs over the years They last forever and go with tons of different outfits 
They Made Me Feel Ready for Bed all Day Long I m a pretty sexy girl and these so called panties are just about too sexy for me Ooooweee do I feel hot when I have em on Levi s shorts dress or trucker s overhauls it makes no difference The whole rest of the world might not know what you have on under there but you ll know and that s enough to add a certain blush to your face let me tell you They made me feel ready for bed all day long 
Birenstock August Great purchase good price easy what more could you want 
I love these boots These are my new favorite boots The detailing on them is gorgeous and although they are quite high heels they have a bit of a platform so I do not feel wobbly at all on them I m really happy with my purchase 
Comfortable and good looking I like this dress I am medium sized and bought size Medium and the dress fits just like on the model shown with even a little extra I think even if I would of get size Small it would still fit well with more trim fit look It is basically like a super long tank with body contour Nice to wear around house when you just want to quickly through something on but also want to look good in it It is way more flattering than wearing boyfriend s long tea shirt if you understand what I am saying It is soft comfortable cozy beautiful color I am very pleased with this product 
Perfect inexpensive duffel bag Was delivered quickly was priced right and folded up into a small size so I could stuff it into a suitcase before going on vacation When unfolded it held more than the suitcase High quality material and excellent workmanship I think I ll buy another one for a spare 
small perfect convenient this is a great wallet it fits into small purses the purpose of this is just to hold a few cards your id and a small zipper section for some money it s not meant to be a complete big wallet i love it because it fits into my small purses and so easy to carry around i don t have to shove and push my bigger wallets into my purse and not have room for anything else anymore love it 
Another 5 stars for gold toe All my Gold Toe socks are excellent but these offer extra room and are extremely comfortable especially after the first washing I am about to buy another pair The Trellis style is the other wonderful Gold Toe sock for comfort 
Fun Comfort and Casual Style Absolute gems Simple versatile shoes that are fun comfortable and have great casual style I have them in red wear them to work when traveling and the one time I got stuck in a surprise Seattle snowstorm they even had traction Nearly an all purpose shoe 
Beautiful Silk Scarf My wife shopped around at Amazon looking for her grandmother s 88th b day coming up soon and came across handmade hadong silk scarf Every silk scarf she came across she would say What a beautiful and gorgeous hadong silk scarfs they are Before she found Vietmade Silk Scarfs at Amazon she had looked online stores at Macy s Nordstorm JcPennies but couldn t really compare with the ones Vietmade made I agree with my wife when she said This place uses good quality silk materials and has a great prices When we got the scarf today 4 10 07 ordered 4 4 07 and opened it to see what the silk scarf looked like in person my wife wished that she had ordered one for herself one for my mother and one more for our sister in law My wife and I definately recommend this place and we ll buy a few more hadong silk scarfs in near future Also delivery was on schedule good packaging and love the scarfs 
great as formal wrap I was looking for a wrap to go with a black backless dress This scarf was perfect It added just enough color with a little sparkle and was plenty large to use as a wrap Very pretty 
Great Leather so so zipper Great jacket excellent feel only qualms are the quality of the zipper and the big bright label on the inside of the jacket 5 stars for the leather itself soft and very comfortable change the zipper so that it doesnt jam on the way up 99 of the time and make the label much more subtle and this would be an awesome jacket also sad but not surprised to see this is made in chin 
Highly Recommended I m shocked I forgot to write a review about these jeans I love these jeans They are by far my favorite jeans The fit is perfect and allows for room to breathe I love wearing these jeans with my boots on a daily basis I can t say enough about them I tell everyone about them Even for a petite woman the fit is far better than anything I could find in a local store I am completely satisfied They also have a very modern look to them 
Olga I buy these wherever I can find them It s a bit of a tribute to my aunt for her middle name but wish I could find them more frequently 
Review of Smart Tags Big and Bold This product is exactly as described and was purchased as an additional means of identifying luggage at the airport baggage claim so many types of luggage are similar in style and color we ve had trouble in the past Several of our family members were given new luggage for Christmas and these tags were included These tags are big bright lime green and can be easily seen No more headaches in trying to find our luggage 
Nice product The product arrived in a reasonable time frame and was what I had ordered I really like it 
C B Collections Red Slingbacks I love these shoes The service was great the price great These are really good shoes I have a hard time finding wide shoes where I live These were perfect Very comfortable very good quality This is where I will be buying my shoes 
Good service on time delivery would have been nice to have a gift wrap optio 
Excellent product I found it very comfortable with good fitting I bought 4 pairs in last 3 and half years and this one was the best I gave it 5 stars based on comparing with other brands that I bought Overall quality is good 
Like having air conditioning on your bike Recently I took a motorcycle trip from Atlanta GA to Ft Lauderdale FL Unfortunately I didn t have the option of riding at night when it was cooler and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110 it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dryer set on high blowing in my face I also didn t have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so I would pour water on my t shirt and let the wind cool it down After getting home I recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket preferrably mesh I was amazed at how well it worked in the demo so I went online and ordered one The particular model I ordered from Amazon is the Deluxe Evaporative Cooling Vest in black It came about a week after I ordered it via USPS Priority Mail They offer several styles and colors including some that have removable sleeves The outer shell is quilted black nylon with 2 outside zippered pockets and a zipper up the front The neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snuggly around your neck if you want The inner liner is blue and is 100 Nylon Taslan a water repellant fabric so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it Out of the package it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water the special material called Polymer Embedded Fabric PEF between the inner and outer shells absorbs water and the vest ends up weighing about 2 3 lbs You only need to soak it for about a minute There are spandex panels on either side that allow for some for expansion I got the Large size and it fits great not too tight not too loose Once the water is absorbed the instructions on the tag in the vest say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner liner dry Not being like a sponge wringing it doesn t do a lot of good so I d suggest blotting if you need to While the inner liner is water repellant there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you don t soak it too long the inner liner will be relatively dry The material that holds the water doesn t expand like a sponge it just holds lots of water it s pretty interesting stuff The first thing you ll notice after a few seconds is that it s cool to the touch The principle of it relies on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works I haven t had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool I don t think I d like to try it in anything less than about 65 deg F because I d probably freeze nor would I want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it The inner liner stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp The cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets they are lined with the same material as the inner liner so they ll stay relatively dry One thing I ve found though it ll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it The water is very slow to evaporate but once it does the weight goes back down to a few ounces Bottom line I HIGHLY recommend getting one of these if you routinely ride in hot weather They re an inexpensive way to keep cool and they re stylish except for the hi vis lime green Wear it under a mesh jacket and you won t know it s hot outside 
Comfy and cute These shoes are so comfortable and cute I ve gotten a lot of compliments on them and I like their old school Pony look 
Little brother body suit I mailed this for a shower gift so I didn t see the item but was told it was very cute 
Deceptive image This brown leather wallet does not have a highly glossy finish as shown in the image leather is well stitched but thin Old fashioned style with no credit card slots Snaps and zipper handle add bulk to profile not a front pocket wallet for sure Purchased two as gifts for nephews will probably get one for myself 
Perfect fit These shirts are hard to find during certain seasons I was very happy to find that Amazon had them The quality of these shirts have lasted a long time The fit is perfect and comfortable 
Review for Jerzees 100 cotton Shooter T Shirt Red Men s 2X I am very happy with the above purchase I am very impressed with the arrival and condition of the item I like it because it fits well and when you wear it you feel quite cool Will shop agai 
socks These were purchased for a wedding The quality is very good We would like to see solid black offered and argyle in black pink grey and white Thank you Joy Ree 
Fabulous These shoes are beautiful and comfortable I wore them at a New Year s Eve wedding danced all night with NO sore feet This is my third pair of Carlos shoes LOVE THEM 
HOT I initially bought these shoes for my mom for a Christmas gift but she said they were too high for her Well i fixed that I kept them for myself I love them and they are really hot Thnx Ja 
Good Pants My only reason for not giving it a 5 star is because there i no elasticated bottom cuff Otherwise Great Gym Pant 
Good Sale I was a little nervous about ordering clothing from the internet Not knowing if it would fit I think that the sizing chart used for this particular product works well because the produt turned out to fit just right Also the picture is on key with the actual product My loved it and so do I 
Good quality This is a good quality pajama set and was worth the price I paid with an Amazon discount Be forewarned that the color is a really bright red though 
Comfy and sleek pajamas What a great pair of pajamas these are So soft non binding roomy and great for lounging I ve already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays Very good quality silk well sewn and tailored I m normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine 
oh so sexy highheel shoes I love these shoes and so does everyone who sees me in them I am the envy of the girls at work 
Bootie licious I actually purchased a 9 5 and felt they were a little too big and then ordered a size 9 The 9 didn t fit well the arch was too short so I sent them back and kept the 9 5 They are very nice I ve been looking for a nice pair of boots for 5 years I get a lot of compliments from people of all ages 20 65 Not too young looking not too old looking They are the perfect boot One little negative I needed to put in a pad for the front part of my foot not a lot of cushion After that I can wear them all day long I should have ordered them in brown 
Remember this is Italian Sizing These sweaters are excellent quality cashmere and I just bought another one in a different color They feel like a million dollars and come from an esteemed Napoletana designer Ermenegildo Zegna But as a general rule when buying Italian clothing always buy them bigger than you would expect I normally wear a size large shirt in the US never XL I am 5 7 and 185 lbs I bought a size 54 x large and it is comfortably roomy and not too huggy on the fat I think some of the similar sweaters from Zegna are more delicate read see through This one is a little thicker but still thin for a sweater I really like wearing it with a t shirt underneath feeling the soft cashmere on your arms 
Eye Catching Canopy We are very happy with the gazebo and will be excited to use this next football season Unfortunately the cover came with some stitching missing and we have not been able to receive any response from Amazon after sending 4 emails We do not want to send the entire order back for another because the cost of shipping would be more than the cost to have someone repair the stitching We have only asked that our repair cost be covered by the company but we can not get anyone to respond We will never order anything through Amazon again 
SD Chargers Gazebo The gazebo is very sturdy and works great in the sun and rain Adding the team cover is a great way to show your team pride during tailgate parties It takes a bit of practice to set up the unit but I believe that all gazebos have the same problem 
Love it Love it Love it Love it Every football fan should have one It is perfect for tailgating This is the only site I could find it Great price and the free shipping is a great deal It also shipped really fast faster then it had originally said 
My husband likes these shoes I purchased these shoes as a Christmas gift for my husband He s been wearing it a lot He says it s comfortable and he has not experienced the squeeking from the shoes as some other reviews had pointed out I was hoping it has more of a dressier look It really looks better with jeans and not as good with kahki s 
Review of silk robe The robe was made of a very high quality fabric and held up very well The color and tecture of the silk was truly beautiful 
Both Tactical and Casual Good material and does the job that it promises All other brands claim to do the same thing but not all glitters are gold 
work out shirt great shirt for working out in Clears away all the sweat and is loose fitting 
Same great jeans the quality you want but better price I have worn nothing but levi s for over 20 years now and I have been through almost every style of them These are still the same great jeans reliable fit and quality that you know Currently I have three of these in my closet nest to standard 505 s and they are virtually identical but the signiture series cost a lot less Same thick denim material unlike a lot of fancy boutique jeans that last a long time and can stand up to most activities that an active person does Check these out you won t be dissapointed and neither will your wallet 
Cool I got this hat because it reminded me of what Jack Nicholson wore in One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest I m happy to say it also keeps my head quite warm Cashmere is very soft and it breathes well my head never feels too hot 
Very comfortable and easy to use I ve tried 6 different nursing bras This one with the center snap closure is the easiest to use It is also the lightest and most comfortable while providing good support My only complaint is that after about 50 washes the underwire begins to poke free from the fabric Even when I try to sew it back into place it breaks loose after a few washes Perhaps if I handwashed the bra instead of using a machine it would last longer This bra is less durabe than my other nursing bras particularly the Leading Lady bra which seems to be indestructible but it is well worth the sacrifice for comfort lightness and ease of use It is by far my favorite 
Comfort meets Great Style A great shoe I was very impressed with the softeness of the leather immediate comfort and versatility of this shoe This is definitely a well made year round slide If you are looking for a classic loafer this is your shoe 
quality superb the shawl was beauiful and just the right color an excellent value too very good product fast shippin 
Penguins I love these pajamas The color the softness get softer the more you wash and the fit I had purchased these for an older friend and found I wasn t able to part with them so I made it up to her in other ways Never done that before shows how much I like em 
THANKS Arrived fast and in time for V day Thanks for your high quality product and its fast arrival 
Great Snowbroading pants I love these pants i m a first time Boarder and I wasn t cold at all Deffinately a Great BUY 
Watch out boxers Briefs are back in i tried these on and i ll never wear boxers again They are very confortable and i sleep in them everynight they are tight but not too tight I wear these to school as well I love them 
very nice polo It s a very nice polo very soft and nice to a casual date 
Very comfortable for me I bought Brown Burnished color of this variety After I got them I tried them on and these are simply fantastic I liked the way they fit onto my feet My feet are wide and hence I had ordered a wider version of these They give you a very comfortable and stable feel when you have them on and walk around The sole looks very sturdy and durable Does not skid over wet surfaces 
Love this product The robe arrive in great condition and in a timely manner My boyfriend absolutely loved his Christmas gift Thanks again 
It s Why I Got It It s thin so you can wear something over it And it helps keep the chill out I wear it cycling and golfing 
Carhartt Jeans Since these jeans were ordered as a gift for someonelse I cannot give my own opinion of the jeans other than to say I received the jeans in a timely manner and that the size and color was exactly what I had ordered 
Fossil makes great wallets The wallet was a gift for my daughter s boyfriend He loved the wallet the leather the design style and sleek look of the Fossil wallet It was a great purchase and a good value 
relaxing comfort this is a form fitting but not to snug nightshirt gives freedom of movement yet also allows some comfort with a nice breathable material deffinitly will order more of thes 
Excellent socks I hate long socks and smelly shoes so I ve become a big fan of shoe liners I recently ordered a set of these and am very happy with them They are each individually priced at 5 99 So for 6 pairs you d pay 36 retail So this is a good deal at 4 pair More importantly they are heavy weight cotton with no underside seam They have elastic all around the opening and actually stay on your feet They are cut generously My feet are about size 8 and they are a little big but manageable If you have smaller feet I d try to get a different size than M L They do ride a bit higher on the foot than some of the others they are fine with loafers but a lower cut shoe could be problematic I ve tried a lot of these socks Calvin Klein Ralph Lauren Donna Karan Peds Leggs et al These are by far the best 
Great shoes I bought as a gift for my sister in law and she absolutely loved them These are some great looking shoes 
great idea This is a great idea that is not apriciated until you go on a long trip and end up with dirty wrinkled clothes that are all thrown into a bag This keeps clothes seperated and organized and easy to repack if you are moving from place to place 
Top performance Great grip cool rugged look comfortable enough for regular winter use as well Was about 80 when I got it though Might not be the best option around for 130 
Sexy Boot My online shoe shopping tip Buy a half size bigger than your normal size If it s a little too big you can always add inserts to achieve a better fit I also search the web for additional consumer reviews PROS This pointy toed boot looks really sexy A great bargain for 30 bucks It s an easy to put on short boot It goes up to the bottom of my calf I m 5 5 The leather is shiney and has a seamless look Stains will wipe right off I d recommend these with a nice pair of jeans or even for young professionals to wear with their slacks Relatively comfortable I personally wouldn t wear them all day long CONS Leather IS stiff Doesn t really bend with the leg when walking I think that is what the previous negative review was referring to The inside of the shoe has a nicer softer leather The zipper is not the best quality Hope this helps you make a better shopping decision Or you can always buy try on and return If you choose the free shipping method and you want to return the item you just have to go to the Returns section of the website and generate a return label Once Amazon receives it and processes it they will give you your refund MINUS the shipping cost you saved when selecting Free Shipping It is usually less than 5 bucks and you can see the amount in Your Account enjoy 
Great product and fast service Great company to order from good product and got to me faster than any other order 
Long lasting great shape and support I had a heck of a time trying to find a bra that would not slip off my shoulders and would support my breast This one did both This bra supports me better than my sports bra and it gives a beautiful shape to the bustline I was looking for a well rounded shape not conical or ski sloped The key is to get a propper fit I went from a 38C to a 34DD not that my sized changed just getting a well fitted bra If you can pull the band more than an inch from your body you are wearing the wrong bra size It is supposed to be snug to hold everything in place It takes a little getting used to wearing something that tight but I don t bounce jiggle or pull up falling bra straps anymore I bought two in September 05 and went back and purchased 3 more in October 05 and when these wear out I will purchase the exact same thing I hand wash or machine wash on delicate after each wearing with a lingerie soap and line dry They still look band new I was a little concerned with that itty bitty plastic front closure bursting with the band being so snug but they are still holding it all together I was also concerned about the sheer fabric lasting but I haven t had any tears rips runs or poked through any of them yet 
Good to your Feet I love my Cayman Crocs My sister swore by these shoes but I wasn t convinced because they are a little different looking I liked the bright colors I saw some people wearing at the beach this summer but I m practical and they can only go with so many things I ended up purchasing a navy pair because they go with just about anything I m not at all disappointed They really don t look bad paired with casual outfits I wish they could make the soles of all shoes out of this stuff though because it s amazing It s not so much that you slip them on and say wow this feels great for me it was more so that after activities marathon shopping trips for example my feet weren t sore or tired when my regular shoes would have had them ready to quit I think they are great even with the different look though I do wish they d come up with a more stylish pair at some point 
Superfreak Spectacular item Wears well on a fine woman My wife is short and this item fit fine especially since most one size fits all lingerie is built too tall 
Great Gift Thank you for this Great Gift for a baby shower States away that you made helpful and she loves i 
Good synthetic wicking sock These go on real easy and come off real easy They feel like a regular cotton sock except that they wick sweat away I m ordering more 
Socks for Son I searched the Internet for a particular type of sock that my son likes but discovered they were no longer manufactured So I went to Amazon to see what they offered and decided to try the Gold Toe The price was excellent and my son likes them very much He s very finicky about some things and it was a real if to try something new I m so happy that Amazon offered them and at a price that meant it would not be a huge loss if they didn t work out My son has looked at the price of this sock at some of the department stores nearby discovered that the Amazon price is very good so now we know where to go when he needs some more Thank you Amazon 
Great guys to do business with The shorts were everything I wanted The service was 5 star and my husband wears these short all the time I bought him all the colours available 
Your child won t take these shoes off My child slept with these shoes on the first night he got it I allowed it because he has not worn it outside Of course he wore it the following day to school rode his bike with it and just took it off at the end of the day Very comfortable and cute shoes I might get a pair for myself 
Cool Shoes I own 2 pairs They are classy and go with everything but the only minus point is that they are a bit heavy but you eventually get the hang of it 
good quality build comfortable These shoes exceeded my expectations in that they are very lightweight The soles are made of some kind of stiff foam instead of solid rubber Time will tell how it wears compared to rubber but the shoes are noticeably lighter than the last pair I owned They look good they are very comfortable very little if any break in time If you like the look it s a safe buy you won t be disappointed with the build and feel 
Bargain Leather Bag So far I have been very satisfied with this bag For the price I really can t complain It has enough different sections places for pens a divider pouches in front and other nice touches that makes it a pleasure to use I m curious about the durability how the leather will hold up and if the zippers will last I use it to hold 2 1 notebooks a textbook a portfolio a book a calculator and my pda This is about maximum capacity I should note that the notebooks and portfolio just do fit inside the sections The handle ontop is cozy the over the shoulder strap should be wider Overall I am happy with the purchase and hope that it lasts 
Used for Football My son used these socks as part of his football uniform He said they were comfortable and I was happy that they withstood the abuse week after week The didn t run or snag like some other lighter weight socks 
Very cute but runs a bit small This shirt is very cute but you may want to order it in a larger size than what your child normally would wear My child normally wears a 24 month I ordered the size 2 and it s much tighter and shorter than her other tops 
arrow short sleeve broadcloth shirts shirts are what I had expected and the service was grea 
love these shoes I am very pleased with these shoes They are very comfortable and look great as well 
I m used to Walmart Clearance rack stuff It s only been the last 7 years or so that I ve enjoyed wearing a robe around the house I admit I used to be walking around in my underwear when I woke up in the morning All of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth I bought this becuase my last robe is falling apart I have to say that although I hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe when it got here and I wore it for a couple days I really like it I bought the Large Black robe I m 6ft about 200lbs a little heavy around the middle and the robe fits pretty well The arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist The length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs It flows nice too when I walk not like the heavier terrycloth robe And the silk lining makes me feel rich Overall I like it 
Great for Kids Play The wand is sturdy full sized and nicely designed even if made of plastic The kids wanted their wands so they could play Harry Potter so this was much more appropriate than the beautiful but more fragile and very expensive collectors versions available 
THE AWESOMEST SHIRT EVER This is cute funny and it s not uncomforable I think it rocks I love this movie I even call my pet rabbit the rabbit with those big pointy teeth 
Pitbull Poly Tank Top The overall quality of the garment is excellent The fabric is of very good quality as is the stitching The sizing is also accurate However the tank top I received was NOT the one I had ordered but a substitute Thus four stars not 5 In the future I will specify that a substitution will not be acceptable 
AWESOME SOX NEVER fall down A+++++++ These SOX are the BEST my husband has ever used He has asked for me to buy more and he has thrown all his other over the calf sox into the trash He has been in construction for almost 30 yrs and has never been happy w any sox I have found for him until now These make him VERY HAPPY Thank You 
Socks That Stay Up My husband really likes these socks because they do not slide down his legs below the tops of his work boots I also like the fact you can buy them in black and Amazon had a fantastic price on them I don t know the wearability of the socks since I just got them for my husband for Christmas I bought these same socks in white locally some time ago and they seem to be wearing okay no holes in the toes yet Overall I think the socks are great 
Socks That Stay Up These socks are really comfortable and they really stay up All other brands of over the calf socks that I have tried won t stay over the calf Within a few hours other socks are sitting on my shins I have worn pairs of the Gold Toe Over the Calf Athletic Sock for up to 24 hours and the most they slid down my leg was about an inch Great socks 
Maidenform One Fabulous Fit Strapless Bra This is absolutely the most comfortable and flattering bra I have even owned Have thrown out all my regular bras and only wear this one now The fit is unbelievable 
Betula sandal This sandle is very comfortable and attractive I would recommend it to anyone looking for this type of sandle 
A bit narrow for my feet Birkenstocks are a great thing for my diabetic feet I found this particular model to be a bit narrow to my liking 
Travalon Luggage Scale This little scale can pay for itself many times over and grants peace of mind as you approach check in I purchased two one for my Australian friend who always overpacks and has to pay at the gate for overweight luggage It is more accurate than bathroom scales If you are by yourself hold it in front of a mirror 
Caught my eye in the store window Was shopping at the mall This item caught my husband s eye in the window We went into the store to inquire more of what it was and it s uses We actually bought one for ourselves It came in handy when we went on a trip to the mainland going and returning home Especially since the airlines are quite strict with the luggage weight I was quite worried our bags would be in excess weight with all the shopping we did but it wasn t We foud that to use the scale is compact enough for it to be placed in one of the luggages It s a two man operation My husband would lift the luggage bag then I would look at the scale quickly 
Fits my narrow feet trendy yet comfortable walking shoe I tried this shoe at Shoe Carnival today It was on sale for 49 99 Needless to say I bought it right away at Amazon since it was 39 99 It fit me really well I walked around the store and the strap stayed fastened it was comfortable all around I really like the mesh material at the toe area I m hoping this would mean that my toes will be well ventilated during warmer summer months This is a very comfortable trendy shoe that is a good option for those wanting to look hip while wearing something comfortable to include more walking steps in their work day It s also a great shoe for those not wanting to expose their toes wearing sandals but want them to breathe 
Good merchandize but bad service The item was what I expected however It took them weeks to have the item shipped I sent over emails to follow up and they never responded Bad customer service 
The best bibs ever We needed some plastic coated bibs once we started solids and started with those super stiff plastic ones from Babies R Us The stiff bibs were great for keeping her clothes dry when she would keep her bib off of her high chair We ve got a Svan high chair the best that has a pretty small opening for the kid s torso so a stiff bib that you are constantly stuffing in there is such a pain Also when cleaning if you got the back fabric side of the bib wet the bib would be cold and wet for hours The bumkins bibs can be washed thorougly with soap and water in the sink and then hung up They will be totally dry by the next meal They are so soft that our daugher doesn t mind wearing them They do not get in the way and stay nicely tucked assuming our daughter doesn t pull the bib up to look for bib goodies in the pocket We bought 2 sets and could easily use more They can also be washed in the washing machine no dryer but they air dry super fast 
Woodland Desert Digital BDU s See my review for the Desert Digital I own both the woodland and the desert BDU s 
good prooduct inadequate description Bra was more padded than I thought when ordering Descriptions of products are not adequate thanks though love shopping on Amazo 
The best bra available for the small woman This bra fits is comfortable and invisible under T shirts I hope they keep making it forever 
Excellent Bra This bra is great for those of us with smaller busts It s the only bra I ll wear under my t shirts now because it doesn t show the outline through the shirt like every other padded bra I ve found It VERY comfortable The only downside is that mine did lose it s form it s not as tight fitting as it used to be a little bit faster than some other bras But it s absolutely worth buying a replacement I just hope they never stop making this bra 
Great Case This is a nice case if you are looking for something compact I have a Kodak Easy Share digital camera and it fits perfect inside The case has a nice size front pouch and 2 side pouches for easy storage 
Perfect SIZE for Canon Powershot S2 IS I purchased 2 other bags before finding this one It is awesome The Canon S2 IS is a hard camera to find a case for that isn t way too tight or super big I wanted a bag for my camera and the original accessories that came with it This bag fits it all perfectly It isn t too small or too big The camera fits perfectly without squishing it in the main compartment and has a little bit of room left for the usb cord or whatever else you want to put in there I wouldn t recomend this bag if you are looking for a bag to hold additional lenses is it isn t big enough for that 
Backpack for my college student My son loves the backback and the spacious room for he has for all the engineering books he needs for class 
Best Briefs This is the best style and fit of underwear that I have ever owned I have been buying this style for almost 7 years now It gives me the support and freedom that I need in physical activity and the comfort I desire in everyday wear Plus it provides you with a nice lift and profile Note beware ordering through Freshpair My order took 1 month from them 
great checkbook cover I love it It is just what I wanted Great deal and smooth transaction Thanks 
Nice inexpensive checkbook cover I was looking for a durable checkbook cover that would last for years yet wasn t going to take years to pay for HA HA This is a nice checkbook cover for the money My only complaint is that it needs to have a tab to keep your check register open to the page you are working on However it does have a loop to keep a pen inside you should desire to do so All in all a good buy 
Great Boot Bought this boot for varying terrain and temperature conditions It is stable comfortable provides good traction and is warm without being sweaty I would strongly recommend this boot 
Wonderful Company speedy delivery product as stated would buy from them agai 
Sounds Silly Best sock in performance that I have ever tried I buy them in bulk and have never been dissappointed No sagging no defects The only reason I toss them is that they fade to gray after a long life of use One of the few products that once you try them you never have to worry about this item in your wardrobe again If they ever stopped making them I would buy a 100 pairs just to know I would have them for my liftime There I actually wrote a review on socks 
Great I bought this product online about a week ago and it is exactly as described And to the reviewer who backpacks If your that hardcore of a backpacker you might want to consider spending more than 6 on a fanny pack Seriously lighten up and review the product not tell your life story 
Amazing style AND comfort This shoe transcended all my expectations the style color and fit were all everything I hoped for and more All this plus a modest price 
Dressed up Feminine Courduroy Shirt This shirt is a dressier than the usual shirt jacket or big shirt It is unlined has a bit of stretch for comfort and is just slightly fitted to prevent that big blob shapelessness of some other courduroy shirts I think it runs true to size and matches the color on screen I bought this as a gift for a friend who likes the comfort of big shirts in the winter and maybe she can have that comfort even at work with this shirt It was almost thirteen dollars then but I have seen it for less than ten which would be a really good deal 
Great boots I have owned a pair of these boots for three years now and they are still going strong I work in construction and find these to comfortable boots whether I am on site at home out on the town etc These are really incredibly made considering their 40 dollar price tag 
Perfect These are just what I was looking for in a knee sock Perfect weight and never slip but aren t too tight at the top either 
Almost the Perfect Sock My daughter s school requires that they where white knee highs with their uniform I had an awful time searching the net to find any until I came across these They are very soft and comfortable My daughter only wants these types of socks from now on But from a Mom s point of view they are hard to keep white Even with soaking in bleach I can t get out any of the foot wear and tear discoloring Other than that they re great 
Sock it to me These socks are wonderful Just the right weight very comfortable and warm Don t fade after washing etc etc I purchased 6 pair two months ago and have purchased 6 more 
best trouser socks for plus size women I purchased these socks from a large department store in Chicago and fell in love with them and wanted to get rid of every other pair of trouser socks I had It took me months of online searching through all major department stores to find them and then as a last resort I went to Amazon and found them in a second I have already bought 8 pairs and will probably order another dozen and get rid of all the poorly made and uncomfortable socks I have in my drawer I am hooked on Hue Plus size and it is so easy through Amazon 
Very nice belt hard to find The belt is high qualilty and was a good value for the price Very satisfied 
great I where these shoes all the time They are really comfortable to run in 
good running shoes I like the look of the shoes and the shiny parts are easy to clean although the cloth parts are difficult to keep clean I have a high arch and they seem to support well so I would say over all they were a good choice 
Good shoe for the price Shoe pretty true to size good shoe for the money I buy Nike Shox often and decided to try these for the price Not as cushy as a Nike Shox but also half the cost or less For the price it is a comfy shoe and I would recommend it if you have wider feet and or don t want to send 90 00 and up for Shox 
I would highly recommed these very nice I was concerned that these silk PJ s would be really thin and on the cheap side But to my surprise they are much thicker then I thought they would be and feel like they will hold up rather well My husband did NOT expect these and is quite pleased with them I am back tonight to order another pair in a different color now that I know they are worth the money I paid for them Plus the fit was perfect I noticed others here said their large was to big so get a smaller size and another person said the opposite That confused me when I went to buy So I just went with my husbands normal size which is a XXL and it was absolutely perfect My husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of PJ s ever The size is perfect color bright looks like it will hold up after many washings Seams looked like quality sewing unlike some I have bought in the past I can t find anything I don t like about these I need to get another pair here FAST before he wears these out lol Anyone thinking of buying these I can t help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least Ja 
Finally a shoe I can wear all day long I ve had foot problems this past year Shoes that I had worn comfortably for years including other Rockports Ecco New Balance Avia Reebock Asics etc were suddenly uncomfortable and painful to wear all day long These Rockports are great I m finally NOT in a hurry to get home and get into my slides I was to the point that I d pay 300 or better for a comfortable pair of shoes This shoe is well worth the money 
Just like my father s I highly recomend Fruit of the Loom mens briefs Not only I did grow up wearing their brand but my father and his father before him all wore these briefs If somethings not broke why fix it 
Very nice Backpack is light when empty yet strong to curry the load of books to school Side pocket for bottle very handy Top pocket for CD player or small easy to reach items such as keys very helpful and practical I like the base of the backpack being dark color so it doesn t look dirty from use 
cloud nine I love these bras so much They are so comfortable any other bra I wear now feels weird The only thing i noticed was the lacy edging started bubbling after about two months of washing and drying otherwise their my very favorite bras 
Great buy I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the items I ordered as well as receiving a 10 discount coupon for my next order Thanks 
Women s Under Armour Tech Tee This tee shirt is my first Under Armour purchase and I took a chance by ordering it without ever trying on any Under Armour before I m not dissatisfied but it isn t my favorite tee shirt On the positive side the weight of the fabric is good for exercising especially for the gym and it would be a good single layer for outside warm temperatures The fit is pretty good I am average sized and wear sizes 8 10 I don t like really tight clothing and this shirt is loose enough to be comfortable but fitted enough so that it doesn t look like I m wearing a bag On the negative side I am a little short waisted and the shirt is long for me and bunches at the top of my hips which I don t like but accept Also the vee neck is not a very strong vee pictures of this shirt are true in that respect A lot of technical tees are like this designed more for function than for style maybe and vee necks are essentially a crew x vee hybrid I prefer a true vee neck Lastly the fabric has a slightly rough scratchy feel which seems characteristic of today s technical fabrics It s not clear to me that the cost in hand is worth the added function of wicking in this instance Overall I consider this shirt fine for the gym or for an hour long run but I wouldn t want to spend a lot of extended time in it 
Excellent condition and prompt delivery This is ideal for wearing layers of clothing or if you re dressed in a short sleeve over this one However I personally prefer the long sleeved version by the same company 
Hush Puppies Shoes Love Hush Puppies They are comfortable and I can get a heel low enough for me to be comfortable 
Why The slippers are what I expected With only a month I can only say they do the job 
Red Sox Nation Great overall shirt Good quality wears well Wear it proudly 
Very cute This sweater fits perfect exactly what I was looking for and I coudn t go wrong with this fabulous price My husband liked it as well 
A Great Gift for the Busy Professional Woman I bought this bag as a gift for a lawyer friend She loves it and has told everyone about it The color allows her to express her personailty while remaining professional and the size and durability of the bag allow her to eliminate a separate purse lunchbag and carryall 
Great casual pants for mud or movies Comfy tough lightweight wrinkly like me Surprisingly durable considering how thin the fabric is Good stitching Velcro� back pockets will save your wallet Doesn t offer lots of stupid exterior loops and gear freak cargo pockets Not for the tidy country club set who need creases on everything but just perfect for active soccer Dads or when the family hound insists on playing Fetch with muddy logs and the like 
Exceptionally comfortable Like wearing a moccasin only with more support More supple than most Driving Shoes and light weight too Soles wear very well as do uppers A Great looking shoe that has become my favorite knocking around shoe yet plenty dressy for evenings eating out in Southern Cal 
You can have it all So glad I didn t have to choose between the convenience of carrying all my cards and the bulkyness of a holder big enough to accommodate them This wallet is slimline and holds all my cards It s been 6 months since I wrote this review and I only become more satisfied with this wallet All my cards are easily accessed viewed and I know immediately if one is missing The leather is silky soft and durable People have been asking where I found this item I think it s the best I ve ever purchased 
Great case We ordered this case for our son s Creative player and it s a hit It fits snuggly he can access all the functions with no problems and the loup allows him to attach it to a variety of cords and leashes during different activities A great value for the money 
Best Shoe Ever I just don t know where to start There just doesn t seem to be a way to describe the comfort You will just have to try them on to believe it My neighbor mother husband and I all swear by this product Accept no substitutions Attractive no but the comfort will blow you away 
Best Ever Don t Buy Imitations These are the best ever I bought these for my daughter and at first was nervous about ordering something like this online and because I had seen similar crocs at local stores for far less Well these are worth every cent My daughter and I went to a local store and she compared the way these felt to the local brand no comparison These are the best 
Health Benefits I wore these shoes when I worked on my feet all day and they really helped with pain in my feet ankles knees and hips I could really feel the difference from my other work shoes and the teeth in the shoes on the soles of my feet really felt good Being diabetic I am very concerned about circulation and I believe this was a good purchase A little expensive but well worth it in the end I plan on buying more 
Great Boots Soo comfortable and soo warm The only thing that sucks about them is that they aren t waterproof 
Perfect I bought these boots just in time before the crazy weather started Let me tell you these boots are great I read all the reviews and bought them a half size bigger and now they re a little big regardless I love them and another thing they keep my feet very warm and cozy 
Size is what it should be I read the reviews and alot of people said they run 1 to 2 sizes to big So I always wear a eight and I ordered a 9 They were huge on me I sold them to a friend also the ankle part was really wide for my foot when it was in the boot I ll stick to my Ugg s 
Fits perfect warm and comfy Please note I did not find the need to order up many sizes I only ordered a half size up from my normal shoe size and they fit perfectly Nice quality boot slippers with excellent traction nice arch support and a just little lift in the heel which relieves pressure from the low back I loves these boots and at a great price too Fast efficent shipping as well I should say that I bought a pair of White Mountain Suede Shearling boots and I was disappointed with the sizing as well as the quality 
Excellent quality and value Purchased this for my girlfriend Told me that fits well and was very happy with this I am glad to get such a good price on them too 
Best Sport bra for larger bust I have tried many different sports bras and this one is truly wonderful 
I order two of these shirts and I am very pleased with them They are very comfortable My sugguestion is to order a size larger if you have a little extra weight because the material can be a little clingy 
My Husband s favorite dress shirt This is my husband s favorite shirt because it s light and comfortable It is my favorite shirt for him because it needs no ironing and always looks crisp and neat 
None better These are the most comfortable briefs I have ever worn They are worth every penny in my opinion They are designed for a man plus they seem to not gather moisture as some fabrics do 
Small lightweight and beautiful I was looking for the lightest slimmest possible wallet and the Dopp Getaway is just about perfect For the first couple of weeks I kept sticking my hand in my pocket to make sure it was still there it s that unobtrusive It s made out of soft thin leather so thin actually that the embossed lettering on my credit cards shows through the surface That might affect the durability but it certainly keeps the overall bulk of the wallet down The illustration shows a large embossed crest but mine arrived with only discreet lettering saying Dopp at the bottom a significant improvement in my mind The wallet has pockets for 3 credit cards and a little pouch open on the top and one side to hold your cash There s also one additional pocket that s ideal for other documents you just have to carry The only slight negative for me was the caramel colored vinyl lining of the cash pocket I don t know why they used such a low class material there It s invisible from the outside and not really offensive but if I could change one thing that would be it I debated knocking off a star for it but the overall function and appearance of the wallet is so excellent that I thought it deserved the full five stars Overall if you re disciplined about what you carry you ll love the small size and low bulk of this wallet 
Romance in a bag It will definitely get her attention in the best possible way 
Very elegant This is my first Charles by Charles David shoe The material is good the size too The only uncomfortable issue was the open toe side but it after 3 days using them it was ok Very nice shoe but definetly it is not a 100 dollars one if you pay less than 50 will be fair 
Stylish and Comfortable heels My twin sister bought these for me and initially I thought they were too tall and they would never be comfortable Breaking them in wasn t so hard although the little ball part made the top of my foot hurt at first But now they feel stable comfortable and easy to walk it They feel perfectly balanced and I ve never experiance blisters in these shoes Two thumbs up 
Strong and durable I really liked my tote bag What I liked most was the variety of colors and the size of the bag which is pretty durable considering that I use mine to tote my books in college The only thing that i didnt like was the outrageous amount for shipping Let me tell you when I say the company sent the bag stuffed in a small manilla envelope but yet charged me what almost 6 or 7 dollars in shipping when in fact the enevelope probably costed about 50 cents to ship That was foul Despite everything about the shipping cost the bag is a good bag and I guess I shouldnt complain as much 
Great gifts for bridemaids For the price these bags cannot be beat There aren t terribly large but they are just the right size to fit the goodies that I purchased for my girls I am having them personalized and they will be ready to give 
Nice Tote I am happy with this bag I got the pink and white one It is a lovely color nice size durable and good price It comes with an outside pocket and I received it quickly My only complaint is that almost 7 in shipping is being charged for a light tote that was 3 99 otherwise I highly recommend this bag 
Great Value I wasn t expecting much based on the price so I was pleasantly surprised when I received my order The tote is a nice size made of relatively heavy fabric and seems to be well sewn I ve paid a lot more for a lot less This was a great buy 
Wide Dress Shoe I have wide feet and getting comfortable shoes expecially dress shoes has been a problem for me Once again LifeStride does know the meaning of wide shoe sizes It fits me very well looks great and is comfortable The color Wild Rice is a medium dark tan and is as shown I do recommend the shoe and of course it is available in other widths so it is not just for wide feet 
Under where Look what I found Where Under there Under wear Right there It says Be the first person to write a review for Jockey Boxer Briefs Hmmmm no wonder no one has reviewed these yet who writes a review for men s underwear Ok fine I ll do it I love these my preferred brand and style Your brand and your style may vary as this category of apparel tends to be a personal preference item I only buy these in black as I am a firm believer that underwear men s especially should not be white as by the time the end of the day rolls around and it s time to change them it s better to be left wondering what might be there as opposed to seeing it so prominently displayed on a white background These hold up well for the price Nothing lasts forever The elastic band is usually the first to go after many repeated washings before the material gives out i e they will fall off before they rot off Finally so I can feel like I have done a complete job in reviewing these I had a buddy of mine help with the ultimate test the Weggie test and these shorts handled it well extreme pain was reached well before the structure and or material of the boxer short failed I give these a ten tippy toes rating for how well they performed in the test 
Very comfortable shoe This is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The high top really supports your ankle and the shoe itself is form fitting and not one of those big bulkly tennis shoes It s light weight and flexilble but still supportive Well worth 30 
Cute I love these shoes and they are so cute and comfortable The heel is not so tall that you feel like you can t walk Customer service and shipping was excellent Best price I could find Don t hesitate on this purchase You ll love them 
ZenVision M Silicon Case is nice Protects the Vision M without restricting it s use or synch connection Flip screen provides extra protection but doesn t always stay in place Shipping took a little longer than expected more than a week but was reasonable 
A great case at a great price After having purchased the DLO sports case for my Creative Zen Vision M I read horror story after horror story about the case being too tight scratching the unit and even leaving a sticky residue on your valuable player I looked around for a while before going with this package deal and I m happy I took the time to do so The case is snug enough so your Zen won t move around in it but it doesn t button mash either The download charging port on the bottom is large enough to allow the adapter to plug in easily so once the case goes on you never really have to take it off The power switch headphone jack and microphone all have openings that are completely functional The belt clip kick stand and arm band are all bonus add ons that can be used or not depending on your needs And finally the flip screen helps protect your valuable screen which is the main reason I bought this The film screen protector is difficult to put on without leaving any air bubbles underneath so I took mine off in the end Fortunately these can be found almost anywhere unlike this case and package that comes with it And all of this for under 10 A great deal on an excellent product Highly recommended 
Very Comfortable Not very pretty but the comfort makes up for that I am on my feet all day and used to wear reeboks nike etc I decided to try the Crocs and have not gone back Its like walking with slippers on I have been wearing them for about 7 months or so and just recently tried my tennis shoes again and barely made it through the day By that night my feet and back were hurting so bad I didnt want to do much but sit down Right then and there I made up my mind to never go back to tennis shoes again I do wish they were a little cheaper so I could add all the colors to my wardrobe Buy them you wont be sorry Stay away from the look a likes they are nothing like the original crocs in comfort 
Great underwear I wouldn t say they re my favorite pair but I definitely like them Soft Comfortable Sexy 
Good purchase These are great goggles they are as good as sweeds but don t leave marks they stick to your head the same way I have used mine in several Triathlons and they are so easy to use and adjust if needed 
Black Tuxedo Outfit I really liked the Black Tuxedo Outfit my son wore it in a pageant and won so I am very very happy about that The tuxedo fit nicely and looked very nice on him 
Great Tuxedo I purchased this tuxedo outfit w vest for my son who was in his aunt s wedding He was 18mos at the time It looked wonderful on him and fit nicely The pants were a little long but other than that it fit very nicely on him The tuxedo was true to size of my child Fast shipping from retailer as well I was very impressed overall 
Very nice leather backpack at a very good price This backpack is sturdy good looking very functional and at at least a third of the price of other similar backpacks I looked at I m completely satisfied with this purchase 
The lady loves her hello kitty If your girlfriend is a fan of hello kitty then you can t go wrong with the cami panty combo Its cute but sexy Very nice 
Never buy just one I made a bone head move and just bought one It cost as much to send it as it did for one shirt These people have areally good t shirts Not thin and they are stiched well 
Best I ve ever owned This is the the most comfortable and motion limiting sports bra ever I highly recommend it 
Andrew Christian Fleece Hoody is Great I just purchased Fleece Hoodies and pants by Andrew Christian the material is wonderful The hoody feels luxuriously soft on my skin I would recommend them highly The pansts are low rise since I am older I am still getting used to that but they too feel really good on 
Hilfiger Doria Slip on More than pleased excited The price was better than local stores should have purchased several pairs Easy on the feet wear well and on and off at the airport 
silky shorts My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter They are perfect washing easily and retaining their size and color 
Wellies Par Excellence These Wellies rubber boots are a show stopper I get lots of comments on how smashing they look and they are very functional I wear them in the garden on the beach can walk into pretty high water without getting wet and they are comfortable for long periods of walking Very happy with them and the price was right too 
Good Socks These socks are a bit on the thin side but they withstand a lot of wear 
Nice Girlfriend loves these gloves they were thicker than her original fingerless globes however she complained about the thumbs She wish they had a better way to hold them on the thumb and when not in use to restrain it back 
Be organized Got this for my dad before his truck was a slew of mail and papers worked out well 
i love it I purchased the white entrance wedge sandal by Steve Madden from Amaon com and I LOVE THEM They are so Cute and they go with everything Perfect fun shoe for the beach or for a night out People compliment me when I wear them and you will not be dissapointed They are so comfortable and did I say that I love them 
Nice dress bag This is really too small for me to use everyday but is great for times when I want something dressy It is a very pretty little bag 
An Excellent Design Inexpensive Top Quality This fanny pack is superb The design is very roomy a very large main compartment fully lined and zippered and two convenient smaller zippered compartments in the outside front of bag Also fairly large zippered area within the main compartment and another on the back of the fanny pack leather area near your body As yet I haven t found a use for the very small side zippered pockets near the belt The leather is very good quality and the brown is a warm medium shade All zippers work well Extra large belt I am a new fanny pack wearer so it does take some getting used to the bulk and weight in the front waist area but it beats the strain of shoulder straps hand bags etc I use the cell phone pocket for my hearing aid volume program adjustment device the size of a small cell phone Similar fanny packs in leather stores in my town cost over 70 without all the features of this one It arrived soon after I ordered it I recommend it highly You won t be disappointed 
Heelys These shoes are the best I like the removable wheel You could heel to school and when you got there you could take your wheels out so nobody will know that you have them on You will be heeling across the floor in no time if you keep practicing on them It took me a while to get the hang of these shoes You should be absolutely satisfied when you try out these shoes They are the only shoes with removable wheels in the heels 
Dearfoams are like comfy homes for your feet This is the best brand of slippers I have ever owned I have a cute pink pair that I slip into the minute I get home They have lasted for several years now and they are still in good shape These slippers are so comfortable and they stay on my feet without any effort They are very soft and keep my feet plenty warm and my feet never sweat in them even without socks This style runs large and I wear a 1 2 size smaller than my normal shoe size in these slippers After wearing them the first week I noticed they got a little roomier but they still stay on just fine They are my only pair of house shoes at the moment I just ordered a new pair in a different style in pink of course and I have no doubt they will be just as good as this pair was to me Try Dearfoams and your feet will thank you

Top Jock Top Notch This swim jock is a great all around jock Very durable and very comfortable pouch and straps Mine has taken a beating and has not fallen apart like other jocks I own The swim style is cut very low in front with a fairly small pouch Not only is it great for working out under your workout pants or shorts it actually turns out to be a very sexy pair of underwear for everyday or play The low rise cut pairs very well with low rise jeans not to mention the barely there skimpy factor Heat it up a little and try this jock under your low cut jeans looks and feels hot If you re looking for a jock with less coverage and a lower waistband or just a comfortable sexy pair of underwear this jock is a great buy for the price

Woodland Camo Vintage Paratrooper Fatigues The fatigues were just what my son wanted The only thing wrong was that there was no inseam available to order I guess on fatigues you are suppose to use the drawstring at the bottom But my son didn t want that so I had to hem about four inches on each leg Other than that it was an excellent product

Looks Awesome I bought these boots when they were on sale Definitely worths the money they look great with skinny jeans tucked in and they are really comfortable Whoever saw my boots loved them 
Great shoes I love these shoes they are so comfortable and give great support These are my second pair The merchant got them to me really fast and I appreciate that Though when I ordered I thought the amazon site specified free shipping so I was surprised at that 
AMAZING I have been a fan of ASICS shoes for many years my feet tend to overpronate which puts a terrible strain on my knees and arches Asics duomax technology allows me to run comfortably which I love to do but stopped for many years due to the strain on my joints until I found these shoes I absolutely love these shoes they have helped me regain the confidence and comfort to enjoy running again This is the only type of shoe I will ever buy and has been the only one I have bought for 7 years now I highly recommend this shoe Especially if your feet tend to overpronate 
Shoes My baby loves his new kicks They came quick and would recomend them to anyone 
Best Belt Ever My husband is a big man and very rough on belts Most belts last him a few weeks This one has lasted him 3+ years The only reason I m buying him a new one is because he s lost so much weight There s still lots of miles left in the belt I m replacing Definitely got our money s worth out of it 
Great shirt Shirt looks good its a tighter fit not lose Color is very dark and looks almost black in some angles 
Ugg an oldie but a goodie The boots arrived packaged in their original packaging and individually wrapped inside These boots will never disappoint they are fun warm comfy and stylish Dont forget to spray with silicon before taking them out 
Real comfort and stain resistance I bought these just a couple of months ago but i ve already put them to the test I went hiking to a waterfall in Mexico I ended up covered in mud my new shoes included I was worried they would be spoiled it really was a lot of mud Then I just washed them with running water and all the dirt was gone Besides being really comfortable it s great to know that you can use them in all types of terrain and they will do the job 
julie snyder I love this purse I just wish I could get it in the emerald color too I have the magenta 
Finally Finally I ve been looking for a good bust enhancer for several years These enhancers are well shaped and incredibly comfortable When ordering go ahead and get the B C size Even if you are an A or low B These inserts are a little heavy and require a good bra to conceal and hold them up I personally recommend using a Fashion Forms pocket bra style 9400 or a Playtex style 4300 Order a cup size above what you would normally wear 
I love them but For me they are very difficult to put on I have to use a long shoe horn They aren t tight in fact they are so wonderfully comfortable and warm They look great if you like the UGG look I m hoping when they loosen up they will be easier to put on The top scrunches down when I put my foot in that is why it is so hard to get them on It could be me though Otherwise I love everything else about them Van C 
Great Item This was a very nice item I bought it for my mom for christmas She loved it It was shipped very fast and I was informed very well on shipment information This shoe was a great deal Usually they are pretty expensive but they had a great deal Thanks 
Skechers Women s Bikers Hot Rod Mary Jane Very comfortable but the straps keep coming loose 
Excellet Gift For Your Daughter My daughter simply loves this item Very handy compact and versatile A great wonderful gift for anyone s daughter 
basically great These are perfect for low rise pants The cut will likely be flattering for any guy The front pouch design allows for maximum comfort and moveability and I find the fit in the back to be basically great An essential for those whose jeans hang low 
It s pretty good The skin fits well the belt clip works well It seems a bit bulkier than my friend s Zen skin belt clip but she paid about 10 more than I did I would definitely recommend this product I have yet to use the armband so I can t review that right now My only issue is the screen protector fits into the window of the skin not Zen screen So the screen protector is smaller than the Zen screen The window of the skin covers a couple millimeters of the top of the screen but that part only tells the time anyway 
Excellent product Excellent product Item arrived fast and exactly as described Works like a charm Haven t yet had TSA open the lock but it does the job 
Best bra I have ever owned Once my best friend described my bra size as beige Meaning that when you shop in the full figure section of a department store you feel like you accidentally walked into your granny s closet Most of the bras are beige with some black or white ones and all are gigantic and ugly If this sounds familiar to you then this is the bra for you It looks pretty comes in a variety of colors and I at least was able to jump up and down while wearing it with no negative consequences The cups do the supporting so the bra doesn t need to have those super wide heavily padded straps And it gives a good silhouette under clothes but will also look nice by itself 
Almost Illicit What can I say these are pretty and practical I know my boyfriend is going to be impressed after the shock wears off I like these panties I like the lacy look so divine and I like the way they ride pretty low And they don t show through your clothes Like my dear gal pal Ophella I can imagine a naughty situation or two where I could have a little illicit and harmless fun Yikes What am I saying 
Fun comfy Who hasn t wanted a pair of these since they were a little girl So glamorous girly and sexy I was surprised how comfortable they are on the foot They really do feel like slippers just with the heel as a bonus I normally wear a 6W or a 6 � so these are a little snug but not too bad So glad I bought them two pairs red black Pink will be next 
Comfy My son love these shoes I have to stop him from wearing them so much I just wish they came in other colour 
Le Mystere is Le Manifique Not all bras are created equal But what makes it so special As a fuller figured female let me explain the merits 1 Support it does a great job This bra does not sag over the course of the day Your figure looks just as great in the evening as when you put the bra on in the morning 2 Coverage this gives the modest more coverage so people don t see what you don t want them to see For starters the fabric is thicker than any bra that I have ever owned And no this is not a padded bra the material is just thicker Since the material is thicker it means that it is truly opaque Not even with the thinnest and whitest t shirt will you be embarassed 3 Comfort this bra is quite comfortable especially considering that it is an underwire I have not experienced the sensation of underwire digging in nor the straps gouging my shoulders But on occassion I do feel some pressure from one of the straps hence the 4 star rating Now there are a few things that may give you pause 1 Price this bra averages 60 65 in department stores not a cheap undergarment 2 Size this bra is larger compared to other bras of the same size What I mean is that the bra has a defined shape it does not lie flat as the cups are molded And there is more fabric that connects the cups together A good descriptive word is substantial but don t think bulky This bra does disappear under t shirts giving you a beautiful form rather than a body marked by undergarment lines This is an undergarment that I intend to buy again and again and again 
Excellent Excellent quality for the price I paid Very happy with purchase Arrived in a timely manner 
Nice Pants My husband really likes the Intimo Men s Classic Silk Pants They are very comfortable and the color is really nice He wears them almost every day The only complaint that we had is that the pants are a little bit short in length 
Great bra know what you are buying This is a great and comfortable bra and it works for me It s a MINIMIZER and is great for larger sizes I exercise a lot and it provides great support even good enough for running on the treadmill I have a few of these same bras that have lasted several years I am so impressed with them that I looked up the tag numbers on the bras and found this site to purchase more and it is half of what I paid in the mall Now it is all I wear for everyday 
Righteous Bra I got this bra at a deeply discounted price when it was on clearance at a nearby store and I didn t realize how much I liked it until I decided to buy another one some time later and panicked when I couldn t make out the writing on the tag I have been trying to find this dang bra for AGES Finally I found it again I am so stoked The one I bought so long ago is my favorite bra and it looks pretty sad by now Like other reviewers bras mine developed a split in the fabric but it was only after many many washes in the machine rides on the bike exercise DVDs naps etc I like this bra because it fits me so well but also because the fabric is so breathable no cotton so it dries fast It is really stable so I actually use mine instead of a sports bra because sports bras suck If I could I would people the lingerie world with these bras The only problem a lady might have with this bra is sheerness related Don t wear it with a sheer shirt I wish there were another version Opaque Tapestry maybe Then I d never buy any other bra 
I give 5 stars I give 5 stars for the easy spirit sandle I ordered I like it Delivery is fast I will order something else 
nicer then i thought it would be I just love the color and the way it looked on me IT is a very very pretty jacket 
Didn t believe it but it s true these are comfortable You can actually forget you re wearing them And if you are like me and worn just about every thong there is that is huge I was thinking I should just stop wearing thongs at all until I found these I ve washed my pair a couple times in the regular cycle and dried them and it still is holding up well I m back on Amazon com to buy more Go for it girls you won t regret it Sexy and comfy Could you ask for more I now own three pairs 
Leather Bag Tag After having plastic tags crack and break off my suitcase a leather bag tag is what i needed They stay on the suitcase and don t break 
Light weight nice style These shoes not only look great but feel wonderful They are so light weight and comfortable Great product at a great price 
Very good service This company gave me very good service They called me personally a couple of times to make sure they had everything correct I was a bit diappointed that in the bigger sizes the selection of color isn t large but that is okay They were out of Granny Apple and so we had to get Red 
Good fit comfort price Very comfortable Better quality than most Good rubber sole and lotsa fur inside Sizing appears to right on for me I take an 11 shoe and the 11 fits just right The laces actually do tighten them up and pull the back up so my heels don t pop out as normally happens with a new shoe I doubt they will last very long outside but who wears slippers to the store Highly recommended 
Toasty well made except for some fit variation Good construction and material for the price Size seems a bit different in L vs R unless I am more asymmetrical now than I noticed before Nice sheepskin material I am hoping this lasts longer than the previous moc I purchased by Acorn 
Heaven for your feet Once while traveling I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn t rub my heel I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs very cushiony soft like walking on air Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don t get sweaty either I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home It s wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step They ve replaced my slippers mocassins surf shoes and sandals 
Carhartt workwear T shirt This product is what I expected when I buy a Carhartt product It s a quality item and worth the money I spent 
More than just the Shirt on your back UA products are worth every penny Turf Gear is initally marketed for use with football players well I think the year Bill Clinton became President was the last time I donned shoulder pads but it didn t stop me from being active later in life With Long Sleeve Turf Gear shirts from Under Armour I was hoping that the product would live up to the description A long sleeve shirt that is skin tight yet allows your skin to breath Material that wicks sweat away from the skin Sounded almost too good to be true but I took a chance anyways So far I ve used mine both hiking and cycling with the latter getting so much use that I need to order more Despite the tightness of this shirt when you initially put it on it stretches and breathes amazingly well I was a little leery with the two size charts and actually used Amazon s instead of the actual retailer who was selling the Under Armour product Fogdog and ended up just fine Works great for working out or any number of outdoor type activities which is what I use mine for Bottom line is that it breathes and stretches well and is very comfortable I must also add that after several washings and even a bad spill while cycling these shirts are amazingly durable I feel the price is definitely worth it excuse me while I go order more 
Lots of room and stylish at the same time I love this bag I purchased the pink chocolate color and I get alot of compliments on how cute it is I am in my early 20 s and I have a 2 and half year old and this bag can hold what I need for him as well as my things and still not look bulky or overstuffed and at the same time is very stylish I really like those trendy baby bags for those young moms but they are very expensive This is lightweight made of cotton so very easy to clean I chose standard shipping and it came so quickly I am very satisfied with my purchase 
Comfortable Durable I m very pleased with the comfort and design and appearant durability I just wish it would get colder and stay cold long enough in Arizona to wear them more often 
great wallet It s just what I wanted I pulled out the removable sections because I prefer a slimmer feel 
fantastic value These sweaters are a fantastic value for 18 Quality is excellent though the colored trim may not appeal to all tastes Note that the fabric is somewhat thicker than most merino wool sweaters and the sizing on this model is a little snugger than the other Raffi merino sweaters 
recent purchase I was pleased with all purchase I did not feel that I was given enough consideration on shipping costs as a very old and loyal customer In addition for reasons that are not clear to me I continue to get duplicate orders or the order is sent to an old address The return process in this circumstance is cumbersome and communicating with you and receiving a cogent response is quite difficul 
Disney cars sneakers The Disney cars shoes were awesome for my grandson He loved the racing lights and the wheels on the sides They are somewhat tight because of the elestic on the insides but they were a big hit for him 
Great Parka Having looked extensively for a casual parka that works well with jeans I finally found this one I ordered on line and then received a phone call from the company supplying this product through Amazon verifying that the size I ordered was correct The person I spoke with was very friendly and helpful She helped me decide that I needed a larger size and I m very glad because when the parka arrived it was the perfect size I love all the pockets It has just enough lining to be warm yet comfortable And best of all it looks great with jeans and other casual clothing The outer shell is also very soft 
Great boot for the price I have purchased several shoes from Nine West and for the price these are very comfortable boots and of good quality I would highly recommend them because they are the kind of boot you can wear all day long The calf of the boot is very generous and the heel height is exquisive for walking in fashion 
great shoe not as pretty as I hoped on my feet but an overall great shoe and fit DO not regret the purchas 
Barely there coverage I m a size 0 2 I ordered a size small if I ordered another pair I would probably get a medium due to dryer shrinkage They fit in every way but they are so revealing I m barely comfortable going outside 
awesome shoes I bought these shoes for my husband I ordered them on a Monday and they were at my house by Wednesday I have owned a pair of real Birks before and these look identical to them My husband loves them and they wre more than half the price of the real ones 
Birkenstock Lover I ordered this item and a pair of mocha nubuck as well I ve been wearing Birks and various varieties of them for years I m always very satisfied with the fit delivery time and the customer service that i receive from Midwest Sports I wear my clogs in all sorts of weather except when there is fresh snow but as soon the walkways and streets are clear I m back in them with thicker socks of course They can be a little stiff at times but once you break them in after a couple weeks of constant wearing you will love them like no other 
amazing little item Well since I will be using this soon I believe it will be just perfect Holds all the necessary items safely so will let you know when I return from my trip 
Comfortable and sweet looking Material was not overly thick and designs were great Look good on my daughter 
Perfect At first I thought i wouldn t like this bra because it has to be pulled over you head to put it on However this is the most comfortable bra I bought and I bought a lot of different kinds This is perfect for engorgement and just plain daily comfort 
Lovely line and versatile wear I ll start with my stats I m a size 8 5 2 and I carry my weight in my rear and thighs all extra 20 pounds of it This skirt is lovely it hides what should never be seen refer to the 20 pounds above and helps create a slimming line I ve worn it with silk blouses stockings and high heels and I ve worn it with slouchy sweaters tights and chunky mary janes it works perfectly with both 
I love these socks I got these socks as a gift at my baby shower I ve looked everywhere trying to find them so I could buy more These socks stay on my little boy s feet and are made very well 
Well made looks good My son really liked this although I recommend that you check sizes exactly as I thought that a size L Big kids would be big but it is just the right size for an 11 or 12 year old 
Love my Clarks I love my Clarks and I can get such good prices through Amazon I have bought two pairs of Clarks with Amazon and I plan on buying more in the future Bett 
1 5 Inch Deluxe Military Fabric Belt by CTM Khaki Navy The product was as advertised and delivered on time 
Very Pretty Shoe These are great shoes The shoes are a medium to baby pink and they re very high style The shoes run true to size The shoes are surprisingly comfortable and I got lots of raves when I wore them to a recent wedding They re great shoes at a good price 
fantabulous I ordered these shoes for my wedding so you can imagine my nervousness I received them within a week and fell in love I ve shown them to my bridal party and my mother and have received nothing but raves Even at the shoe repair where I had no skids put on them and the dress shop where I had a fitting no one could take their eyes off my shoes Order a 1 2 size smaller 
Comfortable easy to wear The shoes are comfortable Easy to wear and feel great with or without socks 
Best Small Wallet This is the best of the small front pocket wallets available Other front pocket wallets have gimmicky designs that don t work well This is designed on the same pattern as a full size wallet only reduced to 4x3 inches Holds three cards bills and ID as well as having a little room under the ID card for business cards Great buy 
Good price very good looking jeans These are so pleasing on the eye What can I say besides the fact that these jeans fit great look great and attract alot of attention Buy them 
Awesome socks There so warm and cozy for those long winter nights and they re good for mountian hikers The keep your feet warm and dry 
Guess Oval TagNecklace is Great I love this Guess oval tag necklace It is just like the Tiffany s oval tag necklace and it has an adorable little rhinestone dangle The best part is the price I only had to spend 18 00 for it and there is also a matching bracelet for only 15 00 I would recommend this to anyone of any age 
Great gift for a golfer My husband thought this was a great shirt as an avid golfer 
Please help end the rubber wristband fad The whole Rubber wristband thing has gotten out of hand do your part to put it to rest by buying regular wristbands When it was all for charities before thats okay but it is ridiculous now heres the rules Livestrong= okay because that was the original Everything else= NO People who wear like 5 of them= Probably the main reason why you d starting wearing the regular ones Plus they re way better and not some cheap piece of rubber that cost 2 cents to make anyways END THE FAD 
Great Comfortable Shoes I love these shoes I bought 3 colors and they are great They are very stylish AND comfortable and that is hard to find in a dress shoe 
Cute and very comfortable I got so many compliments on these shoes the first time I wore them to work They are very pretty and preppy looking I wore them with slacks and a matching cable knit sweater The green is very bright so they don t match everything but it s a standout accessory Wore them without socks and had no blisters 
Good shoe but be careful of delivery dates Sharp set of shoes Comfortable too and they fit well But I believe they were shipped on Cinderella s Coach while the mice were still mice It took FOREVER to arrive so be warned 
sexy and comfy Very nice sandal lookes great with a dress or jeans Low enough to wear for hours at a time but high enough heel to make it look chic 
Nice Fit I liked the shoes they look nice my only concern when I first received them was the quality of the cover leather at the begining it looked like plastic But otherwise they fit perfectly 
Slippers for non slipper wearers My husband refused to wear slippers and it was driving me nuts that he walked barefoot all the time he said he could never find slippers that were comfortable enough Since the Red Sox are his favorite team and the reviews were so good on these particular Reebok slippers I thought it was win win all around so I bought them as part of his Valentine s gifts Needless to say they were a big hit he LOVES them They are comfortable modern looking and the Red Soz logo made his day I would buy these for any sports lover with their favorite team logo on them 
Great pair of comfy slippers I bought these for my husband and he loves them The material is soft and comfortable and they keep his feet warm They are also easier to slip on and off than his previous pair of slippers He wears 11 1 2 wide so I got him the XL pair and they fit him well 
mommybag quick shipping and a great product I am looking forward to using it VERY soon 
Not exactly what I hoped for The shoes are not exactly what I wanted bacause I was trying to get the same shoe that I had purchased some years ago Times change and so does style I searched everywhere and these were the closest to what I wanted The Keds shoes from Amazon which I ordered and received on time might I add were more like what we used to call Bo Bos and the rhyme used to go like this Bo Bos they make your feet feel fine Bo Bos they cost a dollar 99 Bo Bos Don t know who made it up even but that was the rhyme we used to sing I can t explain exactly how the older pair is but there is a slight look and feel of a difference I still like the older ones better Not sure if I ll ever find the same ones again Oh and one last thing if I could give shoe and clothing stores one tip it would be to make adult sizes for the children s items They make some really cool things for kids today Like the Keds Girls Jazzy Sneaker Hope it s not just because I haven t grown up yet 
flesh wound review It is a must have for all monty python and the holy grail fans 
Love this tee shirt Bought this as a gift for my husband who loves the movie He loved it from the minute he saw it Whenever he wears it it seems that someone makes a positive comment about it It is amazing how many fans of the movie there are A great gift for Holy Grail fans 
Did what it was supposed to do My wife used this to get a better fit into her wedding gown In retrospect she wonders if it would ve worked even better if she had worn a traditional strapless bra over the Shape and Size bra 
Nice shoes This was a great purchase and I love keen shoes My only complaint is sweaty feet when it s hot and the shoes don t dry out very quickly 
Sexy and comfy My girlfriend thinks they re sexy and they re solid underwear No swampiness from boxers or boxer briefs If you re a briefs guys I switch around these are the way to go 
Faux fur leopard belt with silver tone buckle This is exactly what I was looking for It s longer and perfect for wearing on your hips Feels nice and soft and belt is not stiff 
Most comfortable unders ever This is by far the most comfortable pair of unders I ve ever worn Over the years I ve gone with boxers and with briefs and in the boxers vs briefs contest both are losers compared to the Contour Thong There s no elastic to chafe the legs yet there is full support The Contour Thong has a Y thong back and you don t need to have the body of an International Male Undergear model to wear these For any guy with an open mind I recommend these just buy one or two pairs and give a try 
swimsuit review I am very happy with the swimsuit Delivery was as stated Fits wonderfully The only problem was once I was wearing it a little of the edge of one of the cups was showing but I tucked it in whenever it was noticeable I was very happy that the suit fit nicely because I was a little worried of having to return for a different size and paying shipping The size I ordered was the size I normally wear and as I said it fit great 
comfortable and affordable great flats Compact and small for those who have too many shoes already The only thing with these shoes are the elastic part starts hurting the back of my my foot but only happens if you wear them for a long period of time 
Comfort with Style This is absolutely one of the most comfortable heels I have in my closet great buy good pric 
Superb Shoe for Running or Day to Day Use The New Balance 991 GL and 991 and 990 before it is an outstanding shoe for running and day to day use even some cross training I have worn this family of shoes because they provide ample support wear well and are well ventilated The 991 GL carries on that tradition Hopefully the 992 will be just as good 
Extraordinarily Comfortable Shoes I am not a runner thus I use the shoes for typical tasks such as shopping errands hanging out etc I have owned many shoes over the years and these are probably 1 of the 2 most comfortable shoes I have ever owned I am hooked on the New Balance line of running shoes 
Good for the price Pros They don t hurt the back of your heels Comfortable like walking with socks on Cons Very thin you can see your toes thru the fabric on the top Bottom line they are a good buy for the price Very cute stylish and comfortable 
Very beautiful lingerie I bought several things from this seller and this was among my favorites My husband loved the way I looked in it I must admit I was not that sure I wanted to buy something like this online mainly because I am extremely picky with the quality of the things I buy and also because I tend to be between sizes But I ordered size 34 and looked perfect on me I am very pleased with this seller The order was shipped promptly and arrived in very good condition 
Great Shoe This shoe is great It even came with an extra pair of shoe strings that had a different design The only thing that I felt it lacked was extra comfort I wear Skechers and have done so for years and I have had other styles that were more comfortable although this was not top comfort it was definitely wearable and did not hurt my feet It was a great deal that I just couldn t pass up and definitely worth the price 
Great shoes The Moondoggies are very comfy and cute as can be Perfect for wearing to the park with the kids but nice enough to veture out in the evening I am buying another pair 
Munsingwear Comfort Pouch Brief Purchase I am totally satisfied with the merchant and the product 
Good price for all the necessities for your iPod Everything you need that your iPod didn t come with at one low price Shipped promptly

For Any Napoleon Dynamite Fan Oh my gosh I was so excited to see this item My 15 year old and all of his buddies are big fans of Napoleon Dynamite and this t shirt is an exact replica of the one worn during the famous election rally dance I will be a hit on Valentine s Day with this gift 
I Love Bowling I was so impressed with this shirt that I had to buy another for my best friend It is for her birthday so I have yet to see her expression But since I thought it was awesome I knew she would love it too We are both on different bowling leagues and so far everyone else got a kick out of it My opinion this is where we should get a good team together and order from CruisinUSA I wouldn t mind being a Gutter Gal so to speak These shirts are AWESOME I give BowlingShirts com 10 stars Bravo 
Darth Vader P J Pants My husband the Star Wars fanatic loves them Very comfy 
Cute but sizing off I bought a couple of these bodysuits because I thought that they were quite amusing The quality seems ok I have not washed them yet so I can t comment on the color fastness the dark blue seems a like it may fade The first thing I noticed was that the bodysuits are very long They are not the stardard length you get with Gerber and Carter s etc The 0 3 mths has the length of a normal 6 9mth bodysuit The chest area is ok but the armholes are a bit small In the bigger sizes the armholes seem normal I have to wait until my son gets here to decide if I will convert the smaller ones into tees This would have gotten 5 stars if the sizing was right Hope this helps future buyers 
Rubber Boots Great item Have already used several times and is exactly as is described 
Super Comfy This is a really soft and very comfortable pillow It is priced great a lot cheaper than similar microbead travel pillows I am very satisfied 
Style and Comfort for a STEAL I couldnt resist these shoes for the price I ve had good experience with Bandolino branded shoes I have two other pairs that are stylish and very comfortable Sure enough this pair of boots are very comfortable too The color is a great burnished bronze that is a great neutral color to wear plus metallics are in fashion again The zip up is easy and the calf is roomy I m very happy with them and would recommend them to anyone who doesn t want to spend 100 s of dollars but wants to get the look and comfort of expensive shoes 
Bandolino Calista Boot Pewter I ordered this boot in a size 7 Pewter Very cute boot and fits perfectly Very comfortable fit and feel Everyone who saw them wanted to know where I got them Simply darling boot 
Awesome sunglasses and great price I have really enjoyed my sunglasses Quick shipment and great price make this a must buy item Would buy from again 
Great for the price These wrestling shoes are an awesome buy for a great price And they were delivered faster than expected 
Perfect for everyday and travel This is my 2nd set of these type of curlers The last ones stayed with me for three years They are so good I stopped using the big home set and use these type daily Heat up fast great lasting curl particularly for hard to curl fine hair and don t even need to leave them in that long Would have given them a 5 but this set has the awful plastic clips that can leave a kink in the curl Recommend getting or using a set of the old fashioned wire clips that come with most non travel sets if you want a smoother curl 
Great I bought this pump in Bonsai color The pump was true to size They are more cute than in the phot 
Lets do it again This was my first time using Amazon and it was great I have bought other things over the net but by far this was the most seamless Lets do it again next time Lawhote 
Aerosoles Boot I purchased these boots hoping they would fit and not hurt my feet I have arthritis in one foot and can hardly wear shoes because of the pain These boots fit very well look great and I can wear them longer than any shoe I have had in the past year I love them 
LOVE these shoes I love these shoes They are so comfy and look good The price is a bit steep I think but considering I could wear them practically every day and not get tired of them I guess they are worth it Definitely considering purchasing another pair in brown 
Not sure if the problem is Amazon or Dance Now I ordered 3 products from Dance Now None of them fit being at least one size too small When I contacted Dance now regarding this issue they told me that these shoes are sized for Women Men need 2 sizes larger in their street shoe size I found no reference to that detail on the Amazon website Dance Now representative told me it is referenced on their own website But Amazon does not make that fact known So now I have 2 orders I have to pay shipping to Dance Now as well as their exhchange cost I am a bit unhappy over this 
nice shoes but VERY small These were nice lightweight budget jazz shoes however they do NOT fit the same as street shoes despite what the description says My daughter wears a 2 5 in street shoes and I ordered her a 4 in the jazz bootie thinking there would be plenty of room for growth WRONG I have to return them and get her at least a 5 or maybe a 5 5 BEWARE 
love these shoes I bought these for my husband and he LOVES them They re well made and super comfortable He liked them so much he bought another pair in a different color Highly recommended 
Comfortable I bought these for my son and he says they are really comfortable he wears them when he plays basketball lots of support and no blisters I ll most likely buy another pair for him 
Great bra I love this bra It is very comfortable and like the other reviewer said adds a whole cup size Cheaper than Victoria s Secret and well made 
It REALLY works BEWARE This bra WILL increase the appearance of your breasts a full cup size or more The only draw back to acquiring this bra is slyly wearing it without family and co workers knowing something s up This bra is made from good materials The cups are thick and smooth and the straps are study and comfortable The liquid is ample but not noisy or lumpy The cup fabric is itchy at first but a handwash in woolite will fix that The only problem I have is that this bra doesn t push the breasts up to the cup I prefer low cut blouses and would feel more confident in a push up design Otherwise it s a truly effective bra to give you non surgical results 
Naughtys are the best these shoes are so cute and sexy High heels makes a girl look so much longer and leaner Beware though if you ve never bought naughtys i would go to a store and try them on first b4 buying online I wear 8 s in EVERYTHING but these i wear 7 5 LOVE THEM 
Great Great Great These socks are absolutely the best I take pilates classes and if it is hot your feet can slip off the mat Not good in the middle of a side plank Anyway these socks keep your feet planted and dry One note make sure not to order them big the idea is that they should be snug 
My 2nd review I wrote a rave review of these the day I got them They were absolutely terrific and gave me purchase doing yoga on a slippery rug However the next time I wore them for a longer session they got stretched out My toes kept falling out of them and they became twisted around my feet and just generally got in the way I put on a new pair for another session and when doing any lunges or poses with my legs in a wide stance they were very uncomfortable Oh well The concept is great but they don t really work unless you re doing very little movement I wish someone would come up with something like this that does the job 
Beach Garden Clog I brought a pair of the Beach Garden Clogs from Cozee World the order was shipped quickly and when I realized the size was wrong they even allowe dme to exchange them for the correct size It was Overall good service thanks 
Beach Clogs I received these today in the mail and am pleased with the way these feel on my feet they are so comfortable and so easy to slide on 
great service price delivery we needed a ruch delivery for our vacation of some quality water shoes with a decent price we were treated superbly our order took less than 3 full days to arrive we will use amazon again to fine deals and service like this 
Beautiful Shoes Great product with speedy delivery The shoes arrived before I expected and were exactly what I wanted Thank you

great deal and great quality The shoes are comfy and of great quality I wasn t sure if I liked the buckle but decided to risk it b c of the great price The buckle is a nice accent and overall I m am very happy with the shoes 
Great Product the shoes were in great shape the shipping speed was fast really satisfie 
great product I love this umbrella It s just the right size and works perfectly It s so pretty that I don t want to get it wet 
Great product great value These were ordered for my son for regular sledding and tubing activities He thinks they are warm and comfortable not stiff like similar snow pants from other manufacturers They are a great value 
SO COMFORTABLE I love these underwear I have not bought them from amazon yet but I plan to I will wear them until Jockey stops making them I have worn these for the past 3 years or so and they are so soft and comfortable Highly recommended 
Well done Good quality product at very reasonable price Postage was quick even though I m in the UK All round good service 
Great but not exactly like the picture It s nice and has yet to fall apart in 10 belly dancing classes The only thing is that every other triangle does not have coins so you are only getting half as many coins as pictured However for the price I would rather that than have it full of coins and falling apart 
To Nice To Live For Now this Military Style Combat Boot is one of a kind It takes a while to break it in but after you will enjoy it It looks so cool just looking at it never mind wearing it its leather is tops And it WILL last a life time Not water proof but great for jungle trekking Shines easy 
Nice suprise I bought this for my wife as a throw in with more expensive items because it was so cheap I actualy forgot I even ordered it until it came in I was pleasantly surprised when she modeled it for me Unlike a lot of stuff it looks exactly like the picture She is a size small and it fit perfect This not something most would wear out however as its insanly short which is great for me The only thing that could improve this piece is a matching thong which is hard to find in lime green so maybe black would be a better choice if your trying to match things up 
what a great swaddle item This is an amazing product I bought one of these along with another swaddle product that did not have the sleepsack feature believe me there is no comparison not only is the Halo product made better and is more durable and holds the baby better but it is a 2 in 1 so that you can use it as a sleepsack by itself too I trust this company because the product is recommended by the SIDS society I don t have to worry that my baby is going to wriggle out of the swaddle because he is so secure in it 
Perfect These shoes are great My daughter tried to talk me into giving them to her Quick Delivery Good Quality 
great quality will use again Great delivery of a quality product and the speedy service is one reason i still use amazon today is b c of sellers and products like this 2 thumbs up 
Awesome Boots Just got them in the mail today As other kenneth cole reaction shoes it runs one size larger I m usually a 12 but I ordered an 11 and they fit just right These boots look great with jeans The color is a bit darker than the one shown in the photograph 
Can You Guess What My Hubby Couldn t Take His Eyes Away From I had the opportunity of wearing these for my husband before I left for the west coast and my annual visit with my friends and our second annual lingerie party My hubby couldn t believe I d wear something like this but boy oh boy he didn t object He couldn t take his eyes off my well you can just imagine what it was he couldn t take his eyes off of 
Great Item I purchased one of these cases for my sister in law and she liked it so much that I bought one for me too I really like it and would recommend it to anyone wanting a great carrying case for their DS Lite The vendor that shipped both of the cases did a great job of a quick shipment of a case that met all expectations I would purchase from them again without hesitation 
great commuter bag This bag is perfect as a commuter bag on my bike The cell phone pocket is very accessible and the bag is large enough to hold a change of clothes but not so large everything gets lost inside 
love them these are so great and keep my baby s feet warm She even slept with them on with no problem She s been a master at getting her socks off up until now They also protect her feet as she is starting to stand and was breaking toenails She s chewing on the toes but I haven t seen any scuff marks yet so they are holding up very well 
the best shoes robeez are the only brand of shoes we even bother to use they are well made and do not come off by accident or when baby tries to get them off we ve tried all of the other generic brands and they all come off but not these its worth it to spend the extra on these shoes and they re so well made they ll last for baby 2 
Love it I love the look Even my friends complement it And the wedges are so LIGHT But you got to stick to your size I couldn t find size 8 5 so I bought size 9 instead which was a big mistake 
Very Cute Swimsuit very cute size as stated 16 = 20 22 Bra did not have enough support for me so I wear a matching sports bra with it and it works very well I love it 
love em i love these shoes they are totally cute the only draw back is they are kinda like satin over paper they aren t as soft as i thought they would be but i great buy none the less 
The cutest thing I just love different and odd things I love to give people gifts that no one else have Thanks 
LIKE THE WASTE BAND I GOT THESE CAUSE I AM PREGNANT AND TRYING TO FIND CLOTHS THAT FIT IS KINDA HARD BUT WITH THESE I DON T HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT HAS ADJUSTABLE SNAPS FOR THE WAST 
Perfect snow boot This item was durable warm the right size as advertised and the right price 
Best I ve Ever Owned I didn t want to pay over 50 for a sports bra but I really wanted a good product and the reviews promised that So I shelled out the dough for one and they were right It fits snug so there s no unwanted bouncing and it also prevents uni boob I ordered a different sports bra from Champion and this is by far my favorite of the two The Champion one pushed my boobs in so much it made that ugly boob bump above the bra line that s visible in light t shirts ew and they re supposed to be the same bra size so go figure More positives this one also fastens securely just start from the bottom and work your way up it will fit and is super super comfortable I do wish the price were less so I could buy a second but I ll have to put that in my budget Nevertheless as a wannabe runner with a large chest it was worth the investment in comfort and security 
Good Overall Pros Ultra Fast delivery w package tracking Item was shipped within a few hours of order Suit is in great condition and I like the color Cons When they say grab bag that means the suit may or may not look like the picture Mine turned out to be a blue stripped jammer which is cool with me cause I actually wanted a blue jammer Just be prepared 
Quick Service Quick service for a shoe that has been discontinued and hard to find in a size 8 black No complaints great service great price 
Delivery time and price fantastic This is the only shoe I wear for High Impact Jazzercise classes four+ times per week I have a wide flat foot and this shoes fit me perfectly And with boot cut jazz pants they look great 
Heelys rule A very cool product it got me a lot of attention on 3 22 07 at the OU student Union At first it was hard to work but now I can even spin I always wear them to my mom s office 
My favorite bluejeans These are hands down my favorite pair of jeans I m 5 5 and they are just the right length to wear with tennis shoes and midheight heels The stretch fabric hugs in all the right places and the cut is slimming 
good one well i bought these shoes after reading the good reviews it had got And i was not to be disappointed They are really awesome They are real comfy and fit perfectly for every sport i play I even wear them to office sometimes Though after wearing them for a long stretch of time i did feel something in my right ankle but it was temporary and maybe that is why i dont want to rate it full 5 star But they are worth every single penny i spent on them If you want to get good shoes which not only feel great but look good too look no furthe 
Extremely soft and comfortable I LOVE my soft and comfortable green robe that I received last year for Mother s Day Whenever I wear it I want to just relax with a magazine or watch TV and then fall asleep in it The matching green slippers complete the feel and I really feel pampered I never knew I could feel SO good wearing a robe especially since I was not really a robe wearer before receiving this wonderful plush robe This is such an excellent product and great gift 
Best Running Shoes EVER I absolutely love these shoes I have a very high arch and I am a hard heel striker Needless to say that finding a comfortable shoe for my difficult feet has been a real chore These shoes have plenty of cushion in the heel and yet also support my arches However I did put an extra arch support insert in did I mention I have really high arches but didn t get the usual crowding effect which was wonderful I ve bought lots of shoes that were supposed to be right for my type of foot but after running in them had to eventually give them away These shoes were honestly perfect right out of the box I ve been walking jogging running in these babies for over a month now with no problems whatsoever I plan on buying several pairs of these before somebody decides to improve them and changes something Boy do I hate it when I finally find a shoe I like and then the company decides to improve it and screw up a really great shoe bitter much gee not me I also received the shoes in less than a week and that is a miracle where I live Good service all around Hope this helps someone else 
It may sound Boring to hear it again This is the absolute best sport bra made I have been running 5 miles or more 5 times a week for over 20 years and once I discovered this particular model I have never switched back The Champion also lasts wash after wash without losing it s shape Unfortunately these great bras never seem to go on sale 
To alter the words of Ben Franklin These shoes are proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy 
Great shoe with an updated look I had been on the look out for a Mary Jane pump that I could wear to work with pants and skirts I finally found this shoe online and decided to give it a try Usually Steve Madden s run big on me so I got a size smaller and surprisingly it was actually too small A half size up did the trick however I love that it comes in patent leather because it really adds a kick to your feet They re also very comfortable for a high heeled shoe My only complaint is that the show is actually very deep on the top and there s quite a bit of toe cleavage I guess this isn t necessarily a bad thing it just didn t look like that at all in the picture Also the strap that goes across the top of the foot is very low and if you have wide feet it could make your feet look even wider or fatter Despite those two small flaws I really like this shoe and find that I can wear it with almost anything they look especially cute with skirts 
Adorable We bought this for our 13 month old for Christmas and she loves it It is extremely soft Her favorite part is the cell phone that rings The compact also squeaks I love that it is all soft so that she cannot hurt herself with it This is a perfect gift for a 1 year old girl 
Very Good Product These are very good quality slippers comfortable well worth the price 
Better Fit Better Shoe These shoes are durable comfortable and most importantly come in different widths Most other athletic shoe manufacturers apprarently don t make anything but D width New Balance does For those of you complaining about width my guess is that if you size your feet correctly that problem will go away I had always worn a 12D width until some gentleman at a mom and pop store sized my feet correctly for the first time in my life I found out I need a 13B You may think you know your feet but you may not As to comfort I can t complain As to durability maybe they are a little stiffer but if that is what extends the life of these shoes over the others that is well worth it in my book 
The Coolest Henley Shirt This is a fabulous find My husband loves henley shirts but they have to be just the right fabric weight and sleeve length After many failed attempts I finally found the perfect shirt Great look great feel and most importantly my husband likes it too 
Nice and Comfortable Nice to put on after a long day of work or after being outside shoveling the snow Do reccomend 
good quality and value Comfortable If elastic waist degrades over time not known yet but has happened to other pajamas there is no back up draw string As with all flannel PJs easily tangles with flannel sheets 
Zipper wallet a great product in great demand The zipper wallet is a product with a practical idea that is long overdue It is a known fact tha all leather wallets stretch resulting in important items such as credit cards and drivers lisence etc slipping out making identity theft a serious possibilty The zipper wallet avoids this from happening Ironicly this item is not available at local stores I encourage everyone to try this product and see for yourself how useful it is in the everyday world Yours Truly Joe Alvare 
very cute for the price I bought a pair of these in tortoise and really love them They fit great they arrived in great condition and very quickly The rhinestones are really blingy in the sun I am buying a pair in black for my best friend who is in love with them also Very cute for the price 
Nice and sexy If you have the body to show for it by all means wear it alone 
Great shoes for toddler I bought these shoes for my 23 month old son We needed something comfortable with a flexible sole but with enough thickness in the sole to stand up outside and provide traction They are excellent shoes and he loves them He won t wear anything else and the shoes receive many compliments 
Smiles All Around We just had our son in January and we couldn t resist these cute little shoes Even though he s only 3 months old we can t wait to see our little guy in them What a well made product 
Beautiful stunning Shoes These shoes are stunning original and over the top beautiful I just can t understand the review regarding the point of the shoe being too pointy Square toe shoes are soooo late 90 s and these shoes are anything but mosquito hunters They have a perfect narrow shape with an interesting mix of fabrics and a PERFECT toe for the current late decade of 2000 Trust me with 117 pairs in my exploding New York closet these have ended up at the front I m picking up the black ones as I m writing this Enjoy them I know you as well as your better half will 
Fairly Vibrant Good color visibility nicely structured with warmth applicable to the unspeakable and inhuman frigidites of the amerikan North The hat fits snugly and will evoke a positive commentary now and again I have ordered Maroon but will likely add some other color choice as the array is rather impressive For an 100 acrylic knit this is not a bad hat the only problem perhaps being that it sucks up hairs very easily almost as if it were a hair vacuum machine 
The best They shipped these almost overnight My daughter was a perfect little flower girl No trips no blisters and they ve held up great over the past 9 10 months with great durability for dance and lots of play She was a size 10 at the time of the wedding but the shoes were a 9 Her feet were fine She can still squeeze into them now and she s an 11 Very pleased Good value These are the exact shoes 
Jansport FTW Now I m a pretty picky guy when it comes to certain things in life and one of those items just happens to be Backpacks I spent about two months searching for a new one until I finally came across this particular model I ll start with by saying that I love this damn thing It has plenty of space a whole bunch of extra cords that I suppose a hiker would use but I think just look nice and its very durable which is a must for me since everything I own will take a beating I m telling you straight from the horse s mouth this Backpack is worth the money Now if it only came as an 18 slot 
love it It is exactly what I was looking for I had no problems ordering or receiving it I got to my house quickly Nothing is wrong with it 
Soft but small The PJ bottoms were soft and of good quality material However I ordered the extra large and they were very small for that size It seemed as though the XL was more a Med Large I would also think that lounge pants or PJ bottoms would be a bit bigger as you wouldn t want these types of pants too tight They were a gift so I just hope they don t shrink after washing 
Sweet Gloves The Best These are the best windproof liner gloves out there I freaked out thinking they had discontinued them because I thought they were made of Gore Windstopper and couldn t find any that said made with Gore Windstopper but actually it s Polarguard Windbloc In any case when you freak out becuase you think you might not be able to get something again you realize just how much you like that thing These are totally windproof Extremely compact I don t think you can make them any thinner than this Good price The only downside is that they take a long time to dry out when they get wet This is true of any windproof glove so it s really not fair to call it a down side of this particular glove These weigh nothing probably about an ounce each and so I pack two or three pairs if I know I ll be getting them wet I wear these ice climbing hiking mountaineering I have a pair I cut the finger tips off of for rock climbing in winter and I wear them skiing inside of my mittens These really shine inside of mittens because if you have to do anything with your hands the mitten must come off and these completely protect your hands from the wind during that time I haven t had cold hands skiing for two seasons now a problem that plagued me for years I can t recommend these enough Scott 
Great This is such a wonderful pair of gloves They are light and easily portable They can be folded and stored in one s pockets They have features that enable use of one s index fingers and thumbs for fine operations such as turning minute knobs The synthetic materials comprising these gloves also make them very protective against harsh weather especially wind and rain I am now able to run outside in icy wind despite the fact that my hands freeze more easily than anyone s elses 
SEXXXXXXXXXXY These are hot Hot HOT Will be buying them in other colors My guy went NUTS 
good The product is in good condition when it was shipped The quality is good Thank you 
Great value I bought these for my husband He went riding in 45ish degree weather and his hands stayed warm He was very happy with them and I will be buying a pair for myself 
Luxurious I purchased this robe for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift And I wish I would have purchased one for myself as well This robe is made of the softest warmest materials but is extremely light weight unlike most robes Luxurious is the perfect adjective 
like wearing your slippers to work These boots are warm and comfortable like my sheepskin slippers My feet are toasty even when it s freezing outside They have a thicker sole than some other styles which makes this boot great for walking in snow and ice I love the warm brown of the chestnut They look great At 50 off the price was great too 
too wide for ladies if your feet are narrow I did order half size up because of other reviews and the length is perfect However the unisex width is way too wide for me I have a pair of Ugg men s Ultimate and they are not as wide Overall I still think Uggs are a little better and more comfortable 
It s a miracle an attractive sneaker Most sneakers these days come in two varieties they re huge athletic clod hoppers for teenieboppers or they re white keds or orthotic shoes for old ladies This sneaker is the best compromise on the market today It s youthful without being for the young Light weight low profile wide enough for a thick sock and it ll get you compliments everywhere you go My first pair is in black and wow they are stylish Today I wore them out shopping and my back started hurting before my feet did My one objection is this supposedly squishy foot bed I don t know if my shoes were missing that part or what but I found the sole to be hard and inflexible They were still _comfortable_ but it wasn t like putting your feet on pillows or anything If you do prefer a squishier footbed I recommend a thin insert so as not to squish your toes I m not sure if they would perform well for athletics I m going to be saving mine for errands and casual nights out but I want these in every color 
sunglasses are great customer service even better the only thing better than these sunglasses is the customer service i got after i dropped and broke the lenses on these i called 80 s Purple and they actually sent me out a replacement free of charge i was blown away 
Excellent product This was just what I was looking for and couldn t find in local retail stores Fits perfectly in my wallet and now my credit cards don t fall on the ground in stores Reasonable price also Excellent product 
Better than barefoot I have to tell anyone who has lower back or foot pain to try a pair of Merrells When you try them on they feel comfortable but once you wear them for a week you ll never wear another brand of footwear unless you have to Most of their shoes need no break in time I own these in four different colors My eldest daughter owns two pairs of these I own more than 20 pairs of Merrells I have been wearing these for years The cool thing about them is when you see someone else wearing a pair it s like you re both in on a secret You know you re walking in heaven 
I WEAR THEM DAILY FOR WORK and they are very comfortable Quality seems to be better than the last Unlisted shoe I purchased elsewhere Haven t polished them yet so I can t say anything about that 
Excellent Quality Price and Delivery This merchant really delivers with this item In the stores this is almost twice the price I really wasn t expecting such quality from this item Yes it s Crushed Velvet so not warm but warm wasn t the goal Would definitely recommend this item and may buy another color for myself 
Comfy Halloween Cloak At first I had my heart set on a different cloak but when it was no longer available I decided to go with this one I am very pleased that I was not disappointed This cloak looks and feels beautiful It has a nice button closure at the neck and for those that are petite it is floor length This cloak is just what I was looking for to add a last minute touch to my Halloween costume It is very comfortable and soft no itchy feel here 
very cute but kind of painful I bought these in black and got a ton of compliments as soon as i started wearing them however I recommend you wear these with sheer stockings or something because they gave me a blister the size of Mt Everest ouch 
Very cute item This item arrived on time and the quality was great This bodysuit makes a great gift idea for baby it s just how I expected it would be 
Pretty I got this shirt when it was on sale for 10 so I snatched it up quickly I like the shirt a lot It is very pretty on Order the size that you normally wear I made the mistake of ordering a large instead of a Medium The shirt is way to big So maybe even order a size smaller because it is just a bigger shirt 
Very comfortable bra This is a great bra for any mother that is looking for a nursing bra I live in the US and had a terrible time finding this bra in any store or anywhere on line It s a fabulous bra It s very comfortable washed up nicely and provides great support This is our second child and I wish I had these with the first 
Awesome Belt This belt is seriously great I ordered it and it arrived 3 days later exactly as the seller described I m not sure what the previous review was all about but my belt is great I love how I can use interchangeable buckles with it 
Try em and you ll love em These are my single favorite pair of underwear Not your typical jock but much more comfortable and stylish I m in the military so at first I thought thongs are not for real men but after wearing these I found they are and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize I wear these for every day activivties sports work and leisure There isn t much fabric so they re great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy After wearing them for a while it s like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it If you ve never owned a thong I think you should give these a shot I definately recomend the 2xist Y back thong 
Defenitely not Prada I Just want to make something clear the windbreaker is NOT Prada the tag reads MIU MIU a very good brand but definetely not Prada I found out it looks better when it is layered with a dark jacket I layered it with a black Yohi Yamamoto jacket and it looked just perfect 
Warm Hoodie Got this for my teen as an alternative to a bathrobe She loves it nice warm pretty pink color They run small she usually takes a medium got her a large She could have used an XL Sleeves are a bit short She likes the look the zip front 
Iman s Review These are some very nice shoes I love the blue and black ones These really should get some more publicity because the are better than all other basketball shoes They are also very comfortable If you want to get some high quality shoes for a good price get T Macs 
Soft and Comfy I have been searching for the perfect ped sock not too thick not so thin it slides off your heel and most importantly COTTON My search is over This is by far the best sock ever Great with sneakers AND closed in shoes 
Wedgie Yes beautiful people I too own this shoe and it is fun and sexy I didn t think at my age I could wear such a high wedge heel however I was wrong and thankful to be so This is a fun shoe which looks great on I have it in the gold and I love wearing them out and about 
3 Pack Apron Great price aprons are perfect for my mom She just recently suffered a stroke and I needed inexpensive aprons to easily put over her head for when she eats that look nice and does the job The Company sent them out right away would order again Just wish they had more colors and designs to choose from I order two packages with 3 in each package 
Wonderbra Extravagance III bra I love this bra just the right amount of support Order arrived 4 days before expected woo hoo 
Excellent work out shirt I like adidas brand and this is a great shirt for working out or whatever It is comfortable and well worth it 
Marathon Runner Who Won t Use Another Shoe To echo another reviewer I am a heavy runner with high semi flexible arches and a neutral stride running 20 35 miles per week Even though my strides are consistent in terms of length pronation and heal to toe gait I tend to have very heavy footfalls being a former sprinter with muscular legs and need a well cushioned shoe I am training for the Boston Marathon and have tried Asics Gel Kayanos the shoe designed for the clydesdale type runner a pair of Adidas Adistars the newest model is a very good shoe but didn t fit my wider foot properly and some various pairs of New Balance least favorites of the bunch but the Mizuno Wave 7 s are by far the most natural feeling durable light weight cushioned without being bulky shoe I have ever owned I have now owned two of the Wave Creation 7 s and a pair of the older Wave Creation 6 s and put a lot of miles on these shoes they consistently hold up mile after mile better than any of the other shoes out there The Gel Kayanos are the only shoe remotely comparable but I found that they break down far to fast for distance running and they are slightly heavy That and the Mizuno s were comfortable from the first step and did not require any breaking which is very rare I am confident I could switch to a new pair a week before a marathon and hardly notice a difference I would not only highly recommend this shoe to anyone with medium to heavy footfalls and a high arch but I endorse it as the only shoe I will buy as long as the line continues 
Truly an Excellent Bra This is an excellent bra In addition to being sexy it is also quite functional It defines one s individual breast shape well and it offers maximum support This particular bra comes in a pretty peach color and a beautiful black Chantelle bras are made according to French standards You get a somewhat larger cup and the band size is not as long Still it s an excellent bra 
awesome fit For years I wore Asics The GT the Cumulus the Nimbus But I have to say if you re fan of any Asics shoes named after clouds you should try the Trigon 4 Very similar but cheaper Also they did not joke when they called it the Ride It has a very smooth transition and insane cushion but a little more support than Asics for those who are neutral gait yet a tad wanting in stabilization without all the weight A big thumbs toes up 
A wonderful dress shoe I have had a pair of these for several years they were an incredibly lucky find They re extremely comfortable better than many pairs of sneakers I ve tried on They ve worn very well and I d say they re well made I ve only had to replace the shoelaces once A bit of polish some Kiwi leather cleaner and protector for water and they re perfect Trust me you can walk for miles in them and they look great I think A great purchase If you re looking for a pair of dress shoes and nervous about buying them without trying them on well my feet love them Don t know how far that will carry yours but there s my two cents Excellent 
homecoming out fit I was very very pleased with the sailor outfit that included a very nicely made hat It fit perfectly and was ahit with Mom and Dad upon seeing him at the airport on their arrival home from being deployed for 6 months I found this same outfit about 25 00 more on other sites and so you can t do better on this buy 
Good start This is a well made rugged coat Sort of a North Face Mountain Hardware coat for the farm ranch Not a summer coat too heavy The next model needs to have pit zips 
A+++++++++++++++++ I have several jackets They are well made warm and I wouldn t wear any other Long lasting and look good with anything 
Precious These shoes are adorable and perfect for summer I love mine The only negative thing is that they are wide I have normal size feet and ordered my regular shoe size They fit length wise but are very spacey width wise 
Exquisite These boxers are much nicer than the photos suggest I was pleasantly surprised I was trying to replace a pair I had accidentally washed in the washing machine a no no with this fabric Turns out the replacements were twice the quality of what I had originally purchased I will probably be purchasing more Your wife will thank you for buying these Excellent quality and softer than satin My only complaint is that the fly tends to fall open sometimes because it s made without a fastener The idea is for a sleeker feel but it sacrifices security Love em anyway 
Great Item This is really a great item very comfortable I would have no problem wearing them for more than girlfriend if the opening was not so loose Great for the intended purpose though 
Minimzer is correct Minimzer is correct I bought this bra in a 38DDD and it made me look more like a D or DD It lifted and minim1zed my breasts My only complaint is that the cup was rounded but the lining made a barely noticeable point If you want your breasts to appear one or two sizes smaller then this is the bra for you 
The Best Invention since a Blow Dryer These are the coolest things ever made I have been searching for a product like this forever and I could only find what used to be called quot lingerie helpers quot from the 50 s or 60 s I think which didn t quite do the job No more buying those quot speciality quot bras that cost a bundle or those racerbacks that didn t quite fit right I just put these on my favorite bra and don t even know it is there Now there is no excuse for me to ever see anyones bright pink bra straps peeking out from their shirts I am just jealous that the woman who invented it is going to make millions and I am not 
About what I expected These are lightweight cotton thermals at a good price I wear a Large in most shirts and the Large size for these fits snug especially after a wash which is how I like it for wearing as an undershirt If you re buying for outerwear you might consider going a size larger Shipping wasn t Amazon Quick but it was reasonable about a week if I remember right 
Sheila J Kaufman Slipper lover The slippers are great comfortable and good quality Just like the pair I purchased in Lake George a few years ago Buying them online was so convenient 
Beautiful although size runs big I absolutely love this suit my only downfall is it runs big so order one size down 
Hanky Panky Camisole Very comfortable and sexy Hanky Panky is the standard in comfortable lace 
As advertised This suit is exactly what I ordered small enough for training racing but not as small as a traditional Speedo suit 
Size I got it on size 32 because I usually get my pants on size 32 The bathing suit was too tight I ll get in on size 34 next time 
Great feeling boxers I do roofing work work outside on the hotest days I had problems with heat rash jock itch My boss suggested I wear loose fitting all cotton boxers like most of the crew I asked around picked up some HANES all cotton boxes WOW what a difference they feel great No binding when I work the cotton does give a bit as you wear them Now they are the only underwear I will wear They do shrink a bit after washing so do get a size up 
KOBE IS KING THIS WAS AT 1OTH BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY SON WE ARE CALIFORNIA TRANSPLANTS LIVING IN TEXAS AND NO ONE HERE AT THE TIME HAD ANY IDEA THAT KOBE HAD EVEN CHANGED HIS NUMBER FROM 8 TO 24 IT WAS A NIGHTMARE AND A LOT OF DRIVING AROUND TRYING TO FIND KB S 24 I FOUND IT ON YOUR SITE AND THE PRODUCT WAS JUST WHAT I EXPECTED NO SURPRISES MY SON LOVES IT 
Accessory pack for mp3 player A great bargain Saved 50 over buying separately Good quality Very satified 
very comfortable These boots are a little bit on the snowboarder side of things as far as the way they look The fit is right on and they are very warm and dry i love them They are very easy to just pull on and tuck your jeans into Highly recommended 
Looks good does the job and is inexpensive I only use the protective case skin not the armband or belt clip I primarily wanted protection for the screen which this provides The screen protector and skin fit perfectly and were easy to apply I can easily access all ports and manipulate all controls with them applied installed I have not used the armband but it looks pretty sturdy I paid 18 90 for this item including 5 95 shipping 
Very warm comfortable I bought a pair for my wife and she told me how warm her feet were while wearing them so I decided to buy a pair for myself I wear them without socks as they are so warm and comfortable i think wearing socks w these shoes would get a little too warm for my feet 
Happy Feet My new Shoe Wallet is even better than I expected It securely fastens to my running shoe holds my key emergency cash and identification and most importantly serves as a safe place for my iPod Sport Sensor Best of all my iPod works efficiently and accurately in the Shoe Wallet without my purchasing Nike branded shoes I m a very happy consumer 
Quality Bag This is a fine leather bag beautiful comfortable I bought on the mfr website and saved the shipping Its a wonderful product of quality and craftsmanship A must have 
I felt like Jackie O all day Everyone loved me in these glasses for our Old Fashioned Banquet They completed my outfit great price and a speedy delivery which I really needed 
WHOA HOT HOT HOT GOT THIS FOR MY WIFE WELL REALLY FOR ME AND BOY OH BOY DID I ENJOY SEEING HER WALK AROUND THE HOUSE IN THIS ALL WEEKEND THANKS AMAZON 
Good value Very comfortable and durable I would wear these outside although not for a long walk but the sole is durable enough for walking to the mailbox or taking the dog for a brief jaunt I recommend these if you are looking for an inexpensive and durable slipper 
Great slipper I received these slippers for Christmas in December 2005 I got the Pine green a very nice looking slipper with lots of comfort I am ordering another pair in Charcoal as I want 2 pairs to have at both places I live It s all about comfort for me when I am home so these fit the bill Good value as well 
LOVE THESE THESE ARE THE SOFTEST MOST COMFORTABLE FLIPS FLOPS I HAVE FOUND IN YEARS YOU CAN T BEAT THE PRICE EITHER 
Nice and tough Our son love this pair of shoes he wears it to church or just to a party He said that they are nice and comfy he can run with them because the have rubber soles WE think that they are elegant as well WE give 5 stars for them Very Good 
Product was great Service was terrible We ordered this product and paid for expedited shipping 8 days later it had not arrived Their explanation was that it was 2 day shipping from the day of shipping but it still took 3 days to get around to shipping The backpack missed the giftee and it had to be shipped again to catch up to her 
Great shoes I buy these shoes in bulk as they are so good I have high arches and these shoes are the only ones that have never given me any trouble I am now on my 3rd pair and use them for my marathon training and running 
Awesome belt especially for people with a short midriff My first pregnancy I tried several styles of belts most of which had a wide band in back I am short have a short midriff and am overweight so wider belts would roll from the top down I never had that problem with this belt Unfortunately this pregnancy I am entering my 3rd trimester and have finally out grown the 1X belt and the store I purchased it from is now closed I was thrilled when I found this on Amazon com in a larger size I recommend making it little snug in the mornings and then loosening it throughout the day as needed The most appealing feature for me is that this band is completely adjustable to give you the support you need for the different activities you will be doing throughout the day Any time you start needing the extra support just slightly tighten the side straps When you start relaxing or if the belt starts feeling a little tight just loosen it up a bit It s quick and easy to work with and if one side needs more support than the other just make that one side a bit more snug It s AWESOME I am a technology education specialist so I m on my feet for many times 16 hrs a day training and supporting hospitals with their new computer programs I couldn t have survived even my First Trimester without this belt I raise it a little higher in the back so that I have complete lower back support and belly support There were days when I forgot to wear my belt that I almost couldn t walk after only 4 hrs of work due to lower back pain that would eventually extend down to my fanny and legs My legs would litterally give out from underneath me until I could rub and relax my lower back for a while When you are working with doctors in the surgery room or doing rounds with them this is NOT a good thing As long as I wore my belt I NEVER had a problem I strongly recommend this product 
Best nursing bra I ve tried I ve been pregnant or nursing for most of the last 4 years and I ve tried a LOT of different nursing bras I got this one several months ago and absolutely love it I ve been reasonably happy with the Bravado line in general they hold up very very well stay comfortable and remain supportive over time but I just wasn t fond of the sports bra styling of their original one I am often between bra sizes between 34 and 36 between B and C cups depending on the maker and due to a habit of nursing more on the right side than the left often have one breast larger than the other The 36C fits me very comfortably with no noticeable bunching lines or that nasty spillover when it s been too long between feedings I wear fairly fitted cotten shirts just about every day of the year so it s really important to me to have a bra that fits smoothly The only other nursing bra that I ve found that works as well under t shirts is a Mimi brand one that it costs just about as much but doesn t hold its shape for very long Basically this is a comfortable bra that is easy to use and will last 
Bikini Briefs Although I prefer Jockey these Hanes Bikini Briefs are great and I plan to order more Great value I also bought Fruit of the Loom but in my opinion the Hanes have a much nicer fuller cut The Fruit of the Loom are for youngsters with tiny butts The reason I didn t buy Jockey is they re too expensive 
great shoes Im in the military and run quite abit about 20 miles or more a week Ive had these shoes for a while now and I have to say they are the best Ive ever had as far as comfort and durabilty My current pair is about worn out and I plan to purchase a new pair of the sam 
Good buy I purchased this bag to take on a tour of Greece and was pretty happy with it I loved the size not to big and not too small and also the flatness of it It was very lightweight and the compartements are easily accessible The only problem i had with it is that when you wear it as intended accross your body the strap tends to rub at the neck so I had to keep adjusting it every five minutes Overall it was pretty good though 
one sturdy garment I have owned and worn this for several months now and it is very durable AND warm as well I would just be cautious about the unisex sizing as I am a Medium sized person 10 12 and it does seem to be a little large yet I wear it anyways Hopefully subsequent washings will tone it down in size 
A little dated but works well for kids and adults Every time I wear this tie it always strikes up a good conversation of the way things were and when cartoons were cartoons Also working in a place with a lot of kids they tend to be more at ease when they see me with this on I ve had this tie for 3 years now high quality and does not stain really easy at least for me great quality Only downfall a little dated with a 32 cent stamp Kids don t notice and neither do most adults Worth picking up great price 
Classic boots These boots look good with everything from jeans to skirts Because they are real leather I was expecting to have to break them in before they were comfortable but it only took a few wearings before I could wear them all day with a lot of walking and no sore feet Didn t have any problem with them fitting my calves I had that problem with other boots I have tried before Even if you don t consider the great price for all leather boots they are wonderful buy 
Good Boots The boot is beautiful but because my feet are wide they are uncomfortable to break in The price is reasonable Hope to wear soon 
good for the money awesome handling while balling on this shoe Great grip on the court and I especially like the pump on the shoe that you press to fit the shoe to how you want it on your feet 
great fit Great fit lightweight These are very snug and allow for maximum mobility for quicker players who do a lot of cutting and fast movement Support strap is not too tight which is good and actually serves a purpose 
Excellent Let me assure anyone who is even remotely thinking of buying these shoes DO IT They are not only beautiful but as high as they are they are extremely comfortable The detail is way more beautiful in person as they are on the website My favorite shoe of the summer 
good socks good price These socks are just what I was looking for a thin cotton blend to wear running No bunching and they breath very well The price and timliness of the order was also great 
Great running shoes I d been shopping for a pair of running shoes and have tried on various brands These shoes surpassed others in fit support and comfort I m so glad Kayano comes in wide sizes because it fits my feet PERFECTLY I highly recommend 
Munsingwear Briefs Have always been pleased with this manufactures product The company I purchased from was fair priced and very efficient 
comfort is key Munsingwear is definitely the most comfortable best fitting men s brief I have ever worn 
Great summer shoes These were really easy for my little girl to put on herself They were well make and very light weight I like the ridges in the surface and hope they will help keep her feet dry and prevent the shoes from getting super stinky 
Surprisingly well constructed I picked this sucker up for 30 from Fred Meyer after they made it clear that they had no other options available for charging my iPod from my computer I was on vacation with no cord and a dead battery I was only expecting it to last throughout the vacation but I ve been using it ever since I keep the car charger in my car with no extra cables to burden it and I keep the wall charger plugged into the wall The cable retracts easily with a design much like that of a window blind pull until you let go where it locks and then pull a bit more and let go to release It s a small unobtrusive and incredibly convenient device for your iPod and at this price it s a steal You d pay two or three times this at some electronics stores for the wall charger or car charger alone let alone one that is so solidly constructed No question if you own an iPod purchase this product I was impressed enough to come and write this review perhaps you will be too 
Speedo suit review I really like the Speedo suit I wear two swim suits the Speedo and a larger drag suit over it I ve done this since my days on the swim team The chlorine in the water tends to weaken the seams on my suit over time causing the drag suit to self destruct eventually Having the Speedo prevents any embarrassing moments The fit and material is good and it holds up very well this is the first replacement I ve needed in years If you are husky this might be a tight fit I wear a 42 44 pant size and this is on the snug side 
Great Blazer Well constructed blazer Great color You can wear with jeans or shirt and tie for church 
Can t go wrong with Gerber LOVE LOVE LOVE Gerber products and these are no exception Great quality and they are so soft The only thing is that the 0 3mths are a little small so you may want to consider starting with the 3 6 
A great shoe if you can find a pair that fits you When I saw in a magazine that Croc was making a style of their shoes that was NOT UGLY I literally went the same day to Dillard s to get a pair for myself They are unbelievably comfortable it feels like you re standing on clouds The Amazon listing doesn t show all the colors that they come in light pink silver gold celery lavender light blue white black and fuschia All the colors are really adorable and I had a hard time deciding I have also had issues with sizing just as other reviewers have had I usually wear a 7 5 Wide in women s shoes but when I tried on the Primas in an 8 they were ridiculously big and when i tried them on in a 7 they were a tad too snug I really wish they made half sizes I ended up buying the 7 even though it was a little small but I read about a great trick to help mold the shoes to my feet that works like a charm throw them in the clothes dyer for two minutes on medium heat then pull them out and while they are toasty warm immediately put them on your feet and wear them for about a half hour and voila they will now fit perfectly Grade A 
Good but specifically for 700W Overall I m happy with the skin It fits the Treo 700 very closely This was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it The 700w and p if you don t know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen The button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p Not a huge deal just a slight annoyance I m going to see if there s a way to remove these somehow 
Walking Shoes Great service The shoes were just what I wanted I highly recommend these walking shoes because they are light weight and comfortable 
Pure Beauty This set is guaranteed to make your partner stop and take notice Plus you will enjoy wearing this silky sensuous set to liven up your evening The fit is fantastic Not much is left to the imagination 
Hey it s a flippin cord Plugged into Ipod and guess what Audio and video came out the other end A little spendy but what can ya do 
GORGEOUS boots These boots are GORGEOUS I got such an awesome deal on these boots I searched online for about an hour to find another website that has a picture of them I ll put one up here They re comfy rich leather well made I ve always wanted Frye boots 
The Comfort of Frye These are by far the most comfortable boots I have ever owned I am a huge fan of Dansko clogs and these Frye boots are just as comfortable and sturdy They run a bit on the large side about a half size difference You will love them 
Lovely shoes just a little narrow I just got these and love them My only complaint is that they pinch are a little narrow even though I don t have wide feet or regularly wear wide shoes The dark red color is a little deeper than the picture but that is a good thing if you want to wear these in both winter and summer If you re gonna buy red shoes or any other colors available these are a great choice 
SKy Blue Sox The socks were nice but cost too much Price a little unreasonable 
Excellent Calvin Klein provides a fashionable comfortable underwear Tight but not too tight it holds you in place while not constricting you to a tight position Excellent but don t buy them too little 
Comfortable stylish These trunks are great The pouch in the front works great in keeping everything together and comfortable I drive alot and these are by far the best underwear I have ever had Just be sure to order one size larger than you usually wear otherwise they will be skin tight unless you want that 
Really easy to put on and lightweight Doesn t fog my glasses This mask attached using some Velcro in the rear I love it because it can be removed or put on without taking off my helmet At first I had some problems with my glasses fogging up what I did was just pull it extra tight until the material was very snug with my cheeks This drastically reduced fogging I read on another products review that using some medical tape below the eyes would eliminate fogging on a similar product Overall this has been a great buy Nic 
Love It This bra fits very well I found it fit very true to size and offers great support I d much rather pay this price than the outrageous prices I ve paid for sports bras in the past that have offered no where near the support It has held up well while jogging 
Pay less for a great product Very smooth transaction and timely delivery First time on line shoe buyer I tried those cute shoes on at a local shoe store and loved them but was not willing to pay high price for them I saved about 35 by purchasing here 
Best sports bra I ve ever had This is the best sports bra I ve ever had I show dogs for a hobby and was always aware that as I gaited the dog around the ring I was bouncing Now no more bounce and extreme comfort I ve had the bras for over 6 months now and they ve held up well Everyone that I ve recommended the bra to has had similar experiences 
A must have for every breastfeeding mom This is a product that every breastfeeding mother needs to know about Finally a solution to leaking and a way to sleep without wearing a bra I ve been using lilypadz for about a month now and I must say that I LOVE them When I started breastfeeding my daughter I was using the traditional round cotton pads that you have to put inside your bra to soak up leaks I hated them because they look terrible under a snug fitting shirt they don t always absorb all the liquid and they can shift out of position leaving you with no protection at all I assumed it was just a necessary evil to breastfeeding because I didn t know something as wonderful as lilypadz existed I have to admit when I first saw them advertised I was skeptical I didn t think they would stick I didn t think they would stay in place and I thought for sure if they did stick that it would hurt to take them off or they d leave a tacky residue on my breast I hestitated for a couple of weeks wanting to try them but afraid that I d spend all that money and end up disappointed It was one morning after waking up soaked because one of my cotton pads slipped during the night I decided I would risk it and order them When they arrived I read all the instructions and was ready to try them out Now this is the embarrassing part in the instructions it specifically says to take them off the plastic dome before using For some reason I thought they meant take them out of the plastic container I didn t realize that EACH lilypad was also stuck on a piece of plastic When I first tried to put them on I actually tried flipping the entire pad and the plastic dome inside out yes it was tough to do too I was frustrated because they obviously didn t stick I began to think that my fear of them not working was true Once I realized my stupid mistake I peeled them off the plastic and tried again They stuck perfectly Try and avoid having the problem I did make sure you peel each of them off their little plastic domes I was immediately surprised at how secure they felt I knew right away that I would be able to wear them to bed and not have to worry about one falling off My next fear was removing them I carefully lifted up an edge and peeled one off I was surprised that even though they stuck securely they peeled off with ease and without causing pain to my tender breasts I was estatic What a great product I have found after using them for about a month that there are pros and cons However the pros greatly outweigh the cons This is what I have found PROS 1 Attaches securely 2 Removes with VERY little or no pain 3 No residue left behind on the breast Baby can eat as soon as a pad is removed 4 Protects tender breasts from rubbing against clothing or sticking to cotton pads If you are feeling sore these are a HUGE help 5 Secure enough to stay on all night long without wearing a bra 6 Washable and reusable 7 Invisible under snug fitting shirts 8 When properly applied you will not leak 9 Peace of mind 10 Quick drying After cleaning them give them a good shake and you are ready to reapply them even if they are a bit damp still No need to buy more than one pair unless you need the peace of mind of a back up One pair will work and will always be ready to use CONS 1 If not properly applied you might leak You must be careful to avoid air bubbles and make sure you apply strong pressure to the nipple when putting them on However even if you leak it won t get on your clothes Instead it pools up around the nipple It usually stays sealed You just have to be sure to remove the pad drain the liquid rinse them and then reapply properly One warning if you have an air bubble and you leak A LOT it is possible for the pad to loosen and pop off spilling milk on you This has only happened to me maybe twice after a long night of leaking while sleeping I leaked during the night woke up and was feeding the baby from one side without checking to see if I had leaked on the other My milk let down filling the air bubble more and the pad popped off drenching me 2 If you own cats dogs keep them AWAY from the pads when you aren t wearing them They attract fur like crazy If they do get furry its OK because it does wash off Its just a pain in the butt and takes a little extra effort 3 Takes a little more effort to reapply the pad in public vs shoving a cotton pad back in your bra but once you get the hang of it it woudn t even make the con list anymore 4 I personally don t wear them every day I m one of those types that thinks skin should have a chance to breathe a little I DO wear them every night but during the day I ll occasionally wear my cotton pads so my skin can breathe I m afraid that I ll end up with thrush or just pruney nipples if I wore them 24 7 I have no evidence to back up the claim they may work just fine 24 7 I d say I wear them 3 4 times a week during the day I will NOT go a night without wearing them though because I hate wearing a bra to bed As you can see the pros outweigh the cons by quite a bit The cons shouldn t be enough to keep you from trying them yourself Even if you plan on wearing them only at night they are well worth the cost If you are like me and you are skeptical don t be These really do work and you will be glad that you gave them a try Every breastfeeding mother should own a pair and I think they would make a WONDERFUL and unique baby shower gift 
Best product ever invented I regained my sanity after getting these Sooooo much nicer than disposables 
Stop the drool from soaking through Ditto I bought more of these Love the bibs with vinyl backings and absorbant terry fronts really stops the soakings that happen with little ones who are teething I bought these for a very low price that couldn t be beat Nice quality 
Awesome bag This is truly a beautiful bag I got the classic dark leather which is exactly the rich brown shown in the pictures The leather has a wonderful grain that adds to the bag s character The leather is thicker than I expected while it is by no means stiff it is not ultra soft ultra thin butter leather This is leather that will age well and last for many many years The zippers are matte silver metal so not only do they look great against the brown leather they ll be durable The other hardware is the same type of matte antiqued silver The bag is lined with a heavy khaki twill that is just a shade or two lighter than the strap The cotton strap not only adds to the bag s uniqueness it also keeps the bag from sliding when you bend over I wear it across my chest like a messenger bag Inside there are two small pockets on the divider separating the two sections of the bag One is gusseted and works well for a cell phone or items of a similar size and the other is suitable only for small flat items such as business cards I would have really liked for my iPod to snuggle in that second pocket but something that thick won t fit The internal sections of the bag are large enough to hold a notebook file or book but the bag is smaller than most of the other messenger bags I ve tried because they were sized for laptops I actually use it as a purse and it has plenty of room for all of my junk and the ubiquitous book On the outside each end of the bag has a pocket that has a vertical row of stitching bisecting it This creates 2 tall thin pockets where I keep pens it would have been nice if one side didn t have that row of stitching so that it could hold larger items but that s not a problem for me The entire back side of the bag is another zippered pocket On the front flap is a small zippered pocket that turns out to be a good home for a cell phone because you can get to it quickly without going into the bag The magnetic closure on the flap is sufficiently strong There are 2 magnets in the body of the bag and in the flap there is a metal bar running the width of the flap so you don t have to worry about lining up magnets to close the bag I ve had the bag only a few days and have already received compliments Though the bag is pricey it is obviously crafted with care from high quality materials It also has a very distinctive look I am very happy with this purchase and have already added another Diongini bag to my Amazon Wish List 
Prompt Service I received the earmuffs I ordered 3 days after I placed the order

Pink Camo Can t find her I bought this for my daughter She is into pink and camo Anyway it is a quality product and the daughter just loves it What more is there to say 
Polyprop LongJohns Tops and bottoms are very comfortable and able to keep me comfortably warm at +30F to +40F with regular Dockers and long sleeve cotton polyester shirt They are lighter and less bulky than their all cotton longjohn cousins designed for similar temperatures They also dry much more quickly As with all longjohns I have found on the market in the past forty plus years the tops are too short for anyone much taller than 6 now or 6 2 back then Sadly I never see them listed in Tall Sizes and as always before I have to tuck in the tops or hike up the bottoms over and over and over to make sure my waist is protected 
Great Buy Completely Satisfied I love the sweatshirt It came exactly as pictured and in time for me to wear it for the Super Bowl 
I love em I originally wanted the Orange colored Tsubos but they were out of stock so I decided to go with the pickle color I absolutely love em The comfort and style are unique and satisfying It is because of shoes like this I have become a shoe expert of sorts 
Never buying Nike Running Shoes again Seriously went into the store to find new running shoes possibly the air 360 Was wearing shoxs in the store Threw them away immediately These are the best shoes I ve worn in a long while I m one of those ppl that like to take off my shoes as soon as I get home I forgot that these were on they were that comfortable I m a heavy parttime runner Nothing over 5K as I am just starting again They support my weight extremely well 
Great Skull Cap Even if you could never see yourself wearing this Go ahead and get it anyway This is great for under the football helmet for under the motorcycle helmet Feels good on your head I have even seen wrestlers wear these under headgear so it must be good for that too keeps your head dry I also wore this under my mask when volunteering a haunted house 
After one month s use I have had these boots for one month winter in Alaska I have been climbing a 1 000 foot elevation trail that is about one mile long It is winter the temperatures range from 5F to 25F and the trail is a mixture of ice and snow with a few knife edge ridges of ice I am wearing one pair of medium weight SmartWool socks and no gaters To date my feet are always warm and dry in these boots Lacing alone has prevented snow from coming into the boots The lateral support is excellent and better than I expected The fit is excellent and I have no slipping inside the boot yeah For my conditions the soles could be slightly more agressive but they hold well My four pint instep crampons have a tendency to slightly roll to the inside I think because of the shape of the sole at the instep so I have ordered a set of six point that add 2 to the heel Light weight but strong and sterdy so far Felt completely broke in right out of the box Not a hint of any blisters going uphill or down I would highly recommend them so far 
COMFORT AND PRACTICAL I HAVE NEVER BEEN INTO FULL RIM HATS I NEEDED ONE FOR THE WORK AND REST I DO SO I GAMBLED ON THIS I AM VERY HAPPY THAT I DID IT FITS PERFECTLY AND ALREADY I HAVE BEEN THROUGH A TWENTY DEGREE DIFFERENCE WITH RAIN AND BEING A GLASSES WEARER I CAN SAY I AM DEFINITELY PLEASED I RECOMMEND THIS HAT FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT FOR ANY REASON

THE BEST JEANS EVER I am so in love with these jeans I made myself a promise that when I buy jeans again these are definitely the brand jeans I will be purchasing I am very pleased with the L E I jeans to the full extent 
Black Forced Entry Tactical Boot The zipper pulls are somewhat ill suited for the job the only way I found to be able to zip the boots up quickly easily and snuggly was to replace the zipper pull with a key chain 
comfortable and stylish i love these shoes and wear them at least 4 days a week 
The only bikini briefs not designed by a woman These are the only semi affordable bikini briefs I ve found that are actually designed with a pouch making them the most comfortable on the market of all the brands I ve tried that is Unfortunately they re difficult to locate in typical retail outlets and you ll probably have to purchase them from an Amazon outlet that has exorbitant shipping charges but what can I say I guess it s worth it The briefs also run about a size small I have a 31 waist but the mediums are too small 
The most comfortable tennis shoes I have ever owned These shoes are so light that sometimes I forget I have them on They are so comfortable than I don t want to take them off I have to walk a lot every day and I am not kidding when I said that any other pair of shoes make my feet sore after a few hours of use but these shoes do the job to perfection I highly recommend them 
nice trunks They are very nice and comfortable I just advise ordering a size larger than you are used to

Best Choice I am technically a 32JJ per some lingerie store lady but have worn 34 DD and DDD since high school I m 27 now and have been on the hunt for a good nursing bra 33 weeks pregnant today I tried the Medela Seamless Underwire Full Fit Nursing Bra in a 34G and 34H This one is the most supportive but is an underwire which after 8 hours I can t wait to take off and I ve always been a committed underwire wearer and the H cup fits but I m nervous about if it will fit once my milk REALLy comes in I also tried the Fancee Free Foam Support Soft Cup Nursing Bra which I also got in a 34G and 34H is not the most supportive but is comfortable i wear this one to bed around the house etc So regarding the Goddess bra I just got a 34G and yes the cups are a little big which I m so thankful for because that will certainly allow for some growth and they aren t so big that my breasts look silly through shirts Not to mention the cup part that is looser is mostly around the nipple I ve been instructed to begin wearing a nipple shield so it allows for room for that so not inconspicuous item to be My favorite part is the back portion which is a stretchy cotton and does not dig into my ribs by the end of the day like the others It is also pretty supportive maybe a 9 out of 10 in supportiveness compared to the Medela but steps above the Fancee Free I will likely buy one more G and an H in this style and call it a day on buying nursing bras because I finally found what I m looking for I d recommend buying one that is a cup size below what you normally wear if you re looking to wear it right now and you may have to wear a size up after milk comes in This bra really got me excited enough that after 4 years of ordering from Amazon this is the first review I was ever compelled to write Hope you find the same success with this bra too Good Luck 
The Best nursing bra I have found This bra is the best nursing bra I have found It is very supportive and comfortable I like that it gives you the same support as an underwire bra but without the hard wire digging into you It holds up very well in the wash I would definitly recommend this bra to anyone that has a hard time finding bras to fit them

Hard to locate but worth the time I find this a very comfortable bra for women of larger sizes 
excellent sandal I love the Garrick sandal It was exactly what I expected as seen in the stores Delivery and service was excellent 
Soft as a glove warm and toasty I m the type of guy who has never bothered to buy slippers I run around the house in socks I m getting a little older now and my feet seem to get cold plus I run outside to do quick things like grab something from my shop turn on the water for a tree or plant etc things that normally require me to slip on some shoes These slippers are VERY soft but have a substantial enough sole to step a few steps outside without worry The light color and porous surface do tend to stain easily however but so far I ve managed to wash off the toothpaste drips and such laugh with me Yes I d recommend them for now and will let you know later how they held up 
Good exercise gear I used this pair to replace my regular large fins Speedo fins worked quite effectively and gave me a good workout The material is also good strong I have no gripes about this product I will highly recommend to people who do not like to use regular size fins 
adidas Originals Steeple Suede Running Shoe Very satisfied with my purchase The item was a Christmas present for my son and they got here in plenty of time and fit perfect Amazon was the only place I could find the shoes in stock and the price was also lower than any other site

Slip and Slide no more I have started water walking in the fitness center pool and found i was slipping enough to bother me This shoe fits like a glove and is very inexpensive to use I would recommend it to anyone desiring to use it for this purpose or any other water related activity I am certain it would be great at the beach etc 
Pretty and dandy but one size smaller This is a great pair of shoes and a good to have n your collection It is a subtle silver and looks absolutely delicate on your feet BUT it is one size smaller than normal I usually wear a 8 5M and this turned out to be small for me I do fit into it but my toe juts out a little bit A 9M would have been better But I dont have the patience to return it so I am gonna keep it Its a lovely pair of shoes 
Great Work Shirt I wear this shirt waiting tables and I reccomend it to anyone When washed it is wrinkle free and can survive many washings The larger size is very roomy and sleeve length is appropriate for long arms I only wish it came in a broad collar instead of just a point color but still an excellent shirt 
Perfect Lap Swimming Suit This is my favorite for lap swims Reasonable modesty but not baggy You ll move through the water with ease with minimum suit slippage If you are not looking for a tan get this one 
Simple and workable solution to tie management I bought two of these as a gift for my husband He d previously bought himself one of those eletronic tie racks and the thing fell apart while he was trying to get it installed These were ready to go right out of the box no assembly required took up less space in his closet than the 3 4 hangers with ties wrapped around them that he had and have made his tie collection managable and easy to select from The cushioned tie hooks ensure the ties will not slip off and also that they will not be damaged A breeze to organize his vast tie collection And he s loving this product 
Sperry boat shoes The shoes are awesome my daughter LOVES them Business was done in a professional manner and was an easy transaction 
Professional Look Workplace Comfort and Dickies Durability I found that these shorts do run a little bit small in size so make sure you give yourself an extra size up to make sure there is adequate room to move freely Follow the care label for the first wash or two until they get broke in because the shorts are bit stiff at first due to their Scotchgaurding TIP Make sure you wash them before you wear them I would recommend these shorts for most anyone who is looking for durability comfort and or needing a professional look in the garments they wear NOTE If you are looking for extra pockets go the Dickies cargo route These do not have any extra pockets 
Not for the larger chested I still love this bra It s great for casual wear sleeping etc It does solve the back fat problem however there is no lift and separate for me I m going to try the underwire version of this bra to see if it helps It is an extremely comfortable bra that feels great on I bought a L for the band size but there s just not quite enough coverage for my Ds 
Excellent fabric Classic wedding tuxedo Excellent fabric and cut The tuxedo was changed to single breasted suit after my approval 
Decent sock but not quite stretchy enough through ankle area Nice sock but the leg area was not really ample or stretchy enough in my opinion to be considered plus size I will probably pass these on to my sons who wear 8 men s size 
Very comfortable crop top bra I purchased this bre several weeks ago and found it to be the most confortable top I ve worn to date Since then I have purchased 4 more 
The perfect balance this cologne is the perfect balance of wood and sweetness It is not overpowering and it is very masculine I bought it for my boyfriend and found that on him it s even more potent It s aa great fragranc 
Great addition to my ipod This case is so cute and matches my green iPod perfectly I read other reviews that said it leaves little black fuzz on the iPod but I haven t had that problem The belt clip works great with this and feels very secure The other review said the cut out for the wheel is off a little and I guess she is right Looking at it you can see just slightly that the wheel isn t centered but it is completely accesible and I have no trouble using it Overall I love this case 
Fantastic purchase I bought this for my husband and am so impressed Nice and thick and incredibly soft and huggable I have not seen anything nicer when looking in department stores The attention to detail that went into the packaging was also a complete and welcome surprise Sturdy shipping box and the inside was packaged nicely enough to present as a gift with no wrapping really required There was even a hand written thank you note included I am more than satisfied 
Good Bathrobe The megasoft bathrobe is pretty soft and thick relative to other bathrobes It has a nice feel to it The bathrobe is made of Japanese yarn and the yarn is made of cotton so the bathrobe is made of 100 cotton Cotton of course strinks in the wash but the strinkage is tolerable I purchased the expresso color and after a few washes the color faded but that is to expected Overall I am satisfied with this purchase and would purchase it over again if I had the choice to do so 
Wow This is a heavy thick robe I expect it would fit a man 6 tall perfectly I am 5 8 and the sleeves are only slightly to long but I don t even notice now The comfort level is amazing this is so incredibly soft and warm you will put it on as soon as you get home and take it off when you go to bed I cant speak on durability as I ve only had it for a month or so but you most likely will not be dissapointed with the feel I got the brown color and I love it I feel like grisly adams in this thing 
Perfect My son s favorite color is orange but finding an orange lunch bag this year was a tough find until I found this lunch kit It is perfect high qualtiy great price fast delivery I am completely satisfied and will definately order again next year 
Does the Trick At first I was bugged by how sticky this was but boy did it work They gave me 1 2 ounce tube in the hospital and charged me 9 for it but that s another story It moisturizes and protects your nipples from chafing while nursing and doesn t bother baby a bit Take my advice bring your own tube to the hospital to avoid being over charged 
Great sneakers I pronate and the light eight material gave me breathability as well as a sturdy base for my running I not only trained up to 40 miles a week with these but I ran two half marathons and the NYC Marathon with this exact sneaker When they became worn from the wear and tear I bought another pair exact one These sneakers lasted me half a training season PLUS the marathon Not ages of running but probably close to 200 miles I highly recommend them And the color is fun too 
Cute little cranberry cap I ordered the cranberry watch cap and the matching scarf for my daughter for Christmas She loved the set as it is light weight and not bulky for packing for her honeymoon The great choice of colors made it difficult to choose only one 
Great PJ s I have the gown too and ordered the PJ s from the direct website They are the same great quality and the bottoms are so cute I wear them all the time out of the house 
Simply my favourate See title these shoes are simply the best pair of foot protectors ive ever owned so comfortable waterproof and just sweet looking i feel like a ninja every time i wear them 
Awsome Mom was looking for a similar item from Bass I told her this brand was very reliable She can put them down 
chain necklace this item was a great buy fast delivery and was given as a gift thank 
This shirt is a home run Shirt really made a hit Arrived shortly after placing order 
Wonderful These are absolutely the most fashionable and adorable shoes on earth They are right on the mark I love them so much that I am ordering my second pair not because the first fell apart but because I simply have to have more than one pair 
Awesome Service I got my Adidas Adissage WHT PNK sandals in record time I was able to take them on my trip with me as intended Also the price was the best that I had seen on the internet 
123 really nothing to say about this product fast shipping good deal i like the style and the color not too loud 
Fits I ve been wearing this bra for years It just can t be matched for comfortable fit no wires no seams Whatever your shape you can quot shake yourself quot into it 
great pair of lightweight boots these boots are a great alternative to the military style combat boot and the cost is less then when i purchased similar style boots when on active dut 
Nice I missed my late 80s over the knee suede boots which is why I got these They are great The only thing that could be much improved are the soles and heel They are very thing I d wear them out in a day I had to have them resoled But the Ammazon price was so good it was still a steal 
JBMC This was exactly what my husband had admired in Macy s I paid 25 more for the convenience of having it delivered to my home without my husband s knowledge He is thrilled with the jacket 
Under Armour to the rescue My 9 year old nephew told me he wanted Under Armour for Christmas I had no idea what he was talking about I asked Under arm deoderant Undershirt I was ever the un cool aunt for not knowing what he wanted I found out that 3 of my friends experienced the same thing The shirt runs very tight and even though my nephew is smaller for his age the large just barely fit him He asked for a second one for his birthday and so did my sister so she could get the shirt off of him and wash it The kid loves it and if he gives it 5 stars so do I 
Funky boots These boots are comfortable but they don t keep my feet very warm in cold weather They have an unusual pattern that gets a lot of compliments and goes with almost every color in a wardrobe The heel height is perfect Also I can tuck my jeans into the boots an added bonus 
with this shirt you always win It s October 8th 2006 The Detroit Tigers have just defeated the New York Yankees to advance to the American League Championship Series People counted the Tigers out Everyone thought the Yankees would walk into Comerica Ballpark and put a serious damper on the success the Tigers have produced all season long Nope Didn t happen The Tigers won 95 games this year No one thought the Tigers advancing this far was possible but when you have excellent stars such as Magglio Ordonez Curtis Granderson Ivan Rodriguez Marcus Thames Craig Monroe and Kenny Rogers you can t lose The manager Jim Leyland also played a major part in helping to reshape the Tigers as a team and give them much needed direction He was probably the main reason they won so many games The Tigers are now a team EVERYONE can love not just Detroit fans TV stations are now playing Tigers games again and reminding people that yes the Tigers are still around The fact that the Tigers haven t been mentioned for the last 10 years shows that the fans may have forgotten all about the team but beating the Yankees last night was solid proof the team is back and threatening Proof that the Tigers can hang with the big boys The celebration after the final out in game 4 was wonderful Everyone on the team lifted Jim Leyland on their shoulders and proudly walked around the field while the fans celebrated and cheered indicating they still remember those successful championship years a long time ago and obviously still support their home team It got extremely crazy when the team decided to spray champagne at the audience and they enjoyed it Even a cop wanted to be sprayed The celebration supposedly lasted an hour This Vintage Crest T Shirt should PROUDLY be worn by you I want you to take a trip to New York City wearing this shirt and walk down the street so everyone can see how much of a proud loyal Detroit Tigers fan you are The days of watching them lose game after game are finally over Long live the Tigers Make sure you buy this shirt to celebrate the wonderful run the Tigers had in the season of 2006 You need to wear Orange if you live in the Detroit area 
These are a smart choice The Tiffany s version is super expensive These are clean and simple They get the job done 
Make sure you order ahead of time I initially recieved my order very quickly within a week in fact However it was the wrong size and I had to send it back to them It turned out it was another 6 weeks before I got back the correct fitting corset The good news is with my wedding dress it is perfect however if you are planning a wedding make sure you get this item way ahead of time in case there are any issues with sizing or back ordering 
Great historical representation My wife has been looking for a pair of seamed pantyhose and didn t think such a thing existed Last week she wore this pair to a re enactment and received many favorable comments Highly recommende 
Decent support for large breasts Finding sleepwear that has enough support for lactating large breasted women is no fun but this dress is pretty good What this will not give you is any kind of coverage If you re ok with people seeing you with Major cleavage then this is fine If not just wear it to bed not in the hospital or as I see some women do out of the house Yikes I think I d be arrested 
BCBGirls Pascaly Sandal Gold looks very nice material is not bad just a little big from my original siz

Great shoe on sale With the sale and promotional rate applied This is a great shoe 
butterfly rainboots I bought these for my granddaughter after I saw her wearing a pair of plain black rubber boots which she loved When I gave her these she absolutely loved them They are so cute with flowers and butterflies all over them They run true to size are well made and look so bright and cheerful on a rainy day Needless to say the black boots have been retired 
very comfortable shoe I love the look and they are very comfortable on my feet I got the black and white and I love them with a pair of capris or long shorts 
These are great The denim on these jeans is lightweight and the touch of stretch renders them super comfy not confining like some stretchy jeans can be They re almost as comfortable as my sweats and there are some weekends when I just live in these True to size and I didn t have the shrinking issue another reviewer seems to have experienced 
Very comforatble running shoe I recently purchased this shoe after a friend of mine recommended ASICS shoes to me This is my first pair of running shoes and I am very pleased with it The shoes were very comfortable from the day one One comment that I have about the shoe is that they are quite narrow in the front I have wide feet and would have prefferred a little wider shoe I worked out fine for me however because I had purchased 1 2 size longer than what I usually wear Overall I am very happy with this pair and would recommend it

Great shoes great price We have always bought stride rite shoes for our son however the cost can be overwhelming when you are buying a new pair every three months I was excited to find these here at such an awesome price They are identical to those in the store and my son loves wearing them 
Thumperific Color and image are delightful I do wish I had gone up a size as I like to wear it with a long sleeved t shirt underneath 
Extremely Comfortable I love these shoes Tsubo is notoriously comfortable and these are amazing They aren t the prettiest shoes in the world but I can spend 12 hours on my feet in them and my feet are happy 
Nice casual shoe These fit a tiny bit loose but the comfort level is great Shoes at Amazon com are one of my favorite on line purchases great prices 
Marc Ecko Shoes Bought these for my 7 year old per his request The size was right the style was right and he has been wearing them everyday since They arrived quicker than anticipated and we are very happy with the purchase 
Great Leather Bag Very good quality nice leather sturdy and can be used for anything Big enough as a book bag great carry on a purse etc I am very satisfied with my purchase the bag is made in the states and a great price for a quality made item I highly recommend this leather bag 
Nice and sexy If you have the body to show for it by all means wear it alone 
Slide em on Slide out the door Great leggings I love the feel of these thicker than the regular cotton lycra leggings and they hold you in nicely One thing I like about Danskin is the waist elastic is not tight it just rests on your waist It s extremely comfortable Gusseted cotton crotch is also a plus I wear these to yoga pilates on hikes with my dog and just about everywhere else Oh and they look much more expensive than the cotton leggings I even wear them in 90 degree weather I just can t get enough of them I have always appreciated Danskin quality just machine wash and dry and off you go 
Lyndsay pump This shoes are very lovely classy and comfortable I m thinking of getting them in another colour 
Naruto wristband Exactly as advertised If you re a Naruto nut or like wristbands I d advise buying this 
Nice and Warm Warm and soft I have used this brand for years and they have never caused skin problems This brand is warmer then those without the fuzzy inside 
Finally a bra that fits I had bought a bra of this model at a discount store just got lucky It quickly became my favorite and I was glad to find it at Amazon 
Dansko Prof Chocolate The shoes are great I love Dansko they are the most supportive and comfortable shoes that I have ever worn I have 9 pair will buy more The retailer was great I received my shoes within 5 days I would shop there again

Championship gear The bundle can be worn on warm and chilly days to support my favorite college team and alma mater Material is good for both the t shirt and hoodie For the quality and price can t beat it anywhere 
Makes my 44 year old chest look like 30 I got custom fit for this bra at Nordstrom s and I am so happy that I purchased it among others that day I had lost 55 pounds and was looking to update my image and had gone through about 4 bra sizes on my way down Hands down this was the best purchase even better than the 65 I spent on the Le Mystere bra It is unbelievably comfortable and since I am a light 34c it adds the perfect amount to make me a perfect C Plus it gives me a bump and just the right amount of cleavage I can even wear it with many of my plunging tops and feel sexy without being over the top One thing to note is that it puts the breasts pretty close together and since I am 5 1 and a size 2 that works well for me as I am pretty small framed It took a bit to get used to them being so out there in front So if your breasts are set further apart then this might not be the right fit for you I love it so much that I now have this in all 3 colors and 2 of the bare color as I am very fair skinned 
Nice coat but big guys beware I m a big guy Heck I ll just admit I m a fat guy However I am also simply large framed broad shouldered barrel chested I got the largest size possisble to accomodate my stomach and my large chest largest available is a chest measurement of 60 my chest is 58 and while the coat looks pretty good on me the shoulders are extremely constricting and I have heard the seam in the back pulling if I move my arms too quickly or too far If you have unusual proportions like me I reccomend biting the bullet and getting a tailor made coat elsewhere Still though the coat is quite warm and looks pretty nice on me so if you are of relatively normal dimensions you can add a star to this review when considering a purchase 
My favorite cover This boonie hat is collapsible yet has a firm rim Chin strap is attached to keep it where it belongs in high winds This is the hat that will conceal you in the woods but gets noticed about town The digital pattern is impressive can often times is a conversation piece I wear it almost every day and it s my favorite piece of headgear 
excellent Sexy and well made I am a size 12 but I bought the queen size and it fit great 
Maui Polarized The glasses were in excellent condition they were exactly what i expected plus more they sent them in a glasses case which was a bonus to me This was an excellent seller 
great socks i am picky about the kind of sock i put on me my son s feet his feet have been sized as extra wide and these socks fit wonderfully in his size without being stretched tight i love the high cotton content the cushioned soles these are well made socks i will be buying from this brand when it s time for the next size up 
lax shirt trans was great love the shirt I know it s a lot for a t shirt but I had to have it 
Led Zep T Shirt The Song Remains The Same A really nice looking t shirt that was made to show an archeological dig revealing an unearthed artifact a Gibson Les Paul Guitar I ve had nothing but positive remarks about it every time it was worn I ll probably order another because something this good usually goes fast A really good Led Zep shirt is hard to find and this is one Highly reccomended 5 stars

Still great shoes With a good selection of colors to go with the casual style to say I love these shoes is an understatement They are very comfortable and have grown on me so much they are about the only casual style shoes I have bought in the past few years 
Durability meets Affordability i had purchased these kicks three years ago for work purpose three years later i still wear them everyday my job is fairly labor intensive so they have really taken a beating while they are still in decent shape and by far my most confortable shoe i am ordering another pair or two from amazon cant wait to get my new pair to start breaking them in 
Adidas Superstar II The shoes are comfortable the fit well and they seem to be standing up to wear and tear exceptionally well Also Amazon com is really easy and convinient to shop from 
swim suit This suit was as expected The lycra should hold up well in the pool 
Good products I ordered this swim suit recently it arrived very quick with regualr shipping and fit me very well it s a better quality product compare to the speedo I bought from Sam s the only thing is they don t have size 34 I wear size 4 or size 6 cloth so according to the chart I suppose to order size 32 which is the largest available size but I still feel it a little tie on me maybe that s the way professional swim wear suppose to be Overall it s a good product 
Nice Simple black suit I like the suit and Lane4 shipped it to me in a timely manner 
Great product The collar stays work well and the shipping was on par I will consider ordering from this company again

Boots Lasted 8 Years My first pair of 10 eyelet DM boots lasted 8 years before the heel came apart from the sole I m on my 2nd pair now I don t think they will last as long but you never know 
Nothing better on the market Some people scoff they say 100 + for boots no way too expensive I have been wearing DR s for 10 years and nothing else Why Because nothing holds up like DR Martins Oddly my first pair ever fell apart after a couple of weeks the stiching just fell out but I exchanged them and have never had that problem since The average pair last me 2 3 years of everyday non stop wear I where them all year around on the sales floor wharehouse or office and everywhere I go They will not come apart I only get new ones when the old ones look worn and stretched and when the soles start to wear smooth 14 18 months of 8 14hr day wear seven days a week and then I keep the old pair for another 14 18 months for working outside or any dirty job I have to do where I don t want to damage my good pair I got married in DR Martins pollished with a new double breasted suite They look great with everything Jeans cargos Dress clothes shorts I bought my wife a pair of dress sandles nearly three years ago they still look like brand new These boots are forever 
Great aviators These are some really good glasses Plenty dark full mirrored so you won t be caught checkin out all the ladies you walk by Shoot for 18 you can t go wrong I highly recommend them And since I m a pilot it was obvious that I got a pair of these 
great glasses i have purchased 2 pairs from 80s purple and i love them both they are very cool and durable for such thin framed glasses the shipping is always ahead of schedule and they are very well packaged i don t plan on buying sun glasses anywhere else 
GREAT SERVICE thanks so much I bought these glasses and they had a minor defect They responded to my email very quickly and I was send another pair within days Would definetly do business with again THANKS 
Five stars for customer service Not to mention a great pair of sunglasses at a great price Initially there was a problem with my order but Lu at 80s Purple was very helpful and once contact was made things were settled in a timely and orderly fashion I was very impressed with the customer service end as that is always important when dealing with a seller or vendor after the initial purchase has been made The glasses are great Though thought of as some as 80 s Retro or what have you Aviator sunglasses are like Chuck Taylor Converse shoes like cowboy hats like your favorite solid color T shirt Its Americana Classic and Cool which is what makes it buck the trend and stand the test of time I love my new shades They also come in a great hard case so you can stow them anywhere and not worry about them getting damaged Beyond that even why pay over 100 dollars for a pair of name brand sunglasses that are made of plastic when you can get something with sturdier more durable metal frames Even beyond that the UV rating on these is actually not any lower than anything else I ve ever worn solidifying the fact that not only are you getting what you pay for here but if your not buying here and paying more elsewhere you are most likely wasting your money I was very impressed with the professionalism and kindness showed to me by customer support Thanks 80s purple 
They look great but for metal frames they feel delicate I bought a pair similar to these from a vender at a rest stop and when those broke I ordered these They come in a nice bag and they re metal not plastic frames You wouldn t know from looking at them since they re so thin and light The lenses are full mirrored and scratch pretty easily I hugged someone while they were hanging from my shirt collar and there are nicks But they are wicked cool looking block plenty of sun and unless you look really closely you can t see my eyes which is the point Goes great with The Sisters of Mercy Floodlands CD 
Thrilled I am absolutely THRILLED with my aviator sunglasses They look absolutely amazing and pricey I cannot believe how sophisicated and polished it looks And for just 14 dollars It s a total steal And the shipping was super fast 
GREAT AND TOTALLY CELEBRITY Best sunglasses ever I ve received sooo many compliments and that i look like a movie star and they are a reasonable price and they look EXSPENSIVE Best sunglasses ever They are sooo comfortable you ll forget your wearing them and they look totally vintage Trust me buy them 
Took Me Through the Danger Zone Best aviator sunnies I ve ever owned This is my second pair because my first pair got lost I really like that these are 5 2 inches wide as opposed to the standard 5 inches so they can fit on my fat head and not squeeze my brain 
Not Bad I like these cute pants alot They actually fit my larger than average baby well even though most pants are far too long for his legs The material isn t cheap and is nice and soft washes well too A good buy I will buy more of these especially considering BabyVision sent me coupons and gives a repeat customer discount 
Great pants for long legs My 8 month old has his dad s build tall and slim so finding pants that are long enough and still stay up has been a challenge These pants fit the bill The material is ultra comfy and the colors go great with onesies from lots of different companies They ve also been through the wash numerous times washed with Dreft without fading or loosing their durability A great product for the price 
Very nice These are wonderful pants and for a good price too My baby is wearing the 6 9 size and she is about 16 lbs and 26 inches at six months The length is very good I think she ll be in these at least another month or so The material isn t cheap or light and they don t stretch out easily The color of these match the colors in most baby clothing out there presently which is very nice I ve bought a bunch of things from Baby Because through Amazon and some are really poor quality and others like these are wonderful so don t judge them on their prices some of their things are really nice These pants are at least as good as the more expensive ones I recommmend them 
great buy I purchased the 0 3 months for my newborn They fit him perfectly He weighed 8 lbs 6 oz The pants are soft and match the onesies I bought for him too It s hard to find this color of green 
The best swimsuit so far I m swimming every day therefore I needed something very durable very chlorine resistant This was my 4th swimsuit purchase in six months Well this swimsuit IS really chorine resistant so far 3 months it kept it s color and shape It is comfortable too although it is hard to take it off when it is wet 
Best suit I ve ever worn No kidding I am a regular fitness swimmer and go through the lycra suits every 4 6 months They always get too stretched out and cause drag in the water This suit is holding up beautifully with none of the usual snags and wear marks from getting in and out of the pool Also I m usually a size 16 on the chunky side but this suit looks good on me and fits well even in a size 14 Really glad I found it 
speedo queen Great suit Always loved speedos This one has skiny straps for more comfort Fits well and looks great Also sizes don t say but a 38 is equivalent to a size 12 womens 
Speedo I bought this because it says the material would last longer than the nylon swim suits Its less stretchy but okay for lap swim 
Perfect fit This suit was better than I expected It flatters the figure and is one of the most comfortable suits I ve ever worn I feel great in it and I don t feel like I have to tug at it every time I move Great quality great buy 
Speedo Endurance Flyback Swimsuit This suit hugs the contours of the body and doesn t get in the way of whatever water oriented sport your involved in It s flattering to the figure as well The material feels durable and appears to stand up to the pressures of being used daily in a chlorine environment You can hardly go wrong with a Speedo 
Baby shower gift I purchased these as a gift and was really impressed by how incredibly soft they are I wish they made women s shirts out of the same soft cotton Everyone I showed they too really liked the cute pink and yellow outfits I am very pleased with this purchase 
Good quality for price These are good quality baby bodysuits and very reasonably priced Make sure you buy the size according to your baby s weight and height and not by the age posted My 3 month old girl is wearing the 6 9 month size They are a little big but thats great because they will last longer Warning the medium green body suit is not color fast and will end up looking like camo wear after you wash it The other body suits in the green pack are color fast and will not fade quickly It seems it is just the one green bodysuit that doesn t hold up well I did not have any fading in the pink bodysuits All in all I d recommend these 
Good quality but small The quality of the bodysuits are very good They are well made and good material However they get three stars because of the sizing issue My son is 10 months old and so I got him what I thought would be ones he could grow into the 9 12 month 27 34 lbs This was not the case as soon as I washed them they shrunk to about the size of a 6 9 months onesie The are good but if you order them order at least one to two sizes bigger than you think you will need 
Best toddler socks ever I am thrilled to finally find socks that fit my toddler well and actually stay on her feet These socks are great because they fit well stay on and have great non skid bottoms that allow her to wear them without shoes and not slip all over the floor And unlike most other non skid socks these are still thin enough to wear with shoes I love these socks and will be ordering more of them 
too tight at ankle I bought the 18 24 month old size for my 15 month old who is in the 90 of height and 40 of weight The sock felt soft and fit her foot perfectly But the ankle elastic part was so tight it left a dark red mark within seconds of wearing And our daughter does not have fat ankles I wish the ankle wasn t constructed so tightly but I now have 6 socks that will never be worn 
Great socks seem to run small Love these socks they re the first ones my boy didn t kick off with ease I also like getting a color assortment The fabric is sturdy and thick the elastic is firm but not binding and the quality is much higher than other kids socks I ve tried And the price is right However be careful with the sizes I got size 0 9 mo for my 6 month old and they were too small He s a big boy but not that big So I would order one size up from what you think you need As long as you get the size that fits you can t go wrong with these 
Love em I love these sock they don t shrink and cover my son s feet perfectly Don t know why a newborn needs non skidding socks but oh well 
Best socks so far We ve tried several brands on our very active 8 month old These are the first ones that stay on In addition the colors both blue sets match most baby clothes and they feel very comfy The no skid bottoms have been great on hard wood floors and plastic toys 
Wonderful socks At 6 1 2 months old my baby isn t walking yet but when we go out I put these on her feet with our without shoes She moves her legs a lot and usually kicks off any shoes and socks on These stay on better than any we ve tried She can t pull them off easily They are holding up very well in the wash and the colors match the colors used in baby s outfits on the market which is very nice The non slip part is the printing on the bottom of the feet that says Loveable Friends It is a soft rubberish kind of printing that feels very nice to the fingers We started using these when our baby had just turned 5 months old and they stayed on just as well then They seem like they will fit her for another few months Overall these are very nice socks for a good price I highly recommended them 
Nice nice nice My baby pulls off any shoes and socks that may be put on his feet These stay on better than most We got the 3 pairs in blue yellow and green The non slip part has cute printing on the bottom of the feet Overall these socks are nice nice and nice and the price is reasonable 
Great socks for babies of all ages I purchased these socks for my newborn baby girl because I used the same style for my son last year and they are awesome They fit right and feel comfortable my son is picky about socks 
Speedo Women s Quantum Splice Solid Swim Suit This suit is a good quality suit I ve used Speedo brand swim suits for eleven years now and I have found them to last well through recreactional swimming Also these suits are able to handle about two seasons of indoor competitive swimming or more depending on the chlorine levels and how well one takes care of the suit So far my new Quantum Splice has held up very well in the highly chlorinated pools in which I swim I recommend this suit the price is so much less here than any I could find at a brick mortar store 
Very Good It was sent to me on time And the product corresponds to my expectations Thank you 
It s good I read some reviews before I placed my order Some complained about the smaller size I found it s OK The quality is good at least worth the money 
The Perfect Swimsuit I love it It is exactly what I wanted and fits great Arrived promptly too 
speedo solid splice swim suit i have been a fan of this style since i was little and swam competitively if you do not have a traditional petite body this swimsuit is great it has coverage in all the awkward areas that some of the other designs don t i am 5 9 and well not skinny and i was happy with the way it fit if you are unsure of your size however unless you are racing it is best to order one size up i went with a size up from what i wear in men s jeans and it seemed to work 
Speedo Fit and Quality This is my 4th suit of the same style and make It works well for me as I swim laps It has good coverage and holds up pretty well I swim about 4 times a week and I get about 4 to 5 months out of a suit due to the cholorine 
European sized Swimsuit Suit was too small not enough information available on the site for it and I would not buy another bathing suit from Amazon as it cost me money to send it back 
Good stretch and fit Fast delivery Good quality lining in the front I wish there is lining in the back too Delivery is fast 
perfect everything was perfect it was exactly what i expected came in a timely fashion would order from here again 
SOCKS The warmest most lasting and most comfortable men s sock on the market Excellant Price 
great service and quality I was having a hard time finding a cheaper swim suit so I just ordered one from the grab bag I figured nothing could be worse than my plain black swim suit Also the swim suit was delivered in half the time that it was expected 
Lane 4 Swim Shop The TYR grab bag suit I received was one I would have chosen a great price for a great suit 
Good quality suits These are good quality Speedo suits for competetive swimmers Speedo suits last longer than Tyr suits I generally order 2 at a time get sent 2 different styles colors no solids so far The only issue may be that you can t choose wide straps vs spaghetti straps 
Champion Cotton Tagless tee x large white why not to buy If you are a small frame person or a short person these will work fine for you The white is thin and you can see through it so i don t reccomend buying white on this brand The t shirts run very small A size x large fits both of us very big on most brands but this brand was so tight we could not even get it on so these run very small They are also short 29 inches is short for a man s t shirt If you are tall i would not recommend this t shirt The t shirt is soft not scratchy and the style is nice We only had problems with the sizing and of course the white being so thin that it is see through 
Excellent quality for a t shirt Champion Cotton rocks Not only that they have variety in sizes and colours but also good quality This can make an excellent gift 
Champion Makes A Great Shirt I love Andrew Christian too Great Quality Shirt and no itchy tag very quick shipping from seller I love the nice selection of colors and the shirt is not too tight and not too lose Has a cool Champion logo 
one of the best hello this item it s on of the best watch from guess it s nice and i advice you to buy i

Guess is nice watch I like guess watches spicily gold candy rock and white gold one is look like really gold 
I ts very catchy It s golden color is very remarkable It looks like real gold wonderful piece to have 
Hard to find length My daughter needed black gym shorts for PE but all of the shorts I could find were shorter than my modest 13 year wanted to be seen in These were a nice mid thigh length without looking like boys shorts We were both happy with the quality and fabric They did take a little long to ship 
high Quality T shirt Fast delivery and superior quality shirts They do not shrink are roomy sized and heavy weight Not a cheapo imitation Love them 
Champion T Shirts score a knockout with my husband I ordered 2 extra large Charcoal Champion T Shirts for my husband Only 2 because he is very picky about his T shirts and I wanted to make sure he liked them before I ordered a whole thundering herd of them I told him I loved the champion items I have and he should try them They washed and dried well didn t shrink or fade He absolutely loves them So much in fact he asked me to order more Denim Maroon Forest I ll let you know if he likes those too 
Can t believe Dr Marten s are made in China now The soles of these shoes are very comfortable but the padded collar of the shoes need to be broken in very well 
I ve had this pair for 3 years An I m still wearing them I went through 4 laces and it s still going strong It is soo comfortable and a great work casual shoe Highly recommended 
Great shoe I was just looking on line for a new pair of docs I love love this shoe I m probably getting on average every 4 years get a new pair of docs I basically just wear one shoe and this one is it After the first week this shoe is worn to fit you which is great and comfy Another perk of docs So I ve gotten this particular shoe 3 times I gotta still give it raves but my hubby wants me to get a different style I won t get anything now but docs Why a different style Well I just had a baby recently and most of the leggings and stuff I wear well is black and my docs have ALWAYS been brown You know to go with a great pair of khaki s I wonder if he ll notice if I get the same shoe but in black 
Leather key case A difficult item to find in department stores Found some at twice the price in a leather goods store The Fossil leather key cases were of equal quality I purchased two and am very satisfied 
Really like these bags I ordered two of these one for me and my husband we wore these in Disney World and you would be suprised at all the stuff we were able to put in them I would suggest these to anyone who is looking for a great bag and what a bargain price I know we will get many more uses out of these they are really durable 
great bag I just got mine I am very happy with it I ordered another one right now too I cannot believe the price I am very happy with my purchase 
What bag I was supposed to get it by no later than March 2 It is now March 19 and still no bag I had read another review that said they waited a long time for this item but I figured since I ordered it Febuary 15 to be sure it would be by now What have they got working in their shipping department a couple of monkeys that only work two days a week 
Okay shirt This is the kind of shirt which you get what you pay for The material isn t that bad well made The style is okay looking smart but not geeky It s good value though 
Excellent shirts Two co workers and I ordered these shirts We are all extremely satisfied with them These shirts are an excellent value We would recommend them highly to all our friends and colleagues 
fine quality great price I was wary about buying since the price was so low but the shirt is quite good I own many brands of dress shirts some are expensive some not This is a nice shirt It isn t see thru like some of the other reviews said It is just right for wearing under a suit in the warmer weather You can go wrong at this price 
Great Buy As always Amazon com delivers right on time and great quality I bought this shirt for my son in law who will be changing job positions and will require dress shirts and suits He lives in another state so it is great to use the bill to this address and ship to this address feature that Amazon com offers My son in law was very pleased with the shirt and service 
Worst Quality I wore this shirt just once It s almost transparent Not worth it even if you get it for free 
Poorly organized customer service I received an email from txshirts stated that I should direct all inquiries to csr txshirts com I did this on two occasions and received no reply Customer service finally contacted me only to ask why I had left negative feedback on Amazon They stated they never received any email from me Their gym shorts were not as described The description said covered elastic waistband Instead I received an uncovered elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin Their response I should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back But who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised 
Great everyday shirt at a great price As the wife of the wearer I find these shirt to be great and long lasting and though not their claim by any means pretty darn stain resistant too The color does hold true throughout many washings While the Wrinkle Free portion isn t 100 true they do come out of the dryer looking better than most and after a light starch and ironing stay quite crisp during a day s wearing The manufacturing quality in my experience is also great I ve never had a problem with a loose seam or button I also love that Van Heusen offers a shirt in a size 18 neck with a 32 33 sleeve My husband is an average size guy with a greater than average neck so finding this 18 32 33 combo is dang near impossible in other brands Thanks Van Heusen 
No fears on my wedding day I bought the breast petals so that I wouldn t have to worry on my wedding day I did not want to wear a bra because of the style of dress I had This product was great It was easy to apply and did the job They came off easily at the end of the night I wore them for about 8 hours and had no problems at all I would highly recommend them to anyone 
Great addition to your wardrobe I bought some of these to wear with a drapey shirt cut open nearly to the waist and these little covers made me feel way more confident that even if my shirt slipped a little nobody would be able to see anything The nude ones were practically the same color as my skin so they were perfect They also stopped any embarrasing reactions to the cold The best part was they didn t feel weird at all 
Almost as much a part of me as my feet I started wearing these shoes when I was 19 Five years later I ve gone through two pairs about to buy my third but they ve been my one and only pair of shoes I just haven t had the desire to wear anything else I ve worn them for nearly 12 hours a day every single day year round working at a job during the day that requires constant movement and then walking around the city at night You can t really tell by looking at them that they ve been literally everywhere with me They could use a bit of a polish but other than that nothing s worn down I suppose if I wore more shoes I would only need one pair of these and they d last longer But thats not stopping me 
Nice looking but I had blisters and painful feet for 3 weeks until these shoes broke in If you buy these make sure you get band aids too 
These shoes may be the last pair you ll ever need to buy I bought my first pair of Doc s when I was 16 After joining the military traveling to nearly 50 different countries in sleet snow and boiling deserts in the Middle East this same pair of shoes still look great today 20 years later albeit scuffed up Indeed last week I had a casual business meeting with a little spit elbow grease and an old towel I used to dry off my dog they cleaned up quite nicely and worked well with my Docker khaki s They re exceptionally comfortable timeless and well worth the price How many 20yr old pair of shoes do you own That s like what 5 yr The style colour conscience among you might want to consider another pair in black They re that good like an old friend reliable stylish and right there with you to conquer life s many challenges I highly recommend them josef 
Worth the money and the trouble These shoes really do wear like iron and are superbly comfortable once they are broken in The sizing takes some getting used to I recommend buying or at least trying on Dr Martens in a store the first time to find out one s size in the British system My USA size is 10D Yet the Dr Martens that works for me is UK 10 USA 11 Go figure When the first pair of these I got began to look shabby I simply polished it with brown shoe polish That pair of shoes is still fine after being worn more days than any shoes I have ever had 
Not Bad I like these cute pants alot They actually fit my larger than average baby well even though most pants are far too long for his legs The material isn t cheap and is nice and soft washes well too A good buy I will buy more of these especially considering BabyVision sent me coupons and gives a repeat customer discount 
Great pants for long legs My 8 month old has his dad s build tall and slim so finding pants that are long enough and still stay up has been a challenge These pants fit the bill The material is ultra comfy and the colors go great with onesies from lots of different companies They ve also been through the wash numerous times washed with Dreft without fading or loosing their durability A great product for the price 
Very nice These are wonderful pants and for a good price too My baby is wearing the 6 9 size and she is about 16 lbs and 26 inches at six months The length is very good I think she ll be in these at least another month or so The material isn t cheap or light and they don t stretch out easily The color of these match the colors in most baby clothing out there presently which is very nice I ve bought a bunch of things from Baby Because through Amazon and some are really poor quality and others like these are wonderful so don t judge them on their prices some of their things are really nice These pants are at least as good as the more expensive ones I recommmend them 
great buy I purchased the 0 3 months for my newborn They fit him perfectly He weighed 8 lbs 6 oz The pants are soft and match the onesies I bought for him too It s hard to find this color of green 
The best swimsuit so far I m swimming every day therefore I needed something very durable very chlorine resistant This was my 4th swimsuit purchase in six months Well this swimsuit IS really chorine resistant so far 3 months it kept it s color and shape It is comfortable too although it is hard to take it off when it is wet 
Best suit I ve ever worn No kidding I am a regular fitness swimmer and go through the lycra suits every 4 6 months They always get too stretched out and cause drag in the water This suit is holding up beautifully with none of the usual snags and wear marks from getting in and out of the pool Also I m usually a size 16 on the chunky side but this suit looks good on me and fits well even in a size 14 Really glad I found it 
speedo queen Great suit Always loved speedos This one has skiny straps for more comfort Fits well and looks great Also sizes don t say but a 38 is equivalent to a size 12 womens 
Speedo I bought this because it says the material would last longer than the nylon swim suits Its less stretchy but okay for lap swim 
Perfect fit This suit was better than I expected It flatters the figure and is one of the most comfortable suits I ve ever worn I feel great in it and I don t feel like I have to tug at it every time I move Great quality great buy 
Speedo Endurance Flyback Swimsuit This suit hugs the contours of the body and doesn t get in the way of whatever water oriented sport your involved in It s flattering to the figure as well The material feels durable and appears to stand up to the pressures of being used daily in a chlorine environment You can hardly go wrong with a Speedo 
Baby shower gift I purchased these as a gift and was really impressed by how incredibly soft they are I wish they made women s shirts out of the same soft cotton Everyone I showed they too really liked the cute pink and yellow outfits I am very pleased with this purchase 
Can t go wrong at this price I don t see the difference between these bodysuits and the more expensive ones Fits my boy just right 
Good quality for price These are good quality baby bodysuits and very reasonably priced Make sure you buy the size according to your baby s weight and height and not by the age posted My 3 month old girl is wearing the 6 9 month size They are a little big but thats great because they will last longer Warning the medium green body suit is not color fast and will end up looking like camo wear after you wash it The other body suits in the green pack are color fast and will not fade quickly It seems it is just the one green bodysuit that doesn t hold up well I did not have any fading in the pink bodysuits All in all I d recommend these 
Green Very nice basic clothing I think the size is fine I really like being able to find these shades of green though I have decided the lighter shade is really a feminine color This is the only brand that I can find these muted greens 
Good quality but small The quality of the bodysuits are very good They are well made and good material However they get three stars because of the sizing issue My son is 10 months old and so I got him what I thought would be ones he could grow into the 9 12 month 27 34 lbs This was not the case as soon as I washed them they shrunk to about the size of a 6 9 months onesie The are good but if you order them order at least one to two sizes bigger than you think you will need 
Best toddler socks ever I am thrilled to finally find socks that fit my toddler well and actually stay on her feet These socks are great because they fit well stay on and have great non skid bottoms that allow her to wear them without shoes and not slip all over the floor And unlike most other non skid socks these are still thin enough to wear with shoes I love these socks and will be ordering more of them 
too tight at ankle I bought the 18 24 month old size for my 15 month old who is in the 90 of height and 40 of weight The sock felt soft and fit her foot perfectly But the ankle elastic part was so tight it left a dark red mark within seconds of wearing And our daughter does not have fat ankles I wish the ankle wasn t constructed so tightly but I now have 6 socks that will never be worn 
Great socks seem to run small Love these socks they re the first ones my boy didn t kick off with ease I also like getting a color assortment The fabric is sturdy and thick the elastic is firm but not binding and the quality is much higher than other kids socks I ve tried And the price is right However be careful with the sizes I got size 0 9 mo for my 6 month old and they were too small He s a big boy but not that big So I would order one size up from what you think you need As long as you get the size that fits you can t go wrong with these 
Love em I love these sock they don t shrink and cover my son s feet perfectly Don t know why a newborn needs non skidding socks but oh well 
Best socks so far We ve tried several brands on our very active 8 month old These are the first ones that stay on In addition the colors both blue sets match most baby clothes and they feel very comfy The no skid bottoms have been great on hard wood floors and plastic toys 
Wonderful socks At 6 1 2 months old my baby isn t walking yet but when we go out I put these on her feet with our without shoes She moves her legs a lot and usually kicks off any shoes and socks on These stay on better than any we ve tried She can t pull them off easily They are holding up very well in the wash and the colors match the colors used in baby s outfits on the market which is very nice The non slip part is the printing on the bottom of the feet that says Loveable Friends It is a soft rubberish kind of printing that feels very nice to the fingers We started using these when our baby had just turned 5 months old and they stayed on just as well then They seem like they will fit her for another few months Overall these are very nice socks for a good price I highly recommended them 
Nice nice nice My baby pulls off any shoes and socks that may be put on his feet These stay on better than most We got the 3 pairs in blue yellow and green The non slip part has cute printing on the bottom of the feet Overall these socks are nice nice and nice and the price is reasonable 
perfect I love these socks They fit great my 15 month old daughter has thick ankles and she can zoom around on the kitchen floor and not take a nose dive into things 
Great socks for babies of all ages I purchased these socks for my newborn baby girl because I used the same style for my son last year and they are awesome They fit right and feel comfortable my son is picky about socks

TYR Swimsuit Your company was a pleasure to work with thanks I will enjoy wearing the swimsuit that I ordered 
Lane 4 Swim Shop The TYR grab bag suit I received was one I would have chosen a great price for a great suit 
Size runs big My son is now over 12lbs at 6 weeks and these shorts still look like capris on him They do run on the big side but are cute 
Good quality suits These are good quality Speedo suits for competetive swimmers Speedo suits last longer than Tyr suits I generally order 2 at a time get sent 2 different styles colors no solids so far The only issue may be that you can t choose wide straps vs spaghetti straps 
Excellent quality for a t shirt Champion Cotton rocks Not only that they have variety in sizes and colours but also good quality This can make an excellent gift

Guess is nice watch I like guess watches spicily gold candy rock and white gold one is look like really gold 
Hard to find length My daughter needed black gym shorts for PE but all of the shorts I could find were shorter than my modest 13 year wanted to be seen in These were a nice mid thigh length without looking like boys shorts We were both happy with the quality and fabric They did take a little long to ship 
Durability meets Affordability i had purchased these kicks three years ago for work purpose three years later i still wear them everyday my job is fairly labor intensive so they have really taken a beating while they are still in decent shape and by far my most confortable shoe i am ordering another pair or two from amazon cant wait to get my new pair to start breaking them in 
GOOD SNEAKERS GOOD LOOKING KICKS IF YOUR KICKIN IT OLD SCHOOL LIKE ME AND COMFORTABLE AND RELATIVELY CHEAP I LL ALWAYS KEEP A PAIR OF STAN SMITH S AROUND FOR WEEKENDS 
Adidas Superstar II The shoes are comfortable the fit well and they seem to be standing up to wear and tear exceptionally well Also Amazon com is really easy and convinient to shop from 
swim suit This suit was as expected The lycra should hold up well in the pool 
Good products I ordered this swim suit recently it arrived very quick with regualr shipping and fit me very well it s a better quality product compare to the speedo I bought from Sam s the only thing is they don t have size 34 I wear size 4 or size 6 cloth so according to the chart I suppose to order size 32 which is the largest available size but I still feel it a little tie on me maybe that s the way professional swim wear suppose to be Overall it s a good product 
Nice Simple black suit I like the suit and Lane4 shipped it to me in a timely manner 
disappointed I want to start by saying Fred Flare shipped this product very fast And the transaction itself was very smooth I do however have extreme problems with the product itself The product is not leather its nylon and it sort of looks cheap The inside material is sued but that s only the lining for the base of the wallet Also The wallet part is very hard to use You cant really put too much in the wallet The credit card slots are a little too snug and there is no place for my I D The wallet included a small note book but it also doesn t fit in the wallet I was very excited about this product but now I feel duped The pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality and that it was user friendly but it s not I do not recommend this product 
great player very portable great picture easy to operate all the accessories you need great sound playes dvd s from sony camcorder very happy with the system am looking forward to using this camping and on vacation 
high Quality T shirt Fast delivery and superior quality shirts They do not shrink are roomy sized and heavy weight Not a cheapo imitation Love them 
Champion T Shirts score a knockout with my husband I ordered 2 extra large Charcoal Champion T Shirts for my husband Only 2 because he is very picky about his T shirts and I wanted to make sure he liked them before I ordered a whole thundering herd of them I told him I loved the champion items I have and he should try them They washed and dried well didn t shrink or fade He absolutely loves them So much in fact he asked me to order more Denim Maroon Forest I ll let you know if he likes those too 
Can t believe Dr Marten s are made in China now The soles of these shoes are very comfortable but the padded collar of the shoes need to be broken in very well 
I ve had this pair for 3 years An I m still wearing them I went through 4 laces and it s still going strong It is soo comfortable and a great work casual shoe Highly recommended 
these are my first Chinese Doc Martens I have been looking for a pair of Docs for a while I know they are a new globalized company and I am not necessarily against that I am disappointed that you can t get a better range of colors I ve had a few blue pairs and a lovely green But colors are not really available now except on high tops emblazoned with the brand name An abomination for sure These shoes are very comfortable and apparently well made My single quibble with the black pair I got here on amazon has to do with the flimsiness of the tongue I like a nice strong tongue And who doesn t Whatever they saved on material here may have been a mistake On the other hand maybe the sole will wear out first or it will be a dead heat Never thought I d buy shoes online but amazon and the Doctor made it happen 
Great shoe I was just looking on line for a new pair of docs I love love this shoe I m probably getting on average every 4 years get a new pair of docs I basically just wear one shoe and this one is it After the first week this shoe is worn to fit you which is great and comfy Another perk of docs So I ve gotten this particular shoe 3 times I gotta still give it raves but my hubby wants me to get a different style I won t get anything now but docs Why a different style Well I just had a baby recently and most of the leggings and stuff I wear well is black and my docs have ALWAYS been brown You know to go with a great pair of khaki s I wonder if he ll notice if I get the same shoe but in black 
There isn t a more comfortable tennis casual shoe made PERIOD The leather on this shoe is glove soft and the sole is like a featherbed I always enjoyed adidas tennis sneakers over the years but this is the only sneaker that allows me to serve and volley with comfort and agility as if I was floating across the court THey just look cool to I look forward to buying 2 more pairs as back ups and tryingthe stan smith II as well JUst try these you will love em 
Delighted to have the same convenience to purchase apparels Thank you for these new line of offerings Some us that prefer the convenience of online shopping due to busy schedules can now keep up with our fashion tastes without the inconvenience of finding time to go to the malls

Lambskin leather belt bag I give the order processing an A+ due to receiving the product within three days The bag on the other had leaves a bit to be desired While the material used is soft the inexpensive zippers are difficult to operate with one hand 
Great product The collar stays work well and the shipping was on par I will consider ordering from this company again 
Mens Collar Stays for Dress Shirts Review The collar stays are great They came in a convenient little container and now I m not searching all over the laundry room floor for the collar stays that fell out of my husband s dress shirts The different lengths were helpful because he has different style shirts and the collar stays came very quickly

Okay shirt This is the kind of shirt which you get what you pay for The material isn t that bad well made The style is okay looking smart but not geeky It s good value though 
Excellent shirts Two co workers and I ordered these shirts We are all extremely satisfied with them These shirts are an excellent value We would recommend them highly to all our friends and colleagues 
fine quality great price I was wary about buying since the price was so low but the shirt is quite good I own many brands of dress shirts some are expensive some not This is a nice shirt It isn t see thru like some of the other reviews said It is just right for wearing under a suit in the warmer weather You can go wrong at this price 
Great Buy As always Amazon com delivers right on time and great quality I bought this shirt for my son in law who will be changing job positions and will require dress shirts and suits He lives in another state so it is great to use the bill to this address and ship to this address feature that Amazon com offers My son in law was very pleased with the shirt and service 
Just as I expected Nice shirt Well made Good price What more can I say 
Bill Blass shirts The shirts are what I had asked for They are sturdy and well made I would buy more if I needed more Well worth the money spen 
Great shoe These are a great pair of shoes feel good look good and very lightweight That is why I am buying a second pai 
A great running shoe Adidas traditional running shoe suede nice touch feeling Great quality It is quite green with less white 3 stripes 
Great everyday shirt at a great price As the wife of the wearer I find these shirt to be great and long lasting and though not their claim by any means pretty darn stain resistant too The color does hold true throughout many washings While the Wrinkle Free portion isn t 100 true they do come out of the dryer looking better than most and after a light starch and ironing stay quite crisp during a day s wearing The manufacturing quality in my experience is also great I ve never had a problem with a loose seam or button I also love that Van Heusen offers a shirt in a size 18 neck with a 32 33 sleeve My husband is an average size guy with a greater than average neck so finding this 18 32 33 combo is dang near impossible in other brands Thanks Van Heusen 
Great product Great product I got exactly what I wanted I would give it 5 stars but they didn t have the dark brown you see in the picture Instead I got a Khaki color I was very happy with their service and prompt reply Just make sure they have the color you want 
Great Service Product is great perfect fit and cool style The package arrived well on time 
Comfy Sweet cap if you like the style It fits well and is well made I love it 
Andrew Christian should always be one of you fist places to stop Great style quality products and the prices are unbelievable Finally some who has a great variety of clothes and XL hat sizes Andrew Christian is definitely at the top of my list 
Cool Vintage Cap Very stylish this fashion is spreading at the moment Don t forget to check the sizing chart first before you buy it It s important Cool cap 
cool cat This hat fits good It s cool and fashionable You can wear it anywhere and I got a lot of compliments 
Still not disppointed The Vintage Fatigue Cap is a great looking great fitting true to size item I was very happy when my cap arrived and saw that it looked better than I had imagined even though the advertisement picture provided was an excellent reproduction The cap came within the specified time and was packeged to arrive in excellent condition Once again I am very happy with a product that I ordered through Amazon and its vendor 
No fears on my wedding day I bought the breast petals so that I wouldn t have to worry on my wedding day I did not want to wear a bra because of the style of dress I had This product was great It was easy to apply and did the job They came off easily at the end of the night I wore them for about 8 hours and had no problems at all I would highly recommend them to anyone 
These maintained my virtuous self I love wearing those tank tops with shelf bras or summer dresses that can t be worn with a bra but the nipple issue was quite vexing I didn t feel comfortable with any nip protrusion the only disadvantage in having implants is that they tend to be a bit nipply But problem solved These things rock 
Boots Lasted 8 Years My first pair of 10 eyelet DM boots lasted 8 years before the heel came apart from the sole I m on my 2nd pair now I don t think they will last as long but you never know 
Nothing better on the market Some people scoff they say 100 + for boots no way too expensive I have been wearing DR s for 10 years and nothing else Why Because nothing holds up like DR Martins Oddly my first pair ever fell apart after a couple of weeks the stiching just fell out but I exchanged them and have never had that problem since The average pair last me 2 3 years of everyday non stop wear I where them all year around on the sales floor wharehouse or office and everywhere I go They will not come apart I only get new ones when the old ones look worn and stretched and when the soles start to wear smooth 14 18 months of 8 14hr day wear seven days a week and then I keep the old pair for another 14 18 months for working outside or any dirty job I have to do where I don t want to damage my good pair I got married in DR Martins pollished with a new double breasted suite They look great with everything Jeans cargos Dress clothes shorts I bought my wife a pair of dress sandles nearly three years ago they still look like brand new These boots are forever 
great glasses i have purchased 2 pairs from 80s purple and i love them both they are very cool and durable for such thin framed glasses the shipping is always ahead of schedule and they are very well packaged i don t plan on buying sun glasses anywhere else 
GREAT SERVICE thanks so much I bought these glasses and they had a minor defect They responded to my email very quickly and I was send another pair within days Would definetly do business with again THANKS 
Five stars for customer service Not to mention a great pair of sunglasses at a great price Initially there was a problem with my order but Lu at 80s Purple was very helpful and once contact was made things were settled in a timely and orderly fashion I was very impressed with the customer service end as that is always important when dealing with a seller or vendor after the initial purchase has been made The glasses are great Though thought of as some as 80 s Retro or what have you Aviator sunglasses are like Chuck Taylor Converse shoes like cowboy hats like your favorite solid color T shirt Its Americana Classic and Cool which is what makes it buck the trend and stand the test of time I love my new shades They also come in a great hard case so you can stow them anywhere and not worry about them getting damaged Beyond that even why pay over 100 dollars for a pair of name brand sunglasses that are made of plastic when you can get something with sturdier more durable metal frames Even beyond that the UV rating on these is actually not any lower than anything else I ve ever worn solidifying the fact that not only are you getting what you pay for here but if your not buying here and paying more elsewhere you are most likely wasting your money I was very impressed with the professionalism and kindness showed to me by customer support Thanks 80s purple 
They look great but for metal frames they feel delicate I bought a pair similar to these from a vender at a rest stop and when those broke I ordered these They come in a nice bag and they re metal not plastic frames You wouldn t know from looking at them since they re so thin and light The lenses are full mirrored and scratch pretty easily I hugged someone while they were hanging from my shirt collar and there are nicks But they are wicked cool looking block plenty of sun and unless you look really closely you can t see my eyes which is the point Goes great with The Sisters of Mercy Floodlands CD 
Thrilled I am absolutely THRILLED with my aviator sunglasses They look absolutely amazing and pricey I cannot believe how sophisicated and polished it looks And for just 14 dollars It s a total steal And the shipping was super fast 
Pretty Good These sunglasses are all right They were a little crooked but still cool 
GREAT AND TOTALLY CELEBRITY Best sunglasses ever I ve received sooo many compliments and that i look like a movie star and they are a reasonable price and they look EXSPENSIVE Best sunglasses ever They are sooo comfortable you ll forget your wearing them and they look totally vintage Trust me buy them 
Took Me Through the Danger Zone Best aviator sunnies I ve ever owned This is my second pair because my first pair got lost I really like that these are 5 2 inches wide as opposed to the standard 5 inches so they can fit on my fat head and not squeeze my brain 
Almost as much a part of me as my feet I started wearing these shoes when I was 19 Five years later I ve gone through two pairs about to buy my third but they ve been my one and only pair of shoes I just haven t had the desire to wear anything else I ve worn them for nearly 12 hours a day every single day year round working at a job during the day that requires constant movement and then walking around the city at night You can t really tell by looking at them that they ve been literally everywhere with me They could use a bit of a polish but other than that nothing s worn down I suppose if I wore more shoes I would only need one pair of these and they d last longer But thats not stopping me 
Nice looking but I had blisters and painful feet for 3 weeks until these shoes broke in If you buy these make sure you get band aids too 
These shoes may be the last pair you ll ever need to buy I bought my first pair of Doc s when I was 16 After joining the military traveling to nearly 50 different countries in sleet snow and boiling deserts in the Middle East this same pair of shoes still look great today 20 years later albeit scuffed up Indeed last week I had a casual business meeting with a little spit elbow grease and an old towel I used to dry off my dog they cleaned up quite nicely and worked well with my Docker khaki s They re exceptionally comfortable timeless and well worth the price How many 20yr old pair of shoes do you own That s like what 5 yr The style colour conscience among you might want to consider another pair in black They re that good like an old friend reliable stylish and right there with you to conquer life s many challenges I highly recommend them josef 
Worth the money and the trouble These shoes really do wear like iron and are superbly comfortable once they are broken in The sizing takes some getting used to I recommend buying or at least trying on Dr Martens in a store the first time to find out one s size in the British system My USA size is 10D Yet the Dr Martens that works for me is UK 10 USA 11 Go figure When the first pair of these I got began to look shabby I simply polished it with brown shoe polish That pair of shoes is still fine after being worn more days than any shoes I have ever had 
Love them These are so adorable my daughter loves them and wears them all the time 
FUN WINTER BOOT I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY LITTLE GIRL SHE LOVES THEM SHE GET ALOT OF COMPLIMENTS ON THEM QUALITY IS GREAT AND THEY TEND TO RUN BIG 
HoHoHo My daughter loved her new boots from Santa I was concerned when I was sent a size 13 5 instead of a 3 5 BUT all worked out the exchange was speedy and I had the correct size boots within 2 days That was awesome We recently had a chilly couple days here in South Florida and my daughter was able to wear her Snuggy Boots to school 
Comfortable and great traction These shoes are very comfortable for walking or running on both pavement and trails They have much better traction than the last pair of trail runners I had even on wet slightly muddy pavement The aggressive lugs in the sole do tend to hold mud however so I have to check them before I come into the house The shoes seem to run a bit wider than the other NB shoes that I have worn so I need to wear thick socks with them even with my wide feet Overall I am happy with the shoes 
Nice Gift I ordered this blouse for my daughter because she has to wear oxford blouses at work She said she was very pleased with the blouse just didn t like ironing However oxford blouses are expensive and this is a great bargain Today I ordered 3 more for her 
Great shoes These shoes are great If you have any problems with your feet New Balance is the way to go But what was most impressive about this order was how quickly I received them I got them within a day or two I was very impressed 
excellent My transaction was as smooth as it could have been The product is of fine quality The company was prompt and informing 
new balance Excellent shoe excellent company You can do no better than this and prices are exceptional Highly recommend 
a MUST HAVE for every woman Oh my goodness I don t know what I would do without my Spanx I will never wear a pair of work slacks without them A nice pair of trousers will have some polyester involved in it well this stuff clings to bulges and panty lines Spanx gets rid of VPL and smoothes out those little areas we don t like to mention So fabrics that have a little more flow to them will actually flow and not cling You will look more neat and tidy in your clothes and you might even look a few pounds lighter They are so comfortable and because it is thin nylon material you can wear them during the warm summer months Don t be fooled by imitations Spanx brand is the only one you want when it comes to quality and doing what it promises I recommend the medium control even if you have a little bit of tummy to hide it still works well on me The super tends to be a little tighter so size up if you are going to get them 
Very Impressed We received our item well within the time specified It was exactly what we ordered We are very happy with this service and will use it again 
Great Panty very comfortable I have 4 pair and will buy more I love the fit and they are so comfortable to wear 
One Perfect Bag I found myself carrying several bags to transport all my items even though I had a really nice large leather bag This bag takes care of the problem of everything being thrown in together The compartments are roomy with space enough for everything including lunch I am contemplating getting this bag in red also Everyone who sees it wants it 
this is the only travel laptop bag you ll ever need this bag is awesome it s not big enough to use as a suitcase but for women carrying a laptop bag and a purse can be a hassle this eliminates that problem because it fits your laptop and anything else you could feasibly need to carry with you i just put my purse right in there the only problem is that i have a 15 laptop which fits in the bag but the velcro strap that holds the laptop in place barely fits over it it does though but it would be good if that were a little longer to hold it more securely also for those with a laptop bigger than 15 this bag is not for you i also love the outer pocket perfect for your boarding pass and other travel documents you may have to access several times and quickly 
actually fits an 18 laptop It was hard to find a tote for my wife s 18 laptop I sent 3 back that said they worked but didn t 
Red tote The color is great its roomy enough to carry everything But that can also be a problem its like a overnight case So for everyday things like back and forth to the office with the laptop it might be a little too big 
Gorgeous Wallet I have been looking for a new wallet to replace the dinosaur I currently have My biggest issue is that I have several cards hard and soft that I have stuffed everywhere which made my old wallet big and unwieldy You could say it would be useful as a weapon it was so big It would take me forever to find things The Kenneth Cole wallet was just what I needed It has several pockets and since I hardly ever carry cash I can use the extra space for receipts and the soft cards Much slimmer and lighter to carry The change purse part is small but isn t a problem for me since I don t carry that much change anyway Since change is bulky by nature I would prefer a separate change purse anyway The leather is very smooth and I love the avocado color makes it stand out in the black hole that is my purse 
Item on sale and a value for dance or yoga and pilates This is a good undecorated leotard I am fussy about such things as snugness fabric surface and stitching with new clothing especially exercise and dance attire Everything is fine Time will tell how well it holds up to wearing and the laundry 
Absolutely worth it The Charles David strike high heel sling is stylish and sophisticated It s an update of a classic that will never go in the back of the closet The fit is true to size and is surprisingly comfortable I intend to wear this for work and for going out I couldn t be happier with this purchase 
A Good Standard Jock This is essentially the Standard 10 Bike Jock in Grey You ve worn this jock for years and this one is no different except for the color I wore it today to the gym it fit great in the pouch holding everything in place the wide 3 inch waistband and thick 1 inch straps I prefer wider leg straps as they don t roll under your cheeks felt great and I ll be using it again in the future The grey color is a nice masculine change if you get tired of white or black jocks If you want a good sturdy traditional jock this is it 
A Real Man s Jock Strap This is the real thing Not only is it light and easy to wash it holds your package in place like a jock is supposed to This is a real man s jock strap 
Great stylish beautiful NineWest certainly know how to make great shoes for not that high price Thank You NineWes 
stylish comfortable Nine West shoes are always a hit with me They are true to size fit perfectly The tread on the bottom of the boot is great for winter weather walking These boots look great with jeans 
Funny Cheap and entertaining this bag is a hit at work We were surfing the internet one night and decided he would be a great greeter for our guests Everyone loves him I higly recommend 
great lightweight jacket great jacket lightweight with a nice waxy coating to protect against rai 
Real Comfort If Little Ventilation I was leery of trying a mule type sneaker wondering if it would would slap my heel with a thwak every time I took a step Still I m the kind of person who ll go shoeless rather than tie laces The Travel Time Mule is very comfortable and I tested my pair walking miles upon miles at a local attraction My feet sit securely in them and they re just so easy to take on and off My only complaint is that there is no ventilation to the shoe The top which could easily provide a little air if differently constructed is solid so that by day s end your feet will definitely be on the warm side However the comfort and ease these shows provide make that only a moderate inconvenience 
comfy shoes good price Got these as a gift for my mom for Christmas She wanted a shoe to put by the front door so she could go out and get the paper in the morning get the mail etc These shoes are perfect easy to slip on and off and very comfortable They are a little narrow so that is why i am givng them 4 stars but other than that they are wonderful 
These shoes are made for walking Not really but they should be Very comfortable 
Great pants Nice construction and style Very comfortable Perfect for working out or lounging if you re lazy 
Love Them Shoes I love my Vaneli Shoes I have gotten so many compliments on them Besides being very stylish they are way comfortable 
thermal pants I was surprise by the narrowness of the pants but please with the light thickness of the material It does keep you warm 
Excellent Fast Ship best price new item Excellent Fast Ship best price new ite 
Great passport holder I love the variety of neon colors Amazon offers for the passport holder Its easy to find in my bag when I m at the customs counter or on the airplane 
quick delivery nice quality I like the service and product The company is considerate enough to put on a size chart for people who are confused about which size of gloves to pick from online stores This becomes very handy The glove itself is soft and warm It will be an ideal gift for my dad s birthday in June although he won t be wearing it until this winter 
Gorgeous I bought these for my Dad and they are lovely and warm and he really seemed to apreciate them a lot 
Incorrect sizing chart utilized I purchased a bathing suit using the sizing chart that the seller provided and it proved to be very inaccurate I purchased a size small based on the chart and it doesn t come close to fitting The suit is not exchangeable since it is sold by a California merchant Now I am out of pocket and the suit does not fit I do not recommend this merchant to others 
Awesome but I had the same problem about it not really being true to size I m small 5 0 and about 100lbs but when I put the small on it was tight I don t have much weight to lose so I guess I ll be spending more time in the gym toneing up I ve gotten lots of compliments on it though 
Best Casual Shorts and the Price is Right The shorts I purchased were very light weight was was an excellent quality considering the heat These shorts come in even sizes up to 42 These shorts have elastic on each side which lets the shorts expand during the day particularly when you are working and your pockets get full or your work belt gets added weight These shorts were the most excellent buy of this type that I have ever made 
Great bra extender I have been very pleased with this item It is well made and is comfortable 
Oddities at the touch of a finger Easy and convenient Quick delivery and walah Thanks Amazon for offering so many products 
Great Football Gear My son needed this in a hurry because his team was in the regions games and the weather changed quickly He was warm and did not freeze with this cold gear It was also the perfect color to match his uniform 
Too Small Not mentioned in the description of this product is how it only fits children 
Great shoes I have really enjoyed the Biker style shoe They are light but yet supportive enough Especially enjoy the velcro closers don t worry about tripping over untied laces 
comfy I took this dark blue sleep tee on a 10 day vacation crumpled it in my luggage spilled coffee on it all the usual errors It always looked and more importantly FELT great It didn t ride up was a nice dark color so it didn t show any dirt from falling on the bathroom floors of hotels and was always comfortable Not cheap but it really took a beating from travel and still felt great I ll enjoy it now at home 
Comfy and cozy sleeping I bought two in different colors and love them They are soft but sturdy and practical They are easy to wash with plenty of fabric to cozy up around your legs and a slit side to make movement easy The vee neck is flattering You can t go wrong with the excellent price either 
Poor fake It reminds me of a cheap imitation patch that my grandmother would sow onto a hat I have several MLB hats and this isn t anywhere near the same quality 
LOVE THEM These shoes were exactly what I was looking for I was worried after reading previous customer reviews that these shoes run small narrow because I have a wide foot However they fit perfectly The straps are feminine and the gold sole provides just enough glitz And with a retail price of 105 how can you beat this great deal 
Sizing is wrong These shoes are more of a 5 than a 6 They are labeled as 6M but I even had an aunt who is 5� try them on and they were tight on her 
perfect for the task This short is minimalistic Just what you need if you are doing Yoga Grips the leg does not show what you do not what to show I use black underpants under them as they are a bit too minimalistic without I think they are a bit overpriced but I have not found as good a short for less low demand 
My favorite yoga shorts The Mantra short by Prana is my favorite short for yoga I practice Ashtanga which is a very active form of yoga so my body is twisting and turning a lot The Mantra short is a great length not too short but not too long It fits my leg well too it hugs it without being too ungodly tight I recommend it 
EasyGo Travel Pillow with Pouch Black The EasyGo Travel Pillow with Pouch Black is functional comfortable and had timely shipping It also makes a nice travel gift 
handy travel item Though maybe just a bit less comfortable as the new pre filled travel pillow this is much more practical especially if you re taking multiple ones for different family members We traveled to Europe 3 planes with a 6 1 2 year old and he used it too just with a little less inflation It is comforatble durable inexpensive and transports easy in a purse or little side pocket of a carry on 
Excellent coat This coat is worth the money I love it It is actually very warm as well 
Good description of the product I thank them a small packing for the shipment I will buy one at this time Please put the shoes in a small box because when they put on in a big packing that is very expensive for my You complete measures of security for the articles but sometimes oneself articulates it is wrapped up different in small or very big packings I thank if it is possible to put it in a single very small box so that I pay less for the shipment I transfer to my country because there are very big differences of money thank you MORAIMA MENDOZA 
straightaway I love the shoes but I suffer with an arch problem and sometimes they hurt my feet but I suffer through it I do love the style 
good buy This is the second pair of these i bought for my wife She loves them Fit is great and they look good 
Great Panties These are stretchy and soft It s a little hard getting used to how boyshorts are so high up in the back but once used to it it s fine They re really well priced and they do run small like the merchant says We will be buying more 
4 star I had to return them because of wrong size I would like to know if you have them at a size 40 Please let me know or tell me who I can contact to re order the item Thank 
Perfect I just received these today and absolutely love them They re small very lightweight and extremely comfortable They fit perfectly due to the spandex but doesn t fit so tight as to cause any discomfort They also aren t too revealing which is what I was afraid of before I tried them on I have them in black so I can t speak for the white pair but I d definitely consider these for your next pair 
not a swim trunk I purchased this thinking it would be a bona fide swim trunk After all the word trunk is in its description It ends up being an athletic support brief in a box cut hardly something a serious swimmer would think of wearing 
Square cut chick magnet These square cut Puma trunks will get you hot looks at the beach if you have a good physique Very comfortable and way better tan lines than board shorts Puma logo is big enough to be noticed and will definitely garner comments especially on a beach full O label ho s LOL Have fun be happy and don t be a hater 
Ahhh Fruit of the Loom These products are worth every penny well made deliciously comfortable easily laundered They iron well and keep their shape They last for years and there is just something so comfortingly old fashoined about this brand and it s reliabilty 
Absolutely brilliant engineering and comfort These bras are PERFECT I hand wash mine and they last a long time This bra does keep the ladies in the right position without any arm going numb discomfort I ve tried many bras in my lifetime to try to get that semi sleazy cleavage in the right position and not have my shoulders be cut off from the weight on the straps There you go Bali Seductive Curves Bras are practically bullet proof and are comfy to boot If I was rich I d buy stock 
The cups wrinkle This bra fits me properly and I am fastidious about how I wash and store my lingere Still the cups gave up their sleekness and I can t wear it with a t shirt or other close fitting tops 
Sexy Shoes These shoes look fantastic on They are very high heels so my suggestion is to only wear them for dinner and you ll be comfortable Worth the price 
FAB SHOES This comfortable under price beautiful shoes are the best buy I had in months And believe me I buy a lot of shoes From Prada to Christian Louboutin The design it s original innovative and fashionista Why are they so cheap I have no idea 
The black dye came off on my feet I loved these slippers except that the black dye came on on me feet and am having a hard time getting the dye off I suggest getting the natural ones They re a great slipper otherwise Thanks 
Ugg slippers Loved these Comfortable and the fit is great if you go down a size you normally wea 
UGG COQUETTE SLIPPERS I purchased these for my 12 year old daughter They are beutiful and she loves them She wears them as shoes outside At first I was so worried about them getting ruined and dirty but they are very hardy and wipe clean very easily We are both very happy with the purchase 
UGG COQUETTE Fantastic I wear a 7 5 shoe maybe 8 sometimes yet I fit perfectly into a size 7 Coquette 
UGGs Don t face winter without them Super comfortable Super Warm I only own 3 pairs but it s still early in the season 
Very nice shoe This was my very first pair of Tsubo shoes I have since purchased many more I fell in love with these first site and first try on They simply feel fabulous on my feet and get many compliments from others These shoes are the bomb 
Tsubo I heart tsubo shoes they are always comfortable and last And I know they always fit My first pair at least 3 years old finally developed a crack in the sole but are otherwise fine Tsubos and Blundstones I need nor want any other shoes OK I need Shimanos for the clipless bike pedals too Hey Tsubo how about making some bicycling shoes 
Great shoes Many fashionable shoes keep that as their main focus This is my second pair of Tsubos and I am continually impressed by the incredible comfort and durability they provide while maintaining its stylishness 
Cabin Cuddler is a hit This was a gift for my mom I ve never actually seen it and she loves it It arrived on time for her birthday and she s planning to buy them for all of her other world traveling friends 
warm but awkward It is very warm but it is somewhat awkward to get it 
Cabin Cuddler Comment I saw the Cabin Cuddler featured in the Travel section of our Sunday paper and thought of my daughter in law who is always wrapping up in blankets to keep warm I ordered one for her birthday and she loves it It is lightweight and easy to use whether she is at home or traveling to visit us She loves the handy foot pocket to keep her feet warm 
Fantastic and cuddly I ve traveled with it and just used it to cuddle up I m very pleased with my purchase and its handy bag thanks 
Perfect for home I bought this for travel but have ended up using it virtually everyday while at home Its great for curling up on the couch and keeping your feet snuggly warm The design is so creative with a foot pocket and separate shoulder wrap I haven t seen anything like it I ve been giving it as gifts to family members and it gets rave reviews from everyone travellers and couch potatoes alike 
A TRULY FANTASIC PRODUCT An absolutely wonderful product I was given one as a gift and can t do without it on my regular business holiday flights It stores very neatly and attaches conveniently to your flight case Congratulations on a truly brilliant product EVERYONE WHO TRAVELS SHOULD HAVE ONE No more itchy small airline blankets for me Buy one for your husband wife sister brother mother father friend anyone who travels frequently A STAR PRODUCT 
Great at home too The Cabin Cuddler was great on the plane but I use it at home too on those chilly nights when you don t want to rack up the heating bill It is perfect for watching television or reading and having hands free to turn pages or work the remote It is pet friendly too and so easy to wash and dry I am very pleased with it 
great product great product shoes didn t fit and return was easy no problems at al 
I Hit the Jackpot Trying to find a great present for my grandson is quite challenging These were a smashing hit I wouldn t be surprised if he slept with them on 
Best gift ever My son LOVES his Heelys I can t say enough about how much he uses them and how wonderfully they are made I like the fact that you can change out the wheel to use as regular sneakers during school time and have the wheels in for after school play I ve also already had to wash them and they came out great Definitely best gift for my 7 year old It only took about two days to get the hang of how to ride on them 
Beginner Well i tried these on in a store and they seemed to fit great but wen i receieved them they were a bit tight but i m assuming it was due to them being new they squished my toes a bit but once u kind of move ur toes around you can find a good position for them other than that im not used to such a high heel but im gonna give it a try today these shoes are beautiful and for 20 im not complaining they make anybody s legs look great and once i get used to them i plan on buying more if you love 3 3 4 4 inch heels you ll love thes 
Review The shoes looked wide in front but upon trying out my toes are squashed and it can be quite uncomfortable Nontheless the heels are nice and presentable Can only be worn for a short time 
Excellent buy These shoes are an excellent buy if you are looking for a high fashion look Unfortunately they were too spiky for me But the quality of the shoes is great Very upscale rich look 
Magic Scarf I love these scarves I have one in nearly every color I even talked my sister into making me several of them They wash up well and are very warm I have six of these kind and several of the kind that Target has Try it you ll like it 
I love these scarves I agree with everyone else on this one I do love these beautiful scarves they are the softest and warmest scarves I have ever bought I own 3 of them myself Where I live they are very popular and nearly everyone I know has at least one of them However I bought mine at the local mall for 5 99 so I would not buy them on here for twice as much but if it s convenient for you guys out there go for it 
AMAZING They sell magic scarves at the Hallmark near my house and my friend and I went in a bought two of them because they were so pretty and soft and we didn t even notice that they were big tubes until we got in the car and started playing with them I wear it every day and it hasn t gotten messed up at all and it s amazingly warm and perfect There s so many different ways to wear it and I love it Even my boyfriend wants one now 
Magic Scarfs Are The Best The pink one concludes my pink clothing look Magic scarfs are fun to put on your head and say GIVE ME YOUR MONEY I did this when I was on vaction and my cousin did it with me her mom just laughed This scarf is the best 
fun and versatile I received a maroon one as a gift and have gotten endless complements on it When I walked into a knitting shop the owner thought I had made it until she looked closely at it s edge I wish I could knit one like it I tried to knit one and couldn t get it to have the resiliency It becomes a long tube scarf or a becoming hat capelet It s fluffy yet warm though light even though it isn t wool It washes easily HIghly recommended 
Fuzzy and so silky soft I saw one of these scarves at the J and M bookstore in Auburn University during a big game weekend and it was sold in the University s colors of Orange and blue This scarf is soft and stretchy but no matter what you do to it it stays fluffy and fuzzy with a silky powder puff texture to it I think I might wait to go back and get the orange and blue version though I like those colors better than the those shown above 
Alright I go to high school and my class color is purple Finally I found something that is cool to wear on color wars days They look very good and do not look cheap at all They were also very bright and shiny I am very pleased 
MY SHORTS They look great feel great I wear them to B ball practice and my mom broght me another pair cause I like them so much I reck a men you buying a pair or 
Great Quality Great Design I bought this shirt for my husband to wear during the Super Bowl since he planned to view the game with a die hard Bears fan Let s just say that die hard fan wanted to know where we got it because he loved the design The price sure is right too And even though my husband is a Vikings fan this is one shirt he wears anyway 
Great shirt Great shirt Colors are great Sizing is generous so don t order big 
Feels like wearing nothing These are the most comfortable panties I have ever owned in my life They fit right don t ride up and look like new washing after washing I hope to never have to do without the Vanity Fair Microfiber panties again I would pay 10 a pair for these if I had to they truly are awesome 
Outstanding seller Did business in the past with them and will do so in the future 
Outstanding cargo pants for hard wear I always have a hard time with my 17 year old son finding long pants that are durable and yet comfortable enough to compete with his soccer shorts Length is always an issue for us since he s 6 6 with 36 inseam These cargo pants were perfect They are well made durable long enough and have drawstrings both at waist and ankle for size adjustment Plenty of cargo space for cell phone keys wallet and more I ordered 3 pair and am glad I did 
I love these pants These are great pants very comfortable The zipper is a bit rough but other than that I love these pants Now I know why my son always wears his combat fatigues even when he is out of uniform 
cool pants big boy I have a big butt and big legs these fit really comfortably the zipper sometimes sticks on them but I love the pants 
BDU Pants My Son s happy with items from this Seller Good communication from Seller regarding delay arrived within reasonable time and prior to X mas Will Return 
FAVORITE PANTS I bought these pants for my son and he loves them I got a pair in every color and this is all he wears they do not shrink but we did find they run small in the waist he is 13 and wears a 29 waist and we had to get the mens medium i thought the small would have fit but it was a very fast exchange with the company no problems at all and they tie on the bottom so the lenghth does not matter will buy again very well made product A+++++++++ THANKS 
A Great Value for the Money As an emergency response volunteer I need comfortable sturdy pants with a lot of pockets These fit the bill nicely The pockets are a good size and easy to secure The pants are lightweight and comfortable while being able to take some abuse thanks to the reinforced knees and tough material My only question is what the drawstrings on the legs are for They don t actually gather the leg when you pull them In fact they don t seem to have any purpose at all I am happy with the purchase and I am sure I will purchase the same thing again 
Great The size was perfect and so was the color It looked just like it did on the web page 
Good shoe for the price Shoe is fairly comfortable gives excellent support when running and still allows your feet to breathe 
Very Nice Very very comfortable great price would purchase again Better than my Nike Shocks 
Very Satisfied it was what I expected and the price was right The shoes lived up to my expectations you just need to wear them couple of days or run couple of hours before they fully adjust to your feet 
one of the best shoes I ve owned The Adidas a3 Gigaride is definitely one of the best athletic shoes I ve ever owned I usually go with Nike Jordan brand but I decided to give these pair a try and I m very happy with them The cushioning system is very similiar to the Nike Shox but feels much more isolated from the shocks of running on pavement At the same time the cushioning does not feel mushy or too soft It is very controlled and firm at the same time I d recommend a pair ito anyone who likes to run 
Great for keping hands warm and dry I am not sure why but I get just a little water in through one of the gloves I drive a concrete mixer and use them anytime I am dealing with water They are durable and do an execellent job of keeping my hands warm and dry with exception of the one leak 
GREAT This one actually WORKS The others I have tried rolled down and made your situation worse looking And these are easy to wash I just throw mine in a mesh pantihose bag and in the washer comes out perfect Love them 
Memory Foam slipper purchase I recently purchased a pair of these slippers as a gift for a family member Shipping was extremly prompt and I received them in three days Although a very nice product one of the slippers was obviously used worn so I emailed the company with this information I received a response from TV Guys the very next day asking for a phone number where I could be reached so that the problem could be resolved I emailed them my number and received a call the following day The gentleman I spoke with was very apologetic explained that he had no idea how this could have happened and asked what he could do to fix the situation I asked for a full refund and he was more than willing to refund my entire purchase as well as the shipping charges I had incurred Because of the promptness and professionalism with which this incident was handled I will order from them again in the future 
good service We received the sweatshirt in a timely manner In fact sooner than expected The sweatshirt was exactly what we expected and of good quality I am very happy with the service 
Great This is a great sweatshirt Exactly how it was listed I gave it as a gift and he loved it 
Great Jacket Great Jack at a reasonable cost Material is excellent and comfortable to wear out of the package choice of color Shipped in a timely manner Would continue to buy On Line from Amazon 
The best stockings ever I absolutely love these stockings They are beautiful durable and comfortable The micro mesh pattern is a classier more subtle version of the fishnet which means you can wear these to work without giving your boss a heart attack 
Quality Quality These are great jeans My 4 year old son has now begun crawling around while playing with his cars these jeans hold out for a very long time I will get these and Old Navy jeans any day 
bowling shoes We were very pleased with our recently ordered bowling shoes They were a little tight initially but now fit quite well and look femanine They were received in record time as well Thanks 
DEXTER BOWLING SHOES I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE BOWLING SHOES THEY ARE ACTUALLY NICER THAN THE PIC SHOWED SERVICE WAS FAST AND EASY 
Good value for the money I m a recreational bowler so I only bowl once in a while I m not a great bowler but these shoes are a great value for the money So far no complaints 
Comfortable and well made shoes I love my new bowling shoes The size was right on target unlike clothes where sometimes a size 5 pant fits but yet another pair of the same size in another brand name is way too big or small Order a size shoe you normally wear They are light weight and durable Expedient delivery and great courteous service too 
bowling shoes Great pair of shoes for the price They are very comfortable and stylish 
Great shoes Much better than renting I like the shoes and there really pretty Hopefully I will improve my game Good shoe great price 
Bowling shoes worth wearing Now I m no expert on bowling shoes The only ones I had ever worn were the rentals at the alley but I bought these and they are super comfortable and lightweight Believe it or not they actually helped me improve my bowling game because I have better control now They seem to run true to size because I bought my usual 7 1 2 and they fit like there custom made 
Nice bowling shoe I especially like the look of this shoe I like bowling but not the bowling shoes Dexter Bowling Dottie is a nice looking shoe 
Pretty but The colors are MUCH brighter than they appear I still like it though Just not quite as versitile as I had hoped 
Great jacket This jacket is beautiful fits great and looks very expensive and professional I ordered this jacket big enough that I can pair it with a nice long sleeve button down shirt The sizing is great 
Leather blazer review My husband was very happy with the leather blazer The leather is very soft and a beautiful color The fit was also very good We were happy with this purchase 
Cute shoes it s everything i expected fits like true size and the real thing looks sooo much better than the photos plus it s soo comfortable I can walk all day in these babies and i dont even feel a pinch in my feet it s absolutely awesome 
Trust Quality Name Brand Pedro Slip on is easy get in and out it is perfect for folks on the run Department store would cost twice the price plus tax 
Look no further when the temperature drops Best 50 bucks I ve ever spent I have a valet job and work outside all winter I wear these things every day under a pair of thin Dockers and they are fantastic I m a bigger guy and the compression gear tops don t work well with my big gut these are just right for my lower body type If you re a size 38 40 waist like me go with the XXL it s just the right size Combined with the Under Armour Driver Mock actually a golf item my base layer is perfect I never get cold I recently wore the same combination skiing and the leggings were perfect under my snow pants Just pull them up to the top of the sock with a little overlap and no moisture accumulates against your body whatsoever a very important element of staying warm and safe when it s cold out All of Under Armour s products I have tried do a great job of this moisture transportation away from your skin and I ll never wear cotton or other long underwear again Do yourself a favor and try these out they are the new gold standard in my book 
When the cold winds howl and so do you I hate the cold I mean I really HATE it after getting frost bite on my nose and ears However I try not to let it slow me down I run except in the coldest weather like now its almost 0F with the wind chill Whenever the temperature drops to 40F or less I wear these and my running shorts I can wear them to about 60F then I overheat and have to shed them They are great except the fit they were too small in the quads so I chose a XXL When the weather gets very cold 25F to 10F I layer additional clothing on top wind pants jeans whatever See my Smartwool reviews about other cold weather gear that I wear 
Make great running tights and more These are probably one of my favorite articles of clothing I am a frequent normally 5+ times a week endurance runner and I have found these to be a great addition to my gym bag Whenever it s too chilly to wear shorts I ll pull on my Underarmour coldgear leggings and throw my shorts on top of them Thay keep my legs nice and warm without overheating them I also tend to use these as a base layer under everything from jeans to my dress pants whenever it s cold out Again they keep my legs warm but not too warm I also like the fit of these leggings They are tight around the legs providing good muscle support and compression good for reducing injuries and soreness without being too uncomfortable in the crotch and rear provided you don t wear anything under them yes they are supposed to be worn as underwear They also have what feels like a synthetic microsuede interior which just ads to the overall comfort level I have heard a few people complain that underarmour heat gear keeps them a bit too cold especially when they don t wear anything on top I like to be slightly cooler when running so these work for me If you can t stand being a bit on the cool side you probably shouldn t leave any part of the tights uncovered wear something over that completely covers them but if you don t yo won t be shivering either 
Puma Contre Slip on GREAT It is very confortable and looks great I recently weent to New York and used it all around IT was very confortable and fashonable 
Like the skirt longer than appears This item appears to be a short mini skirt in the picture but it runs kinda long I wouldnt reccomend going down a size though it runs small around the waist I do like the skirt though its a really cute plaid and nicely styled 
Tom Brady Navy New England Patriots Youth NFL Replica Jersey Large 14 16 We received the jersey when they said we would and it was just what we wa nted 
perfect It was just what I wanted and came quicker than I thought Price was righ 
Thank you My son loves his jersey He tries to wear it every day The quality is very good I would purchase agai 
Very Good This is a gift for my 13 yr old son who does not have it just yet I am positive that he will be very excited and enjoy wearing it

Very comfortable and sharp looking I bought these to wear on vacation in Hawaii They are very comfortable and breathe in hot weather They looked very nice for both semi dress wear and for casual wear When I got home I ordered another pair in brown They are generously cut so if you are on the border of two sizes you may want to go with the smaller one 
Born Women s Tano Dark Brown Excellent shoe It s very comfortable very stylish if you like something a bit retro and versatile If I have to complain about a feature of the shoe is the shoe laces because they re waxy and they tend to come undone but don t let that deter you I highly recommend this shoe 
comfortable and stylish I received the shoes in a timely fashion and love wearing them 
I love my Clarks Clark shoes are like no other shoes that I ve worn You can put a new pair on and walk several miles and your feet will not hurt There is no waiting for your feet to get accustomed to the shoe You put them on and go 
Lovely and comfortable These shoes are another well spent purchase of Clarks They are really comfortable and attractive And with all my other pairs of Clarks I had to wear them in for a few days so that they would not chaffe my achilles tendon Warning wear socks or vband aids for a few days or you won t get too far without blisters When the shoes wear in then there are no more blisters and the ride is very luxurious 
Comfy Attractive Shoes These shoes are very pretty and so comfortable and graceful feeling without looking orthopedic at all They are classy and make you look good because you are standing straight up and looking comfy 
Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me i am a 32DD and most bras made for women with larger busts start at 34 if you re lucky this is a godsend and when i put it on it was like a miracle i am running and jumping and all with only one sports bra on i feel like a normal person again it is pricey but what can i do apparently it is a crime to have a bust 
Great for runners I highly reccomend this bra I am a 34E I started training for a half marathon Before I bought this bra I used other thicker sports bras I had cuts underneath my breast after running They were really bad I bought the Shock Absorber and now I can run 13+ miles without any cuts or chaffing Don t let the lightweight feel of the bra fool you It is an excellent bra I am on my third one While I was washing it I tried the other bra again last week and again I got cuts underneath my breast This is an excellent bra for ladies with big breast like me 
Berlei Sports Bras I can recommend these Impact Level 4 Berlei Sports Bras 100 I have 6 of them and have been wearing them for a little over a year They completely minimise bounce and are the most comfortable supportive Sports Bra on the market I wish they would make a skin coloured one 
SIZES where are larger sizes for big chested ladies we exercise also 
Rasta Sandals I purchased these sandles for my 17 year old son He loves them They are good quality sandal and is a good value for the money 
Nice Looking Flip Flop You know after looking at several sites I discovered that it is a little trying to find a simple black flip flop with no pretentious heirs about it I finally found it in this shoe It s your basic run of the mill flip flop but also has a solid black coloring which looks pretty sharp as well The sole seems to be pretty durable and the thick nylon strap seems to keep your foot in place The standard shipment didn t take an exceptionally long amount of time which I liked but once the shoes did arrive I discovered that they came in a simple clear plastic bag No shoe box given Normally I wouldn t have mind as they are only flip flops but as they were ment to be a Christmas gift it would have been nice to have a matching box to wrap them in 
Great fit and shape poor longevity This is the best fitting and most comfortable bra I have ever owned It gives a lovely shape The only problem is the fabric used to make it As another person has said every one of these bras that I ve bought has split The floral outer fabric is so fragile I ve even put my finger through a nearly new one Very disappointing I wish they would make this same bra out of some sturdier fabric Then it would be the perfect bra 
Olga Bras These are the most comfortable bras I have ever bought Most bras do not have a wide enough band on the side so the body tends to hang over the material This bra has a nice wide side band I now have several of these in all 3 colors 
soft comfy This is a great casual shirt Very cute It does run true to size Checking the provided sizing chart is a good idea if you are not sure of the size I wear a 10 12 so I got the extra large because I do not like my clothes snug it fits me fine 
Best Shoes Ever I LOVE these shoes My husband and I own three pairs each 
Personal Trainer Loves them For years I tried many different shoes until I found Saucony s I will not wear anything but Saucony I purchased this style and they are very comfortable I speed walk hike cross country and weight train in them Very comfy sturdy and stylish www bodysculptingbyjanina com 
i heart my Flojos OMG i absolutely loved my sandals they are comfortable match everything and are perfect for summer will buy again plus fast shipping 
mens fragrance bought as a gift for my son i was thought it had a very nice scent my son seems to be pleased with it also 
Average i bought 2 sets of these blue and black because of the price and to really stock up they look nice and just as pictured but the fit on these is less than desirable if you or your man like to just wear their boxers when lounging around the house they may find these have an awkward feel and constraint because of this constraint as far as movement i DO NOT recommend anyone wearing these if they plan on being even remotely active during their day played a couple hours of basketball and these boxers were not comfortable at all for everyday lounging while wearing shorts pants then they feel fine for someone who likes to run jog or play sports i highly recommend finding a different set 
My favorite This is the perfect gown for the hospital and after you get home it makes nusring so much easier Thanks for the great product 
Great gown Love my nursing gown I almost haven t taken it off I have the PJ s too and they are grea 
Awesome gown and great service Thanks so much for the great product It was so cozy and easy to nurse my baby The fabric is also really soft Loved the sizing help before I ordered it saved me from an exchange since I was going to order the wrong size You don t come across alot of companies that give personal service I will definitelly recommend you Samantha 
LOVE IT In fact I m ordering a second for myself and one for a mom to be This was the best nursing gown I ve owned with either pregnancy I love the fact that you really don t have to wear a sleep bra with it and the leak pads stay in place I received it as a gift in the mail and was dying to know who sent it so I could give a big thank you to I love the fact that it has the pull down access intead of the slits It allows you to stay covered if you want to wear it around the house Also it s sexier than most nursing gowns so an added bonus for the husband 
Good Service I ordered these shirts to wear as a uniform dress shirt The price and the product fit my need very well They were also delivered in a timely manner and in perfect condition I was very pleased with my transation 
full figure bra I really like this product Even after a full day I am still comfortable Wearing such a large size is hard to come by sometimes Especially when I enjoy the front closure There are very few to choose from I was lucky to find this It really is comfortable supporting at the the same time This is really hard sometimes trying to find both I feel I found that in this product I hope they don t discontinue the item Thanks again Vanity Fair 
Great Service and a Bargain It s so nice to not have to drive all over town looking for something to find exactly what you want and at a bargain price Super service and what a deal 
Satisfaction I was pleased with the service of the retailer and the quality of the web belt I bought It cost less than other retailers and functions fine Why pay more I received e mails letting me know one belt I ordered was out of stock and would be sent later That doesn t bother me I got my belt in the U S mail The whole process was a lot easier than driving across town to shop in a store which probably would have charged me a great deal more money 
Web Belt Purchase This company Andrew Christian did an excellent job This was a small order Nevertheless the price was reasonable the quality good and the items arrived the same day as my Amazon book purchase Excellent job all around 
Punisher T Shirt Well I was meaning to write you guys about that I ask for 2X large but you guy send me a LG XL shirt I did not want to send it back because i was looking for that kind of shrit for over two years next just make sure that you send a right order that ask for it if don t have just say so 
purple Fine t shirt but didn t know it was Purple Brings to mind the great line from Babylon 5 Londo but in Purple I am stunning 
Soft and Warm I m so happy I took a chance and bought this item it s exactly what I needed I bought the small medium in black and it has a circumference of 23 3 4 Inches 60cm The Headband is curved at the widest point it is 3 inches and narrows to 2 1 4 inches The width of 3 inches is sufficient to completely cover my ears It is only 3 Elastine so there is a minimal stretch and it doesn t feel tight against my head nor is it too loose to require constant adjusting It sits comfortably the polar fleece is what I would call a micro polar fleece it has a small short pile and doesn t feel cheap I have worn this headband in temperatures as low as 15 Degrees Fahrenheit and it keeps my ears warm Unlike earmuffs I can wear the headband indoors it s one less Winter accessory that I have to remove whenever I step inside a building 
Great and very comfortable This shoe is absoultly wonder a very comfortable and a great looking shoe 
Savane Pants No Cuffs I am pleased with the quality of the pants but was disappointed that they did not have cuffs The Web site indicated that pants through waist size 44 had cuffs I ordered size 44 but the pants did not have cuffs 
excellent choice Excellent choice for someone who wants to be casual yet not too casual Comfortable aswell 
great buy I got the sheos promptly They fit the colors are magnificent I d buy again with all the variety I think I have to I m also glad that they come in such an array of sizes I have large feet and I finally have some shoes in my size that aren t granny shoes 
Awesome Usable and comfy but dont wear for long periods These are great lightweight slippers with rubber soles They are warm and handy They provide absolutely no support so if you have bad feet they are not good for wearing for long periods 
Great Moon Boots I do not go without something on my feet These moon boots are a great slipper They are terry cloth and have a flexable rubber sole It feels like I am not wearing anything yet I can walk outside in them I wore out the two pairs I had purchased years ago and searched several cataloges as well as the web for them I am so glad I found them on Amazon com 
Loved this product This is exactly what I was looking for Last year I had a back surgery and I needed a bra that would fit me but would be very lose on my back because my current bra was too tight for my very sensitive back I bought a bra that was two or three sizes bigger than my actual size but it did not work It was still too tight I finnally bought these bra extenders and they are perfect I can continue using my same bras and they are now lose enough so that they do not cause me any pain It comes in pairs of two but I only need to use one of the extenders wich ties to the other extreme of my bra 
Truly useful I m so glad I got these It solved my issues with now too tight bands and I can wear my pre pregnancy bras without complaining that I can t breathe I do have a couple of 3 hook bras that don t conform to the sizes available but since they give you the measurement of the band I was able to get extenders for the bras that fall within the range that they offer I m very happy with those I even ordered a couple more in different colors The items arrived within the shipping estimate they gave despite the holidays And if they offer free shipping for other products in the future I will certainly buy more things from this vendor 
Bra Extenders These were for my mom and they got here in a timely fashion and were what she wanted Pleased with service 
Handy Handy for those of use that do not want to spend money on another whole bra This is much cheaper and very easy to use when we need more length to around our bust 
Great Product Being pregnant and quickly growing these are big money savers Be sure to measure your bras to get the right size I purchased a couple of the 3 hook narrow ones They matched perfectly with the hooks on my bras and they re comfortable Don t waste your time with the extenders with elastic bands on them I bought some at Walmart and the elastic started to stretch out warp after only 2 days of wear 
great shoes I bought these shoes for my 12 hour days nursing they re great the shoes are vented on the sides and therefore my foot breathes and doesn t sweat 
The most comfortable tennis shoe I have ever worn Cute too True to size I would definitey buy these again 
Great all around warm weather pants They look more professional in the office than denims but are ready to go into the field any time Another advantage over five pocket jeans is the accessory pockets great for the cell phone calculator Leatherman tool and or whatever without the cargo pants look Also Assembled in Mexico with USA components Closer to home than China 
Excellent Fits great super soft and slouches a lot more than you would think Very good boot and comfortable 
Jansport Spring Break I know the item arrived on time a it s OK but I don t have it yet I m expecting to have it at the end of January when relatives of mine come back to Argentina but as I know everything is OK Thanks a lot Bert 
Good shirt but the sizes do run a bit smaller than others The quality of these shirts are nice The only slight complaint is that the the neck area is a bit tight You might want to consider getting one size larger than you normally wear 
Artiga mens short sleeve shirt very fine quality shirt comfortable shipped expediately Very satisfied with this produc 
Best T shirt I own This well made relatively heavyweight 100 cotton T shirt fits just right on my middle aged frame feels nice and silky and didn t shrink much in a cold water wash Plus everybody seems to like the shade of red including me Recommended 
Artiga has slight edge over Soffe but both are excellent We bought both this brand Artiga and the Soffe to compare We like Artiga more as far as a somewhat silkier look and feel but run a tad smaller You may want to order a size larger than you usually wear Soffe was also excellent quality but more in the vein of a true cotton t shirt and runs true to size 
Buying More Bought 2 and buying 6 more now My son wears Tees everyday and these are equal or better to the ones I usually buy at Banana or Abercrombie for 20 00 Soft and wash really well He actaully told me how comfortable they feel and gave me a big kiss Also think I will try the Long Sleeve ones for only a buck more 
Nice Sandals I was having pain in my feet because of other flip flops not supporting the arch Foot pain has gone away so has the pain of finding a bottle opener Very comfortable 
Comfy Shoe These life stride shoes fit like a glove They don t pinch and they were made with quality I really like these 
Recommended Very Comfortable Shoe Few words to describe this shoe very good arch support and cushion insole True to size good leather and soles A great shoe for comfort and walking I ve purchased other Life Stride Dean styles and recommend all of them Mar 
Comfort galore As a matter of fact I have them on right now Comfortable is the word Stylish a great value for the buy 
Perfection in a Bag To be able to get something this stylish and practical while supporting such a heart warming cause is just incredible Its a consumer s dream We need more products like this I ve never felt so good about a purchase It was the perfect gift for my mom and sister who both love the bag and the story 
Stylish handbag Stunning look excellent craftmanship and enough storage space That s a really good gift for a smart lady 
Poor Quality The stitching on the front of shirt is defective so the shirt folds and stretched out 
Great product This wallet is beautiful and has lots of room The two inner pockets are perfect for storing bills and the other for reciepts or coupons And neither gets mixed up The inner zipper pocket between the 2 inner pockets is perfect for my change The best part of this wallet is that its roomy There s a space for everything with out losing anything 
Very Nice wallet Excellent compnay and I am very pleased with the wallet It was everything I wanted 
Excellent My daughter absolutely loved the wallet I personally did not realize it was a very popular item with the girls 
Handy dandy blanket After visiting with 2 other mommies that had Tuffos I decided to purchase one for our burgeoning family Supercool Lightweight waterproof many choices with pattern love the carry strap thing Kind of wish the straps were part of the blanket itself but I understand that it would compromise the waterproof backing Be careful when pulling off the mfc tag can tear the stiches Great product overall we think MauiMommie23 
Great picnic outdoor play blanket This is a great blanket The back is a water resistant material so you don t get wet when sitting on damp grass The top is a soft cotton type material The blanket is lightly padded to keep you comfortable from hard ground and small pebbles It s machine washable It folds up easily to fit back in the matching tote bag that it comes packed in It s large enough to hold two adults a baby and all of the baby s play things I m so glad I purchased this and I look forward to many years of use 
Big durable soft and cute This would be a 5 star if it wasn t so bulky to carry but I don t see how it could Otherwise we love it 
Comfy and Cute I got these shoes just in time for Spring and they are comfortable but are high enough so that they don t feel dowdy Nice pair of shoes 
Couldn t be better I sent two sets to my twin grandsons and they fit perfectly and are comfortable for growing boys The vendor was fast in getting the items out and I would and have shopped with them again 
A fitting silicone case I got this case because I needed something to protect my new iPod Shuffle I also got it so it would match my black headphones I got the black color case obviously I find that the case works well It fits the shuffle very nicely The face buttons are easy to navigate as the volume up down and forward back buttons are clearly formed within the silicone case There is a slight misfit on the back of the case where the clip meets the back of the shuffle but it s very minute and doesn t interfere with the overall look and fit of the case i never really notice it That why it gets 4 stars and not the full Overall I m happy with the case It s also a great price 
Comfortable Shoes Really these are very comfortable I work on my feet all day With other shoes my feet feel like they swell up and I get a pain from toes to heel These feel like moccasins with support They re highly recomended 
Bra by Bali Excellent fit for us overly endowed folks Wanted another one so just went on line to Bali and they sent me to Biels in Florida On time delivery and product was as asked for 
Hot and Sweaty This bra will hold you in and minimize but the material is is junky satina which does not breath so be prepared to sweat You ll soak in the summer 
Great Minimizer My mom wears this bra and told me to try it I m really glad I did The girls have been getting bigger and bigger over the years and this bra really makes them look smaller I highly recommend it But make sure you get the right size the material is not flexible of course or else it couldn t hold you in so if it is even a bit too small it s quite uncomfortable 
No Bounce no jiggle I show horses and this bra controls the bounce and jiggle better than any other I ve tried 
SO cute This bag is so cute Really roomy inside and I ve had it only one day and I already had like hundreds of complements on it It came very quickly and the service and packaging was outstanding I ll definitley recommend this to everyone 
good bag The bow did come loose on me but is easily re tied It s just the right size bag and even with a lot of stuff is pretty lightweight I ve had some roomy bags that were very heavy not the case with this I am usually skeptical and picky about handbags and buying such an item online but I was pleasantly surprised I would buy from this seller again they are prompt and quick I had it in 2 3 days from when I ordered 
Monica Gathered Hobo Brown Perfect Size for me I love the length of the strap Very well made The only reason I rated it a 4 is because I was looking for a red bag and this design doesn t have it I am experimenting this new brown and I am growing to like it more and more 
A MUST HAVE BAG EXCEPTIONAL I ordered two different colors the pink and camel I must say I fell in love with them The bags are beautiful I was VERY impressed with the fast delivery and exceptional packaging Each bag was also placed in a special protective cloth type bag of their own to protect each one for shipping 
tee shirts I love all these t shirts I got them for the cruise and I have always been pleased with my purchases on Amazon 
The very best white sock out there I m a runner and go through a lot of white socks I wanted to stock up on a new set so I bought about 5 different kinds to see which I liked best and then would stock up on those This one was the winner They are extremely durable and VERY comfortable They have so much padding and cushion I like just wearing them around the house and they feel like you have slippers on The Thorlo XJ 11 Running Crew Socks were also very nice well padded etc but were A LOT more expensive and I actually prefer these Russell socks better The Thorlo s don t breath nearly as well I highly recommend these socks A good value very durable extremely comfortable great cushion for runners and breath great Kevi 
Excellent medium heavy weight t shirts These shirts are well made and hold up well in the wash I ordered a whole bunch of them because of the good price They are part of my summer uniform khaki shorts and a khaki t shirt The only way they could be improved is if they were tagless 
Great Bag I love this bag I use it all the time now It is perfect for all the random things that I need to take with me 
Big and sturdy Wow this is as good a quality as I ve seen in the catalogs that are known for good boat totes but at about 1 3 the cost Definitely recommend this

Nice Tote Bag I bought this tote a couple of weeks ago and has been using it day in and day out It is a very convenient tote that you can depends on Anyone who likes tote bags from Funtote or Marimekko should also loves this bag 
Great This product was great I bought two for a gift for Christmas this one and another one from a brand name that cost 5 times as much and I returned the more expensive one this one had a lot better quality so I was happy I m thinking of buying one for myself now 
pleased I bought this item as a gift for my daughter It is well made and the color is beautiful The length of the handles are perfect 
Great bag for a low price this bag is awesome i use it to take a ton of books and sometimes my computer to and from the library and work It can weigh up to 25 lbs and the straps still hold the weight with out any signs of breaking down the best part though is that the bottom of the bag is square so it stands upright making it easy to access everything inside of it I also like the orange color 
Great Bag I love this bag The quality of the canvas and stitching is wonderful I would have expected to pay a lot more for this bag The orange is a great color 
This is a great bag I didn t expect such high quality at this price but the material and construction of this tote bag is just as good as those sold by more expensive stores I ordered a few of these to give as gifts to my bridesmaids its a beach wedding and I am going to fill the bags with fun gifts My only regret is not ordering one for myself 
Easy Spirit Women s Tempest Casual I bought one for myself and one for my sister We both love it 
nice shoes hey they look good and have a nice feel to em my feet are a little wide so there is a little rubbing along my little toe area but that was only during a very long day on my feet Problems Well I would just call this an interesting trait they have these stud like things on the bottom the make you feel really bouncy until you get used to them they also have a bad habit of squeeking on marble and certain tile floors people will turn their heads every now and then that could be a good or a bad thing just depends who s looki 
Most Excellent I have not found anything negative to say about this luggage It is sturdy well made and has lots of storage compartments The wheels roll so smoothly that it makes pulling a loaded suitcase almost effortless and that is a good thing because I have a heavy travel schedule this year So far I have to say this is the best luggage I have ever owned 
Great socks I received these socks as a Christmas gift and they are the best socks I ve ever owned They are very comfortable and don t get all bunched up in my shoes They kept their shape and size after being washed many times These socks are the best and I love them I just wish that they made them in more colors and fun patterns 
great socks what a wonderful set of socks the receiver of the gift was extremely happ 
WHAT A BUMMER THESE SOCKS WERE ORDERED FOR CHRISTMAS ON DEC 9 THEY WERE INSTOCK AND WERE PROMISED BEFORE CHRISTMAS THEY ARRIVED ON JAN 10 AND WERE NOT THE COLOR I ORDERED MINE WERE RED AND PINK STRIPED LIKE THE PICTURE THE ONES THEY SENT WERE SOLID RED I FIANALLY HAD TO SHOP ON CHRISTMAS EVE MY DAUGHTERS BIRTHDAY WHAT A STRESSED OUT MESS THE HOLIDAYS WERE FOR ME JUST BECAUSE I COUNTED ON THIS AND A COUPLE OF OTHER VENDORS FROM AMAZON NEVER AGAI 
Hue socks This is an excellent product They are by far the best socks I ve ever worn They don t fall down hold their shape after repeated washings and are soft and comfortable I love the two tone effect when the rolled top shows the contrasting interior color These are truly wonderful socks 
Cute little socks I like them They re perfect for summer or any time you don t need really warm socks 
Good handbag Very cute purse exactly what I was looking for I even had an ink pen bleed a huge mess in the bottom within the first week and much to my surprise I was able to get nearly all of the black out of the liner material 
GREAT I got my order in a short amount of time I will definetly buy from this company again 
Great Leather Color I purchase these boots because of the color I have several pairs of brown leather boots mostly dark brown but the color of this pair is unique I get so many compliments on the boots mostly comments on the color The leather is so soft oustside and inside I purchase the boots in a size smaller because they have a gap at the top of the boots which I didn t like However when I purchase the same boots in black I got them a size smaller to see if the gap was less noticeable and it was so I did the same with these 
Nine West Botamy Boot I feel like I got a Great deal the quality of the leather is superb what a beautiful boot they are comfortable as well Thanks 
Awesome boots I love these boots The leather is soft they are very very comfortable although it is a high heel and they keep your legs warm due to their 15 inch in length These elegant boots are true to fit classy you and will get many compliments They do have a gap at the top but even with a mini skirt you look natural so do not worry I got them on sale from Amazon with free shipping so that was a big plus for me Way to go Amazon 
Nice looking boots Nice looking boots but to large in the calf area going up to the knee The boots leave a noticable gap if your wearing a skirt if your planning on wearing pants tucked into the boots they are perfect 
Terrific Boot This is a gorgeous boot simple but elegant style with a high graceful heel These boots go with everything from casual to dressy and although the toes are quite pointed they are extremely comfortable I can wear them all day and walk considerable distances and they still feel great I had never ordered shoes by mail before so I was somewhat apprehensive however I couldn t be more pleased Without question these are the best boots I ve ever owned 
I love love love these boots These are the greatest boots I have ever owned I have received so many compliments and they go with everything If only I had more I d buy another pair in a heartbeat 
Very nice warm gloves ignore spam by antifur people No rabbits were killed for these gloves can t these guys read And I also happen to think fur is ideal for warmth Yes native americans and all the people the ultra left worship wore fur communists wore fur TO KEEP WARM These gloves are soft and luxurious and I love the 
Real Fur Real Warm Very Stylish These gloves are stylish and extremely warm I d buy them again anytime

bearpaw boots They ar great Glad I didn t get the bigger size They fit perfectly Anyone who buys these boots will totally love them 
very comfortable these are such comfortable boots if you want sheepskin boots without paying a bunch for UGGS then these are the ones i highly recommend water proofing them first thing because they re a bit hard to clean 
Bearpaw Womens Suede Boots I am very happy that I purchased these boots They were the right price and a great knock off of uggs 
Classic sock Do you have a hard time finding quality black socks Don t buy the Fluffy version since it will just make your foot sweat This sock can be worn hundreds of times before the heal will become low Cool in the summer and warm in the winter Never itches or scratches Stays up and not too tight The perfect sock 
colors galore This shirt is comfortable and fits well as long as you wash it a lot I have a tendency to wear a shirt non stop for days and it gets stretched Other than that I love the color selection too 
S T i LOVE these bras and DON T wear any other but these in the passed i brought so many other types of bras and they NEVER seems to fit right or comfortable when i saw these onsale at kohl s i purchased one and tried it and LOVED it it feels so comfy on and stays in place so i purchased more and when i saw it for 6 50 at amazon what a BARGAIN i purchased a few more i paid double the amount for them at stores 
Very Pretty better than expected This is a lovely shawl extremely well crocheted I am surprised at receiving this level of quality for the price It is smaller than one would think from viewing the photograph 
Comfortable and Cute I love these They are very comfortable The lace is stretchy so it is comfortable I ordered 3 different pairs I love the bright colors I ll probably order more I love them 
sooooo comfortable These are the BEST panties I ve ever had They don t ride up they feel like they are not even there and they don t cut into your skin They are so smooth that my jeans don t pull them up either If you re tired of digging your panties out even the victoria secret s barely there panties buy these They are much cheaper here on Amazon than at Beall s department store I paid 11 99 for 3 pair at the store 
Beautiful This is one of the nicest blouses I have ever bought Fits great and looks great 
Use it everyday I got a pair of dickys coveralls and this jackit is all I need to keep warm on any cold day at work outside 
satisfied son My son was delited to see the package arive so quickly He was happy with the grafics and quality of the shir 
Cute Ballet Flat Loved the shoe and especially loved the price Very comfortable and goes with anything 
pretty good I bought these because I needed some basic black flats that I could wear often The great thing is they didn t need to be broken in and they were comfortable as soon as I started wearing them since the leather is really soft But this also means it is more prone to scratches and scuff marks so be careful when wearing them mine have small rough patches at the toes just after wearing them 2 3 times but I walk a lot They re really comfortable to wear throughout the day but not too breathable so wear some shoe liners with them Overall I really like Steve Madden shoes and these were a great buy 
Very Stylish I ordered 1 2 a size larger than what I normally wear they are very comfortable but I could have ordered them in my normal size Very nice looking 
Very nice The clutch was very well made and attractive It served the purpose well 
Very nice bag Bought this bag for my daughter who was a bridesmaid this summer It matched the silver shoes she wore and was large enough to fit some makeup her cell phone and her keys She will definitely use this bag again Very reasonable price 
A very stylish pump These are a beautiful pair of pumps I love the tailored look I can wear with them trousers and a vest You get not just the ribbon ties as seen in the picture but also regular cord ties though I think the ribbon is much more attractive The only complaint I have about these pumps is that there isn t a lot of padding inside so as the day went on my foot would rub back and forth in the front and cause some friction Other than that they are wonderful 
Nice shoes These shoes have a nice look but run almost half a size larger I m a 9 5M and the 9 fits better 
Great Shoes The shoes look as good as they did in the photo They are very comfortable and can go with any outfit 
Great after breaking in These shoes are quite comfortable now but they took about two weeks to break in properly In the beginning I actually was considering returning them because of how uncomfortable my feet were by the end of the day I m glad I kept them though they look good they re comfortable now and they re definitely made well Other reviews have mentioned that these shoes don t look exactly like the picture which is true they are a little bit darker and have a fair amount of scuffing and marking done by the manufacturer out of the box but I purchased these expecting them to be like that I m satisfied with them to be sure even with the initial rough period 
nice shoes to bang around in I found the shoes to be pretty much what I d hoped for a pair for everyday use that had a certain style and comfortable feel The shoes have a scruffy look which works for me I like them 
Nice Show for the price Shoe was as described And for a stylish pair it was well worth the price Free S H and No Tax charged was a great added feature 
Great shoes These shoes arrived quicker than I imagined next day when I only have prime 2 day shipping and fit great They are comfortable and they are still great today 2 months later The only problem is that the shoes aren t the same color as the ones in the picture The picture depicts it as a whiter shade while in reality they are much browner But don t let the color difference mislead you these shoes are well worth the money 
not such nice quality this shirt looks like i ve made it myself very simple printing and the quality of the shirt is not so nice either 
Classic Full Cut Boxer Been wearing them for about 10 years now never liked the feel of briefs Hanes boxers fit feel great They are nice and baggy with plenty of leg seat room They also last a long time hold up well in the washer My only advice is to size UP when you order I got a 34 waist only wear size LARGE Med is too snug Hanes boxers are classic comfort for the guy that has to feel some slack in the sack 
Can t Argue With These Total classic white boxers Fit great not too trim not too baggy Maybe a little pricier than the Windham Pointe stuff but a lot better manufactured No waist band hip fatigue lines at the end of the day wife loves them can t go wrong 
Boxers are Wicked cool I love wearing boxers They are the best stop wearing those things and wear boxers Boxers are the best and the chicks love them 
Boxers are cool I have been wearing Boxers for 2 years and i never stop wearing them They are sexy looking I use them for wearing underneath my pants walking around the house in and sleeping in I sleep in boxers and a t shirt Those wimpy boys who don t wear boxers you better start wearing them The way to look cool wearing them are going to a sleep over and sleep in them ok 
Practical everyday boxers I have been using Hanes brand boxers for years and I swear by them The material is light and does not cling to the thighs The basic design has the seams running up the cheeks of the bottom not up the centre This prevents the boxer from clinging to the centre of the behind The boxers are durable and remain wearable for many years Note that the front flap can stay open after continuous use and should be pressed to retain that closed look Color selection is somewhat minimal A 3 pack usually has 2 of one color when there should be 3 different colors patterns Why Buy As your main line of boxers practical for everyday use You want to see your man looking sexy even after many washes 
Great My new boxers arrived 5 days ago and I ve been wearing them non stop They look good give your boys total freedom and don t restrict in any way I can t express how much I love boxers the best style by far and these are a comfortable quality pair Next time I see my boyfriend I ll definitely be wearing these to show them off I just know he ll want a pair for himself 
CAN T BEAT THE PRICE This camo t shirt was exactly as represented The only reason for the lack of a 5th star is because I thought that they should have listed in the description that the shirt runs small so order big or to let us know it was sized for Juniors Thank goodness I ordered XLARGE 
Levi s Jeans I am extremely happy with my jeans and they fit great Price was fantastic and the seller was one of the best 
Doesn t work on my phone but cute I received this item after having placed it on my wish list not knowing that it does NOT work with my cell phone Your phone must have a place to put a handle strap on it which is how this charm attaches There is no alternative to attaching it so I put it on a purse instead 
Comfortable These slacks feel so good You can t go wrong I love them 
cute this hat really wasn t quite what i d expected i thought i was purchasing a winter y sort of knit hat and it turns out that the front fabric of the hat is actually quite thin and the back of the hat is that trucker cap type of mesh material i didn t even notice it in the picture at all they seemed to angle the hat in the photo so you don t see the mesh back anyway it s still a cute hat i m just not sure it s worth the money i d paid for it after discovering what it s really like 
good buy This is a great buy The tie is good quality and just as advertised It arrived promptly and in good shape I d definitely buy more of the same type 
Bought shorts In response to Amazon asking for a review on these shorts here it is They re shorts Not much more I can say about them They are a little comfortable but nothing to write home about 
very useful product Used all summer long almost everytime i was outdoors Has held up well so far and has a really cute design it was shipped very fast Thanks 
No muss no fuss There are very few options for small figures 32A and what is available generally doesn t fit me well This minimally constructed design works and is very comfortable When I find something that works and is difficult to find I buy multiples because from my experience the manufacturers will eventually discontinue it much to my disappointment and outrage 
Totally Secret and Comfy I am an adolescent boy named William As part of my puberty I have gynecomastia which means my breasts are large like girls My mother bought me this bra to wear to school and at home My breasts were supported felt comfortable and nobody was able to see my bra I really like wearing this 
This item sucks I ordered this item one month ago and still haven t recived JACK 
They are C IN2 need to say anything else Look great and fit well Comfortable and certainly make a statement I would recommend them 
Great drawers for those who like neither briefs nor boxers These trunks offer the support of a brief and the comfort of a boxer brief with minimal coverage Great undertwear 
Reef Sandals I have enjoyed my new reef sandals I heard about them from my sister in law I found some cheaper on Amazon and decided to buy them I will be buying a black pair in the future 
Perfect in every way Love these Fit is very true to size They are super comfortable nice arch 
How odd mine were made in Italy These are great shoes very comforatble and break in quickly I m not sure why some folks are getting shoes that were made in India mine are clearly marked on the sole and inside the shoe Made in Italy I deducted one star as the soles started chunking the first couple of days I owned them While some may say this is normal I ve been wearing leather soles for decades and this is the first time I ve seen actual divets in the leather from 2 days worth of wear Overall I do recommend them though 
A great pair of shoes and an excellent price Beautiful black leather and deerskin shoes that are of the quality you d expect from Bostonia An amazing price as well 
Mens Shoes Prompt delivery Excellent service Shoes were exactly like they were described Love the shoes 
Comfortable and Stylish I have worn these shoes for over a year They wear well and have never been uncomfortable An excellent value overall 
Great shoe This is a nice looking comfortable shoe I have used this shoe on business interviews and a wedding so far and have found the shoes to be very comfortable If I had to buy this shoe over again I would do so in a heartbeat 
Great Deal Good service and a great deal Will do business again Beautiful shoe 
perfect i purchased several pairs of jersey leggings in different colors they are everything i expected great colors wash up beautifully fit as wanted the delivery was fast i do not have any complaints as all and i will definitely order again from this company 
what a deal This shoe is perhaps the best pump I ve purchased in a long time The quality is fantastic Unisa makes a great product and Amazon provided a fantastic price what more can I say 
Great Pants The only reason that they are not 5 stars is that the zipper is cheap A heavier duty zipper the easily slides would make these pants perfect Everything else about these pants are well made and comfortable a good buy 
Great Pants These are terrific pants they are soft with a good feel to your hands and very comfortable They also look great and the pockets are just where you need them very convenient for carrying anything you need with you I don t know if brown is really the new black but these are a great color they are not your grandfather s brown I also own the khaki and will probably order the black or olive from Captain Dave next 
great shape design and size a great bag nice leather beautiful shade of brown I love the size and design as it was what I was looking for Arrived fast There s a few scratches on it already from using it I m not the most gentle on things but not rough the buckles on it are not solid metal they re like hollowed out That would be my only complaint or disappointment Great for the price perfect size to supplement your purse to work 
Fantastic Shoe Ths is a great shoe I bought it for wearing while walking on or near beaches but it looks so good I often wear it in completely dry places 
nice shoes A picture did not show all the beauty design and the confort I will buy more of this kind 
love the contrast stitching it s a comfortable formfitting t shirt dress whenever i wear it i get compliments 
I own these socks They re great They stay up but don t hurt The socks come in two sizes regular and king I now get the king but I used to get the regular ones I have a wide foot with a high arch that is usually a 13 but can range from 12 14 depending on the shoe The regulars fit but the kings fit better I hate socks that gouge my calf I run These stay up without digging into my skin 
Unhelpful Size Info I didn t actually buy these socks because there was no way to select the size The only quot size quot shown was simply quot over the calf quot which to me isn t a size at all it s a length Since feet and calves grow to all different lengths and thicknesses one would have to be pretty foolish to order a sock with no indication of size Hence only one star and no sale Better luck next time Jos A Banks 
comfort on a shoestring Shearling is cushier and the laces are thin patently pseudo rawhide Nonetheless these slippers are comfortable light weight and good looking If they only last a couple of years and need a spenco insert for better padding they are still a bargain Would will buy again anytime 
Soft and warm excellent house shoe that is able to be worn outside if needed Would buy agai 
great deal I ordered these as a gift for my son The quality was great and the price was right We were both pleased with the purchase I chose amazon to purchase through because I have had so much success finding what I want at prices I like on their site 
Mens Slippers I have purchased many pairs of slippers and these are by far the nicest I have paid much more for a lot less quality The shipping was prompt all in all it was a very easy transaction 
Ripped January 6 2007 I purchased these slippers for my son as a Christmas present The stitching ripped through the suede after ond day of wear I am very disappointed 
Perfection I can t believe the bargain I got with these slippers I ordered one pair and as soon as I put them on I came back and ordered the last two pairs they had in my size It is so difficult to find quality slippers with a wide width but these are PERFECTION Well made comfortable nice looking I would even wear them to run to the store gosh does that sound like some grandfatherly thing or what They are sharp looking and comfortable What more can you ask 
Light as a FEATHER I ordered these last week for myself and they were so wonderful to read with and so light on your nose that my Husband took them for his drawings to take off job bids So I am back today buying me another pair We recommend them for anyone wanting to read And who doesn t want to read LH Texa

Vanity Fair Lace Nouveau Nylon Brief lovely fit well very smooth under clothing 
Love the bag hate the company I really love this bag It was perfect size for traveling around theme parks however the company sent me 3 duplicate bags by mistake and made a huge inconvenience to myself to send them back They also took 4 days longer than expected to get it to me Other than that it was great 
No Good At least the one I recieved for Christmas just simply does not work OK so now I have to figure out how to return it this was a gift that came from out of my household but none the less I was given the receipt However if you call the 1 800 number all you get is a recording that says if you leave a name and number they will get back to you by tomorrow or go to their website and see instructions for return This was ordered from Amazon so I don t have Their web address Hmmm FYI 
Great travel clock I really like this travel clock lightweight sturdy compact even tells the temperature I really like that it displays the alarm clock time also and shows whether or not the alarm function is on even shows when it is on snooze snooze is about 4 5 minutes there is an indiglo light bar which is the same as the snooze bar located across the top of the clock very convenient and easy to find The clock and alarm are very easy to set and you can go up or down so you don t have to scroll through the whole sequence to get back to your time setting hour and minutes separately All of the buttons beep when pressed even the light snooze button but that is minimal compared to all of the great features and conveniences it is a quick beep and much less loud than others i have tried for less beeping you can hold down the button for automatic scrolling when setting the time I highly recommend this travel clock Enjoy your travels 
Perfect For the price of this suit I was expecting something of okay quality and was plesently suprised when I recieved it The fabric feels good and seems to be a good quality This suit would be perfect for ANY occasion my son may need a black suit If you need a specific color tie though you may want to order it seprately It came with a black tie even though the picture I ordered from showed a red tie and the product descripiton doesn t specify color If your wondering how fast they ship out I ordered it priority on Sunday and recieved it thursday 
Black Dress Suit What i was most impressed with was the fact that the sizing provided was accurate The suit fit my son perfectly 
Super Cute Shoes I bought these in black and really like them They re a great alternative to sandals with all the little holes really airing out the feet I have gotten so many compliments on them I love that I can wear them with just about anything and they go I even wear them with my workout clothes when I go to Pilates since they re easy to slip on and off The only issue I have with them is that I sometimes feel a little lopsided walking in them They re the only shoes I ve ever had that make me feel like that almost as if the bottom of the right shoe is crooked or something I still wear them all the time though and would buy them again 
Exactly what I wanted Wash up with no problem I wear a 7 and a large fits just right 
Great Gift This is the gift to give the women in your life who can appreciate comfort and classic style Cushioned inner soles sturdy bottom soles soft and beautiful upper material no pressure points perfect fit warm classic style that goes with pajamas and jeans stands up to machine washings what more can you ask from a house shoe Give yourself the gift of these slippers too in every color

Always the best I have always worn Olga bras Being small in size I have had a fit problem I hate Underwire but like a padded bra Olga has always made a bra that combines both of my needs I m sorry this style has been discontinued but I m looking forward to trying the replacement 
Best sock EVER Well I live in Texas i can t ski very often however I slipped on this pair of socks and got a running start at a freshly waxed wood floor and relived the 69 winter olymipcs It was great oh and they re really soft and fuzzy and feel really good on my feet too

They are great Just like other Russell products My husband is over 400 lbs and tall Not all tall clothing is as long in their tops as Russell is Of course this is not a zip up A pull over is not supposed to zip up It is not a heavyweight but both my husband and I like them In fact I came back to this site to buy some more In tops for my big and tall husband we only want Russell 
FLIP FLOP These are the greatest pair of flip flops Great little price on them too Super fast on the shipping You will enjoy these 
Nina to eight This outfit was absolutely adorable I bought a nine month for my 6 month old grandson and it was a little tight I would buy the next size up because it runs a little small 
vintage style knickers This item is out of this world my grnadchildren wore them for a birthday party and everyone has to turn to make some great comments about the outfits both looked awsome Congratulation 
The Best ever This is the best sunglasses I ever had especially for this price I got so many compliments especially on WMC week in Miami which was really surprising cause everybody is so stylish over there so it s really worth it 
Perfect I bought the glasses as a gift and the individual is enjoying them 
awesome shades awesome deal you really can t find a better value for sunglasses this sweet besides it gets me the ladies just fine i liked em so much i bought a pair for all my friends 
great sunglasses i love this sunglasses they re just the ultimate rock n roll sungalsses you re lookin for 
Great Value These sunglasses are a great value for a great look I ve bought several pairs of them for others and they love them too 
fair price on decent glasses I don t spend a lot on sunglasses because I destroy them regularly I bought these as they were in the right price range for a disposable item These are as good as you can expect for this price They are relatively well made out of decent grade materials They were a little tight on me so I bent them out a touch and now they are comfortable These are a good value 
1312 Aviator Sunglasses I am very pleased with these sunglasses They fit very comfortably and I have been wearing them constantly The glasses do not fall off if I should bend down to pick up something They provide a comfortable shield from Mr Sun when he is at his peak during the day And the best part is that price I paid for these glasses was very reasonable 
sweetest aviators i ve gone through my fair share of aviators but these are by far the nicest ones i ve owned for under 20 thanks 80 s purple 
Comfy Panties Well I cannot speak for the previous commentor but I have worn these for about 5 8 years Yes I have kept a pair that long They haven t worn out at all Of course my underwear are much older so the tag is in the back and says Life Life is by Jockey but now that brand is exclusive to men s underwear I plan on looking for these again at a store and trying them again Well so now I don t know how valid my review is because it s been so long but the ones I do have are amazingly comfortable and I hope these live up to that 
Super Cute I love these shoes I just ordered the brown ones and I am going to order the black ones They are so comfortable I would recommend them to anyone Within the first 5 minutes of wearing them I got a compliment 
slow and small It took 2 weeks after I ordered the hat for the company to even ship it I recieved it after the arrival date When I did finally recieve it turns out that their idea of a large is everyone else s small 
Very sexy chice shirt This shirt feels very confident and sexy Its business style Very good look 
Very Nice Well Made These pants come cut to Spec easy to fit They are very well made and have held up well through many wearings and Dry Cleanings Highly Recommended 
Form without function I m all about buying pretty things but this pretty thing pretty much don t work the way you d want While the iPod Nano is in the case neither outlets on the bottom are accessible more importantly the headset jack 
Really comfortable They are soft and comfortable Tehy feel like I put in inserts inside my shoe These are great and cost less 
I LOVE this bra I will wear nothing but this bra it is comfortable and it looks great no matter what I wear it under I bought it a few years ago in several colors and practically lived in it and get this I grew an entire cup size bought the same bra in my new size and I STILL love it 
The Only Bra I ll Wear I have one of these in every color and wear nothing else The perfect bra if you want to make the cup size you have look great not bigger So comforatable too 
I d go well out of my way to buy this bra I m sure every figure is different but this bra is one of the few I ve found that I would buy again In fact I would go out of my way to buy this bra The fit is excellent and the look under t shirts or clingy fabric is smooth and flattering Furthermore it is comfortable 
Awsome Jacket I was very pleased with this jacket The style is wonderful I found it to be true to size but the arms were a little snug It was a fabulous price It is a definite keeper 
Great Value Great Look I am thrilled with this lined suede jacket with oversized decorative grommets The fit was perfect I got a small and I usually wear size 6 8 Petite Looks great with jeans or dress pants 
Great surprise in a stylin jacket Love the product great workmanship fun to wear nice find on Amazon Thanks for the great jacket Brandon 
Really Cute I love the look of this jacket It is a little smaller than marked 
Excellent jacket It s really original I got a lot of complements and it s nicely made jacket It goes excellent with the Brandon Thomas Women s Yolkster Skirt 
Classy nice fitting suede jacket Incredible deal on this soft nicely made jacket that goes with just about everything in my closet I took the suede ties off and it hangs just right without them Equally nice with jeans or skirts This one works ladies The large fits me fine I m 5 9 and weigh about 130 
Fun Suede Jacket with Grommets A fun lightweight suede jacket It is 100 leather and requires professional cleaning I bought the peridou which is not as vibrant as pictured but is still a versatile multi seasonal color I usually wear an 8 and ordered a Medium which fit perfectly in length and width even through the arms At just under twenty dollars this jacket adds color and flair to a variety of outfits 
Incredible Bargain You cannot go wrong at this price I agree with the other reviewers who wrote that the sleeves arm holes shoulders were a bit snug I own a few other Brandon Thomas suede tops in size Small so that s what I had ordered but I ended up returning it for a Medium In this particular jacket I preferred the fit and ease of the Medium FYI the suede ties are just looped through the grommets so you can adjust or remove as you wish 
Swingman What a waste of money I bought this for my wife and there is nothing good to say about it It s so big that she has to hold it up to keep the string touching her body The bubbles get stuck between the cheeks and she says it does absolutely nothing for her where it s supposed to She said that it was actually irritating to wear Don t waste your money on this 
Pleasure Pearls I d rather give this a 5 stars than a full one star off because the only fault I could find was that the pearls are more like cheap plastic beads one might find on a Marti Gra necklace Not very realistic Other than that the material was super stretchy and soft and the beads fit me in all of the right places 
More fun then you might think I bought these for my wife for Christmas 2005 We have other sex toys some we like Pyrex but most are a disappointment As they can be expensive and are lacking in quality So I thought for the 12 or 15 how bad could these be Well let me tell you Not only do they look super HOT on my wife But they feel GREAT She loves wearing them when we make love When I give her oral I run my tongue over the beads and she loves it And I really like the way they feel during intercourse too The best bang for the buck Pun intended Enjoy Not using my real name so my wife does not get mad 
BEST THING I VE EVER SEEN This is the best thing i ve ever seen I love the string of bubbles so much i tried them on while my wife was at work 5 stars easy HOT However perhaps a better view of the product could help amazon customers choose the item I know i d love to see it and that it would probably have made us make the decision much quicker In the words of our teenage son this product is dope 
great I love how the great the pearls feel on me and am glad I bought these A sexxy thing for sur 
Finally decent men s yoga shorts Not too tight not too loose Nice material It s so freakin hard to find decent men s yoga shorts Only problem is the waistling rides a little high Much better than Prana shorts which are unnecessarily baggy 
works better under pants than over I found that the most useful way to wear this product was under my maternity pants to help keep them from sliding down my increasingly round belly I didn t like wearing it over my pants at all I found that after sitting down or even walking awhile my pants would slide down my belly and the bella band would roll up my belly There were alot more clothing adjustments in public when I was wearing it over my pants 
The greatest thing ever I wasnt to sure about spending the on this item at first but when i got it in the mail and put it on it was a life saver no more maternity jeans I am still abel to fit in my regualr jeans but i just cannot zip or button them up and that is where the Bella Band comes in it work wonders no body can believe that i am still in my regualr jeans Thanks Bella Band Wendy L 
Stylish and comfortable what more can you ask Bealls really delivers with these navy pants it s so hard finding elasticized cotton knit pants that look good and these fit the bill 
Great quality glove The skin is soo soft The gloves are very comfortable and I will come back again to rate them after I try them in snow The only thing I wish to be different is not to have made the mistake with the color I bought the dark brown ones by mistake while I wanted to by black ones 
Great Shoe I like this shoe very much Soft and supple Seems wide but still fits my size 
Adorable comfy shoes These are very cute and comfortable shoes and look great with jeans or dressed up I have wide feet and they were very accommodating I wouldn t recommend them for narrow feet though 
chinese laundry mash flat love these shoes very comfortable and stylish i have a bunion on my left foot and finding flat shoes that fit is very difficult i wore them all day taking my children out and the shoes didn t pinch at all highly recommend them especially at the sale price 
Soft and Comfy Very comfortable Doesn t fall off your feet like other similar clog like slippers I bought these to replace an old pair of Dearfoam slippers I bought more than 6 years ago that finally wore out Definately a long life for such a good price Found that they run a bit small Ordered a Large which I found out was for sizes 8 9 Returned for an X Large 9 5 10 5 which was a better fit I typically wear either a 9 or 9 5 Also are a bit narrow which works good for me but not ideal to wear with thick socks 
great value great comfort I liked them so much I just had to get more for now and the future 
Socks are pretty much socks As far as socks go these were pretty good The vacuum packaging was good for a laugh 
Great Socks My husband loves these socks They are a little pricey however they are super soft and comfortable My husband hates those skinny thin dress socks for work so these do a much better job and since he seems to be in work clothes a lot his feet are always comfy 
Great Socks My husband loves these socks They are very cushy can t find them locally anymore Please continue to carry them Thanks 
The only sox my husband wears My husband can t stand cotton sox and we finaly found Acrlic extra custioned toe and heal here at Amazon com They are great and we will be purchasing 4 pair every month Please don t discontinue this brand they were just to hard to find anywhere Thank you Kerri 
No Problems So Far I bought two of these shirts for work and they seem to be holding up great after over a month of frequent washing and drying The size was accurate and the shirts fit well 
Very Very Very Nice Beatifull Nice Fancy This is a very good quality item The only thing I would say about it is that it has little details is the leather strap I had to apply some glue on it but its perfectly now 
Size reference Great PJ Really glad i got it It s pretty well built I was afraid it would be a bit fragile but so far so good As a reference I m 6 0 with roughly 200lb I got the Large and it s a bit tight for my taste I ll be trading it for the X 
Best Quality I Have Found These silk pajamas in my opinion have much higher quality stitching tailoring details as well as a heavier weight silk than the closely priced DreamSacks pajamas Sizing Help To help clarify sizing for people there have been conflicting reviews here I ordered a Medium but then returned it for a L I will probably get some minor alterations but I don t blame the company for that everyone is shaped differently I am 6 0 and weigh 175 My suit measurements are a 42 chest 34 sleeves and 32 pants inseam The Medium body fit but the sleeves and pants were too short The Large was the best fit overall although roomier around the chest than I would prefer But if you are my size the Large is your best option 
Good for women too These are great Well made did ok in the wash They also did not split at the seam after wearing them 2x They are still cool enough for summer but nice and warm in winter and SERIOUSLY SOFT By a pair for your wife yourself They are heaven 
I would highly recommed these very nice I was concerned that these silk PJ s would be really thin and on the cheap side But to my surprise they are much thicker then I thought they would be and feel like they will hold up rather well My husband did NOT expect these and is quite pleased with them I am back tonight to order another pair in a different color now that I know they are worth the money I paid for them Plus the fit was perfect I noticed others here said their large was to big so get a smaller size and another person said the opposite That confused me when I went to buy So I just went with my husbands normal size which is a XXL and it was absolutely perfect My husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of PJ s ever The size is perfect color bright looks like it will hold up after many washings Seams looked like quality sewing unlike some I have bought in the past I can t find anything I don t like about these I need to get another pair here FAST before he wears these out lol Anyone thinking of buying these I can t help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least Ja 
Good quality This is a good quality pajama set and was worth the price I paid with an Amazon discount Be forewarned that the color is a really bright red though 
Comfy and sleek pajamas What a great pair of pajamas these are So soft non binding roomy and great for lounging I ve already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays Very good quality silk well sewn and tailored I m normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine 
Very comfortable The cotton is soft and lightweight The elastic waistband isn t too tight though tight enough the drawstrings serve no purpose other than for looks My only complaint is the pants are a bit too short but I often have this problem because I m 5 7 
if just because they are so comfortable These are the most comfortable things I have ever worn on my feet I bought them for Halloween and I m so happy that I did They are my new house shoes But just in case you didn t know the straps are only attached at the back of the slipper So you have to sew them into the front I m assuming for proper fit This is a bit annoying coupled with the fact that there is no loop or area of fabric to sew them into without having to see your handy work through the front no good if your terrible at sewing like me And they soil easily This should be expected of course especially if they are white Still as my title suggests they earn 5 stars and more because they truly are that comfortable Especially if your house is carpeted I can t well explain why because the shoes really have no padding But they hug your feet and support your arch to an extent I m assuming these would not be as comfortable for flat footed people The price is great and if you are into ballet what do you have to loose 
Just what I needed Although I am not a professional ballet dancer it has been some 15 years since I ve had my last ballet class recently I have decided that I needed some exercise so I started to take ballet classes again Consequently I purchased the S1C Canvas slippers and I must say I do not regret it The slippers are soft delicate and fit like a glove a ballerina s dream partner 
The shoe that won t die Sansha S1C still stands as the best all around canvas ballet slipper Though this has been somewhat jokingly christened the bedtime slipper for looseness off the foot the line on working feet is very visible especially after repeated use Where Bloch and Capezio tend to require multiple fittings and testing of different styles especially through mail order Sansha styles as long as they are purchased in the correct approximate widths and lengths will mold to individual feet and stand for years with good care The only reservation I have about these shoes is the leather soles capacity for holding onto everything they pass over for an extended period of time If you dance in a meticulous studio this is not an issue but where a stray drop of soda or Gatorade is occassionally spilt you may want to scuff the soles once a week Washing does not seem to clean the leather as well as the canvas and eventual buildup will impede turns 
first class Dear sir I think that you can not understand me Still I am waiting my goods I will check it after receiving my goods I wait nearly one month and pay double price I saw that prices are discounted I am living in Turkey and when I purchase some goods from Cabelas ll Bean or Sierra Trading Post I receive max after 4 days But in your systemI am still waiting becouse goods will go to NJ and my friend repack and transport to me Today I contacted with him and thereis no news from my goods He is working in fedex I have no any bad things about Amazon or Bargain Outfitter or Guide Gear companies But I can not understand your system I must purchase something from a m companies and receive it max after 5 days Another sample last year 12 12 2006 I had purchased some shoes from JC Penney company and goods will came same way to NJ and To TR and I am still waiting I wisited USA several times since 1960 and I can not beleive it This is last sample I want to purchase some decoys from company Mack s Prairie Wings but they can not ship directly to Turkiye But this not end of every thing I will purchase some goods from Amazon for timeless i e necessary for next year goods but When I need urgent I will prefere speed companies Thanks alot kind interest Best regards Bahadir Yamalioglu 
Can t beat the price These are excellent for wearing as around the house leggings or under clothes during cold Midwestern winters I ll probably get another pack too 
Great little pants I know it says that they are not meant to be PJ s but I use them for that on my daughter as well as to put on her with a large t shirt These are great even to use under their regular clothes in winter They are priced great too When I ordered them I was not going to use them but for fall wear but now I may buy some more for the winter as well This store is great on shipping also I ordered them regular shipping and got them in just a few days This may depend on where you are in the USA as to how fast you get them As far as I am concerned you cannot beat this price and versatile ways to use these cute little pants 
Delightfully teasing to both men and women Of the Love Fifi items my husband recently bestowed upon me this was the third item I had tried on My other half had selected the Black Red version for me the one pictured which made it easily one of the most romantic of the bunch After a nice dinner out and once we got home I told my husband that I wanted to change into something more comfortable When he came into the bedroom I had slipped on these Jezebel crotchless panties along with my sexiest black negligee I was also sprawled across the bed with the most alluring come hither look I could muster Hey don t laugh It still works I wasn t sure if lightning would strike again Buy hey With these Love Fifi s centerless panties I m definitely three for three For some reason I had assumed that these and other crotchless knickers would have little appeal between women But when a close girlfriend came to visit one weekend I soon learned otherwise I hopped under the sheets with these Jezebels on unbeknownst to her to help warm her bed After getting reacquainted she playfully tried to slip her hand underneath but I kept shooing it away This went on for about ten minutes until it finally dawned on her that there was another way in This was incidentally about ten minutes LONGER than my husband or any guy for that matter would ve taken to figure it out Surprisingly I never would ve guessed that these Love Fifi crotchless undies would be so versatile Everyone loves em 
Boy Short Feminine Look that is Way Sexy I have to say that after wearing these for a day that they did not disappoint I love the boy short look of these crotchless panties that are made in the USA They are made out of nylon so thin and wispy that it feels like you don t have anything on at all And boy do they look good I just can t get enough of looking at myself in the mirror This weekend I m hosting a lingerie party and I ll definitely be singing praises about these panties that let you show just enough throw to really titalate These panties are so comfortable you don t even know you have them on Do you get the picture that I really like them 
Feel ready anytime I love crotchless panties They re airy and sexy Hmmmm next to being pantyless Why a 4 Because I prefer absorbent material you know Anyway these are nice for those special occasions 
Great penny loafers I looked for a long time for some cordovan colored penny loafers Finally found these They fit great and the price was right 
Poor refund policy I received 50 refund on returning the product in original condition since I did not like what I received Why such a high deduction You should require merchant to post the refund amount when ordering I also paid for shipping the product back thus resulting in only 25 refund of what I paid originally 
Yay for the pointy toe skimmer I saw these shoes at Macy s yesterday for 36 They only had the red IMO the red is a bright clown red It s not a bad red it s just a true red with no subtlety I almost considered getting them but I reminded myself that I was on the hunt for a black patent pointy toe skimmer I am so glad Macy s did not have the black because I got them thru Amazon for 22 I believe the shoe fits true to size I am a 7 5M period In pointy shoes I sometimes go for an 8 or avoid pointys altogether I was going to listen to the reviews here and order an 8 but I tried on the 8 at Macy s and it was too big I think it was a bit stretched it given that it was the floor model but I figured even a brand new size 8 would be too big I ordered recvd a 7 5M When I recvd the shoes today and put them on they were snug Not snug in a tight or uncomfortable way They just fit exactly to my foot This is a leather upper and not man made So the patent looks black and shiny It s not cheap looking at all The point comes to a nice triangle and isn t exagerrated Given that they are leather I expect them to stretch a little to my feet The shoes measures 10 5 from the point to the middle of the heel The point to the top of the shoe is 3 and there is 1 between my big toe and the point There is comfortable room to move the toes and because the shoe is leather it will form a bit to the feet as you wear them I have experienced that already just walking around the house The shoe looks low cut on the sides but my foot stays completely in the shoe when I am walking I ll be watching to see if I end up with a line bend across the front of the shoe By the time that happens if it ever does I will certainly have gotten my 22 out of them And finally I am 5 2 and I tend to avoid pointy toe shoes because it sometimes looks like I am wearing skis These shoes are great because they elongate my leg and don t create a costume y look They look great peeking out of the jeans I have on and I expect them to look good w the new capri leggings I got the other day Highly recommended 
i love flats i absolutely love these shoes they are super cute and look good with basically everything the only sad part for me is that ive got fairly long toes as my boyfriend tells me so the tips arent at a perfect point because the shoe has formed on the side to my toe 
Cute cute cute But they run kinda small Order 1 2 size up Why isn t there a 9 1 2 
These are the shoes I had been looking for I absolutely reccommend these They are comfortable well constructed and the cut is sexy pointed toe but with a wide enough toe box and soft enough leather to reshape a good amount to your foot The side cut is perfect its dressy yet can be worn with shorts or jeans also I highly reccommend these flats Abigai 
There s No Catch These shoes are an amazing bargain and there isn t a catch They look and feel terrific They seem true to size to me The black leather pair is your basic versatile flat in the fashionable and streamlined pointy toe style My shoes just arrived today so I can t tell you how they ll hold up over time but I d highly recommend taking advantage of this 18 deal while it s still available 
Order a half size up Hey I m bw a size 6 and 6 1 2 and I ordered the 6 1 2 and it was still a little tight I m going to see if I wear them long enough if they ll stretch These were such a good deal I couldn t order a bigger size I ve been waiting for these to go on sale all season so even if they are a little small I really need black flats so I m gonna wear them 
Hepburn rules I have two pairs of these They are extremely comfortable look great on my feet and the price is right Quality seems a bit flimsy and they may not hold up for long but who cares I may buy a pair in every color I can find 
The Best Flats Ever I just received a pair of the MIA Hepburn black leather flats and I am thrilled The leather is extremely soft The shoe is stylish and can be worn with just about anything I highly recommend these shoes so much that I m going to purchase another pair Ironically my co worker just bought a pair today 
Excelente Item This back pack is an excellent buy I bought one for me and all my collegues wanted one I packed it for a two weeks trip all loaded up and it did the job pretty resistant and cool looks The best part is the price 
Great Back Support One thing I want to stress about this backpack is how good it feels on your shoulders when you ve got it loaded with a few books and your laptop It feels like someone is standing in back of you suspending the weight off your shoulders The pack sits high on you shoulders stays there no slipping or sliding and keeps the weight off your lower back It s compact slim low profile and yet plenty roomy enough to carry a few extra books It s got two roomy main compartments and a lot bigger than it looks gadget pouch area My main complaint is with the gadget pouch it s not all that convenient to reach in and grab a pen or whatever because the zipper scrunches up when you try to open the compartment If I had to use this as my everyday backpack rather than my laptop backpack I think I d get rather annoyed with this But I primarily use it to transport my laptop and it does it better than I could have hoped it to 
Solid backpack at a great price Very comfy backpack with well organized sections Great value 
Excelent Product good material for a low price This Product is very good the materials are tuff and for 30 bucks that is really good Laptop stays put in place and you have extra space for books and lots of other things 
great and economical I looked at many backpacks and many reviews on them This is a great bag on the cheaper end of the spectrum I find the pockets helpful and well designed I d read that the zippers were slightly difficult they re that way because there s a rain flap on each Which I appreciate The bag can cinch down nicely if you don t have much in it or expand well And the red is nice 
Perfect Bag for School Heavy duty and very well made Lots of storage compartments and the padding against your back makes it very comfortable to carry 
511 sLIM WITHOUT QUESTION THE BEST FITTING JEANS I HAVE EVER OWNED MOST JEANS FOR SKINNY GUYS ARE USUALLY BIG IN THE REAR END OR WIDE IN THE LEGS THESE ARE PERFECT I VE BOUGHT 3 PAIR IN DIFFERENT COLORS GREAT 
Levis Slim Leg Jeans My son is tall and thin so it is hard to locate and purchase jeans that fit him at the local mall I bought these slim leg jeans by levis for him and they fit wonderfully He wears a size 26 waist and 30 length That is impossible to find 
yes comfortable soft tight Other than extreme lack of small waists in long inseams 31X36 these jeans out manuver any loose jeans I had extremly nonbinding I find them soft and extremly comfortable Different from everybody elses and don t get hooked on bikes or motorcycles like boot cuts love em tight maybe tighter super jeans please LEVI S please make some in US 
Skinny Jeans for a Skinny Guy I m a skinny guy Finding jeans that fit great is hard But these fit great at a great price They hug in all of the right places Seriously if you re skinny and want a pair of slim jeans get these They are amazing 
You can t go wrong with Ugg s With the christmas calendar ticking down to zero hour I was in a time crunch to get these slippers for my daughter I tried other websites even the Brand to no avail all were either wrong size or wrong color I was extremely pleased to come to my trusted Amazon site and find these Indigo Tasman s in the correct size Our whole family has this slipper all in a different color and size but all snuggly and toasty for our little cold feet love them 
Not so comfortable Take all the stars away The string wasn t too much of a string More like a strap that hurt I liked the Gregg Homme s Low Rise Pouch ALOT better This would not be something I could wear except to pose for a few pictures and call it a day 
GREAT ITEMS I WILL BE ORDERING FROM YOU AGAIN REAL SOON THANK 
Love IT I Love this product I really had a hard time finding a product like this in the stores The material is very comfortable and the price is very cheap I will be getting this product again in other sizes 
I love these I was hesistant to order products from this company based on other reviews about quality but these are fantastic I think they are better than the Gerber tank onesies and certainly easier to get in larger sizes They have a generous cut and the 12 18 month size is perfect for my 15 month old daughter with very long torso although she s nowhere near the weight stated on the package about 10 pounds less 
great shirts nice and long Great shirts stay tucked in and long enough for a guy over 6 ft tal 
Beautiful I ordered 3 different coin purses from Nvie All are gorgeous They are small but I wanted them that way The quality is fantastic No one would EVER guess how little you paid for them UPDATE I BOUGHT THIS PURSE WHEN IT WAS CLEARANCED AT 3 99 THERE IS NO WAY IT IS WORTH OVER 5 
Nice little coin purse I bought this for my wife and she was thrilled to receive it It has great design and craftmanship And at this price I think it s a steal My wife has no idea how inexpensive this is 
Izod Sueded Fleece Pullover Very nice quality as would be expected of the brand Timely delivery Thanks again 
Great bargain I ordered this in aqua and was quite pleased the color and quality are great If you think it may be too small as one reviewer suggested why not buy two I love mine 
Excellent Item Just as advertised and worth the money This is a hard item to find in local stores and the quality is excellent 
Go Sox Great replica jersey I expected it to be heavier but actually like the fact that it was a bit of lightweight material Some may or may not like that 
2 can t share 1 pair I bought these for my niece to wear in my wedding and she absolutely loves them In fact my sister loves them too so I may end up buying another pair 
Enzo Caitria Black Patent This shoe is elegant it s comfortable the stacked heel is just right the height is perfect and over all is a beautiful pair of shoe I bought both colors that were available Thank you 
Late delivery Once again an Internet business uses deception tactics for delivery times The item said at the time of purchase ships in 2 to 3 days 15 days later I still have not received the item 
Perfect for Toddler Camp This is the perfect size for kids taking snacks to preschool The size in just right for a child that size to carry himself as the strap is too short for an adult It even has a see through name tag on the top where it isn t immediatly visible out in public 
Do you want the BEST roll down yoga pant I have been wearing Hard Tail roll down pants for years thinking THEY were the top of the line that is UNTIL I purchased my first pair of AMMA Was I wrong AMMA is so much more durable They don t fade out and thin out with repeated washings like Hard Tail Don t let the extra cost mislead you into thinking AMMA is not the best buy Just try your first pair I promise you ll be hooked 
Love my shoes These shoes are made of top quality leather are very comfortable all day and versitle Well worth the money 
Great sturdy workout case This was packaged well and worked great Well worth the price Mine came from myGearStore and it was great quality I guess get it from them not the other sellers 
Bad As soon as I put the case on it ripped Then I contacted the seller and after a BIG hassle they sent me a different case When the Case arrived it was already broken Now I am stuck with 2 broken ipod cases I would strongly recommend not buying from this store 
Great Case This case was such a great price I could not resist My Gear Store got the item to me fast and the my iPod looks great in it 
Great little shoe I love this shoe I want one pair in every color 
A perfect fit comfortable and cool I usually have to search high and low for this brand but it is always well worth it These undershirts are made of extremely soft cotton that is just slightly thinner than your average undershirt from Hanes or the likes The cotton is amazing these shirts seem to last forever and after about three washes they feel like they were made to a mold of your body I don t know what is different about them but unlike cheaper tee s they come to fit you perfectly rather than just hanging flat down your sides like so many other undershirts If you haven t worn these before you don t know what you re missing out on The comfortable fit means your underarms don t sweat at all because the material fits you perfectly rather than gaping open under your arms I really can t describe what a difference these shirts make to my day to day comfort The only complaint I have is that they are slightly hard to come by so once you re hooked you ll always want to have a few extras on hand Highly recommended 
Nice Umbrella Haven t had the chance to use the umbrella yet but it looks to be sturdy 
A Happy Ending My umbrella went to a wrong address in another state It was returned to the vendor He contacted me for help The unbrella then was sent to the right address he picked up the tab for all costs The kind of people with whom I want to do more business 
Just right for two easy to use This sturdy umbrella is easy to open and close and covers two people well even in a heavy downpour The rounded handle is pleasant to hold much nicer than the traditional hook shaped umbrella handle The umbrella s mid size length and weight make it comfortable to pack or carry It s a good product at a good price 
Essential for serious rain or sharing Most umbrellas handle a light rain well but leave you with wet pants during heavy rains This umbrella is essential equipment for keeping you dry during downpours I use it for the walking part of my commute through Washington DC thunderstorms and it performs like a champ It s also big enough to cover two allowing you to share your dry haven with a child spouse or co worker The auto close is great for letting you close the umbrella in a heavy rain from the shelter of your car or cab An auto open close umbrella this size is very hard to find in fact this is the only one I know of Quality is good I ve had one for four years that travels with me regularly on my commute Price at Amazon is great 
sweet This is a very nice umbrella It is big enough to cover you without your legs getting drenched but also doesn t feel cumbersome 
Great Support Great support Love the moisture wicking Nice smooth band that doesn t chafe 
so CUTE These boots were well made and so CUTE Very trendy Delivery was quick and service was great 
A must buy peep toe shoe I was looking for a comfirtable peep toe pumps and I am very happy with Jammin Perfect combination of style comfort and fit NSleek and sexy No sore heels or toes sturdy 4 heels and wide choice of colors 
Nice Shoe I really like this shoe The only draw back is that the leather is not as soft as I would like I think they will be perfect once they have been broken in 
Ibex Rain Suit Got an opportunity to use the rainsuit on fishing trip Keeps you dry but does not block the wind very well Overall good product for the price 
Columbia Rain Suit This is a great suit High Quality and sized as expected Received very quick 
Good product but pants are too long This rainsuit works very well especially the jacket The water proofing is excellent and the price is decent The only problem is that the pants are too long and it is hard to alter them since it would ruin the waterproofing 
High Dry I wanted a rain suit for fishing that was inexpensive I got both and a little more The suit is really well made and is plyable Good buy for the money 
Exactly what I needed I bought this rainsuit so that I could ride my motorcycle in all weather It works great against the rain and it is also the perfect outer shell during the rare freezing temperatures we get in Dallas 
Useful product Excellent price shopped around online and at retail outlets around town Good quality for price Thankfully I haven t needed much this season 
Keeps him dry I have a son who works on a golf course they work in all weather except lightning He needed something to keep him dry and not tear easily This has worked wonderfully well others at work looking for the same 
cap great cap real warm and fits well too bad the shipping costs as much as the ca 
birkenstocks have been around for a long time birkenstocks won t be going out of style anytime soon they are the shoes you wear forever i have a pair that i ve had for at least 4 years and they are still in good shape 
Worth the Price Accept no imitations including Betula by Birkenstock Nothing compares to these shoes and they are well worth the price Consider it an investment because they will last for years Despite what the other reviewer had to say I consider them in style and predict they will remain so for years to come 
Once you go Pouch you never go back Best underwear out there Once you enjoy the ease of the pouch you ll throw out all your old underwear with the off center vertical flies you have to dig for every time nature calls 
I really liked your collection I never ever buy like these underwear before My husband was so happy to wear these boyshort underwear It was perfect in design and material too Last week I ordered 2 boyshorts and before two days I also ordered 4 boyshorts and 1 pack has 3 shirts for my husband and he was very happy with your collections Thank you so much Jockey and I hope to keep the good collection and please don t change the material or design keep it as it is All the best Asma 
Nice and comfortable Just recently bought the Army Trunk Very comfortable cotton boxer brief Compared to other brands I own they are as good or better than CK 2Xist 
Cute Too Similar in cuteness and comfortability to the bikini top these boy brief bottoms are a welcomed mix and match collection Although they run a little small in my opinion they are still a great deal 
great for workout OR costume I bought these gloves for my kids Hallowe en costumes they both wanted to be terrorists The older one now uses them to protect his hands while doing weight training at the YMCA They are great as part of a costume As he s only used them a few times for weight training I m not entirely sure how they ll hold up under the long haul in that capacity 
Amazing 1 on time Delivery 2 Exact size 3 VERY VERY VERY comfortable 4 Reasonable price REALLY 5 STARS CHOISE 
Good shoes They are comfortable and look exactly as shown I did not notice but the stitching on the front is actually asymmetrical Very comfortable 
Comfortable but noisy The shoes are very comfortable and feel very well made I find the sizing about a half size larger than marked but not eough to make it a big deal they also are on the wider side which makes them very nice to wear However they started to squeak rather loudly after about two months of usage which at times can be quite annoying 
Great Clarks Slip On High quality but a little bit pain on the back side if ware it for a very long walk 
Great shoes for frequent flyers I travel a lot on business I was looking for a pair of shoes with formal looking but easy for me to pass security checkpoint at the airport This one meets my requirements perfectly and it s quite comforable just as my other Clark s shoes 
Comfort out of the box and good looks to boot If you re like me you enjoy quality footwear but don t enjoy the lengthy breaking in process that is sometimes required before a shoe starts to feel comfortable That s why I love these shoes They are comfortable right out of the box and I can only imagine they will continue to become even more comfortable as they mold themselves to my feet The hand antiqued leather offers a nice texture that works equally well with dress pants khakis or your favorite pair of jeans They slip on easily with no need for a shoe horn and they stay on securely without coming loose at the heel as some loafers are prone to do This is my first pair of Clarks and I m very impressed so far with the high quality of the leather the comfort and the look All in all these shoes are great I highly recommend them if you re looking for a versatile and comfortable loafer 
good itme I like it is what I expected the ball is good and the video that comes with the ball make a good combination 
Tough Workout Although quick using the 8 pound ball proves to be a tough short workout 
Nice short total body toning workout This is a nice upper body workout because you re constantly moving the ball in various positions that really work your shoulders They also throw in static lunges for your buns and some short cardio bursts I consider myself an advanced exerciser and the 8 ball really gives you a great toning workout and keeps your heart rate up 
Nothin like a shirt with tude This shirt is very cool and a nice round a bout FY to those annoying twits that don t or can t take a hint The shirt is comfortable and fits well It s not a heavy shirt so wearing it in the humidity of new england s summer isn t a bad thing Definitely get one if you like the message A really great shirt I recommend one Nothin like a shirt with tude 
Great little bag with little price Nice product great price Fit the small Sony Sureshot cameras well 
Great product of ADIDAS Is cofashion and fresh light and the combination of colors is cool I recommend the product for everything 
Good Bag We bought it for a Christmas gift It was a big hit It seems smaller than it is pictured but is a great sport purse for lose items such as a cell phone makeup and such 
One of my favorite tops Looking at the photos I wasn t sure about its quality but as I was looking for a camo tee with long sleeves and couldn t find any other I decided to risk it And I LOVE it It s thin and clingy but very soft and comfortable It looks and feels great I wasn t happy with some others things I ordered from Andrew Christian mostly belts cheap looking and gloves but this tee is a ten I would buy it again and I probably should seeing how I like to wear the one I have now 
They were a hit My husband thought these were great And we both like the stripes 
Champion Gym Shorts I have purchased these shorts before and I was very happy with them so I ordered more 
decent shorts for the money These shorts are comfortable all cotton Great for working out I wish they had a lining though 
Trendy beach bag Sturdy trendy and colorful beach bag Can be used for everyday aside from being a beach bag alone Good size roomy with good leather trim Wish they come in more than 2 colors offered blue and red A must have bag 
You can t tell but there s a picture of a rooster on this bag The clear colored picture of a rooster on this handbag which you can t tell from the picture Kinda weird 
Love It Love It I bought the Rosso with the nautical print on it Price is rock bottom when compared to other Prada handbags on the Internet I was thrilled with the size of this handbag when it arrived It is very roomy For instance I put two large rolled up beach towels in it to keep the shape until summer arrives and there s still room to spare It is very nearly the size of a tote bag Comes with a Prada insignia soft cloth bag to store your bag in when you re not using it and Prada COA card just in case you ever decide to sell your bag Prada plate is as customary affixed to one side of the bag and leather Prada tag sewn inside of bag as well I love this bag so much I m planning a cruise just to be able to take my bag somewhere it would look smashing Now that is an impressive handbag 
Nighty This item came in a timely manner and I was satisfied with the item as well the only con is that the shipper used the postal service instead of UPS on the shippin 
My Husband loved them I bought these Boxer Briefs for my Husband and he absolutely loves them 
Expensive but Comfortable They re stylish too I am wearing a pair now and feel totally at ease in them The best pair of underwear I own even if they seem quite expensive 
Calvin Klein Boxer Brief Thank you for your quick shipping I have not been able to find this product locally and appreciate your wide selectio 
classic comfortable classic pump comfortable but size 7 is a little bit larger than a normal 7 
Greatest Shoe This is the shoe I have been searching for all my life Beautiful and comfort like a house shoe I am on my feet alot traveling and speaking and this shoe always looks classy feels comfortable allowing me to focus on my speach not my achey feet I liked them so much I purchased them in 6 colors and even got 2 pair of black leather in case they wear out and I cant find them again 
Returned Item I returned the item because it was not exactly what I was looking for 
Style and comfort I love Bandolinos to begin with but these are one of the more stylish pairs I ve seen Even though they re pointy they are extremely comfortable The heel is just right and they look great with pants OR skirts They fit true to size too 
Work Shirts Excellent craftsmanship and material quality Only drawback is needs a little pressing after washing others I have tried will be virtually wrinkle free 
Paratrooper Fatigues I was excited to receive these Pants Expensive for the quality and They ran way Too Large even after a good wash dry the Return Policy States that they must be returned without washing I have to have them Altered which ads more to the cost I would like to have had them returned for a smaller size I am a 4 6 so I went with the small I was going by the size chart I needed an extra Small beware the sizes run Larger At any rate I now own them and I am sure that after modifications they will last a long time the fit does not look at all like the Models fit on screen She must be wearing an extra small I am Disappointed especially by thinking they would have a nicer fit then they actually had They look Sloppy on not Sexy or stylish they will be Used for Yardwork only 
You ll love these pants This is the second pair of these pants that I ve bought and I now have them in black and olive green My favorite thing about them is the way they slim my hips I wear a size 12 sometimes a 14 and ordered a Large the first time They fit perfectly though I had to pin the part around the ankle to keep it from being so blousy I noticed that complaint on other reviews but it s easy to pin it from the inside and remove some of the fullness The slimness in the hips and the comfortable fabric completely make up for the ultra fullness at the ankle I get compliments on them everywhere I wear them and I can dress them up or down with flats or heels with no problem I did make a mistake when I ordered the second pair and got an XL I washed them on hot and dried them very hot as well They actually fit fine and are really comfortable but I ll order the Large again next time for sure I m going to order all the other colors available and maybe even a second pair in the olive green since I wear them so much They ll never go out of style They re perfect for airline travel because you can put your boarding pass and I D in the pockets while sending your carry on or purse through the conveyor belt security I love these pants 
Pants It took so long for the item to arrive but once they got here The item was form fitting comfortable but the pant legs were way to extended overly wide Aside from the alterations these pants were better than the regular army navy store purchase 
WORSHIP THEM I have some of these and am currently ordering more Forget very big they run HUGE I am also usually around a size 9 with a 25 waist and maybe 29 hips at the very most probably more like 27 despicably narrow I know and an extra small still rides low on me and is baggy These aren t for the size 0s at any rate Besides that these are my favorite pair of pants I own Yes I m wearing them as I write this How sad is that Anyway these are very comfortable durable and I love the material 
BEST ALL PURPOSE CARGO PANT EVER I abolutely LOVE these pants I own four pairs already and I am currently about to order 4 more pairs They run VERY BIG I am usually a size 9 10 and the size SMALL fits me perfectly if you want a snug fit and the MEDIUM is fine too if you want them baggy three of my pairs are MED which ride really low on the hip on me my waist is about 30 and my hips are about 40 and as I said the size small is a nice snug fit but still comfy not uncomfortably tight The 8 pockets are GREAT They are so versatile you can wear them to work if you have a semi casual environment as they look great with a button down shirt or a cute little babydoll top but they are also great for anything athletic you might do I rollerblade and ride a bike pretty frequently and these are my favorite pants to wear The drawstring waist is perfect so you don t need a belt and the drawstrings at the ankle are perfect to tie them up at the knee if you want a makeshift capri I LOVE THESE PANTS 
Love them I love Camouflage pants This year they are suppose to be a big fashion statement These pants are wonderful Good material and pattern Draw string for the waist They ride lower on your waist too They run big They are not skin tight by any means They work for me and can for you too These are great I might get a smaller size next time I washed them and dried them and they did shrink some but not much I say get some You will love them 
Nice leather and workmanship This is a perfect combination of size and workmanship if you want a credit card holder with money clip that doesn t bulk your front pocket this works great 
crdea186 This shoe looks better in person than indicated online I love these shoes they look absolutely fabulous on All of Carlos Santana s shoes are sexy stylish and accentuate your legs 
Sexy and Fun Absolutely love these panties my girlfriend looks so hot and playing with panties on is so much fun great gif 
Highly recommended There is nothing that makes feel sexier than wearing a crotchless panty under your clothes This wonderful piece of lingerie is comfortable enough to wear all day long and yet look super sexy when revealed Combine this with the Portrait Open Tip Bra and you have the kind of outfit that will drive him crazy I love playing the hottie in this panty and highly recommend it to you 
Lovely As you can see from the picture Rather than just having a disquised opening these are truely crotchless Much the same as an open bra all you have down there is exposed all of the time Not only does this look uber sexy for your man It also feels great the first time you feel the breeze under your skirt you feel naked Obviously the only person who knows is you Makes me feel SO sexy My only complaint would be that I now seem to be in a constant state of arousal found myself driving home the other night absent mindedly slipping my hand up my skirt and having a little rub Thank heavens for leather seats 
Risque and Tres Elegant I got these for a lingerie party but I think they are a little to risque for that now that said I wore these all day yesterday and boy did I feel oh so naughty Of course nobody knew but me Well my hubby Jack found out after we put the baby to bed and let me tell you he was pleased so pleased I pleased him These panties need to be hand washed and are made out of Nylon and Spandex They are made in the USA and are tres elegant You and your man will just love them to pieces 
I love my Crocs My Crocs are extremely comfortable I wear them to work where I m on my feet constantly always feeling the support I am already looking into getting the Mary Jane style 
PINK is SALMON JUST KNOW THAT WHEN YOU BUY I like PINK These CROCs were Salmon colored I use them but would have preferred a different color Still they are comfy and make it easy to get up and go 
Crocs for Christmas Love them I bought a pair for my niece for Christmas They are light comfortable and surprisingly temperate My feet are never too cold or hot I now wear them everyday to work If it is raining outside then I wear a different pair to the building and put them on as soon as I am in my office 
Crocs I love these shoes I am a nurse and they are the ONLY shoe that my feet don t hurt in by the end of the shift I even have plantar fasciatis in my left foot I own several pairs I would caution people that they tend to run a little large and try a pair on someplace locally before ordering to get correct size 
Crocs review Loved the shoes Took them on vacation and got tons of questions and comments on them Have since gotten another pair different color model and love those too 
TOUGH AND LONG WEARING Without a doubt the very best work shorts I have ever owned I ve tried Dickies they were too stiff and too tight even though I bought a size larger than I normally wear and Columbia they were WAY too expensive These shorts are very heavy but not at all stiff They wear well and hold up After being washed several times they will take on a slightly softer color and feel I buy these literally by the dozen and wear them everyday I live in a subtropical climate and even wear these in the winter They are the perfect work short Plenty of room large pockets A hammer loop which I never use but is there if you need one Not too long and certainly not too short These are THE shorts to own 
Fabulous shoes This shoe is so comfortable I have this style in three colors black navy and cream and I have yet to wear them once when I did not receive a compliment They look smart and feel great Wide heel base makes for easy balance and stride 
VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED NOW I have been purchasing the Vanity Fair My Satin Fantasy bras for years and YEARS BUT I have become very very disappointed I just bought 4 and ordered the free ones on the special offer quot buy 2 get one free quot Now I have 6 bras that are practicallly worn out after the first wearing The little laces wore through nearly all the way the stay poked out on the first wearing I carefully hand wash them and hang to dry no wringing I think the manufacturer is trying to save money by eliminating the little plastic caps on the ends of the stays I have a huge scratch where the stay ripped my skin The style changed and the quality as well I would like an explanation and would like money back I am so sad that a great product is now less than mediocre 
great shorts I bought these shorts for my husband and they are great You can t beat the price 
Just what I was looking for These are my favorite slippers but are unfortunately not that easy to find especially in the stores at any other time than Christmas It s great to know that I can find what I want and need when I want and need it I ll be back for another pair of these when I ve worn out the ones I ve got 
slippers Regular Dearfoam Slippers were too short The Dearfoam Boots are a little longer 
Dearfoam slippers The slippers I purchased are very luxurious and attractive They are nice and warm which is what I wanted as I have poor circulation They were moderately priced and were delivered in a timely manner 
Beware of advertised Size A very good product Just watch for the slipper sizes The sizing link as well as the manufacturer s website do not list the mapping between M L XL to actual US women shoe sizes Had to exchange the product for this reason The Medium M is actually for women shoe sizes 6 7 5 The Large L is for 8 9 5 This information is from the box Hope this helps 
Perfect These slippers fit perfectly more like a very comfortable shoe than a slipper They are attractive well made and a genuine bargain Probably not for the very wide foot 
women s dearform house shoes my wife likes and said these shoes were exactly what she wanted thank you very much 
Be careful when ordering the size I bought a pair of these for my wife and ended up giving them to my daughter because I got the wrong size I know my wife has a 9 size foot but the shoe size tool on the page doesn t tell you what Small Medium or Large translate to in numbers I got a medium and that was a 6 to 7 size At least it fit my daughter s foot 
Great purse Great service When I received my purse there was a small black smudge on the front of it I sent a note to NVie Designs to see if it could be exchanged They promptly replied with a return address to exchange the purse Well I was shocked to see my replacement purse in the mail before they had received my return The purse is beautiful and I ve received many compliments on it 
original and pretty I bought this as a complement to a dress for a late summer wedding Well it goes with a lot more from jeans to dress up I see a lot of Indian style purses but I ve never seen one like this It is quite practical too by having a long strap to leave your hands free Well done 
Sharp Bag I bought this bag to have something with some pattern color for when I am just wearing solid colors It made my outfit really pop I received a lot of compliments My sisters couldn t believe how little I paid for it It goes well with the whole BoHo trend 
corkycoach I am delighted with this product previously bought addias trainers but found these are lite hard wearing and very comfortable After numeruous training sessions with senior and junior teams this lad on a underage team that my son plays with commented Your Dad has the coolest BBall boots out their which made me feel 7 ft tall for a small man EXCELLLANT PRODUCT 
Awful I bought these shoes from Eastbay They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life After wearing them for less than a week I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes As you walk it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product 
great shoe great price I have 2 pairs of this model shoe and love them After being a Nike fan for years I decided to give something else a try This shoe is lightweight and very comfortable I also love the classic style And you can t complain about the nice price 
Arrived quickly just as ordered This is a cute restaurant style apron made of quality fabric The apron was just as pictured and the company shipped it promptly 
Great Yoga Pants If you ve been looking for a great pair of yoga pants for an active practice look no further These knicker length pants 4 or 5 inches below your knee depending on your height are made of an 88 organic cotton 12 Spandex blend The material is just the right thickness for a sweaty practice like Baptiste Power Yoga fairly thin but not skimpy feeling wicks well enough holds some moisture but doesn t get or feel drenched during your practice Verve is a small Colorado company that makes clothes for climbers That background shows in these pants the fit is just right not tight like a pair of long johns but roomy and stretchy enough to allow easy movement between poses Verve makes a longer Hanuman pant that I have not tried I really like the knickers because they let you see correct positioning of your feet and don t have surplus fabric that might get in your way really good for Tree pose for example 
Hanuman Knickers Guys Attention These knickers really work In a yoga world dominated by women and womens clothing I was really pleased to find clothing that gives guys that full range of motion without getting in the way These fit well and don t bind at the waist No uneccesary cloth at the calves and ankles I love them 
Black Pants The were what I was expecting they would be better if the inside pockets were on both sides 
I love this shirt and I m particular First order a size larger than you usually get they seem to run small I love the sleeve length on these and the fit and feel of the fabric The cut is very flattering I am going to buy more of these You can t beat the price 
Tooo small I bought this in 3 different colors black red white I was only able to wear the black because I made a mistake in the size of the other two I hope to reorder as soon as I get my credit Very nice tee that can be worn alone or under something Thanks Amazon 
Sleeves are nice and long I am 5 8 and have trouble finding sleeves that stay long enough even after several washes and these are great XL fits a size 14 16 well 
A Bargain For the price these T shirts are a bargain They re a soft lightweight cotton knit I bought mine for working out at the gym but they look good enough to wear as casual attire They do run small I bought a size larger than usual 
Beautiful Piece For any and all Juicy fans alike this bracelet is a MUST HAVE in their collection An absolutely stunning piece of couture heaven 
Grey pair These panties are nice but do tend to run a little small I ordered two sets of the girls and got grey undies Grey for a 2 year old girl she wasnt liking them Overall good quality though 
Decent Value These training pants are good value for the money I think they might be sized a little on the small size but other than that they re just what we needed I was having trouble finding this type of training pant locally in toddler sizes For whatever reason they are only stocked in my area up to a size 24 months My son is big for his age and that just wasn t working I do wish I had purchased the next size larger 4T though because I think it s just overall a little bit snug If he grows much he won t be able to use them Hopefully we won t need them for very long 
What s up with the Grey pair I get 2 girly pink pink flowered pairs in the three pack and an ugly duckling Grey pair for the third What the heck am I supposed to do with them Do you think you can convince a 2 year old that those things could be worn by a princess I think not my friend That Grey pair is boring ugly boy color Then again I doubt that Superman Spider man or any of the X Men would be caught dead wearing those atrocious briefs either Loved the style fabric and reinforced crotch but I do feel as if I got only 2 pairs for the price of 3 
Perfect for potty training These cotton training pants are perfect for potty training My son 2 5 became all excited about being a big boy in underpants now Great quality very soft My suggestion Skip Pampers etc training pants and move right on to cotton ones 
Great training tool I really love these training pants the best ones I have gotten so far My 22 month old is pretty much potty trained with an occasional accident These training pants are a little thicker then regular underwear helps to keep the occasional accident contained Very soft and fit nicely 
G String Review Nicely made great fit and great look my husband especially liked it 
GOOD VALUE Silk is very sexy especially on women but men will like wearing these too Just be careful to follow the washing instructions 
Only for the young These bras offer zero support They would be good for someone who is young and firm enough to not need it 
Extreme Comfort I bought these shorts for my Dad and he s very pleased with them because of the comfort fit and style I highly recommend them 
WOW Excellent Poos Bought 2 not really knowing what to expect but can now say these wear and wash GREAT Soft cotton and a really nice fit Going back for 3 more Truly comparable to the 50 00 one at 1 3 the price I recommend these to all 
American Apparel Fine Jersey T Shirt in Black X Large These t shirts fit on the small side for women not Juniors but are soft comfortable and well made I have bought 4 
A Real Turn On That s What These Panties Are I brought a couple pair of these to our little lingerie party because I knew the girls would like them I ve been wearing them for over a year and I like them a lot My husband does too They look good turn him on turn me on too You can t ask for more than that in a panty now can you 
Cute and Pretty Darned Enticing I really like the look of these panties all lacy and feminine They feel good on look great and best of all they re low cut so you can were them with your jeans riding low on your hips And if a bit of panty does peek out all the better cuz these are so cute Pretty darned enticing too if you know what I mean 
Stylish and Nice Hot Looking too These are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff Levi s My cutoffs are so faded so frayed so well you know So when I peal them off to reveal this Butterfly Lace up Panty in Black with the pick laces on the back it s like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl We only had two colors at our lingerie party white and the black and pink models but I can imagine all the colors would be nice too 
I love these panties They are sexy an I love I can have different colors for different days 
Great women s jacket I bought this jacket for my wife and she loves it It seems like it runs a little tight if you plan on wearing additional clothing like sweat shirts It looks good very functional and at a great price at approximately 70 Now my wife can look good and quit taking my warm jackets 
MOST comfortable women s slippers Discovered ISOTONER slippers a decade or more ago at Macys Tried imitations out there but NOT as comfortable so the other brands were exiled to the deep dark corner of my closet for closet monsters to use Only buy ISOTONER now and don t share them with closet monsters These slippers follow me around the house I have even driven in them I am wearing a pair right now I make room for them in my bags when I travel never leave home without them Arch support makes all the difference The women s large is comparable to European size 39 When machine washed and machine dried they come out looking like new They do wear out eventually or get misplaced around the house so buy two pairs Amusing aside Until his feet grew too large my teenage son used to steal my slippers navy blue ISOTONER terry Had to beg him to give them back Now his feet are too large and the men s slippers I have bought him he says are not as comfortable alas 
My favorite slippers have lasted for years I ve had a pair of Pillowstep Clog Slippers for years and they are still my favorite I have tried other slippers but have ended up have either returning them or throwing them away and going back to my tried and true Isotoners I m glad they still make them I m going to get a pair in a different color The design looks even better the sole appears to be more plush and the satin edging is a nice touch The slippers are easy to slip on but not easy to slip in good traction and they wash up great in the washing machine everytime BUT the most important thing is that these slippers help reduce the pain in my feet There are the only slippers I ve had with arch support and they conform and stay on even though they are clogs I have problems with my feet I ve been wearing Birkenstocks lately and even with these my feet hurt after a few hours and I can t wait to put on my Pillowsteps at the end of the day Enjoy 
Love them The pillowstep terry clog slipper is the most comfortable slipper I have ever owned They are pillow soft when you step and they fit nice to your foot and do not slip around when you walk 
Good sturdy slippers I like that these slippers have a rubber sole so if I have to step outside it s OK I wear them around the house They re very comfortable and not flimsy 
Comfy and pretty The slippers are attractive with the little satin edge and the sole is comfortable 
Support in a slipper These are very nice and comfortable The even have extra arch support These are just as nice as the Deerskin but with the added support 
Credit card pouch coin holder The key holder credit card pouch coin holder was just as described The size is perfect for my needs It fits well in my pocket Nice quality Good price It came in sooner than expected 
Good boots I do like these boots but I have had better fleece boots for standing all day in I work as a bank teller and after standing all day the boots don t offer much support They still feel comfortable but a like the padding has been mashed down Not as comfy as when I first bought them As far as warmth they are great Enough sheerling to stay warm but not get too hot when it s warmer outside 
as good as uggs These boots are warm comfy and a great deal The only thing missing is the ugg label so if you re into quality and not brand these are the boots for you 
excellent customer service customer service was great everytime i asked a question i got a reply straight away and i got my product very quickly i reccomend this company 
I love these boots These boots are so great Really warm and comfortable and you can even wear them with bare feet They were really tight at first but the material stretches perfectly to your feet just give them a few days The top isn t too tight either like a lot of these kinds of boots Love them 
THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHOES FOR DISABLED MEN WITH BOTH NEUROPATHY AND KNEE REPLACEMENTS I HAVE HAD HARD TIME FINDING SHOES COMFORTABLE LIGHT STABLE ADAPT TO FEET NOT FEET ADAPT TO SHOE MOLD TO BETTER FIT THAN ORTHOTICS AFTER A FEW WEARINGS CLEAN UP WELL WITH CLOTH AND WATER WARM IN WINTER BUT NOT HOT IS SUMMER CANT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THEM 
The best pants These are one of the most comfortable golf pants I have ever worn They look very nice and feel awesome The waist band on the side gives one the perfect fitting for an ever changing waistline 
Yummy raspberry shirt The shirt is a great color It was a gift and she loved it Very fast shipping from where we bought it as well 
Love em These are great shoes like any 3 3 4 inch heel it takes a few wears to break them in Everyone loves them and the match everything I agree with product suggestions purchase 1 2 size bigger and they will fit perfect 
Great Shoe I love these shoes they re comfortable and stylish everytime I wear them I get compliments on them The heel is sort of high but they are surprisingly comfortable They make my feet look smaller too 
love these shoes Love these shoes they are really made well and good quality the shipping also was great 
Cute but hurt These pumps are very cute but don t plan to wear them more than 3 hours After 3 hours I almost couldn t walk They a little bit to high and to narrow But way to cute they perfect for a dinner date but not for a dancing date 
These are soooo cute I ordered these a half size bigger and they fit just fine I love how they make my feet look small I m a size 9 Definitely purchase these 
Ouch These were the most uncomfortable shoes I ve ever put on my feet I say were because I threw them in the trash after 4 hours of wear They are cute though 
Very cute shoe Much more confortable than I thought and i m used to wearing pumps every day They may run a little snug so if you re going to wear w out hose you might go up a half size I m very pleased with this purchase 
Great Robe I bought this for my Grandson and he loves it It saves his mom from picking up towels all over the house after his shower 
Awesome They were an excellent price and a great quality It was everything I wanted in a robe 
A great robe at a great price This is a very heavy duty terry cloth robe I purchased it for my husband for Christmas He absolutely loves it I went to several department stores before Christmas and couldn t find the right texture This is a great value and a durable robe Enjoy 
Pleased with Sandals I am quite happy with the Easy Spirit Sandals I ordered The fit is good and they are very comfortable to wear 
Perfectly Daring Perfectly Risque Love them in Red I have to say that I liked the crotchless French Knichers also by Love Fifi better and that I ll probably buy a ton of them but I ll get a pair or two of these as well because there are sometimes in the bedroom when you just want to play the Devil and everybody knows Satan always wears red This is the last review tonight We ve had mabye a bit to much to drink a bit of harmless fun for under a hundred dollars each and we all got to record a bit here about what we thought about these very sexy undies It has been fun and I hope we can do it again sometime 
Oooo So Sexy I like these made in the USA crotchless panties We got them in red but they come in black and white as well The red is just so darned sexy it s scary Anyway I think you ll like them especially if you like giving your man a thrill sometimes It s too bad we can t continue this because we re having so much fun but it s getting late I m getting tipsy and I have a lot to do tomorrow yeah right I ll be sleeping in that s for sure I hope you liked our little ramblings here sincerely Ophella 
Almost too Sexy to Put On Boy oh boy Jack just about went gaga when he saw me in these I can tell that I ll have to have a pair or two to wear on those special summer nights I think these would go good with Italian food A nice pasta a good Chianti an after dinner drink turn the lights down low change into something more comfortable just these panties and nothing else Ah yes that would be fun Anyway like the other girls I want to say I ve really enjoyed this evening You could do it too Just get a few friends together spend less than a hundred dollars each drink some wine have fun talk girl talk and show off Sincerely Sara 
Stephanie Sane s Perfect Body is the Star of the Show Red what a daring color Ruffles they give off a look of innocence belied by the red The high back is gorgeous and once again Stephanie with her perfect body is the star of the show We all look good in these don t get me wrong but Stephanie just simple looks beautiful in these delectiable good enough to Well let me leave it there And that s were we re leaving it tonight I guess I get the last word It s been fun this party I admit I was a little leary have Jack here he is a man after all but it worked out okay We ll have to do it again sometime Till then bye bye from Dani Lane 
Great Comfortable I was skeptical of crotchless panties but these are the most comfortable panties I ve owned to date I m going to buy a couple more pairs soon 
great shoe i had this shoe in another color and loved it so much i wanted all the colors they are very comfy and go with everything 
ken cole thong love the shoes i want another pair in different color arrived on time and all is well 
Very pleased I m very pleased with the slippers and my experience with Amazon and Land s End was excellent 
Driftwood Mules I was very pleased with this item it was exactly as it appeared on website and even though I picked a light color they have held up well to dirt My only disappointment was the lack of padding inside the shoe I expected a little more but they are still comfy none the less 
Feel sexy and comfortable at the same time AWESOME Once you wear a pair of the Hanky Panky panties you will never want to wear another brand ever again I was skeptical at first because they are one size fits all but they really are so comfortable I can t even tell I am wearing them They are VERY sexy which comfort and sexy usually don t belong in the same sentence when it comes to underwear You will not be disappointed I wear a lot of low rise jeans and they are well hidden underneath They come in so many beautiful colors and cuts if you don t want the low rise fit 
Pleasantly Surprised This is a great starter thong I have not had good luck with the thongs I ve tried in the past I heard that if you try them out for a week you ll love em and never go back to normal underwear again Well I couldn t even make it 2 days straight with my starter thong I don t know what brand it was but it sure wasn t comfortable This Hanky Panky 4811 thong is very nice I read a bunch of reviews and just had to try it I put it on one evening after work and I even wore it to bed It is comfortable and stays put pretty well It doesn t hurt when I bend over like the other thongs I tried AND it fits me well I am a size 16 18 and I have no problems with the size It stretches nicely and does not dig in on my hips or anywhere else It fits perfectly I will definirely be buying more of these they re great 
Wasn t what I expected The shoe didn t have any insole support it was very flat no cushion feeling in the insole Leather was soft almost too giving Shoe size for B ran very tight If you aren t seeking a good support to your shoe and aren t walking alot this may be an okay choice for you 
Nice and comfortable Very stylish comfortable shoe I bought 3 pair and love them all 
Mootsie s Tootsies Mallory Received these shoes extremely fast The shoes fit perfectly and were in excellent condition I have four pair of these shoes in different colors because of their comfort and price I have had excellent service from Bealls 
Best shoes ever This is THE most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever worn and they are nice enough to dress up or down I was initially reluctant to buy them because they are so inexpensive but I m glad I let the reviews persuade me They appear to be exceedingly well made and they are so comfortable that it s almost like being able to go to the office in your favorite slippers 
Versatile shoe great value I bought two pairs of these back in 2000 navy and black I m still wearing those original shoes They are EXTREMELY comfortable and I think that their softness has helped extend the lives of the shoes I can wear them to work with a pair of dress pants and stockings or trouser socks and I can also wear them au naturale with a pair of jeans For as long and as often as I ve worn mine the value is unbeatable The price is more than fair 
Nice shoes I have them in red and it s a nice dark red The size is true but the leather is really soft so if you are looking for a stiffer shoe this one is not for you 
Nice product fast shipment The product came the first day of the expected delivery window and was in great condition 
great shirt for the price great shirt to wear with a tie minus the jacket for a thin guy like me they are ample enough to be durable but not too baggy for the price you can t beat it 
land s end oxford pretty good bargain I have been wearing these shirts for years Good price good quality great customer service from Land s End The collars fray too quickly with repeated washings which is this product s biggest problem and the buttons sometimes need additional fastening Overall a very good buy 
NIce wallet clutch At first I was daunted by the size of the wallet but WOW It really does organize my stuff I like that I am able to remove it from my purse to carry into a store and lighten my load if you will Real leather nice construction I m happy with this item 
when i wana order the leo desdin size 8 or 8 50 but it is not avalable since long time when it is gonna be avalable agin 
Adorable I am so happy with my stilletos These are the first I have bought and I would definitely stay with these They were pretty comfy the first time I put them on and comfortable enough to wear them around the house cleaning to break them in I love them and can t wait to get the black and red pair 
4 pump with Lace Trim White Everything went according to plan The shoes were exactly as advertised They matched my daughter s winter formal s dress perfectly Thank you 
so hot so comfortable i bought a pair of these shoes in red because they just looked so hot i live in Australia so it took a while for them to arrive i was a bit nervous with the sizing as being Australian our sizing is different to America s i bought a size 9 because i m about at 8 1 2 in Aus sizes But they fit perfectly and are suprisingly comfortable i could wear them all day and my feet won t be sore its fantastic and they are so hot i want to get other colours now 
Just like you d get in the mall only better This bra is exactly like the ones I usually get at the department store in the mall The quality is great The best part about it I didn t have to fight for a parking space or through the crowds to get it 
Flamingo bag My sister is crazy about flamingos She lives in Idaho but still displays flamingos all over her property and home tastefully What better gift for a flamingo lover 
Thinking Pink in Minnesota My daughter is a flamigo fanatic and loved the bag She had received a shirt from this same store bought by her grandmother a couple years ago They match The bag arrived quickly even during the holiday season and even met our short deadline to take it for Christmas at Grandma s The bag s square bottom sits nicely on the floor and the heavy cotton material helps it stand up a bit and will last forever The flamingo images seem pretty robust also Thanks 
Good but not great I think New Balance is a great shoe and fits well These are the best New Balance I have purchased The sole is wonderful and provides great stability My only complaint is that not enough attention is paid to a really good arch support Once I purchased additional arch insoles the shoes were great 
My armband is great My armband is just the right size for the opening I think the other user tried to put the clip end in instead of the other side like you are supposed to This is a well worth the price I have not seen this style out there I like all the color options The armband works great for working out 
Great for the Nano This case was fast to ship from My Gear Store and a great buy for the money 
Best This is my second nano skin The first one i bought from somebody else was awful So i got a black and white one from this seller and it looks SO GOOD Try it you won t be disappointed altho i have to say i wish there are more color combinations 
He likes it My boy friend really likes it says it makes him feel classy 
Good quality fast delivery I m very happy with this wallet is top notch quality with lots of card space and pockets 
Sweatshirt Sweatshirts were perfect I could not find them locally in the size and color that I needed 
Just what I needed I was costuming a play and needed gold sweatshirts couldn t find any in retail stores Found these on Amazon and they turned out to be exactly what we needed They held up great during a four week run of the show 
What to wear These jeans have all of the features that I was supposed to look for to best suit my body type dark wash heavier weight denim and boot cut legs that do not narrow at the knee I think they look great and fit as well as other brands I have purchased at much higher prices Happy days 
comfortable but not durable These are my 15 year old son s favorite jeans The only problem is that they only lasted 6 months The material has not held up well and has developed holes by the back pocket typical but a little early and another by the fly just kind of fell apart I would prefer he would try something else but he truly loves these pants and is willing to pay for them himself which I guess says something 
VERY COMFORTABLE I don t even know I m wearing underwear and they work well with low rise jeans because they sit very low It is TRUE that one size fits all because I am not model thin and they fit great They stay put on my hips and I never feel like I have a wedgy even though they are thong I highly recommend them

Fabulous Product Revolutionizes Thong Market This is a wonderful product I hate thongs but thought I d try this one after seeing the WallStreet Journal article They were right It s fabulous and I cannot wait to buy more It s super comfy and doesn t move where you don t want it to It works great with low rise jeans and doesn t obnoxiously quot hang out quot when you bend over Thanks so much If you don t want to get hooked don t buy one 
Perfect Just right good length inexpensive what more could you want in a slip 
Re Slip measurements This is a very nice slip but only if you want an A line shape that measures 56 inches at the bottom This cannot be worn with a straight skirt or dress The picture is somewhat deceiving 
Perfect exactly what I was wanting These slips were a gift for my mom I sent some from a Dept Store but they were not in the length that she wanted which is 25 long The Dept Stores now only have half slips in much longer lengths 28 32 Such a shame for a petite woman it would end up going down to her ankles I am so happy for my mom that Amazon had these beautiful half slips available from Vanity Fair which she simply loves and the perfect length for petite women Not all of us women are giants from Giant Land you know We have nicely proportioned figures and we don t need the NEW Half Slips with Fanny Pad s etc and all of those extra deceitful under garment freakture s to hide behind in Thank goodness and we are ladies who wish to dress like ladies P S The beautiful satiny soft material was so beautiful too perfect in every way Thank you very much Amazon Vanity Fair I am a very happy custumer 
Daughter in law s gift My daughter in law saw this wallet on line and asked for it as a Christmas gift It was exactly what she wanted just as advertised excellent quality and even though I ordered it late it was received in time for Christmas She was delighted 
Ordered Never received The item was never received and an email to the seller resulted in no response How do I get my money back Additionally this was a X mas present with an expected delivery date of 12 22 06 Needless to say it didn t get here in time for X mas 
Black Leotard It has a great fit There s plenty of room and it has a nice full bottom The snaps at the bottom are extremely well made and they lie nice and flat The construction is excellent I always buy a body suit leotard at least one size bigger than my normal shirt size You want plenty of room in the crotch area so you don t get a lot of pull from the bottom Do treat your leotard somewhat gently so that you don t get a snag in it from a ring or rough handling I wash it in a fabric bag and let it air dry If you have a little tummy the leotard will flatten you out and give you a nice smooth shape 
Just what I expected The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn t be happier I am going to buy another in a different color 
Great skin This is a great skin for a Treo 700 I have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that As others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc But the thickness gains you considerable protection I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type The function buttons are under the skin but easy to press 
Treo Skin The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to do Solid grip and non slip Would be nice if it was not so thick 
Good but specifically for 700W Overall I m happy with the skin It fits the Treo 700 very closely This was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it The 700w and p if you don t know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen The button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p Not a huge deal just a slight annoyance I m going to see if there s a way to remove these somehow 
Incredibly comfortable I highly recommend this incredibly comfortable bra Its the first one I don t want to fling off as soon as I get in the house As a 38D with a physically active job I need something with great support This bra offers that without the underwire halleluia The material is great too and the one that I bought two months ago has worn really well I will definately be buying more 
ULTIMATE T Got this for my 19YR old niece great fit and comfortable Alone or under a hoodie Pale pink color is lovely with a tan 
Washy Shrinkey Utterly impressive array of colors it sure brightens up everyone s face when they a pair of such jolly socks Downside After one or two washings the sock begin to shrink and they become less vibrant despite that I will try to expand my collection as these are very happy and good looking socks Basically I give five stars for design and look two stars for durability Three and a half altogether 
Had it for years I have had a black one of these for years and the lace is just finally starting to go It s a great neckline for a more professional look a little higher than the standard cami but the lace keeps it feminine with a little sexy The lace isn t sheer and the lace straps are wide easily concealing a bra straps for more open necks tops Also the nylon exterior clings to NOTHING and the inside cotton is super soft and the lace is very soft as well Can t wait to get my replacement black and a new one in white 
love this camisole Not only is this camisole very comfortable but it looks good too It looks great peeking out from beneath a blazer or wrap style top It is very soft and has a nice drape I was worried that the lace would itch but it too is very soft and comfortable 
These are the best jeans money can buy If you are like most people these days we practically live in our jeans What we really want is a pair that 1 Feels good 2 Looks good 3 Lasts long and 4 Isn t too expensive Finding all four of these traits in one pair of pants can be tricky but it can be done Wrangler has designed the perfect pair of jeans They offer a variety of cuts sizes and styles so that it is easy to find a pair that fits perfectly which incidentally jeans that fit look much better than jeans that don t even if you are going for the baggy pants hanging at the knees look Regular relaxed angler or carpenter all of the cuts and style feel great Also they are really inexpensive and readily available at Amazon com Wal Mart or any nearby equivalent I am really hard on my jeans I am constantly wearing holes in them ripping them setting them on fire etc I have found no jeans that last as long as Wranglers do I have tried other department store brands like Levi Old Navy or Dickies which wear out quickly some even disintegrate washing them and I have tried more upscale even designer brand jeans like Evisu True Religion or Dolce Gabbana which don t hold up to the wear and tear of everyday life Wranglers have outlasted them all and on top of that they are still cheap enough to replace easily if something catastrophic does happen One word of warning that really applies to all brands of jeans however is that the more bleached or stonewashed the jeans you buy are the faster they are going to wear out If you are really looking for value the dark dark blue jeans are the ones that will last the longest and you may get depending on how much you wear them another six months to a year out of them The stonewashed is the in look however and they are still really good jeans even if they don t last as long There may be other jeans out there in the world that are as good as Wranglers but I ve honestly stopped looking now that I ve found these They do the job and I am happy to wear them 308 days a year 
Pretty Summer Dress Very pretty light weight summer dress The fit is right on I am well endowed in the front and am always worried how things will fit This dress is very flattering 
Life is Good shirt purchase Just what I was looking for Great price and fast shipment 
Great Company The shirt arrived about two or three days after I placed the order I was satisfied only recommendation would be to wrap it in plastic before putting it in mailing envelope to prevent tearing luckily this didn t happen to me Otherwise no complaints would buy from them again 
Great for the Granola Kid bought this for my granola hippy dude teen nephew he loves it the stick figure is cute it was pkgd well and came super fast bought from this company twice actually they are great 
Comfy clogs I love Birkenstock products and was thrilled to get these clogs for under 50 with free shipping They arrived on time and are super comfortable 
Great shoes great service I had never ordered shoes online before but when you order the Burk footbed you know you are getting the right size and these fit perfect The quality was great and I would not hesitate to order from this seller again 
Excellent product This is an excellent product and also the price the only thing is that the size is a little bit wrong i used shoes 42 european size and these shoes are lightly bigger than the size 
Ok I wanted mocha betula birkenstocks I didn t know whether to get suede or nubuk because I didn t know the difference between the two I ended up getting the nubuck because the picture looked better the material is better than suede its waterproof and they will last longer I had suede before and they ended up changing colors because of the wear and tear if you have the same problem these are what you should get not the suede ones 
Good stuff These are great slacks for the price Comfortable and not apt to wrinkling for a bit as it says The sidebanding helps with slacks being typically smaller tighter less forgiving than jeans The olive and black colors look somewhat more professioanl than the rest The only caveat is that they aren t cuffed so it doesn t look dressy but it s dressy enough to go to work and not worry it if they get ruined At 25 bucks it rivals old navy pricing but without the infantile look or no stock issues they have Oh and these suckers shipped in 2 days from Joseph Bank Fastest I ve ever gotten an order from amazon or their resellers Very nice It s durable nice looking and just works 
Help stamp out plumbers crack These shirts are made of heavier material then your average tee shirt They fit well with enough room in them for performing physical labor The loop over the pocket to hold your pencil is a nice touch But even if you drop your pencil these shirts are made long enough for you to bend over and pick it up with confidence 
super comfortable Extremely comfortable soft I bought three different brands online this was by far the best Ended up buying two more 
Great Customer Service As soon as my order cleared the manager called me to verify the color and sizes I wanted He was professional and friendly and told me when to expect the hoodie and the pants I recommend getting the set This is amazingly comfortable and flattering pants look great on the butt I recommend getting different sizes if you are smaller on top it looks cuter Very cute set I will be getting more in different colors 
Great gift for a traveler I bought two and got three of these for my parents who are going to Italy in the spring Its compact and I think it will be very useful for the long plane rides and travel time on the bus 
pb first class travel package As someone who travels on a weekly basis I have found this travel kit an absolute life saver When you consider vanishing airline pillows and less than hygenic airline blankets this is a MUST HAVE item The kit comes in a range of great colors it includes a full length blanket and matching eye mask 
The best flip flops ever I love these things my last pair hung in there for 3 summers and if you wear them long enough they totally mold to your feet You usually pay 25 bucks but I bought two pairs for half price from FootLocker via Amazon in anticipation of the nice weather Unfortunately it s currently about 15 degrees in Southern Connecticut 
simply the best These are simply the best sport sandals ever created I wear none other 
Solid Sandals This is the second pair of these sandals that I have bought and am again pleased with my purchase The first pair lasted 4 5 years and I hope this pair does the same The countours on the feet are comfortable and strap is just supportive and smooth enough 
Wonderful sandals These are so comfortable I love them and would recommend them to anyone 
sandals great sandalsa and washable too Better than expected have ordered 6 more pair in 3 other colors 
fantastic These were better than I could have hoped I wore them for the first time for 8 hours on the first day of my vacation in Hawaii without breaking them in In the water and tromping two miles through the jungle left me with no blisters or sore places on my feet Very confortable 
Works for water aerobics sort of I just started doing water aerobics and needed a shoe for traction while in the pool Unfortunately I need to wear sandals for medical reasons and apparently no one including Columbia makes a water aerobics sandal I tried these because they sounded like they could handle exposure to water and were at a really good price They handle the water just fine drying completely in about 8 hours and show no sign of falling apart The traction isn t as strong as I would like but it s better than bare feet or having damaged toes from shoes Also the sandals create more drag in the water than regular water aerobics shoes making my feet cramp more than they probably would have I gave the product five stars because the sandals are performing the way they were advertised I m just using them for something they weren t designed for 
Quality you expect Great shoes rugged amphibious as promised and the quality I expect from Columbia I bought these because as much as I love my Crocs I needed a less goofy look but all the water friendly features My only wish is for half sizes as the sole runs a little long past my toes increasing potential for tripping This is a great shoe for light hiking but if you re climbing over a lot of rocks get something that covers your toes 
Very Comfortable Good Quality I ve been wearing these sandals for almost 2 months and they re terrific I ve never been able to find a pair in this style that I ve been able to wear comfortably and not get blisters or sore spots These are very comfortable I can walk in them for hours and they don t rub me the wrong way Quality and comfort and they look good what more can you ask 
comfortable beach shoes These are very comfortable beach shoes and I was very pleased with the price I would change the color names because they are too vague and I could only guess which one would match my swimsuit 
Columbia Surftide II sandals Very comfortable and great walking sandal This shoe runs true to size Very pleased 
like open sneakers Overall very comfortable but were a little stiff at first got some blisters but now they feel as good as sneakers with very good support 
Nice Jacket I like how well it works to dress up some of my work outfits as well as my everyday wear It is great for everything 
Spanx thanks Great fitting durable figure improving hose for taller women is hard to find Your product is beyond compare no one else comes close to you in creating comfortable beautiful supportive figure enhancing panty hose that feel SECURE Please don t change a thing 
Excellent product Neuropathy or diabetes I discovered Shue s some time ago and was so thrilled to find them on Amazon com This is a great product for anyone with neuropathy or diabetes They are made so that they are not restricting and don t have elastic or anything to feel tight or hurt your feet Great product 
Warm and cute plus a great fit I really like these fuzzy slippers I hate wearing shoes around the house and these are a great compromise They re very warm and the choice of colors means there s one to fit every mood I just ordered another pair 
TOO MUCH FUN THESE LITTLE BOOTIES ARE SO CUTE AND COMFY HAVE SOLES SO I CAN WALK AROUND IN THE YARD I HAVE A PAIR OF MUK LUKS FROM THE SAME COMPANY GREAT ON COLD FLORIDA DAYS I GUESS NO LONGER AVAILABLE TOO BAD I DON T CARE FOR SANDALS TOO EASY TO TRIP AND FALL OVER A CAT STEPS WHATEVER THESE STAY ON MY FEET ABLE TO WALK OLD LADY GOT RED PEPPER GREAT COLOR GOOD BUY I FELL DOWN MY DECK STEPS WITH A PAIR OF HOUSE SHOES I HAD VERY CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT I WEAR NOW GREAT BUY 
FEATHERY SHUES LIGHTER THAN AIR These slippers are wonderful like being barefoot but warm and cosy Only one complaint when new they have a tendency to shed but that s obviously not enough to keep me from re ordering I m into my second pair and have 2 saved for next winter 
Warm fuzzy cute overall great These slippers are great nice and warm without being too bulky They re super soft and have a nice anti slip tread on the bottom The only thing I would like is adding a bit more cushion to the bottom of the slipper otherwise a fantastic deal in the single digit dollar amounts 
My Fav s These have become my most favorite slippers They are so soft cuddly warm Thanks ever so much for carrying them 
At last the perfect gym bag My search for the perfect gym bag is like my search for the perfect hair drying yoga mat organizing products garlic press Zyliss etc Fortunately my search for the perfect gym bag is officially over The Ogio Locker Bag is brilliant and the inventor should get some sort of award K R T Seeley s review sums it up pretty well but here are a few things to add For one thing the shoe area also nicely accommodates a hair dryer or curling iron One of the reasons this matters is that it points up a critical advantage of the shelf separating the shoe area from the upper part of the bag while the shelf is sturdy it s also adjustable It goes only low enough to allow for a pair of shoes but it can also be raised to allow for other items Next while it s very nice that the front end panel has all these handy little pockets for things like shampoo brush and whatnot actually including containers that fit the pockets shows a real consideration for their users Another plus is the number of outside pockets several of which are not only zippered but waterproof as well for say wet bathing suits Before I bought this bag I called my gym and yes I really did make them go measure the width of their lockers The magic number was 12 At 8 the Ogio bag fits in with room to spare For raqueteers sports not crime there are several loops on one of the end panels for holding racquets and a couple of others I haven t quite figured out yet For yogis and yoginis yes the adjustable strap on the end panel can accommodate a yoga mat if it s not too thick An outer side pocket nicely accomodates my workout journal yes I m a fanatical record keeper as well as my beloved NewGrips just do a search on NewGrip which are indispensable for rowing notoriously hard on the hands and weight lifting and about a billion other things for those of us with carpal tunnel arthritis or in my case both Another outside pocket is perfect for a CD player and headphones The only improvement I can imagine for this bag would be adjustable straps on the bottom to hold larger rolled towels or mats Unfortunately even Title9 doesn t seem to carry that one anymore In other words this bag is the best on the market It s a bit pricey but it s worth absolutely every cent I suspect that quite a lot of my friends will be getting the Ogio for Christmas and birthdays and whatnot Congrats Ogio and thank you very very much 
Best gym bag on the market This bag is simply amazing I go to the gym 4 times per week and often go directly from work so I needed a bag that would hold everything I needed to workout and clean up afterwards The Ogio Locker Bag does it all it s got a special compartment for my gym shoes and a shelf to separate them from my towel and workout gear It fits perfectly in just about any gym s locker I go to Bally s and with its front opening door you can access everything you need while your bag is IN the locker I love the fact that it comes with containers for my toiletries shampoo conditioner soap and also with a comb brush and mirror To top it off it s light weight sturdy and even comes with a built in vent so that your wet sweaty clothes don t get too ripe LOL I couldn t be happier with my purchase GET THIS BAG You won t be disappointed 
Job done Ideal for anyone travelling to Britain who intends to plug something in during their stay 
Love these shoes I bought them in red and I can wear them with many different outfits Very cute fit well and surprisingly comfortable 
Love these I got these in black not sure what i will wear them with Very cute and pretty comfortable Highly recommend 
Jessica Simpson Slingback Heels I LOVE them and wear them w basically anything great prices perfectly made and comfortable im 5 9 with out shoes and about 6 1 with the shoes on well just a little under that 
Cute shoes These shoes are very comfortable and really cute Run a little small so be careful when ordering 
Love em The shoes run a little small so order a half size up but I love the shoes overall They fit great and are very stylish 
EXCELLENT PRICE LIGHTENING FAST SHIP These came from Bealls and I must say my husband LOVES them It s hard to find short shorts and they re excellent quality 
I love it This shirt has a soft feel like it has been washed many times right out of the package Great quality and the color is perfect I love it 
Excellent Service Love how easy it was to order unfortunately I ordered the wrong size twice but had no problem returning purchases for credit 
Had to return These shoes looked great but had to return them because they were to small When shopping for puma increase the shoe size 1 full 
Finally warm gloves I have sensitive hands and most gloves are too tight or too loose and never warm enough These gloves are such a comfortable fit and actually keep the cold out I love them 
Warm quality gloves This purchase was well worth the money gloves are soft yet warm great fuschia color pink and durable 
Great These pants are soft fit to a T and did not shrink when washed Look good too 
Running a bit small The quality of this item is fabulous the shipping was FAST but they do run a bit small All in all it s a good pair of yoga pants and a great price 
COOL Adidas makes very nice summer sandals This is the cheapest that I ve seen I buy them for my kids every summer They last all summer and beyond unlike other sandals My kids think they are cool too 
Nice and comfy but get dirty pretty fast Nice pair of slippers with great looks I love the way they massage the feet when walking if I had to choose one downfall I would say they get dirty pretty quickly and since the massaging spikes are hard to get into it s harder to clean them otherwise a decent pair of slippers I d definitely buy another pair in the futur 
Give them time to break in and they are wonderful I bought these slides for house slippers based on the other reviews I read I will give one caution you may not like them in the first few weeks The first few times I wore them my feet were really sore after about an hour or two I recommend wearing them with socks for a week or so until all the nobbies soften and become more flexible After this break period you ll be able to wear them any way you like and you ll love how they feel after a long day of wearing shoes 
Comfy and cool For a trip to the beach just down the street or for a warm outing these sandals serve their purpose First and foremost the soles massage the feet every step The sensation is quite soothing especially when first breaking them in Even after having these sandals for longer than a year they still do cushion the feet very well The addidas brand and outer design are a blast to wear and show off It s funny but true that I actually receive attention pertaining to a pair of sandals This pair has the best of both worlds 
Good classic sandals Great versatile sandals for the price Will never go out of style and you can wear them almost anywhere with almost anything 
great sandals When I first got the sandals it was a pain to have on They have these brissels on the sole of the foot so it was uncomfortable for a couple of days but I guess they softened up and now I wear them like everyday with socks and with out The are very comfortable and not much else because they are just sandels Very good quality too very durable A MUST BUY If you need sandals 
swimster These were replacing the same thing so I knew what I was getting Pool side they are the greatest sandals or maybe even just lounging around Adidas makes pretty good stuff 
Gift for my wife My wife loves this kind of earmuff over the top of the head She doesn t like the ones that wrap around the back of your head neck she finds those squeeze her head and aren t comfortable after long periods of time and fall off This model is her favorite and she wears them every winter day This is her second pair in about 6 7 years they seem to have a long life Very durable and fold up nicely to put in your pocket Yet easy to open and put on your head She has been known to wear them for hours at a time and finds them very comfortable They stay on your head even when running jogging and are also light weight wind proof and warm 
not yet received I still have not received this item and am wondering what in the world is going on 
Almost didn t order but glad I did I almost didn t order these ear muffs based on some other reviews but I m really glad I did If you re looking for a simple ear muff these are it and they are a great deal at only 5 69 One of the other reviewers commented that they were poor quality and too thin They are thin because they are made with Thinsulate If you want something bulky I guess you should order a product not made with Thinsulate 
HORRIBLE LOW QUALITY BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK I was very disappointed when I opened the package from GemAvenue Here s why 1 The ear muffs are of a very LOW Quality Hardly worth the 14 99 GemAvenue e4hats charged me for it 0 99 would have been a fair deal 2 The ear muffs were advertised as being new but it had a definite second hand feel to it It reminded me of opened merchandise from the Salvation Army Store No Joke In fact there were no tags on it at all to inform me of where it was made what it was made of washing instructions etc it did not even have the name of the manufacturer 3 The plastic band felt very fragile like it would break with the slightest pressure Adjusting the width was nerve racking because I had to be very careful not to break it 4 The wool had a very SYNTHETIC feel to it Furthermore it was sparse and flat NOT warm and fuzzy I doubt very much it is sheepskin as claimed by GemAvenue Besides there was no tag to indicate that it wasnt in fact some sort of CHEAP polyester 5 I tried it on and it did NOT cover my ears completely so you can be sure its NOT going to keep my ears warm at all IN CONCLUSION this product is NOT NEW NOT SOFT NOT WARM NOT GENUINE SHEEPSKIN What more can I say I am just disgusted at Gem Avenue e4hats for selling me this rip off useless piece of JUNK I will NEVER buy anything from Gem Avenue e4hats EVER again 
Finally found them I had been shopping in stores and could not find traditional ear muffs It only took me 5 minutes through Amazon com to find exactly what I wanted These ear muffs are comfortable sized right and a great price 
these are the best Love the Athens Crocs flip flops but better Bought them just before a vacation and have been wearing them ever since The bottom is very cushy but supportive Great if on your feet or having to walk for awhile I used to go out and after a while my feet would ache but with these I can walk and stand for a long time and my feet don t get achy One suggestion these run large I originally ordered a 9 and they were way too big I had to exchange them for one size smaller then the fit was perfect Also the first couple of time I wore them I could feel the strap between my toes but by the 2nd day I couldnt feel it any longer so just stick with it 
Beware Sizes run 1 size to big Luv them but order 1 size smaller they run BIG I wear a true W 6 but they were too big Size W 5 fit great You might have to go to kids crocs They should tell you that in item description so you can order correctly Besides that I would give them a 5 I have no idea why they are sized so wrong If you order your true size you will have to return them for one full size smaller for a proper fit 
great price I ve been wanting these since last summer the price was the seller Comfortable and light weight Crocs are great 
athens crocs are great I tried these crocs since I was looking for a flip flop that I could use for coaching swimming Most flip flops make my back hurt after a while since I am standing on concrete for 3 hours I like how these have a raised heel and the pressure all goes to my heel which makes it really comfortable I wear a 7 5 and I bought the 7 and it fits great I really like the two toned color and got the fushia lime crocs 
Perfect warm weather shoe I have a few pair of clog crocs and bought these for a HI vacation They were very comfortable and provided great support I m looking forward to wearing them after work and on weekends this coming Summer 
Athens Crocs beware of the ocean These sandals are very attractive and very light Too attractive and too light if you leave them close to the water s edge as my wife did the first time she wore them The ocean took a great liking to her sandals I managed to recover one but the other is now sailing around the Caribbean Sea 
Satisfied My fourteen year old daughter loves Crocs These were a Christmas gift and she was thrilled She will be all set for our Summer trips to the lake I loved the price cheaper than any place else 
muy buen detalle para hacer regalos excelentes en dise�o y tama�o comprelos si piensa en ropa util y durader 
VERY CUTE I WILL BE ORDERING FROM YOU AGAIN REAL SOON THANK 
worst cap and booties no proper shape to the cap and the booties doesn t stay fit to the legs of baby not worth paying fo 
Keep those ears covered I hate to see parents with their babies outside on windy cool days with nothing on their feet and or head Size is just right and my boy will be able to wear for the next couple of months 
Twill Sandwich Cap Navy Khaki It is hard to imagine a better price on a twill cap than the one I got on this one It is as sturdy attractive wearable versatile as any cap I have ever owned I don t know if I got the sale price on this item but I do remember it was a fantastic price Had no idea the quality would be so good If you are looking for an extra cap with no logo on it this is about as good as you can do The delivery was timely the tranaction worked seamlessly between amazon and the supplier 
Clarks cumin slide is better than expected I bought these slides based on the good review but have no idea that they would be so comfortable They are very well made and perfect fit that wrapped around my feet The color is very neutral for the summer I think I m going to enjoy lots of walking with them during the summer months 
Clark s Sandals Super comfortable sandals Great price Will buy more in several colors 
great bargain you can t go wrong for the price at 50 off this is a steal the dept stores that carry Clarks never sell for this cheap I bought 5 yes 5 pairs of Clarks last week 4 pairs are this style different colors i just couldnt resist and i received the shoes today tried them on and they are COMFORTABLE i cant wear them yet out but i am sure i will get real good use this summer go for it don t pass up a good deal 
Bone colored sandals Love Clarks and loved the price so I ordered these for my daughter as a future gift Size 12 s aren t found many places especially at a bargain price They look great and over good support The difference in these compared to others is the stitching on the top piece It s stitched on top rather than invisible and it seems to make it a little less wide Hope it works well for her 
Clarks Cumin Slide in Cotton This is a comfortable slide in a neutral color but the leather is a bit stiff not as pliable as some of the other Clarks sandals I have Maybe it will soften in time But they are still good everyday sandals and they were a good buy hence the 4 stars 
Love Clarks I love Clarks They are the best fitting shoes I have ever worn They never hurt my feet and I have to be careful with me feet because I am a diabetic You can t go wrong with Clarks I try to buy my Clarks on Amazon because I can get such good prices 
Clarks at a great price The shoes are great very comfortable and ordering throught Amazon was quick and easy They were delivered within a few days and I didn t order express shipping I will buy through Amazon again I highly reccomend shopping with Amazon 
Love Clarks Shoes Clarks shoes never let me down They are well made and look good on my feet I own several pair and look forward to owning more Love my new sandals 
Good shoes terrific price Good job getting the shoes here ahead of schedule They re a little different than expected guess the photos didn t show the detail as well as I thought Once I got used to them I m pleased with the fit and comfort For the price thinking of buying another pair maybe not just the same but similar 
Intimo Men s Classic Silk Knit Tank Top I love my Silk Tank Tops I wear them to work under my dress shirts and the feel is very nice Much more comfie than the Hanes cotton tanks The quality is very good for the price The initial fit was just a tad snug but stretched out just a bit after a couple of washes wears and is very comfortable now I tried wearing one on a hike but i find the coolmax type active wear handles sweating much better than silk But for casual wear or sleeping at night I love them 
Nice and sexy If you have the body to show for it by all means wear it alone 
Very silky and wearble I bought this top for my 18 year old son thought it looked comfortable to wear under shirts etc It is He likes wearing it but he says he would never wear it alone It is a wee bit too feminine to wear on top Would I buy another one I don t know I think for him the basic cotton tank tops are more versatile 
Urlacher Youth NFL Replica Jersey Great quality item excellent speedy delivery very happy to have dealt with this vendor 
Bears shirt I was very pleased with the Urlacher jersey for my grandson He has hardly taken it off since Christmas 
if you love the Yankees you will love this cap So comfortable and adorable I hate hats and I wear it all the time GO YANKEES 
first time ordering on line I have been wearing Harbor Bay Stretch waist pants for quite some time Last year I bought some Geo Foreman stretch pants which fit fine but the material is not good it beads up and my wife has a term for that which I can t remember and I wear them once and they wrinkle so bad it looks like I slept in them The store did not carry your Harbor Bay any more and when I found I could order on line that was terrific I love your product I will order more in another couple weeks I would like these in brown beside Navy and grey 
Excellent value These slacks compare very favorably with pants in expensive Big Men type clothing stores yet are quite affordable I Have been very pleased with the look and durability of these trousers 
Harbor Bay Stretch Waist Pants I am very please with these pants They look good and are comfortable to wear 
comfortable shoes These shoes are very comfortable even wearing them for the first time The make is slightly bigger than the actual size I ordered a medium width which fits well though I thought I usually wear narrow width I was going to order another pair in a different color but they were already sold out It is a bargain They go well with pants and would be OK with causal dresses 
Great shoes but small in the toe I like these shoes because they are durable however the toes are very pointed and don t have much room The material behind the ankle is low so it s difficult to use inserts without making them feel like flip flops 
the best shoes ever i think these shoes are the best shoes i ever had and trust me i have alot of shoes they are comfortable and very fashionable people always ask me where i got them they cost alot but i think it is worth it 
Lightweight running shoe Adidas has three types of shoes for their Ride shock absorption running shoes the Gigaride Megaride and this the Microride Microride outsole consists of smaller sized absorption grooves aka Nike Shox lookalike Gigarides and Megarides emphasize shock absorption Microride is more concerned with weight it seems like There are also two models of Microride one with full fabric top another with synthetic leather construction This one is the full fabric which is supposed to be soft and also lighter The synthetic leather is supposed to be more durable Anyway with the combination of Microride and full mesh top this shoe is low and very light I can t find a number anywhere but once started running the shoes feel like featherweight The impact is a little bit harder due to less shock absorption so it s probably more of a treadmill shoe than trails Overall though very comfortable It s my first time with running shoes this light and I like it With these I achieved my fastest pace ever with less effort than I would have expected A couple of things I did notice the size is on the narrow small side compared to my Nikes and the back heel support is a bit hard tall for my liking The white version gets dirty quickly Running was good but walking on wet road experienced slight slippage Also the workmanship leaves a bit to be desired 
Surprisingly shock absorbing I found this shoe quite stable and surprisingly shock absorbing I usually buy my adidas size 10 but this was a tad larger than other adidas size 10 So beware and buy it 1 2 a size smaller than you usually buy your adidas A very good running shoe overall 
Great boots for rainy Seattle These boots are not only cute but they work great and I would know I live in Seattle My only complaint is that they aren t comfortable for walking long distances and the lining came up after wearing them a few times But overall I m very happy with my rain boots I get compliments on them every time I wear them 
sketchers klone athleisure shoe Very nice shoe Got them at an excellent sales price of 19 95 plus shipping I am very pleased 
Great Shoes This is the perfect little Summer shoe Great Ked s quality with a fashionable design 
Ked s stand the test of time I can remember wearing Ked s when I was in high school and it was cool even then The distressed sneaker is comfortable and easy to wear right out of the box Just slip them on and GO 
baseball jersey The product was fine and I got it very quickly But my husband didn t like the length that the sleeves came to 
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT This is an amazing bag I love it 
Comfy I bought these for my sister and she wears them all the time She says that they are the best fit she has found in any maternity pants I would recommend them to anyone who likes to wear pants all the time 
Love these little shirts These hard to find little shirts are perfect for your new little one no over the head to upset them Love the long sleeve also Amazon has done it again Fast delivery and great products Thank Yo 
the best shirts for newborns I love these undershirts They are better than onesies especially for newborns Onesies slip over a baby s head whereas these shirts don t Much easier to dress a newborn I also liked the built in mittens so baby can t accidentally scratch herself I told my sister about these and she bought some for her newborn son She loves these shirts too AND you can t go wrong with white 
Marines T shirt The shirt was as described Fit well washes well colors vibrant My nephew loves it 
Good shirt I ve had this shirt for over four months now and it still hasn t faded It s made out of thick material and looks good too Excellent shirt 
Totally comfortable This bra is great I have never owned a more comfortable underwired bra in my life It gives me all the support I need and the fit is great You will not be disappointed if you buy this bra and the price here is fantastic 
best bra ever This is a great product excellent support holds up well in the wash and maintains its form thoughout the day I have always had a difficult time finding a bra that has functionality as well as style and comfort This product does all of the above and very well Definately a great product and a I give it a strong buy recommendation 
Good Quality Bra This Bra lived up to it s online description It gives excellent support and survived washing in the washing machine and the dryer I recommend it especially for full figured women 
boxerbriefs I love these one of my friends sugested that I get a pare If you have not tried these you need to 
A Little Loose I m 13 and I I love to wear these boxer briefs because they are so comfortable I ve been into puberty for about 2 years now They tend to ride up the legs a bit when sitting down They aren t as thick as the fruit of the loom boxer briefs which is better because they don t get as hot After they are washed and you wear them they are pretty tight for the first 10 minutes but after that they are just so loose on the legs You start to loose some of the support your looking for I would suggest to get a size smaller than what you really are I m a waist size 29 and I should be wearing an XL but they are too loose so I wear the L Try it out and see if you like them They are awsome for camp outs and swimming and anything than gets you moving Great support 
Comfortable These have a nice fit I recomend them for all occasions especially campouts hiking trips backpacking or anything else that is active These are even cool enough for school locker rooms 
V neck Tank I ordered three of these They are very nice and keep their shape washing after washing I love the bright colors which also handle washing well My only quip is that they seem to creep up a little bit and I have to extend them back down I usually don t work out with these tops but they could easily handle workouts in terms of their stretch and retaining their after wash shape They have a bra shelf on the front and that makes it nice but there is not a whole lot of bust support in terms of acting like a real bra However I still might order these again for casual wear or for a little active wear in which I m not jumping around alot 
My niece loves these I got these for my 14 year old niece She wears them with jeans or cargo pants and loves them Very cool 
Really nice wallet I bought this wallet and it s really nice exactly as it looks on the picture I totally recommend it 
Why I don t like this wallet I just received my wallet today and must say that I am very disappointed First of all it doesn t have enough compartments It might be ok for someone who only carries an ID and 4 additional cards and nothing else The card slots are very tight and not made to fit more than one card in the same slot There is no spare key holder and no storage behind the ID card window The fabric inside the billfold is so thin you can see right through it This wallet is cheaply made unlike the Fossil I currently own which has held up for over 5 years What a waste of an Amazon com gift certificate 
Great choice If you have a tri fold preference this is a great choice at a great price Good for guys who don t carry a bulging wallet If you don t have a tri fold pref maybe you should give it a try 
N 3B Snorkel Parka I am so glad to be able to buy a parka like the one I bought years ago when these coats were more popular That one was wearing out badly and I was concerned that I would not be able to get one like it again as you just can t find them anymore in the retail stores It seems that being warm smart isn t cool or in fashion anymore The hoods on these kind of coats are excellent for cold windy winter days I tried a few of the military outlet places and wasn t satisfied with their quality I was so pleasantly surprised to find this parka for less than the military outlet stores The only thing it lacks is a inside lapel pocket but I guess I can learn to live without that 
Good shirt This is a good shirt and I like it When I ordered it ended up being a bit too big for me so I am having the sides tailored bring them in Be sure to get the right size for your body 
Very nice shoes comfortable and sharp I bought these shoes to wear with my Hickey Freeman suit as I wanted to try something from traditional cap toe oxfords I have to say I love the style but I d classify them more as dress casual than dress formal I ll still probably need to find another pair of dressier oxfords to wear with my suit but for gray slacks these are perfect 
run resistant tights These are the thickest and most run resistant tights I have purchased While still looking pretty 
very warm and snuggly I love these boots they are soft inside with thick sheepskin lining The purple color was lighter than I expected but I like them anyway 
Bearpaw 405 Womens Suede 12 Boot with Lugged Sole 10 Chocolate Nice boots quick shippin 
very good product I purchased these boots the sand colored ones in Feburary and I have to say that I am getting so many compliments I haven t used them as much as Id liked to with this crazy weather we are having on the east coast but I am not displeased one bit They are so soft inside with the sheeps skin and they fit great under jeans Definetely by this product They are cheaper than uggs and just as good of a product even better 
Great kicks great quality These are terrific The fit and arch support is great the quality of the suede and lining material is wonderful and the lining of the boot keeps not only your feet warm but your entire calf as well These were definitely worth the money Very well made beautiful color assortment and I ll be ordering more pairs in other colors 
Great show and service Shoe is good and service on delivery was in a timely fashion 
Great I was pleased with the delivery time as well as the purchase itself Thank you 
bear paw i loved loved these boots i live in alaska and o its cold out here and the bear paw is the best i have most colors i have uggs also most colors i didnt know of bear paw until my friend from california got me some for xmas i called her and told her you must of paid alot for them cause they were way better then my uggs the dark color dont fade like my uggs did they kept me so warm and they did streach and get all lose like my uggs did toltaly spoil your self with these when i found out how cheap they were i had to get most every color in tall and short they are awesome i totaly love them 
Comfort and Beauty I purchased these for less than 20 once all discounts were applied I have to say these were a fantastic buy I have purchased 15 20 pairs of shoes and boots from Amazon over the winter due to their fantastic sales but i believe these are my favorite so far They are very warm comfortable and easy to put on they basically slip on I got these in Black Firefly I wear them with jeans and cords alike They go with everything They are waterproof The faux fur at the top has a double function it also prevents any rubbing which occasionally occurs when i purchase boots of this type If you buy these you wont be sorry they are very well made and incredibly comfortable for a fashion boot 
Hue Plus Soft Opaque Knee Hi These knee highs fit perfectly and are soft and comfortable and truly opaque This was not the case with most of the other knee highs that I have tried The only drawback that I found was that when I wore them with chinos there was major static cling in Jan which made them stick to the slacks and not look too great So I m going to wash both slacks and stockings using fabric softener and see if that fixes the problem I hope it does because these knee highs are the best I ve found and fit so well Also they stay up no matter what 
Great trouser sock A comfortable soft well made trouser sock I am very hard on socks I tend to walk around in stocking feet a lot and have worn these several times with no runs or tears Will definitely buy more 
They do show Very sexy and comfortable But the line does show through my dress pants which is why I gave it 4 stars Otherwise I love these 
Excellent Product Great little scale that gets the job done for a bargain price I like that it freezes the highest recorded weight measurement on the screen for your review 
Serve Up Some Romance for Not Very Much Money These thong panties are a way to serve up some romance for not very much money They re inexpensive feel great look better I love the scalloped lace love the way it wraps around me leaving no panty line Wear these with a skirt or tight fitting pants and it ll look like you ve got nothing on at all under your clothes These are a hit with me 
Looking Good in a Lacy Thong Panty Panties in front thong in back gorgeous band around the waist can t ask for more than that in a panty I like the way they feel the hot way they look My girlfriend Sara sure loves them and I can see why 
My Every Day Wearing Panties These are the panties I wear every day They feel good come in colors and there is absolutely no panty line at least not one me And the best part is not only do they feel good on they look good two I know this because my guy Jack never takes his eyes off me when I m wearing them which is a lot I brought several new pair of these to our lingerie party and they were a hit everybody loved them Maybe Love Fifi should give me a commission 
Great fit This thong fits me great It s cool and comfortable Has a wide waist band that keeps it in place nicely It is a bit difficult to get it back in position after the men s room without half undressing 
Very comfortable underwear These are my single favorite pair of underwear Not your typical mens undewear but much more comfortable and stylish I m in the military so at first I thought thongs are not for real men but after wearing these I found they are and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize I wear these for every day activivties sports work and leisure There isn t much fabric so they re great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy After wearing them for a while it s like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it If you ve never owned a thong I think you should give these a shot I definately recomend the Calvin Klein Body thong 
Nice sandals I really love this sandals the fit true size Got a lot of complements with them The color is as you see it 
Undies I was most happy with the quality of the undies and the speed in which I received them 
Great Shirt I love Calvin Klein shirts They fit slim and tight so they re not for everyone but if you like that fit then they are for you Be careful thought because CK makes some cheaper shirts that don t hold up as well but these Stretch ones are terriffic and worth the price The Spread collar is nice because it s not too huge I read that if you have a long face as opposed to round then a spread collar is best and that seems to be true 
Calvin Klein Dress Shirts Ordered seven shirts for groomsmen in a wedding wearing linen suits Really like how shirt has no front pockets gives the shirt a classic look The shirts are of good quality they wash and iron up nicely There are regular tall and large men sizes available Shipping was speedy Would gladly do business here again 
Nice Shirt I love the Calvin Klein brand of clothes and have been a loyal customer for quite some time So I was visibly delighted to see CK shirts at such great prices on Amazon Selected Purchased Shipped and Delivered in no time I am very happy with this product It has a lovely feel and lives upto its brand name Definitely go for it 
all shirts should have some stretch Great feel my husband usually buys 100 cotton dress shirts this has a slight sheen to it nicely dressy not disco 
great Im 13 am getting into puberty This underwear helps alot in school because I get sudden erections One time in gym we were changing and I looked at another guy and got one and thanks to these briefs they hid it so no one saw it Also their a big hit with your boyfriend to cause my bf loves it and he wears them for the same reason 
Great feedback for seller of item Received item timely and was in exact condition as described Great seller A ++++ 
Good fit and good material I just ordered this slimmer and I love it It is such a good idea to get one of these even if you dont struggle with weight it just makes you look slimmer than you are It fits great and the material is perfect It is not all cotton so it wont stick to whatever you have on over it It is a satin like material so it gives you a nice lean silouhette 
Christmas Gifts Nice shirt that arrived quickly and I would not hesitate to do business with this company again 
Great My 3 boys and hubby love these These are great with the comfort waist band and the no tag No complaints about itchy tags or elastic waists As for the comment about no fly My household of litle men actually like those better Honestly who wants to try to manage things through the little fly opening ayway lol These worked out much better especially during potty training 
Great for very young boys I bought these for my son when he was two years old It s very hard to find boxer briefs in size 2T 4T xsmall I wanted underwear that he could slide on and off easily by himself when going to the bathroom The very soft waistband in particular makes this really easy They fit well hold their shape are very soft seem very comfortable and are cute too He s three years old now and still enjoying them 
Nice boot This boot is nicely made but uncomfortable if you have a wide foot 
Awesome boots Very comfortable Perfect heel height and nice looking You can t ask for more 
good comfortable boots This pair of boots is surprisingly comfortable The heels are not too high it s about an inch making it less painful for a whole day affair I d recommend this to anyone who doesn t want the strain associated with wearing high heeled shoes 8 hours a day and yet wants to complete a professional elegant look 
Best service EVER PJ s arrived within days of the order However the bottoms were mismatched Taking the phone number from the invoice I made a call to the company and found a friendly customer service voice A replacement pair was sent within days I am a huge online shopper and this is a great site 
Luskey s Ryon s Great customer service Lyskey s Ryon s provides a wonderful selection of western wear at very reasonable prices however the quality that won me over is their great customer service skills They help you out in any way possible and are very prompt at shipping your order If they don t have the item you ordered in stock they will often substitute it with a similar item in order to expedite your shipment The hats are of good quality and the prices are right The 20X Toyo Panama Straw Cowboy Hat is wonderful for kids 
Cute and Comfy for my Preteen girl I have a just turned 12 yr old girl with a rather large foot size 10 women s and these look cute and are comfy for her without having the typical heel that I usually can only find in her size I bought her the silver ones and they fit comfortably although they say here they run small they fit her okay in her regular size I cannot attest to the durability of them yet because she just got them but I think overall because it is the Skechers good reputation and that they were an excellent price that we made a good deal 
Comfortable These were exactly what I was looking for They are very comfortable to lounge around in and for working out too 
I ll buy these again Didn t run when I put them on weren t too tight I m pregnant everything s too tight stayed supportive and firm didn t run all night including at the wedding dance I was a bridesmaid and I washed them out and they still look brand new These are awesome nylons Color was light enough so they didn t look fakey I m super pale and they held up great Wow I ve found my new favorite brand 
A Classic Reversal This Product Has MY Support I originally bought these pantyhose due to the Hue name I thought it referred to the Vietnamese city and I thought these would be the pantyhose that you can wear in the jungle as protection against leeches The leech DOES attach itself to your leg but because of the sheer nylon screen between you and the leech the parasite is simple to remove merely by taking off the pantyhose Anyway this is NOT the jungle warfare protective pantyhose for use in swampy terrain but it does look good it IS comfortable and I was quite happy that accidentally found it P S If you use nail polish to repair a run in these pantyhose I recommend I m Not Really A Waitress even though it s red and will look like a glossy little drop of blood on your leg If someone does happen to notice you can make a little joke about it a good ice breaker 
Very comfortable nice looking pantyhose Certain styles of Hue pantyhose along with certain Burlington pantyhose have become my favorite pantyhose to wear I bought the hue Sheer Age Defiance pantyhose in tan a size 3 and I am very pleased with this pantyhose This pantyhose fits me very well and is very comfortable to wear I enjoy wearing this pantyhose and highly recommend it to other people 
Good looks great comfort These shoes are dressy with all the comfort you ll ever want I love em 
These are the best socks These are without a doubt the best socks I have ever worn They are not too thick and not too thin Very durable and comfortable 
Good all around sock Gold Toe makes the best socks I ve ever worn and I ve been buying them for as long as I can remember Normally I would get the cotton crew socks but decided to give these a try These are a medium heavy cotton sock that fits well and will probably last forever They may seem a bit loose at first but one washing will pull them back into shape and keep them up Furthermore they are a little thicker than normal socks but not as thick as a wool rag So consider how your shoes fit before getting these If they are snug these sock will just make them snugger Finally I like the color selection on these socks Oh yeah Believe it or not Gold Toe has a fantastic customer service department I sent them some digital photos of some socks I can t find anymore and they matched them up That and Amazon s prices are worth 5 stars right there 
Finally I can buy my Gold Toe Cotton Fluffies On Line I am absolutely thrilled to realize that I can buy Gold Toe Cotton Fluffies from Amazon I now have no reason to go to a department store in a mall ever again It is particularly exciting to order more than 25 of socks in a single order and then track their free shipping by UPS all the way from Coffeyville Kansas to my home in Massachusetts by way of such exotic stops as Oklahoma City OK and Earth City MO I ordered 3 each of the new Denim Heather and 3 of the Olive I also ordered two of the less expensive three packs in Navy and Black I love the name Denim Heather and I am really excited about wearing these to work on Monday morning The Olive socks were not as green as I expected they are really a shade of Brown I own many pairs of Brown Cotton fluffies and I fear that sorting my laundry in artificial light may prove difficult now with the inclusion of two shades of Brown socks Time will tell 
5 years later after wearing these shoes every chance i get i have finally found the need for a new pair they need a lot of breaking in at first but then they will eventually mold to your feet and the steel toes keeps you feet safe as well perfect concert shoes perfect everything shoes really 
say word man made doc martins need major breaking in order a size to small if you have thin feet the steel toes run big 
Perfect Fit I just received my skort and I loved it so much I placed an order for more I checked the merchant s sizing chart before I ordered and a medium was exactly as it says it is a 4 6 which is what I wear I also got loads of compliments at the gym this morning where I wore it for the first time It keeps me from having to yank down my shorts everytime I stand up I also prefer a skort instead of looser fitting shorts so no one can see my panties during certain exercises Skorts are the best invention in women s clothing for active women in decades IMHO This skort is perfect for casual wear or for the gym I can t wait to get the others that I ordered one in every color 
Great skirt I understand why others might be unhappy with this skirt Andrew Christian usually sells things that are for people on the skinnier side I am 5 2 and 85 pounds and a x small fits great Andrew Christian however does have a problem with their shipping Do order quick 
Very Nice I like this skort it is great just what I was looking for and delivery was super fast 
John this shoe is the most comfortable running if have ever had Thanks 
adidas response cushion 15 running shoe Bought as a gift for my son They were true to fit size comfortable and a very good price 
Disappointment Very disappointed by this bra Not at all like the picture If you are anything above an A cup avoid this item 
Awsome I bought this for my wife and absolutely love how it looks on her I wish she would wear it more often 
Naughty secret When working in an office with a blouse on you really can t go bra free Much as I d like to This is the next best thing Everyone can see you have a bra on but if the guys look close they can see your nipples too or can they One thing is for sure they will never know for sure and will never dare ask you So you get this naughty girl feeling Not to mention the sensation of your clothes rubbing on you nipples as you move I like to wear it best with a white blouse above the knee skirt No panties I feel wicked all day long 
Makes you feel virginal I have this bra in white Very nice I couldn t stop caressing my breasts and my nipples Strongly recommended Wear it under a sheer peasant style top and fitted jeans 
Love them These are WONDERFUL I love them so much that I am going to get a pair in all 3 colors lol I just ordered a pair for my mom for Mothers Day too I think they d be a great gift They are softer than I thought they would be amazingly soft I wish I could wear them all day They are going to be perfect for summertime Also I have a lot of foot problems neuropathy so I really needed something that was soft comfortable and made well I really can t say enough good things about these 
Very pretty Arrived on time and it looks good on me but the fabric is a bit fragile I would buy from this seller again 
decent value I just wear these around the house I like the light comfortable fit Quality seems good for the price being under ten dollars 
Great Rubber Ducks These ducks are great quality and add to my kids collection of tub toys My daughters love playing with them 
Great Product these undies keep my balls warm in the winter and cool in the summer and that is important 
Awesome Very comfortable with a nice snug fit These briefs are stretchable to adjust to size and very breathable Definitely a sexy and fun underwear 
comfortable shorts very comfortable shorts great material i run w these shorts and i like them 
Under Armour Men s loose gear Item arrived in new condition packaged nicely invoice enclosed and on time No complaints 
Wonder Shorts Three things Feels almost weightless always dry never catches The best running or just lounging around the house pants currently made 
great product and service ordered on the last day for shipping prior to the holiday and the product was delivered with time to spare the product is great i only wish ihad ordered the right size 
Best Bra Ever I m not a fan of bras but as a 43 year old woman with a fairly small chest I was stunned at how well this bra gave me a whole new look It is definitely worth the money and I even just recently purchased a second one 
Comfy fit Nice comfortable fit and keeps the boys in one place The sizes seem to run a little small as compared with Jockey so I might suggest that you buy one size up if you do not like them too tight They are soft comfortable and reliable I think the elastics wears a bit fast but you cannot beat it for the price Also some have complained that the fabric is too thin Hey for just over a buck each what do you expect I like the full fit as opposed low rise version Haynes also has higher end undies made of thicker faberics and faberic wrapped waistbands These are inexpensive basic undies 
Good underwear I m 16 years old and normally I wear boxers nothing else Recently I purchased an 8 pack of these briefs for excercising and because I thought I ought to give briefs another try after 6 years At first it was a bit strange but I quickly came to enjoy the feel of this style of underwear They don t bunch up or give you wedgies like boxers do because of their looseness and center seam design They provide support for your male stuff and stay in place throughout the day People tend to believe that briefs are too tight hence the term tighty whiteys If they re too tight you bought them too small Simple as that These briefs are perfect for wearing any time in any situation I thought I might feel self conscious while wearing them but the comfort of them overshadows any of that If anything I m proud Overall I recommend you give these briefs a shot no matter what underwear you tend to prefer However despite being pre shrunk they do shrink up a bit after the initial wash I m a 32 in boxers but 34 in these works out great 
Well made socks I love these I ve had many brands and hese are the best 
First out of the drawer My husband wears a size 13 shoe Finding any socks that fit him properly is IMPOSSIBLE The heels of the Gold Toe socks are actually at the back of his foot where they belong instead of in his archway where other brands land Out of 20 pair of socks in his drawer even long thick ones for the winter the Gold Toes are still his ABSOLUTE FAVORITE He walks to work in NewBalance shoes and Gold Toes and never complains about comfort even in sub zero temperatures Give them a try you won t be disappointed 
great shirt I am very pleased with this shirt The material and workmanship are great and it feels good wearing it What else can you say about a shirt 
So adorable I ve gotten many compliments on these shoes I love how they look they are made of a soft material so they are comfortable but still cause sore feet after shopping all day in them But that s the cost of looking cute 
Great sweatshirt This is the best purchase ever it s really comfortable and it did covered all my expectations I live in a tropical weather and it works on perfection it s warm and don t let cold get in at night 
Adidas a3 Outrunner I thought I would write a short review for the a3 Outrunner as I could not find any info on this shoe anywhere on the Internet when I was looking to purchase this model The Outrunner took me by surprise It offers a nice narrow heel snug midfoot with a medium to high arch height with the traditional adidas 3 stripes for an adaptable snug midfoot fit narrow to medium forefront with a narrow to medium width medium to high depth toe box The low profile sole is not cushy at all and is perfectly supportive yet nicely flexible with a very smooth heel to toe transition The shoe feels very light on the foot I would have guessed around 10 oz As it feels so light yet after putting the shoe on the scales it weighed in at 13 5 oz In my men s size 12 The a3 Outrunner was an excellent addition to my shoe lineup and was an excellent bargain from Amazon com considering their low sale price combined with the and the I would buy this model again without even batting an eyelash The a3 Outrunner offers a great fit I always size up by a � with Adidas running shoes over all of my other running shoes and the fit is right on I hope this review helps anyone seeking info on this model 
Isontoner Therapeutic Gloves Best of the ones I ve tried Outside seams cause less irritation to the hand and the gloves offer firm support to both the hand and the fingers Don t be afraid to purchase if you need the support for only one hand The special way the gloves are seamed means that both gloves can be used for just one hand as in carpal tunnel syndrome 
Isotoner Therapeutic Gloves great for after hand surgery These gloves are great to wear if you have arthritis in your wrist hand or thumb and are a wonderful support following hand surgery Almost all other writst thumb support devices have seams that press against the tender surgery areas but these have the seams on the outside of the glove rather than on the inside so tender areas stay protected The gloves are machine washable and very easy to use Plus they feel great 
Modern Flare Jeans I really love these jeans I tried them on at the Children s Place and they fit me perfectly This is rare because I am really tall and skinny I like the Earthy Wash the best and I also like the Rinse Wash I think that you will really like these jeans If the modern flare doesn t fit you Children s Place has lots of other styles Gracie age 1 
Perfect for light travel This item is exactly what it is described as a perfect ultra light yet durable garment bag Very spacious with lots of storage compartments for various packing needs Expands as needed to accomodate even a 3 or 4 day trip Light yet durable Nice 
Boarding Pass Holder This accessory is great Traveling is such a hassle but this device took almost all of the hassle out of traveling Whatever I needed it was there and in mosst cases they checked my creditials with the documents IN the holder Simply put your driver s license in the bottom window and boarding pass in top window with info displayed and you are set I highly recommend this for anyone who travels 
Very useful This really came in handy on our recent travels everything is right there and handy Regular airline tickets fit nicely preprinted airline tickets from home computer takes some work to get it into the pouch Very pleased with the product overall 
Simply Stunning I had ordered this dress on a Friday for a photo shoot the following Saturday I had it expressed and it arrived that Tuesday Just as expected the cut is extremely figure flattering and it looks absolutely amazing on Even though I had to order this in a larger size in the brown as the red had sold out in my size I was very pleased with the fit It is far prettier in person than in the photo shown and wearing it I felt like Ava Gardner Ladies you can t go wrong with this dress 
excellent service and dress I ordered this Sunday night and it was shipped out the next day before 5pm I got it Friday It was exactly as the picture online the color matches well pink was more pink and less coral than in the picture The fabric feels wonderful it s very similar to the How to Lose a Guy dress but in my opinion i like the back neckline better on this one The mermaidy tail is gorgeous and the length is perfect 5 10ish with heels The size also matches well with the chart All in all this dress was more perfect than I d hoped for and I m very happy with it It looks feels very glamourous The only thing on the downside is that this type of dress isn t lined so you can sorta picture the outline of belly button and even no VPL panties 
boots Loved my boots I bought them in white brown and black and pink for the price I could afford colors I may not use very often like the pink Fit great felt great look great 
Adorable Shoes These are so cute Plus the background is glittery which you can t tell from the picture My daughter loves them 
Great for little girls Daughter loves the boots Waterproof but not for snow as there is no lining to keep feet warm 
Great Slippers the slippers fit well not always the case with on line purchase they were delivered promptly and a very good value and excellent all around slipper with traction The only downside was a limited availability in alternative colors 
Acorn Chinchilla Lined Booties I gave these booties as a Christmas gift to my sister She loved them We both really like the chinchilla lining it s so soft and warm I would recommend this product to others I have given other styles of Acorn slippers to friends and family I also have a pair of Acorn slippers I love them 
Soft and Comfortable These are really nicely made They are super soft on the inside and have stayed that way over numerous months of wear They are warm but don t make your feet sweat and they don t get lumpy on the bottom These are high quality slippers they look nice and are very comfortable 
Nautica Jeans I am a huge Nautica fan and these jeans were an excellent price 
NIce Shoes at a Great Price Good shoes at the price Nice style and comfort 
Easy Spirit Longwood Sandals These are great sandals They have the velcro fastener which is so helpful to people like me who have arthritis They feel great to walk in and are very well made Excellent shoes 
shoes The shoes were the right size when they arrived The shipping was promp Everything was good about the product 
Nice affordable and fun bought another one as they ve added color options we just love these and wow what a great price good merchant ships fast and reliabl 
Great bday gift The garter fit great but i dont think barbie could fit in the panty It said plus size but some how i dont think they realized what plus size is for sure not a size 2 Loved the thought though that my client thought enough to buy this for me off my wish list here on amazon Huggs Lizz 
Great Nightgown I just recieved the nightgown and it is beautiful I was hoping it was a little lomger i m 5 8 The gown drapes to just above my ankle The jacket shoulders are wide but do not drape as much as I d like However the lace fabric is comfortable the underwire really shows off the breasts and it really does look sexy Love it 
Very nice item good price Pleased with the Dockers and feel it was a great buy 
Cool gown for hot weather This gown is great would like it better if it were cotton 
Wish I could give it more than 5 stars It really fit the bill I was very specific looking for this gown I bought it in the navy color because I wanted to be sure it wasn t see through I live in Singapore where it s very hot and humid year round It s common for me to have to take 2 showers a day So in the evenings it s nice to put this lightweight sleeveless gown on to help stay cool I love the length and because of the way it s gathered around the bustline it s loose fitting and not obvious you don t have a bra on I ll definitely be getting another one or two of these down the road 
candylady I usually enjoy this brand and type of nightgown Its comfortable wears well and very pretty That is the reason I m buying sight unseen I m sure I will enjoy this as well as others I have purchased 
Nice Dress Pure Silk This dress was made with quality workmanship It is delicate and flows very nicely I bought it for my sister s wedding in May and received a very good deal considering it would have cost me considerably more retail 
beautiful comfortable promptly delivered I really love this dress It is a little more low cut than I realized Also the flowers are a velvety material and the white backing shows a bit If neither of those points turn you off though you will most likely be very happy with this purchase 
Awesome These are truly wrinkle free and longer than the average womans botton down which I love Overall these are fabulous shirts and you can t beat the price 
Best wrinkle free dress shirt for women I have been on a quest It is not a quest of time and space but of clothing I have been seeking a truly wrinkle free dress shirt for women Oh I ve tried men s dress shirts but they look so well masculine I ve tried women s stretch shirts with spandex but they wrinkle into a little ball just perfect for that pitch into the trash can I ve bought wrinkle free shirts from Chadwick s Lands End Villager and others and was disappointed They weren t bad but they weren t good If I washed them with my husband s shirts there was just no comparison There were always wrinkles in my shirt Sometimes not wrinkled enough to have to iron them but never really neat looking My friends my quest is over I have found the women s dress shirt that wears and washes like a man s This Women s Wrinkle Free Dress Blouse by the Foxcroft Shirt Co has met my high standards I stays neat all day even after a brisk walk in warm humid weather and washes beautifully I washed it with my husband s shirts and some wrinkle free shirts from other companies It looked as good if not better than my husband s permanent press shirts and it left my other shirts in the dirt or wrinkles as the case may be The price tag is more than I usually spend but considering the time that I will not have to spend ironing it s worth it I plan to buy it in each color 
Finally The perfect shirt Good quality fabric and stiching Excellent fit And the bet part NO IRONING I wish it was offered in more colors 
Foxcroft shirts praise Foxcroft shirts feel great and are truly easy care Worth the money

birkenstock shoess I love these shoes They run a little wide considering they are a narrow but I think they will be fine for the summer months They were shipped quickly with not incidents Thank you 
Love it The quality of the shirt is great It was delivered in a timely manner Keep up the good work 
COMFORTABLE PIECE OF CLOTH I really like this boxer is so comfortable It lifts your rear area and kind of enhaces the front Tha short leg style is awesome The colors are quite sober 
Dearfoam Slippers I was very pleased with the Dearfoam Slippers I ordered for my mother for Christmas I could not find them in my area so this was a big help They were shipped in a timely manner and received in good shape 
6 Hanes� Boxer Briefs White WHITE 2XL Rapid shipping good quality items were as represented 
Hanes now on me What drove me to purchase this item is that I was first looking for Boxer Briefs and I found Hanes was offering a good price so I bought 6 pair I own several pair of Boxer Briefs that are 2 3 times as expensive but I d have to say the Hanes is pretty darn good for the price I know this might sound corny but I actually look forward to putting them on I recently converted from briefs and I am now sold on the BB s 
Riggs workwear Excellent all around shirt Very durable for a hard day s work yet good looking enough for a casual night out Very comfortable The tall sizes really have extra long sleeve length which I appreciate I bought three 
Comfy comfy comfy These boots are soooo comfortable My only complaint is that I bought them in sand and they are closer to light pink It depends on what light I m in I wanted a shade darker but they were sold out All in all I d pry buy them again 
My favorite pair of winter boots These are my favorit pair of winter boots I have 2 colors already I plan to get more They are warm comfortable and can be quickly slipped on with or without socks I love the soft sheepskin lining 
LOVE THEM I am in love with these boots I currently own them in 4 different colors and adore them WARM as ever and fuzzy for great cushioning The only thing i warn is to buy them in a size smaller thanyou normally would as they do stretch a lot My 1st pair were an 8 and they became way too big on me after a few months of wearing The other 3 I bought in size 7 and they are perfect I would definitely recommend them to anyone Amand 
Bearpaw 10 Dream Boots Absolutely Fabulous These are so well made and looks awesome They are so comfortable and the lining so plush There are no irregularities around the edges or stiching Wonderful craftsmanship They looks so much more expensive than the price I am getting a couple of other colors Highly recommend it 
Sleeping Like a Baby I bought these pants for my husband who is a general contractor and is out on the land all day long He thinks they are just about the softest most comfortable loungers he has ever put on I have to admit I have stolen them for myself once or twice Thank you they make me happy as well because I get the enjoyment of snuggling next to them each night 
SATIN PAJAMA SOFT AND SLICK LIKE SILK EASY TO TURNOVER IN BED GREAT PRODUCT HIGHLY RECOMMEND MAZEN 
So Sexy I bought these for my fiance He loves them and they look and feel fabulous 
Nice pants for the money I actually ordered these sleep pants as part of my oldest son s Halloween costume I was really pleased with them when they arrived My son liked them so much that he decided to sleep in them after Halloween He says they are very comfy 
Satisfied I was extemely satisfied with my purchase of the Intimo Men s Satin sleepwear or should I say my son was I purchased them for my 14 yr old son for Christmas and he loves them 
adorable and comfortable for a boot with a 3 heel these are VERY comfortable only annoyances are that they are a little slippy no traction and the cute heart on the bottom is only painted on so after wearing them for less than a day though i did go to the mall last night the part that touches the ground is completely worn off not horrible they just should have made it a part of the sole definitely a good buy overall 
Good buy for the money I really liked the boots once they arrived I couldn t beat the price for these boots They were alittle stiff at first but once I broke them in they fit terrific I use them for dancing and they are very comfortable I would definately recommended them to anyone looking for a style of boots like these 
Comfortable and Well Designed slippers These slippers make a fantastic gift When I bought them to replace a loved one s worn out pair I received lots of praise and unsolicited compliments on how comfortable and great they feel on your feet Indeed I wish I had bought a pair for myself but my current pair are still in OK condition Maybe someday 
Slipper Review Slippers are comfortable but tend to run a little small Nice option for the extended sizes 
Excellent Item My husband loved his slippers and says they are the best ones he has ever had Good quality nice looking 
Great bag This bag is perfect for everday use the long straps make it really easy to carry and it awesome for carrying notebooks The canvas material is very durable and has held up really well even with heavy everyday use The only thing that I don t like about this bag is that there isn t a pocket on the side 
Great Product just as described Fast shipping packaged great Thank you Will most definitely purchase from seller again 
Surpasses expectations Given the low price I was expecting a pair of gloves that would survive maybe one winter However they seem very sturdy thick leather so it does take some wearing to break them in and make them softer and they go well with business apparel I like the back zipper look but I ve had some people turn their nose up to it guess it s a good thing they offer them with and without zipper 
I got what I wanted I really needed a wallet that had more space for credit debit discount membership cards I also needed something that wasn t so thick it would cause me to sit off center and create back pain This wallet performed as expected took care of both problems and looks good The only two downsides are that it s a little too tall for standard depth pants pockets This just means that I have to be a little more watchful that it doesn t fall out or get stolen but keeping an eye on my wallet is always a smart idea The only other problem is that dollar bills are not easily moved into our out from the side pockets It s as if the pocket is the exact same length as the dollar bills themselves which makes quickly stowing and retrieving money a little cumbersome My solution was to just lay the money over the cards and close the wallet on it It now makes access to my money even easier and I have had no problem with anything falling out Overall this is a good product and would make a unique gift 
long card wallet review I love this product It lets me keep my cards in order so that I can use them when I need to My business cards such as credit card ATM card etc are on side My medical cards such as dental vision eye care etc are on the other side I love the easiness of it It s the best card wallet I ever had I m happy I have it 
long credit card wallet its what i needed for all my cards you cant go wrong with this product and the price was perfect 
Credit Card Holder The slots for the cards are not wide enough for the card The only way this can be used is to place the cards in lengthwise and hope they don t fall out Lovely leather case but pretty much useless 
Casual or Dress in all day comfort These shoes are excellent They run true to size which is unusual today in many brands I have owned several Rockport shoes and all have been spot on on size They all as well as this style are very comfortable These shoes are well crafted stylish and can be worn as casual or dress in all day comfort Amazon had good prices and quick delivery on these shoes 
Extremely Warm and Nice Looking Too This is a high quality item that keeps me warm in the house and out Stylish too when I go to the kids soccer games 
Love it This jacket is a great find The price is unbeatable for the quality it is so soft and plush It s very warm and not heavy at all It fits true to size I have the color Bullet and its a solid medium gray It looks great with everything from jeans to sweats I can t wait to try it out on a cold winter run 
Looks Much Better In Person OK I admit it I was a bit skeptical about ordering this shirt because it looked kind of tacky in the photos But since it was on a Friday sale I ordered the Asian Pear color which is really a light beige or tan I thought it might be kind of greenish but no I m 5 8 135 lbs with broad shoulders and long arms I ordered a medium And I m wearing it right now The sleeves are plenty long enough and there is a generous amount of give in the shoulders I d say that this shirt almost runs true to size although a medium certainly doesn t hug me like the medium sized Brandon Thomas grommet jacket does A large size in this shirt would have been far too big for me I probably could have gotten away with a small but I like this shirt being bit loose I can wear a shirt underneath it without it being too snug The quality of the shirt which could really be used as a light jacket is quite good It isn t lined but it is soft to the touch and warm It snaps closed so no loose buttons to worry with I like it It isn t tacky looking in person but it s definitely different If it goes on sale again I will buy another color 
Jockey Is Just Right The Jockey Elance bikini cut panties are comfy and well made without giving up cute and sexy They are cut just right with full coverage in back yes there are those of us that still require this a nice semi high cut leg and the waist band fits just low enough to wear with moderately low waist pants They are 100 combed cotton feel soft and nice and even the elastic waist band is cotton covered for extra added comfort The 3 pack of black assorted I received contains 1 solid black pair and 2 pair that are a light green with a very pretty darker design of little flowers and box shapes They still fit great even after laundering the instructions say dry on medium but I used low The price seemed just a little high but they are an excellent quality and have lasted through countless washings This style may also be found at Bare Necessities The prices at this time are exactly the same at the 3 sites What I usually do is check for what the deals are on the shipping charges this will depend on how much you are spending with each merchant in total and also you may find a different variety of colors or patterns at each Just type in Jockey Elance 3 pack Bikini This one is style 1449 check editorial description on product page to make sure and just judging from the reviews of the other styles these are the best in quality and comfort OOOOkay so even though the world now knows what kind of underwear I wear it s a product I thought worth a review You NEED these Happy Shopping Laurie 
My hubby adores them My hubby loves these boxers they are something that he s wanted from childhood The only slight downside to them is that I recommend that you either hand wash them or have a delicate setting on your washer 
great gift for my boyfriend i bought the maroon and forest colors of these silk boxers and my boyfriend loves them i wish i had ordered more great present for our two year anniversary they are still in perfect condition several months later he says he really likes them due to the elastic waist and the really smooth silky texture highly recommended 
Great product The silk boxers arrived in great condition and in a timely manner My boyfriend loves wearing them along with his matching silk robe What a wonderful Christmas gift they made Thanks again 
Never used I ordered the silk boxers but unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it I broke up with my boyfriend the intended recipient before I gave them to him So now I m waiting to meet someone who is a size medium and would like some nice silk boxers But they sure seemed nice 
Good quality and comfortable Though I prefer flannel and cotton boxers I needed silk boxers for a long hiking and camping trip Silk has great moisture wicking and quick drying properties Under nylon shorts the Intimo silks managed to keep my Special Fun Area reasonably dry even while hiking in driving rain When they did get wet they dried much much faster than cotton boxers do They lasted a couple of months before falling apart a pretty good show of durability actually given the amount of punishment they took I had only two pair and I alternated them often with a full week between washings Obviously they got kinda crusty but that couldn t be helped Under the circumstances they held up well I would recommend them As for this boxer brief thong controversy I believe a man should wear whatever type of underwear he finds most comfortable If that means boxers fine If it means a thong fine What women consider stylish should be at the very bottom of a man s list of concerns Women consider all kinds of ridiculous things stylish such as hairless pets square toed shoes pointy toed shoes the Monochromatic Look and the music of Andrea Bocelli 
Silk Boxers As previously described the sensation in your skin is great but I would not use them to go to work I only use them at home and they really feel nice I will probably order a couple more It s also works great as pajama shorts 
Have Not Recieved Still I still have not recieved this item that I ordered I did get the star spangle shirt and love it but I have yet to have recieved this one and am not sure of who to contact about it Please let me know how to go about getting it I was under the impression I would have recieved it a number of weeks ago it was part of a going away gift of my better half who is deployed to fight the war now and still have not had word or recieved it Thank You Holly Padill 
great buy for style and price I just got this dress and it is adorable You can wear it as a dress or a shirt with jeans or leggins It is easy to dress up or down Great buy for the money Extremely flattering and comfortable 
Excellent Clothing I do a lot of yoga and need clothes that not only look good but are comfortable and cool while sweating in a warm yoga room I own a lot of Prana clothes from rock climbing which have always held up well so decided to purchase this top even though I saw it worn by a celebrity I ve had it over two years now and have not been disappointed It keeps me cool and looks cool too You can t go wrong with it 
We love it I bought this tank for my boyfriend almost a year ago and it s held up great I originally bought him the khaki colored one and he wore it so much I got him the black one for his birthday Definitely high quality and well made 
The most comfortable sandal and looks good too I have this sandal in black but I have the l 1 2 heal I cannot believe how comfortable this sandal is to wear all day I wore this shoe traveling several times You can wear it with jeans a skirt or shorts I love it as a travel shoe because you don t have to pack a lot of shoes due to it s versatility The leather is very soft and it has velcro closers for the ankle and toe strap The velco is great because it can be adjusted quickly Your feet are never the same size in the afternoon after standing all day 
Fantastic pants but not great for that far beyond yoga As the other reviews note these pants are incredibly soft comfortable and a very flattering fit I absolutely love them They are fantastic for wearing during yoga pilates cardio machines and low impact or toning activities However please be aware that the more vigorous and rapid your movements the pants may not hold up at the inside seams I wore them during a high impact class with lots of very deep lunges and kicks and the inner thigh seams seemed like some of the stitching was a little frayed by the end of the class So save these wonderful pants for low impact activities and enjoy a truly great product that will make you feel great wearing them 
My new favorite yoga wear These are the softest article of clothing I have ever owned I love them I wil definitely buy more of this brand 
The Best Pants Ever I can t believe how soft these pants are They re like no other yoga pant I ve ever worn They also fit really cute I wear them to yoga all the time now and fellow students almost always ask me Where did you get those pants They are flexible and totally comfortable as well 
Saved MY LIFE I used this folder to pack a dress to a wedding in the UK from the USA and it completely saved my life I arrived with no access to an iron or anything but thanks to this folder my dress stayed wrinkle free and beautiful along with all my other clothes I had for my trip No tell tell wrinkle lines All I can say is I m a believer and will never travel with out these folders and pack it cubes This system from Eagle Creek has completely changed how I pack and how I look when traveling 
For business or vacation they work The Eagle Creek Pack It Folders really do work Whatever is in them stays 95 wrinkle free I hesitated a long time before buying one since I thought they were on the expensive side But I travel about 6 8 times per year and the folder has proven to be well worth the money for the time and aggravation saved The 18 quot model seems to be about the right size for men s shorts I also use it sometimes for slacks and my petite wife finds the size workable too Also makes a nice gift 
comfortable enough to sleep in I bought a white one of these bras at the hospital baby boutique after the sales person fitted me Then I bought the other two colors at Amazon com from a 3rd party seller that was offering free shipping I was surprised to find any nursing bras that fit me But the hospital boutique was able to find 2 or three styles that worked for me However this one was the only one that was not an underwire bra and I hate underwires This one is comfortable enough to sleep in I wear them with the Medela Cotton Washable Bra Pads The only drawback is that it looks like a sports bra with no separation but with my size I care more about comfort than looks 
I love this bra because it holds my organic nursing pads nicely I have found this bra works well with my Swaddlebees organic nursing pads You can t see the pad out line when you wear them both 
Best of the three brands I tried The Bravado Maternity Nursing bra is very comfortable for daytime wear so I would highly recommend it if that is what you are looking for The way in which the bra opens and closes makes it very easy and comfortable and it doesn t create strange lines under your clothes like some nursing bras do After the first few weeks of wearing this bra I had no doubt that I had made the right purchase On the downside as others have mentioned in their reviews I did notice that as time went on the bra seemed somewhat less supportive Along the same lines this bra bothered me to wear to bed because my breasts always seem to fall out of it I know I was wearing the correct size so maybe this was due to the low cut criss cross shape of the bra Whatever the reason I found it quite irritating and uncomfortable to wrestle with my breasts in the middle of the night To be fair I had the same problem with another different brand nursing bra also so maybe this is just what happens when you try to sleep in bras Consequently I ended up buying a sports type bra for sleeping Overall because I only used this bra for daytime wear and I resigned myself to the fact that I d have to wear breast pads with almost any nursing bra I really liked the Bravado bra and would definitely recommend it 
glitter pump wonderful shoe Beautiful to look at and great to wear Would love to get more in other colors 
Beautiful shoes I recieved these shoes for Christmas from my mother They are absolutely gorgeous I m a heel fanatic but these ones are really head turners I wore them out the same day and I noticed alot of people looking at my shoes I was worried the silver glitter would fall off easily but so far I havent noticed any coming off at all The only problem I ve had with these shoes is that the toe area rubs on one of my toes and that hurts but I ve had this happen with alot of heels so I dont really consider this too much of a drawback If you love gorgeous shoes and dont mind a little bit of pain these are perfect 
classic weighted rope great for cardio I ve jumped rope for 7+ years for cardio and just purchased my 4th pair of these I have a a cheap plastic one and a weighted rope this everlast leather weighted The plastic one costs only a few dollars that I use if i m traveling for more than a couple days and sometimes to mix it up The weighted rope is a good cardio workout which also tones your upper arm extremely well This is my 4th pair because the others have eventually cracked through which happens when it drops repeatedly against the floor at a bad angle One of them also just wore out in the center where there s alot of friction with the floor I tried another plastic handled brand but that cracked around the same area as well and even sooner This is a classic and fully recommend it didn t receive 5 stars only because it needs to be replaced every couple years but then again so do all the others Highly recommended 
Wet This is nothing but a nylon bag and a zip loc mylar baggie It didn t work to keep things dry at a recent trip to the water park despite double bagging All that was in it was a set of keys some cash cards These items managed to push open the seal of the mylar baggie I would not recommend this 
Just OK Everything was OK It would have been great if the turn off switch worked I have to take the batteries out when I m not using it 
Clarks mule This shoe is extremely comfortable and stylish The shoe gives you the effect of a higher heel without discomfort I am thinking about finding these same shoes in black 
A fantastic purchase The merchandise is impeccible the service was timely and I am very satisfied Thanks for a smooth transaction 
Detroit Tigers Mock Turtleneck This item arrived earlier than expected packed nicely and my hubby loved it No problems with ordering or shipping Thanks Amazon 
Great Product This was just what I was looking for Extremely comfortable I want to wear it every day 
shorts pretty nice a little smaller than expected if you re not sure what size to order order the larger of the 
Running Shorts I ordered these shorts for running and they are perfect for it I love the short length I ordered a large and i m normally a medium and they are still a bit snug 
Cannot beat the price I wear bandana s pretty much year round and also use them for other various things from tying things together when backpacking to making yourself visible on the road when riding a bike these things come in handy The main thing here is the price your not going to beat this price by buying them at a truck stop or shopping center Truly a great deal and what would you expect for a great product 
Great for going in and out of the rain I am so sad because my Samsonite umbrella actually broke yesterday blown inside out in the huge wind storm we had One of the metal ribs actually bent and broke in half so it s pretty much a lost cause That said this is an excellent umbrella The auto close feature is so handy if you re going to be in and out of the rain a lot like going shopping on a rainy day While everyone else is standing at the door pulling their umbrellas shut you just pop it down and go inside I never had a problem with the open close mechanism The colors that this umbrella comes in are also so cheerful mine was the bright green color The small size of this umbrella makes it easy to tuck into your purse or man bag if you re not sure about the weather It is a little heavy for such a small size but not overwhelmingly so If the rib of this umbrella hadn t broken so suddenly I would have given this product 5 stars However if you can resist using it during a nor easter give it a try it s an excellent product 
Clarks clogs I have many pairs of Clarks clogs many needing replacement now after sev l yrs wear I have purchased a few pairs recently and do not find them as well made comfortable as my original pairs of 3 5 yrs ago I wonder if they changed their fit style manufacturing I still wear them as they are better than other brands so far Overall love Clarks Am recently disappointed 
baby socks these socks are packaged nicely great for babies 0 9 months colors available are good for any type of outfits 
these really stay on These really do stay on The cuff gets tighter after a run in the dryer thats why I didn t give 5 stars Dry on a low temp if at all 
Great T shirt My boyfriend is a Big Lebowski fanatic so his son and I bought this for him one Father s Day and he loves it The only issue I had with the shirt is that we got an extra large size and it still fit a little tightly he s not a huge man I also think I remember noticing that the graphic was a little crooked which was not very noticible unless you looked more closely He still appreciated this gift though 
camd908 Great conversation starter It always draws compliments from people I can connect with It s the Dude fellowship 
Great Memory Shirt It was such a thrill to see the Chicago Bears win the NFL NFC Championship game and this shirt will always serve to trigger this wonderful memory 
comfortable shirt Even though the Bears did not win this years Superbowl it s important to realize they finally made it to the final dance after all those years of having average or below average seasons When it comes to a Superbowl win it s basically a coin toss no pun intended on who will win We re talking about two great teams in this case Colts and Bears and the Superbowl is basically just the two best teams battling it out NFC champs are the Chicago Bears That s the important thing to remember This t shirt should proudly be worn even if you don t live near or in Chicago The Bears were a great team in 2006 With this shirt you will always remember the amazing year they had 
Good Looking Shoe Comfortable This is a good looking shoe It s Comfortable It seems to hold up well the Material is a little bit plasticky I guess it s waterproof the cushioning is good 
Top Jock is a winner The Top Jock line of jocks by Lowry is damned impressive They are lightweight provide great support fit well and are well constructed They don t feel like you re wearing a jock The contoured woven pouch is the perfect size and works well to absorb moisture The look and feel is really terrific Way to go 
Masculine no frills This jock does the job it hold your package in place and does what it s supposed to do Cheap and easy to launder 
warm n toasty i commute to work on my bike in the winter this would not be easily done if it weren t for these thermals they re very cozy and you don t notice them when you re inside a building 
great value for the price I absolutely love this jacket and just bought a second one Has stood up through some bad storms and kept me dry It is fully adjustable with velcro around the wrists and on the back of the attached hood which actually allows you to adjust the height of the hood The hood also has a nice wide visor which helps keep the rain out of your eyes There are 2 side pockets 1 chest pocket and 1 inside pocket The jacket can be completely stuffed inside it s chest pocket for backpacking or long term storage although I have found this is difficult to do and takes a lot of time and effort It is also very breathable for such a waterproof fabric and any sweat seems to dry quickly I couldn t find this jacket in women s sizes so I went with a men s medium which fits a women s large with room to layer a sweater underneath Overall highly recommended to everyone 
What s to hate It works fine It s seems very well constructed and it was comfortable to wear even in the humidity of Jamaica I probably would have prefered fewer compartments but someone may find all of them useful 
perfect Exactly as described I wear a size 7 shoe so bought a size large and they fit exactly right Wash like a dream 
Great Gift This is the gift to give the women in your life who can appreciate comfort and classic style Cushioned inner soles sturdy bottom soles soft and beautiful upper material no pressure points perfect fit warm classic style that goes with pajamas and jeans stands up to machine washings what more can you ask from a house shoe Give yourself the gift of these slippers too in every color 
Great item for the Mrs Found them easy enough on the web site I received the item pretty quickly and my wife loves them That makes her day and that s just fine with me 
Wonderful Slippers I live in these slippers The flexible leather soles are cushioned and insulate your feet from cold floors Be sure to select the style with leather not vinyl soles If you need more warmth wear them with a light sock The stretch satin holds your foot in place When a pair finally wears out I often have to go out of my way to find another This year local stores were sold out and I found them at Amazon 
Classy slippers I bought these slippers for my office so I can kick off my shoes when my feet are tired and slip these on They are classy and so comfortable I don t think anybody notices I m wearing slippers I plan to buy another pair for home 
Wonderful I would definitely buy this product again and again and Amazon is a wonderful place to purchase any type of product Great customer service fast shipping excellent prices The product was perfect Thanks 
perfect for long day The fit was a bit large but they have lovely thick padding for your feet Nice sole allowed dancing I wore them under my long fancy dress at my daughter s wedding reception because I have Rheumatoid arthritis and can t wear dress shoes They looked great Now I wear them around the house every day Not as hot as regular house slippers Plan to buy more colors 
Comfortable and Easy Easy to slip on and very comfortable around the house Even looks brand new after washing in the machine I only wish I bought more so I won t ever be without them Also very transportable so you can bring them with you to a friend s home which is etiquette in Europe since we only wear houseshoes in the house 
super great buy i love my boots never thought that i would like anything dr scholl i have had more comments on these boots than any others that i have had someone saw these on sale at famous footware and they were 40 dollars so this was a great buy will probably end up buying one in every color i got the light tan color very comfy sturdy easy to get in and out of great in snow not heavy 
Dr Scholl boots The boots are very comfortable and stylish I always associated old and ugly looking footwear with Dr Scholl s I would highly recommend these They were very reasonably priced also 
Comfortable great quality good looking Bought these shoes for my husband He always loves the Bostonian brand shoes He had no problem with a need to break in these shoes He wore them all day the first day and he says they were completely comfortable The shoes are excellent quality good value for the price and are really great looking Dressy enough for a suit but casual enough for khakis and a shirt 
Very warm and very versatile I bought this back when it was on sale when I was still an employee at Sears and I was definately not dissapointed Being a 3 in 1 jacket has several uses First off the jacket worn with both the fleece inner lining and the outer shell is very warm for use outside on frigid winter days and the shell semeed to be waterproof or water resistant because even after rolling around in the snow it wasn t drenched The outer shell by itself provides some warmth and also the water resistant outside to put over something else say for example the suit jacket I wore to work Definately not for winter use by itself but a nice compliment to something else The fleece on its own is what I liked Very warm and comfortable and stylish looks I would constantly wear it around town by itself on a cool fall evening when out with friends Only downside it seems to be a magnet for pet hair ALl in all very satisfied with my jacket Starting to get a bit small now so I ll definately buy a larger version and sell the old one 
Great socks Good quality socks Wear well wash well are comfortable to wear Would recommend Wigwam products 
Great jeans I bought these jeans for my husband and he loves them and so do I They look great and still look fresh after many months of washing Would buy again 
Awesome Bag This is the cutest purse It s large enough to carry everything that I need but at the same time it looks cute and small The shoulder strap isn t really functional but you can tuck it into the bag and carry the purse by its two hand straps 
Looks good in pictures real quality less than expected The stitching on one of my gloves didn t reach all the way around the wrist area and caused a loose fit The padding is really thick Some people may think that a lot of padding is a good thing but it was too much for me I wouldn t buy these again Two stars instead of one because of cheap price 
Good performance I don t have anything to compare this too since it was my first wicking technology pair of shorts but I must say it has lived up to my expectation 
Comfortable shorts This product was what I expected They re a little light thin so I wouldn t recommend them for yard work but they re great for running and playing basketball 
Clarks Touareg Oxford This is a great shoe and I have no regrets about buying it Pros Perfect balance of good looks and comfort High quality construction Non slip sole Cons Sole is very squeaky on certain surfaces Clarks use the British sizes so be careful when ordering your siz 
the best thing that could happen to any foot Okay so I ve been a competitive swimmer for quite over a decade and my family and I bought several Ugg boots probably a decade ago before they became the trend that it is now Simply put I love them If you want your feet cozy and warm and happy then you can t go wrong buying this I have this style and two different others but speaking specifically of this Ugg slipper style it s the best thing to wear around the house You can put on right after you get up in the morning and take off right before bed or if you need shoes to get something in the cold garage or just because the kitchen floor is too cold that socks aren t enough I ve worn mine so much the cushion lining inside is worn almost bare but remember I ve had mine for so many years That s right they last you that long and it still offers more warmth than most slippers do 
Major Points with the Mrs Gave these beauties to my wife for Christmas and everytime she puts them on I get a big hug and kiss so far that s 22 but who s counting She tells me they run about 1 2 size large she wears 6 5 bought the 6 fit is perfect and feel absolutely fantastic on a cold winter night The only problem the brother in law hates me now since he didn t get her sister a pair HA HA HA sucka 
Worth every penny The best thing about these slippers is that they keep your feet warm but DRY I d take putting my foot into these at the end of a hard day over a foot massage That s how comfy they are They also have great support and nice soles They re cute comfy sturdy and worth every penny 
bought them for my daughter but i like them too i was skeptical but these are well made with great foot support and warm they handle our wet northwest weather beautifully and they clean up nicely Less expensive than the Ugg boots they are less bulky and great for indoors too 
material is body worthy the body suit fit perfect well let me be politically correct the leotard was an absolutely perfect fit the material hugged the body just enough to feel comfy 
Thanks Received in specified condition customer service was very easy to access and talk to Thanks 
Snuggly wuggly for my boi toes Fleecy happiness has made my toes content with life 
NICE BAGS BUT YOU CAN T LINK THEM The luggage arrived fairly quickly This is the 2nd item that I have ordered from this seller and have not had a problem The luggage is expandable looks very nice The only drawback is that the tag on the luggage says that is has add a bag loop with security buckle but I see no way of linking the bags However the luggage was only 39 99 when I bought it last week which definitely makes it worth keeping The price has doubled since then 
nice jersey but kinda cheap speedy delivery decent price and product it just looks a bit chea 
Good quality This adapter will take your US plug even the ones with one prong wider than the other and convert it to a European plug One thing to note this adapter is not a voltage converter it will not convert European 220V to US 110V unlike what one reviewer said Shouldn t be a problem at if your power supplies support a range of 100 240V like most mobile devices these days laptops mobile phones PDAs etc Just read what s on the power supply or device you re taking to Europe 
I m very satisfied about this product No comment Everything is OK Regards Cristia 
Adaptor works great The adaptor worked great in my trip to Germany Worked with plug that had one prong slightly larger than the other 
Best Shoe Bags The cloth shoe bags are roomy enough for a pair of men s dress shoes and very durable The draw sting closure makes it easy to open and close the bag I brought them for traveling but have decided to store my better shoes in them 
Staheekum Men s slippers The slippers were really nice and received in a timely fashion Unfortunately the person that I purchased them for didn t care for them I had to return them Thank you for making the return of items so easy 
sheepskin slippers My wife and I both got sheepskin slippers and we wear them all the time while we re at home They are very comfortable warm and seem very durable The heavy soles are great for going out to the mailbox or running down to the corner store for a pack of smokes We ll definitely buy more when there wear out Regarding my previous comments I d like to amend it I ve had my slippers for just over a month and the inside of one of the slippers has holes in it above my toes and is giving me blisters when I wear them without socks I ve never seen this happen before and can only assume it s related to the quality of construction I won t buy these again 
Happy Feet These slippers were a christmas present for my husband and I haven t seen him without them since He often remarks that his feet almost get too warm Beautiful slippers and extremely comfortable Well made and worth every penny 
Great Cycling Jersey I brought home an Italia jersey from Italy for my Polish husband s birthday recently not figuring that the European sizes are smaller When the Italia jersey was too snug I found this Polish Postal Team jersey and ordered it a size larger as the site recommends and it arrived today 2 days later love it My husband is really happy with it By ordering a size larger than his normal size it fit perfectly The jersey is very light weight great for Tennessee summers and zippers almost all the way down the front another nice touch when it s warm It has 3 large pockets in back to hold stuff I would highly recommend this jersery as my husband came back from his ride raving about how confortable and cool it was And the graphics are really nice too 
So cozy and comfy I just got these slippers and I must say I love them if you follow the chart and pick out the correct sizing the pair you pick for your size should fit Mine fit perfectly The sole is not a true slipper it has plastic dots on the bottom I would say these are good for lounging reading relaxing in bed These are nice to keep your feet warm if your feet are always cold in bed Also these could make nice car socks I am going to wear these when I travel to Japan to walk around on the plane The design is very nice also 
Cool shoes Comfortable stylish for a 40 something without looking like I am trying to look 20 Not for walking in all day though Looks great with jeans skirts or shorts 
Love them I just ordered these recently They are super comfortable and adorable I would highly recommend them 
GREAT Sneakers I love these sneakers I wear them all the time I now have them in two colors I bought them for 40 in a boutique in Venice CA for 40 and found them on Amazon for HALF Amazing SHOP AMAZO 
Perfect delivery Fast and easy service it got here even before I was expecting it 
flipin sweet ah man i have 2 vote for pedro shirts there both awsome i would wear this shirt anywere even to a wedding or something it makes me happy when i wear it 
Vote for Pedro shirt The shipping on the shirt was more expensive than the actual shirt It is of good quality and arrived quickly 
Power to the People The election of Pedro in the movie Napoleon Dynamite symbolizes the ultimate victory for the underdog based on popular appeal to the majority I smile everytime I remember the line by Napoleon to the kid who just got bullied into giving up his lunch money Pedro offers you his protection Wearing this shirt is truly saying Power to the People 
Great to wear to make a point I love wearing my Vote For Pedro tshirt to show how much I love the movie Napoleon Dynamite People who know Napoleon Dynamite will smile at me when I wear it Great shirt 
pleased with purchase I was pleased with my purchase it arrived in a timely fashion and was as advertised I would buy from this store again 
Just what I needed It was exactly what i was looking for and an important piece for my halloween costume They accidently sent me the wrong color but I had no trouble exchanging it 
Very High Quality This is a superb fitting and quality unitard Excellent fit and very well made 
My Partner Luvs It and So Do I I surpised my new boytoy with a white semi transparent long sleeved footed uni With a little persuasion I have gotten him to wear it around the house and occasionally under his street clothes What I like most is that the tight slick shiny fit really shows off his sexy bod and leaves very little to the imagination Buy one for your beau girls and I am sure you won t regret it 
Great Comfortable shoes I love love love these shoes They took one night to break in and now I can wear them for hours even hours of dancing without any discomfort and they re cute too 
Very Happy with Purchase I recently purchased this rolling briefcase and used it for the first time last week I am very satisfied with the briefcase I had to travel through several airports and the rolling mechcanism was smooth the handle was very long and it has plenty of room for my oversized laptop and many other personal items It comes with a separate bag for laptops but I choose not to use it as it just takes up more room and adds to the time to go through security The front zipper compartment was perfect for the quart size zip lock bag you are now required to have for airport security plus it held my book and snacks for easy access The top straps allow it to be looped over the handle of my rolling suitcase It is easy to lift and store in overhead compartments I highly recommend this product 
Great product for the road warrior If you ve ever had to carry your laptop bag over your shoulder while rushing thru the airport this bag is for you It ROLLS It s lightweight but sturdy holds your laptop all your accessories and you can even get estra goodies in there like your jewelry medication books etc Women especially will like the bag And unless you stuff really really full it fits in the overhead or under your seat My shoulders love this bag and so do I And the best part is the price 
Don t be fooled by great photography Whoever shot the photos for this bag did a great job the bag was not as nice as it looked in the photos It also did not fit the oversized laptop that it seemed it would The wheels didn t seem like they would take much abuse and the organizer pockets were cheap plastic It earns points for color selection and for the handle All in all I sent it back despite the fact that the eBag policy is to only give a partial refund 
Great briefcase I have been very happy with this briefcase I am a first year law student and use it heavily for both my books and my computer and it is holding up well I would recommend it highly 
This little bag holds a lot I m a meeting planner and travel quite a bit with my job I also have a lot of things I have to carry on rather than check As an example on a recent trip I was able to pack two laptops and two 1 3 ring binders along with my makeup bag and a few other small necessities The bag is made of sturdy fabric and the wheels roll smoothly The telescoping handle pops up and collapses quickly effortlessly The bag also comes with a detachable shoulder strap which I removed because 1 my bag is always too heavy to carry on my shoulder and 2 when rolling the shoulder strap often dragged on the airport floor which caused it to get dusty dirty Fortunately this bag has two short handles which make it easy to lift when going up stairs or moving it to an overhead bin I highly recommend this bag and at this new sale price I m thinking about getting one for my personal laptop too 
You can always count on Clarks Eexcellent pair of shoes Durable weather resistant and they still look nice enough to wear to the office on a rainy or snowy day True to size Great company 
Great Product These briefs fit great an for the low price they are you sure can get some wear out of them 
Sooooo Cute All I have to say is that I love these shoes I bought these shoes for work but now I m thinking that they are too cute just for work They look great with everything True to the size I am a 7 1 2 bought that size fits great 
Fabulous My husband picked these out for me and I love them I never would have picked them out myself as I thought that they would be uncomfortable but they are great They look fabulous with jeans and I have received many compliments 
Nice bootie I got this boots in the mail with my other bandolino shoes I bought here I tried them and its comfortable and fits perfect I can wear them with slacks or jeans Its well made The heel is perfect I love Bandolino shoes Its a good buy 
The best littler booties a girl can own I love these boots I brought them in the bone color right before the holidays and have worn them several times since I m not big on pointy toe shoes because my feet are slightly wide but I got them in the regular width and they are very comfortable The heels are the perfect height too just tall enough to be stylish without the clumsiness or lower back discomfort They are classy looking and go well with any outfit whether I wear them with jeans or with a suit The fact that they come to the ankle is also a bonus when you re driving or sitting I ve received so many compliments when I wear them The fit is so great that I m even thinking of getting another pair in black 
Great gift for the fashion conscious My sister has refined taste in clothes so I was relieved when she recieved the socks with much enthusiasm Paid a bit much for them but thats the price you have to pay for buying online The socks resemble the picture accurately I am pleased with the product 
This is exactly what I needed to wear under my stapless gown I am very pleased with this product It was exactly what I needed for my strapless gown I wanted something that would smooth me out without causing unwanted bulges in my back the dreaded back cleavage This camisole is fairly easy to wiggle into and it s very comfortable to wear not too tight at all I also liked the length of it I found the other stapless camisoles too short They would cause my stomach to stick out below where they ended Not attractive at all I would highly recommend this product I was also extremely surprized how fast it arrived It took only two days for it to arrive Very impressive 
Comfortable and stylish Versatile shoe appropriate for both jeans and skirts comfortable enough to wear all day long without blisters or foot pain Highly recommend 
Excellent value for money Even though these briefs are Boss s entry level range the quality is high making them excellent value for money The shipping from Freshpair was excellent too the goods were well wrapped and sent by Fedex I am a very satisfied customer 
Worth it It is definitely worth buying great shipping speed and the quality is excellent 
Great Tank Top These are great tank tops for wieght training Overall material quality is good but not the best Great value 
magical We LOVE this sling Often wonder what we d do without it as it works it s calming sleep inducing magic on our son about 99 of the time It seems like as soon as he gets in he s in his own little cozy womb like world and he just drifts off It can be hard on the back in the shoulder blade area as well as on the shoulder if used for a long stretch of time but keeping the two layers as spread out vs bunched up as possible generally remedies the problem It s easiest I think to put the baby in if you guide their head in first and it s also easy to switch shoulders or the hand baby in sling to another person This is our most used piece of baby gear by far my husband even gardens with it on Our son has loved it since he was 4 days old he s 2 mos now and 15 lbs and there s still plenty of room for him in it Also it works well to breastfeed baby while they are in it which is an added bonus when you are out and about I would also recommened NOT getting a light color ours was a gift because it starts looking a little funky after you dribble your dinner down it a few times 
Happy slinger I am pleased with the sling It is much easier to get baby in and out of than a pack style carrier yet baby is secure and we ve put it through the paces chasing around 20 month old big sister One caution takes a little practice to get comfortable using it Also I ordered khaki thinking it would be neutral so it would go with about anything but dark enough to not show everything well it looks a little too much like a Brownie Girl Scouts sash when baby isn t in it for my taste 
I love her so close This is a great carrier I really enjoy the close contact with my baby The pillow is needed for newborns she is 6 days old now and I am loving fatherhood 
Great Stockings I wasn t sure if I would recieve white stockings because the picture displays black ones but I received them in white They fit great on my girlfriend and she loves them She had a hard time finding solid white thigh highs in stores and these are perfect

Rave review I love Saucony shoes because they seem to be the only shoes that I can wear without pain I am a registered nurse and having bunions on both feet causes increased pain after being on my feet at work especially I had a pair of Saucony shoes that were very comfortable but had just started to look their age After hunting unsuccessfully for replacements I went to Amazon com ordered two pairs and I can t tell you how happy my feet and I are I would like to be a Saucony spokes person because I LOVE these shoes they make my work and ultimately my life better Thank you for making wonderful shoes please don t stop 
Great for Day to Day use These socks are the most comfortable white socks that I have found I love a good thick wool sock but these little guys fit snuggly and are a great option in the summer and for use in athletic shoes 
Great Socks I wore these for a while but made a switch to other brands these socks are by far the best I m getting me a few pair of these 
Great Socks I wear nothing but gold toes These are a great price and are the real thing Nice to have my socks while on the road 
These Socks Rock Best socks I ve ever had and I ve had every brand out there These fit wear well and are comfy 
Great Socks They are the best quality socks I ve owned I ve owned a lot and will continue to buy them 
great socks The socks were sent and received in a timely manner They are terrific socks at a good price and I am very happy with my purchase Life kind of takes on a whole new meaning when you have such terrific socks at a terrific price My life has changed for the better since my purchase of the Gold Toe Men s Cotton Liner Athletic Sock 
Birkenstock Although this product came marked Birko it is the same as the original Birkenstocks I have had in the past It is the same fine product 
i love these these betula sandals are soo comfortable i spend a lot of my day walking and these get me anywhere and everywhere after just three days they formed right to my feet and i never want to take them off the quality was surprising very durable however during rainy snowy days they ll get damanged so i suggest you don t wear them then anybody who doesn t have a pair and is interested should definitely consider this pair they re amazing 
comfortable sandals dependable vendor I have two pairs of these sandals replacing a similar pair ordered years ago from another source Very comfortable and should also last several years Size chart instructions let me order the right size with confidence The vendor shipped promptly I received what I ordered when I expected it at the price I expected One can t ask for more than that 
Bargain Birkenstocks These sandals are OK 4 star quality of material which makes it pretty good but the size system is completely off so that makes me want to put it as 3 stars I m an 8 but i ordered a 7 and i still have some room to spare I wish i could send it back and receive a 6 but too much work and i guess i ll just deal I feel that maybe a 6 would give me a firm size one where theres somewhat no squirming ability so thats why i decided to stick with a 7 I hope that this size review helps out a bit with your choice of size If youre ordering these sandals be prepared to take one size down or two or else you ll feel foolish with such big sandals Besides that the shape and form of the sandal is quite nice Its quite comfortable because after all it is a licensed birkenstock Plus the price is right compared to the other birkenstocks Thats why its moved up to 4 stars 
Perfect 10 Amazon got a perfect 10 on product and the timely shipment of it Good Job 
very good We bought two clothes line to Honduras This one and the Rick Steeves this was by far better It was longer it had suction cups which actually worked and little plastic clips on both ends I lost one suction cup end but it was fine because I would loop the line around with the use of the clip It also was a loose weave so we could use it to hold the items we didn t bring enough small clothes pins It worked great 
Good Coat The coat came just as it was getting cold and breezy here in TN It has a nice fleec lining that came handy while I was fishing in my boat It is not recommended for very cold weather but it is a very good cold weather jacket 
Looked long and hard for a lined water repellent jacket This jacket didn t disappoint It isn t rainPROOF but for walks to the bus stop etc in the rain it does the job and has a cozy lining to help keep you warm Generously sized I m very pleased 
Peyton Manning Blue Indianapolis Colts NFL Replica Jersey I was very pleased with my order of the jersey The quality was excellent and it was delivered in a prompt manner and packaged nicely My son loves it wore it to school the day after the Super Bowl and it was a real hit 
Manning Jersey is a TD Although I thought the jersey was a bit pricey it was a huge hit with my eight year old grandson The quality is excellent I know because he has worn it at least four times a week since he opened the package on Christmas morning I was really surprised and delighted to find his size at Amazon com I had combed all of the stores in our area and had also gone online before I found it at Amazon com I realize now that Amazon is more than a book store 
Got what I expected I got the item fast and in great condition just as I expected 
Perfect leotards the fit is perfect fun yet conservative the fabric is breathable and not sheer it is apropriate for dance or ther aerobic activities and also it can be worn under pants or as i shirt or as a camisole IT IS STUPENDOU 
andrew christian the shop did a wonderful job shipping my items right away i had no problems both items fit great and the scarf i ordered is so versatile also the prices were amazing thanks 
A+ Service Very fast shipping received my item a week before schedule Product was the same as the website description would purchase from again 
Awesome value This leotard is awesome especially for the price You can t beat it The cut of the legs is much more flattering than it appears in the photo Runs true to the sizing chart Only problem is no bra or lining so it wouldn t be good for anyone with a large chest The material is thick though no show thru so anyone b cup or smaller should be fine I am ordering more in other colors 
Great leotard This is a great leotard It is very comfortable and fits well I love wearing it while I am doing my workout tapes It is great to wear while working out It goes well with any workout no matter how hard it is This leotard can handle the most highest impact and the toughest toning It is also great to wear when I am doing my yoga tai chi and stretching tapes it handles and moves well with the most intense stretching It also feel so good when I am doing all these tapes I also wera it with pants or shorts when I go into the gym It is also good to wear with skirts and slaacks when going out on the town You can also wear it under your clothes while you are at work or college like I do very comfortable Then I go home and I m ready to go for my workout routine just have to slip out of the clothes and I m wearing my leotard This is a great product I would reccomend this comfortable leotard for any body who want to be comfortable during their workout such as yoga pilates kickboxing high low impact aerobics etc This is also great to wear at dance class anyboddy who goes to jazz ballet tap modern etc this is great for you girls to wear at you classes I give this leotard 5 stars 
GREAT CAP Super Cute Very nice cap with good construction Great price and selection of colors 
Cheaper at Big Lots three months ago I love these boxes because they take me straight back to my childhood doing my best to stay at home long enough to see He Man before I went to school I associate He Man with my earliest childhood memories Anyways great boxers for what they are Would never pay 20 bucks for them and even passed up 4 so my Dad bought them for me for Christmas Big Lots had them months ago at 4 a piece marked down from wherever they got them Get them don t get them whatever check big lots first They aren t long boxers so if that s what you prefer keep moving 
I have the power in my pants Sorry I couldn t resist the awful joke I received a pair of these for Christmas from a friend who knows my fondness for the cheesy 80s show I often wear these shorts while exercising The fabric is nice and comfortable The printing is good and has not faded much over a year and a half My only complaint is that He Man s quote is wrong He should be saying I have the power not I got the power Maybe as some reviewers assert women will not find you attractive if you wear these As a woman I don t find that to be too much of a problem However one man has commented because of the logo on the backside that my behind is the master of the universe 
See I m going to have to disagree on the sexiness factor The other reviewer cautioned that if someone were to purchase these boxers he would not be successful with the ladies I am a lady and a rather attractive one at that and I can assure you that a gentleman with such distinguishing taste as to wear He Man boxers would get more than a passing glance With the literal but adorably suggestive I Have the Power on them they achieve nostalgic innocense and at the same time a sexiness that can only be achieved by a deep appreciation for all things 80s How could you possibly look cuter unless you were to actually wear purple furry little underwear over your tights like Adam loved to sport I have been searching for a pair of He Man boxers for a very long time now and I will definately be ordering a pair of these for my man s birthday Hillary DePiano is the author of the She Ra Collector s Inventor 
Mostly fantastic I bought this sweatshirt for my husband for christmas it s a great basic He already has two other American Apparel zip front jackets However this is his first hoodie from AA One problem is that the drawstrings have frayed at the tips and look messy Usually sweatshirt strings are protected at the tips and only wear out after the plastic cracks on the 20th wash These aren t protected This product is mostly fantastic 
Great tummy control The Nancy Ganz Boyleg looks great and offers good tummy control It is not visible under clothes and it is very comfortable However the lace does not last for a very long time 
My son loves them I purchased these shoes for my son who is somewhat hard to please at times but he likes these quite well The look and feel of them is great in his opinion he thinks they are stylish and very comfortable He slips them on everyday after work 
The Best I have been wearing Bike Swimmer Jogger supporters everyday now for the past 4 years They are extremely comfortable and durable They are also well worth the money They are the only underwear I will ever use 
Great fit Great bra for the the full figured woman Beautiful bra with wonderful support Best of all it s comfortable I own several of these in different colors and have been wearing this style for several years Highly recommended 
Great bra for the price I bought this bra here on Amazon and have been very pleased with it It is supportive and fairly well constructed and I wear it in a big size I think it is definitely worth the price I paid for it 
Full Figure Underwire Bra The Vanity Fair Satin Solutions Full Figure Underwire is very comfortable to wear It hold up well and the wires have stayed in place 
Love My Sweats I searched for these pants and only after putting the style number in online was I able to find them on Amazon Although I paid a little bit more for them I will order more colors These pants are great for everyday wear and comfortable for working out in the gym Plenty of pocket room as well 
Terrific Sweat Pants The pants are great and the service was Awesome Will purchase again from this seller 
Not just for expecting moms Hi y all When my wife became pregnant she was worried that she would have to constantly expand her wardrobe as our wonderful growing child expanded her belly yeah I know babies grow in uteruses but belly just sounds so much cozier These Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands allowed her to wear her normal pants and skirts with the waists undone all the way up to her sixth month After our child was born my wife had no more use for the bands but I didn t want to see them go to waste I have always been pretty trim but I wondered if the Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands might work for a growing beer belly as well as a growing baby belly so I began to eat and drink excessively allowing my belly to grow My wife thought I was being idiotic but I told her that she had had her turn so she should let me have mine After gaining fifteen pounds and a noticeable paunch the waists of my pants no longer buttoned comfortably I undid my pants wrapped my belly in one of the Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands and threw on an old oxford shirt After buttoning just the top few buttons of the oxford I looked as if I were wearing a particularly snug extra long patterned t shirt underneath I went to my local watering hole and none of the guys recognized that I was wearing an article of my wife s clothing I have now become a big fan of Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands and have bought additional bands to add to my wife s collection Well I suppose I should say my collection since I m the one wearing them If my wife becomes pregnant again I will of course share the bands with her Who would have thought that my wife s pregnancy and my frugality would result in the sharing of clothing between me and my beloved I joke to her that my child is due any day now and then rub my belly lovingly My wife gives me a strange look sighs and then just shakes her head I know she s just jealous so I tell her Hey all you have to do is become pregnant again if you want to wear these Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands I don t know if your fathering another child is such a good idea she replies I ask her what she means but she just shakes her head and says Never mind 
Extreme comfort This item is the most comfortable thing you could ever put on Please be advised if you need support and plan to wear it in public you will not have much support 
The Barelythere Microfiber Crop Top Bra The Barelythere Microfiber Crop Top Bra is the greatest bra since the beginning of the bra back in the times of the Greek empire It feels great fits great and wears great I feel you cannot lose in purchasing this bra The strap the bottom band the cups feel great I think you will love it 
Happy The product arrived in great time and nicely packaged within the box It is very comfortable and wears well under all my blouses sweaters I will definitely consider buy other products from this company and this type of material 
comfortable I hate wearing bras but this is by far the most comfortable bra I have ever worn 
Good for Nursing Mom too I nurse my infant and I like to wear this bra at night for support It doesn t have any hooks or uncomfortable straps and is lightweight yet gives just enough support When I nurse my infant it s easy to just slide up and also accomodates nursing pads that do not shift I bought mine at Kohls on sale for about 8 
Super Comfort I ve spent a lot of money and time trying to find a comfortable bra and the microfiber crop top bra is the best I ve ever worn Definitely worth the price It s as comfortable as being without a bra yet gives support 
Totally worth the price no elastic to leave marks Amazingly comfortable bra the lack of hard stiff fabrics really makes this nice to wear for extended periods I have issues with irritation from seams amp elastic touching my skin so these all microfiber bras really are great for me The price seems high but as long as you launder gently and air dry they last quite a long time 
Great Support EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE I m a nurse I wear one of these everyday at the hospital If you re looking for comfort this bra is it 
Absolutely the most comfy and soft single set of women s jeans that women will fing ahhhhhh such warmth and beauty How wonderful to find something different to say think and feel in this think fit and feel Yay to all us chiks Let us allow the wind to caress our hair and skin as well as to feel the breathe of the Godesses in all Her Exhuberance purify consecrate and sing through our voices as if She opens a beacon of compassion with each exchange of sacred air that consprires to open the gates to another world of of wonder and love Sr Adess 
Very good shoes Excellent product very comfortable and a very good and pretty model he is recommendable 
Great Pants Wouldn t have taken the chance if they hadn t been on sale but they fit perfectly and look wonderful on Good quality and well made 
Very disappointing pants great wool terrible design To me a basic wool flannel trouser would be a more classic fit The very low waist NOT waist 4 zipper too long and very wide cuff was an awful disappointment I own 3 pr Harve Benard from 4 5 years ago which fit me beautifully same good tailoring lined wool so that s what I expected I am 5 7 and this year s design drags on the floor and sits down on my hips The pant legs are 4 wider than my old ones Also missing here are the side elastic options 
Harve Benard Women s Trouser These are one of the nicest fitting pants I ve received in a long time They are very well made and fit my slightly odd figure I also got a real deal on them which made it even nicer They arrived in a timely fashion 
Perfect These pants are the best fitting and most comfortable pants I have purchased in awhile How can you beat this price I would buy more if I could find other colors Very nicely made too 
Very happy with these socks I run most days of the week and wear boots when I m at work The offshoot on that is that my feet are usually fairly unhappy These socks while not a cure all for foot problems have improved my overall foot health and have helped keep me from having recurrences of some of the foot problems that I have had in the past 
Awsome Jeans Aura They fit like a glove First time a pair of jeans ordered online fit exactly like the customer feedback claimes Awsome Buy a pair Of Aura womens jeans today LOVE THEM 
Best Jeans For Real Women Three Cheers to Wrangler for coming our with jeans that are made to fit a real woman and not some male designer s idea of what our bodies should look like This is the most comfortable pair of jeans I have EVER worn Aura also has casual khaki pants but they re not sold here 
Love these jeans I just tried on a pair of these for the first time today and loved them They re right buy them 1 size smaller than you re currently wearing in other jeans and they ll fit comfortably The denim is a nice heavy weight with a little bit of stretch to it I took several pairs with different combinations into the dressing room with me to find the right one and now that I have it I can order online with abandon since they only had denim at the store I shopped at I don t have particularly long legs but have often found that regular jeans were just a little bit short only to have talls be way too long How wonderful to try on the average length and have them be just right I m ready to toss out most of the other jeans I have 
At last a perfect fit Thank you Wrangler women for the Aura jeans It s so great to be able to get a custom fit In my case that s long but not too long inseam but regular rise I also really like the fabric which has a bit of stretch but looks like regular denim This is my first ever pair of jeans that doesn t have something about it I don t like Once I tried these on I immediately ordered a pair in the dark indigo which is available on Amazon as a separate item It would be useful to see all available colors on the same product page I would love them in black and other colors Just great 
great alternative for us thrifty shoppers Not only can you not find Uggs except in very limited sizes and colors I simply wasn t willing to pay their sticker price I felt sure I could find an equally comparable shoe for a better value Well I found it These are SO warm and comfortable They have great arch support which Uggs do not so I ve heard and they are just as cute as can be I got the pink ones The Clausette shipped them promptly They felt about a half size too small but since they don t make half sizes like Uggs which run big I ve heard I knew the next size up would be way too big Then I wore them around the house for a couple of hours and they seemed to stretch a bit and contour my foot They are so warm and comfy Thrifty shoppers unite These are a great boot at fraction of the price of Uggs I highly recommend them Thank you Bear Paw 
Bought a second pair I liked these boots so much I bought a second pair they fit great and are very comfortable The price is even better 
Great Ugg Alternative A quality boot at a great price These are a great alternative to Ugg Classic Short Boots 
So comfortable These boots are the coolest thing I ve had in a LONG TIME They are so comfortable and I m happy as a bug in a rug 
Too smelly I returned them I was gifted a pair of these and had to return them after 2 weeks I wore them only inside my house just to keep my feet warm I should have known because when I first smelled them after opening the package the smell had a chemical hint to it After a week the smell on the outside material was horrible I had them next to my bed and the fumes were so bad I had to move them into another room I know it s not my feet as I ve never had a problem with shoe odor before and anyway the odor was from the outside materials YUCK 
So nice This shirt looks so nice on my baby blue Definitely my favorite shirt This company has pants and socks that match 
Happy with the product Not with shipping policy This is a great top for my teenage daughter It looks great on and she loves it It can be layered in cold weather or worn by itself in warm My only problem is that I was not offered a choice for expidited shipping which I wanted So don t order this if you want it in a hurry 
Lovely Scarf This scarf is lovely the color is just as it looked on line the texture is soft I m very pleased with it 
Lovely scarf and good value for the price I gave this as a gift to my mother in law and she loved it 
Love It I received this as a christmas gift after putting it on my wish list Its hard to know exactly how large it is but its a great bag none the less It is huge so its not great for an everyday bag But I use it for work and it works great and holds all I need I have received many compliments on it as well 
Great for the aspiring dance I bought this shirt for my granddaughter who is on the middle school dance team She loves the message on it 
Fits like a dream The control top is a definite must It sucks everything in as well as smooths it ou 
Total Comfort These are as flattering as they are comfortable Love the vertical stripe Perfect for yoga Check them out 
Not long enough A previous review led me to believe that these yoga pants would be longer than usual I went by this review since the product details do not list the inseam length I have long legs so I was excited to read another customer s comment that these pants are longer than usual They are not They have a 32 inch inseam which is too short for me Too bad for me because they are really cute and comfortable I will have to send them back 
nice at a good price these yoga pants are cute and nicely priced one note they are quite long so if you re used to getting high waters you ll be pleastantly surprised 
comfy and adorable My 3 1 2 year old son couldn t wait to wear it Zipping it up is a breeze and it s really soft and stretchy He didn t want to take it off in the morning Also he s above average in height and weight but a 3T fit him perfectly 
Comfortable and Cute These are a lightweight material which is perfect for CA weather And my son looks adorable in them 
Zen V skin Great skin for Zen V player My daughter loves the color but I like the protection it gives the player 
I LOVE these panties I got these as a birthday gift to show off for my boyfriend needless to say he had a VERY happy birthday I have never owned a pair of crotchless panties before but these are surprisingly comfortable and easy to wear The best part is the way they make me feel when I m wearing them daring feminine and downright sexy They are also a great way to show off a naughty wax You won t be disappointed 
Perfect for A Little Tease Just the right amount of visual tease needed and my woman says that there comfortable to 
Very sexy Customer service responded immediately when I contacted them regarding an exchange Received my items 2 days after I returned it 
The Ultimate Evolution in Being Clothed Yet Free wo Mankind experienced the apotheosis of comfort when someone decided that underwear was good but taking out the crotch would be even better In countries like Japan where the birthrate is too low to support the social medical and retirement systems giving these out to girls upon graduating high school would have the problem fixed in a mere decade It is only through the hard work of thousands of years of human history that we can enjoy the benefits of split crotch panties male or female If you are a woman get a pair If you are a man get your woman a pair Do not throw away into the void your chance to reap the rich intellectual harvest of generations of hard work in the lingerie industry 
Love them I love these so much I am buying another pair in black I wore these to bed with my boyfriend with a simple tank top and when things started warming up his reaction to the crotchless aspect was priceless The bonus was when I asked him should I take these off when it was time to get closer he responded NO WAY Way worth it 
Crotchless and Beautiful I recently received these from my husband as a present along with several other Love Fifi items all of which were crotchless These pretty French Knickers were the first of the bunch I tried and I absolutely loved em Over the years my hubby has always given me different kinds of lingerie all of them mainly ethereal or low cut but nothing scandalous And I think we were both ready for a change I immediately fell in love with the high on the hips and almost bottomless look of these knickers and how they made my legs look even longer The fabric was much sheerer than what I was expecting but the visual effect was pretty close to what s seen in the photo These were the first crotchless panties I d ever tried And it felt different to expose so much of my cheeks in the back as compared to other boy cut shorts I had worn But it was definitely the feeling of openness in the front that made me feel the sexiest I wore these to bed one evening along with a matching color camisole on top And even though these knickers made me more accessible which was wonderful during our warm up I still removed them out of habit when things got more passionate For more general usage I could easily see myself wearing these under my dress or skirt when dining out with my husband as a tease But I d probably want to consider getting a more thorough waxing first To finish up I guess I had always thought of crotchless panties as being a little tasteless But these cute French Knickers and the other items I received from Love Fifi were as beautiful as they made me feel 
cute and comfy My first pair of crochless panties and I couldn t be happier with them They are very flattering even for the girl who s got a little extra meat on her booty 
Sexy crotchless panties I like these because they are different from most other crotchless panties I don t usually wear crotchless panties but I have a few mostly the high cut kind like on my Amazon wish list I ll wear them on special occasions or when I want to feel daring These ones have a cool look Not that anyone but me is seeing them but you never know 
Dynamite on the Eyes Forget for a second that these panties are crotchless and let s focus on how they look They look great dynamite on the eyes front back and sideways Just absolutely georgous Every bit as good looking as the Tango Tanga panties also by Love Fifi that I think really look good Boy I have to admit when it comes to lady s undies these Love Fifi people really know their stuff 
Perfect these Panties are just Perfect I have never ever before had on a pair of crotchless panties and I have to say that I liked it Mostly I don t wear panties unless I m wearing a dress or a skirt and sometimes even then I don t I just like the freedom But these these are cute as can be and it s like you don t have anything on at all At least that s s the way it feels And they are darn beautiful Darn beautiful The discovery of these panties have really made this lingerie party for me 
Pink Floyd T Shirt ok The shirt quality is ok but the shirt pictured is short sleeved I was sent a long sleeved shirt Not what I expected or wanted The shirt quality is average nothing really noteworthy 
Don t Believe IN STOCK I ordered this product two days ago and called to check the status They said the item was not in stock and was back ordered This is a CHRISTMAS PRSENT I wouldn t have gotten it unitl NEXT YEAR This company is a joke Maybe the product is fine but the customer service is a crock the reprsentative even hung up on me If my credit card gets charged by this company I ll have a come a part on them 
Awesome for the price This acrylic scarf is so soft and so cute I bought it in black and wish that I had bought more colors I does say on the tag dry cleaned only but I washed it on cold and laid the scarf out to dry and its fine All I have to say is that its a great buy for the price 
They feel wonderfully soft and warm These are great for the price but I haven t tried to wash them yet so I don t know if I ll have the same problems as other reviewers I figure that if they don t wash well for the price I ll just throw them out and use another since I bought several just for this purpose after reading the reviews I ll have to put an addendum to this review once I ve used the scarf a little longer but so far I think they are lovely and definitely well worth the money 
Runway Women s Acrylic Ribbed Scarf Black Nice quality and price A really good value for the money 
Lovely This is a truly delightful scarf It s very soft and buttery lightweight and long The drape is incredible You can wear it just around your neck or drape it over your head first and it looks stunning Initially I got the winter lilac color which is actually magenta Very pretty color I loved it so much I bought the ivory black and cassis a dark burgundy This was a good thing because my six year old daughter cabbaged onto the first one Imagine that A scarf a child actually wants to wear I love this scarf so much I m going to buy the other colors I don t have yet We had a very cold windy winter this year and I wore one of these scarves every day They kept me warm without being oppressively heavy They also roll up into almost no space at all so they re ideal for travel or having in your bag just in case The scarf is 100 acrylic and the one drawback is that it s dry clean only I suspect handwashing would be okay though Even if you have to baby it a bit it s worth it for the exquisite texture I highly recommend this scarf 
Beautiful scarf This scarf is so soft and beautiful The picture does not give this scarf justice the colors are much more vibrant and the material is so ultra soft I gave this to my aunt for Christmas she loved it You cannot believe the quality for this price 
Very good shoes I ordered this shoes and I loved it very much This shoes makes me feel sexier and it match any dresses I have for the drag queen shows and for halloween that I am planning on wearing it the heels is alittle over 5 inches and the heels are pretty very thin and it has almost all silver metal heel except very little bit on the top of the heel that match to any color with the shoe the Amazon also put the black round thing on the bottom of the heel if it gets out then you could take it off the bottom of the heel and put another one hook back on and thank you Amazon for 2 black round thing on the bottom of the heels too bad it dont have gold metal heel unless you order a leopard shoe that goes with the gold metal heels but i ordered black patant and it only has silver metal heels 5 stars for this one for sure 
Great luggage I beat it up for six weeks in Europe It is light tough and the wheels roll smoothly 
I appreciate the consideration Even it s inexpensive the item from Amazon arrives in extra package to protect it from being bended I appreciate the consideration 
nice looking hats This is just what I expected when I ordered it nice looking adjustable hats that are pretty stylish They probably go well with almost any type of clothing 
Good looking piece of work I really love this cap Goes with any complexion well Thanks The shipment took a while but it was something they informed me about 
Basic Chino Cap Great selection of colors durable material and very well made Not too shallow in the crown so the hat stays on better than some styles This is a great value and I plan to order more of these hats 
GREAT CAP GREAT SELECTION OF COOL COLORS Very nice cap with good construction I really liked the selection of colors that I couldn t find anywhere else Fits perfect and great fabric 
Lovely gown I purchased this gown along with another for my mother as a gift She absolutely loved both of them I m so glad that I found them I was becoming frustrated searching in the stores 
The armband is very comfortable I have seen a lot of cases and this is one of the best Protects the iPod and I can easily control the click wheel The armband is one of the best ones out there 
Best Armband The armband is the most comfortable that I have ever tried It dosen t slip and protects my iPod 
very confortable Fantastic shoe it is wider in appearance than i expectet but this did not affect the fit 
Good Deal Have yet to break the product in Looks well and delivered in a timely manner 
CK underwear Fits nice and is great for doing sports Its also great for dancing and other socical type things where you need mobility Looks a lot better than tighty whiteys If you have a six pack most girls will agree 
So disappointed I bought this for my girlfriend thinking that it was a good find and a great deal I was mistaken Really this skirt was just fabric simply stitched with no lining whatsoever It was awful On top of it all it smelled too I didn t even bother trying to return it or give it to goodwill Instead we just threw it away 
Disappointed I bought this skirt because of the great reviews but when I got it the smell was horrible when I opened up the package It smells like formalin very strong I already washed it 3x but the formalin like smell is still there The smell reminds me of preserved frogs in my Zoology class I wonder if it was dyed right I m not gonna it S M NY 
Stand out among your friends My daughter saw me in this skirt and matching jacket She almost lost her mind I had to order it for her the same day This is fine since we teach at different schools It is a must have for professional educator The Apple dresses for educator is a thing of the pass As a teacher I am a professional and this outfit helps me to look the part Pearl RCE 
great skirt I have now bought two of these skirts and I love them The fit is perfect for me they are comfortable and look good It is not the best suede but it is affordable with a nice look 
nice skirt for price I ordered the Slate and the grey color is much bluer than grey But it s a nice skirt I just can t find a top to match the odd color 
nice skirt This is a nice casual skirt for a reasonable price The quality is fine Suede is soft and nice looking The size is accurate Good deal for the money spent Five stars 
Great Suede Skirt This is a beautiful skirt It s fully lined and the quality is excellent I find that it runs true to size I wear a size 8 and I have room to spare with this skirt There is also some elastic on the sides so there is room to breathe I think it s a great buy 
I love this skirt Mine s perfect I got the Brandon Thomas grommet jacket to wear with it and it makes an adorable outfit Very slenderizing and I actually disagree with the other reviewer s on the sizing I think it s pretty true to size if not a little big It s so pretty with the jacket brown cashmere sweater and suede boots I ve received so many compliments on this outfit 
Great deal great A line look nice quality I ordered Ginger color the raw color of the suede and I bought it fron Friday Deals It is 13 00 very well spent 
Kathy Dunn I gave this as a gift to a beach going teenager She says that she likes it very much 
nice layering piece pretty top has washed well thinner than I expected more like a long sleeved tee shirt needs layered with other pieces in the Great Lakes region unless it s early fall or late spring decent quality 
USMC shirt This is a nice looking shirt and the thickness of the shirt is perfect 
Ripped off I paid for two tie racks I received a large box with only only tie rack and a receipt for both I figured that they would send the second later but it never happened The one rack that I did receive looked fine 
Red Cedar Tie Belt Accessory Rack I received this item in perfect condition It was received in a very timely manner 
Why this is better than other tie organizers This is my necktie There are many like it but this one is mine If my necktie is wrinkled I am wrinkled Without my necktie I am merely smart casual It s amazing that I ve been a male all my life hey this is the 21st century worn many a necktie but outside of those electronic tie organizers with the lights and motors they sell in Sharper Image I have never even known what sort of way one might store their neckties except in a heap which has been my method all the while So now that I m a business MAN I wear these strange things every day and I have many so the heap has gotten quite a lot larger than it used to be And now I m doomed to neatness because I m getting hitched so I get to wear ties more often but the pants less And there in the soft center of my American male mind the wife being Japanese I ve got this idea Why not put my neckties on a tie rack Brilliant It will be a pre emptive strike in the neatness department major husband points But I don t want that dammed Sharper Image thing It s great as a gift but to tell the truth it takes up more than its share of closet space and wouldn t be very becoming outside of the closet This thing though very nice Cedar brass hangs on the inside of the door It s exactly what I was imagining and fortunately some other brilliant man out there thought of it too I take one point away for all the tie racks out there though because there surely could be something just as classic and simple but better functioning Guess I ll have to work on that one For instance this could have one hinged retaining piece of wood so the ties don t all come flying off the rack when you open the closet door too fast 
I was so happy to find a baby outfit for a pilot s son The outfit is very nice the jacket is of good quality My new nephew is only a few weeks old but as an experienced Mom I knew to purchase larger size clothes I looked for hours to find an outfit for a future baby pilot My brother and sister in law really liked it 
Everyone needs a Harry scarf I bought this scarf for my daughter away at college She wears it daily in the cold Everyone she meets admires it Those who are in the know really love it wish they had their own Harry scarf Those who do not know Harry lore still admire the striped colors She is the best dressed college senior on campus The scarf is very high quality with an embroidered seal It will last for years years Well worth the money 
Nice looking scarf I bought the scarf as a Christmas gift for my sister in law Being a Harry Potter fan she loved it The next time I saw her when we went out to dinner together she was wearing it It looked good not I m a Harry Potter Reader goofy 
A Winner This was a gift for my Scottish dad who loved it Great product and really wonderful value Couldn t find anything like it at that price 
Pretty scarf Everyone loves this scarf Is big enough for the winter and is pretty comfortable 
Really pretty and cute I have the brown ones They are cuter than any shoes I ever got They have a high heel like women s shoes I am only seven and I like to wear high heels Little girls will love them Mom says They are very sturdy and well made as can be expected from Nine West My daughter wears them to school and runs around all day in them She says they are comfortable 
cute but seamy great price and as pictured Its really cute but there s a seam right down the front of the cup that i didn t notice originally Still its a great price and a nice bra 
Great prices great product I found it so easy to shop threw Amazon I found what I was looking for fast There are so many different shoes to chose from I love it and will always shop threw amazon being a Canadian I thought it would take a couple of weeks to get to me It only took a couple days I was very surprized when my shoes arrived so fast 
Bad Experience I had a BAD experience with these shoes The size runs very SMALL Every pair of shoes I own is a size eleven and I ve ordered other size eleven s on Amazon with confidence This pair however I could hardly squeeze my feet into Trying to walk was so painful that I immediately pried my feet from the shoes I returned the shoes and I was disappointd by two things 1 I had to pay shipping almost 10 to send the shoes back 2 My shoes cost me 30 NOT including shipping them to me but the company was only willing to refund 20 So in reality it was a huge waste of money I paid 45 50 for the shoes including shipping both ways and they only refunded me 20 So I lost 25 30 on these shoes What a waste Can I give them zero stars 
whoa These are adorable pumps it s too bad I couldn t even put my foot down to walk in them The heel is much too long 
Great Product I had to return a pair of shoes that didn t fit but when I did everything went smoothly and my exchange was processed quickly Thank you so much 
PURCHASED multiple pairs These sweatpants are awesome I purchased many in a variety of colors Hard to find just the right pair of sweats but I think I finally found them 
Goog product I like this product It is good but I much prefer the front close 
cargo pants for the price i think they are very good and i had great quick service i haven t washed them yet but i expect them to fade i m rather tall so the 34 inseam is just about perfect so i ll have to see if they shrink before i buy another pair 
Great cargos Buy these I ordered a pair to see if I would like them and now I am going to order 2 more pairs I would order more if I had more money Nice lightweight material not too thick not too thin also very durable I like the extra two pockets Very comfortable Cheers 
footless tights Best tights I ever purchased They stay in place and don t hike up on your leg Great quality material used I am very impressed with these tights 
Great Bag I am a mortgage loan officer and wanted to purchase a nice leather business bag First impressions are vitale in this business I can t begin to tell you how many compliments that I have received Not to mention the packaging It came in a REALLY nice box and an even nicer dust bag came with it PERFECT BAG FOR THE PROFESSIONAL 
Nice case bought for my wife as a xmas gift It is nice quality and pretty good case 
Perfect Gift I bought this for my husband as a gift and he loves it It is very classy and modern 
Very pleased with Kenneth Cole Portfolio This is an excellent product Would highly recommend It looks about three times more expensive than what it costs It comes in great packaging with a nice box and a black nylon bag over it It also comes with a free small leather card holder Makes a wonderful gift 
Kenneth Cole Portfolio I was very pleased with this product It was nicer then I thought it would be and it came packaged very nicely 
A great buy I bought this bag for my husband for Father s Day and he LOVED it I normally don t buy things online because I like to touch and feel things before I buy them And I am especially picky about leather products The bag is really nice and the leather is of great quality 
She loves it but would she tell me different if she didn t I bought this bag for my wife as a Valentines Day gift She is self employed and uses this bag to carry everything she needs from client to client It is large enough and has a good organizer And she doesn t mind the clasps at all She especially likes the ergonomically shaped shoulder strap 
Gorgeous bag Great for the money Acceptable short cuts This is an absolutely gorgeous bag and you will probably never find one nearly this nice in the price range I bought this for my fiance for Christmas and he uses it to carry his laptop portfolio books etc to and from work and when he is on travel He absolutely loves the look and feel The bag does take two shortcuts 1 It looks like a buckle but is really a cleverly hidden metal clasp And 2 if the clasp is not shut when you travel it clanks against the holder You can get a bag that addresses these shortcomings by spending 200 300 more I didn t think it was worth it He loves the bag as is and doesn t mind closing the clasps 
A stunning scarf This silk scarf is a very high quality stylish and absolutely stunning It goes almost with everything and you can wear it all year round A real bargain for this price 
a hit I brought this as a gift to my Aunt when she and my Uncle had me to stay this summer Then at my cousin s wedding she was wearing it It looked great as everything inevitably does on her beautiful frame 
Awesome I agree with the first reviewer The colors are unbelievable ocean captured in silk Though the scarf is lightweight the texture of the silk is not it s high quality silk not the flimsy kind The size is great big enough to serve as a wrap or shawl but not bulky Worth every cent 
Absolutely Beautiful I received my scarf rapidly after placing my order I like it even more up close and will wear it as often as I can The size is just right to allow it to work as a scarf wrap stole or shawl and the color is simply exquisite 
pleased with the service The avaiability of the size made me choose this product It fits perfectly and the service from the order to shipping and receiving the shoes made shopping this way a pleasure 
Great Wallet Awesome wallet I like that I can remove the ID pouch when I don t want to carry everything with me 
No pickpockets please Great wallet plenty of credit card slots lightweight the only thing missing at the moment is money to fill it with 
Wallet DKNY products are always of a highest quality This particular product was not an exception 
Great Jocks Great stuff I brought a couple of pair to try and they d have to be the best jocks I own The double front mesh panels seem to be able to adjust to just the right size These provide a comfortable amount of support and yet allow for reasonable bit movement Highly recommended 
Gentlemen Start Your Engines When men give up their tighty whities and go for the boxer brief there are usually two reasons aesthetics and support The Under Armour Boxer Jock handles both of these perfect while adding comfort into the mix Aesthetics These are definately the dream come true The form of the boxer brief is perfect for those times when you get caught or wanna get caught with your pants down Support These are perfection in motion Under Armour caters to the athletic gentleman and so these are a nice combination of light fabric that really holds the boys in place Comfort Get the right size for you and they won t pinch ride up or move around Since they re Under Armour they re made to breathe and keep your body at least those parts covered at an ideal temperature This is true even if you re working out with them on though you ought to change when you re done Overall I ve tried all kinds to find the perfect pair and this is really it Comfort support and aesthetics 
Good Deal You can t beat it for the price High quality low price 
Snowboarding Use I use these for snowboarding and they work ok They usually get soaked though but they were cheap so it s ok 
ASICS� Men s GEL Kayano� XII This is the third pair of these shoes that I have bought in a row and I absolutely love them They are more comfortable than any other shoe I have worn yet still provide ample cushioning and support They also come in widths which is a plus when comparing ASICS� to other brands I highly recommend these shoes for runners of any skill level 
nice but style is a bit wild these are the way 60 running shoes used to be made back in the 80s too bad you ve got to pay over 100 nowadays Perfect comfort but one star deducetd for the horrendous styling 
The most comfortable shoes ever I m 6 6 270 and I love these shoes After having them for two weeks I bought 3 more pairs Being a big guy with bad arches and crappy ankles I go through shoes like crazy When I find good ones I stock up These are without doubt the best shoes I ve ever owned 
Large frame runner s here is your shoe I m 6 3 210 and run around 45 miles a week in this shoe I run on trails and pavement and this shoe has held up well for 4 months Light with an easy trasition and soft upper I ve already bought two pairs and am back to re stock no bull Go to a running store before you buy on the internet YOU WILL MORE THAN LIKELY NEED TO GO A SIZE OVER FOR A GOOD FIT Buy some socks and dip out and pay the cheaper price here 
Asics is a sure thing I have had many Kayano models in the last 5 or 6 years and the latest Kayano XII is another superb shoe Good forefoot and ankle protection light and a performance shoe With other runners I often experienced shin pain I have never had any such problems with this shoe or its predecessors You will buy other brands as I did but you are also likely to return to Asics for reliability and consistency If you ve had the best why change 
Great little slippers Perfect little slippers to wear around the house and you can just throw them in the wash to clean them 
Great Slippers They re great Very comfortable non slip soles We my staff and I wear them when high heels get to be too much 
Almost as good as isotoner I was looking for a less expensive isotoner slipper Made of velour they are winter weight At present in Michigan that is good They are very nice 
Coin Purse This is a handy little device designed to stop pants pockets from jingling with loose change It does what it sets out to do and does it well This should not be purchased by people missing fingers or by complete weaklings since it takes a bit of ooomph to open it to drop the coins in If you fall into neither category it s a good product 
Convenient I like to carry my cash in my pocket when possible A purse is a pain So this is very nice for a few bills and lots of coins It s a bit of a bear to open until you understand how You open at the sides rather than squeeze So it doesn t actually work the way it s designed to at least not well But that s a small issue and this is a nice well made product that should last a long time It s easy on the pocket no bulge And it s handy 
coin pouch I had been looking for this exact coin pouch and was thrilled to finally find it My husband has had one like it before and really liked it So I bought three for the men in my family We really like it I hope you will find it as good as we do 
coin purse I got it for my wife and she said she is very happy with i 
Manage your change Rather than throwing your change in a coffee can and eventually giving Coinstar 7 use this well made item It will last for years holds well over 5 in change and keeps coins out of the elusive nooks in your pockets 
Military GI Gore Tex Cap Black Very good for the cold and rainy days or snow 
Decent material I love the pattern very disco The material is a little stiff but it looks good as a head scarf 
Item received was not as depicted I ordered this yoga pant in black The item I received has a very large split up the outside of each leg which is not shown in the pictures of the item and is not mentioned in the product description The item appears so different in person that I could only assume I was sent the wrong item The seller Athletic allows returns on merchandise but will not refund shipping charges When I contacted the seller Athletica to say I didn t think I should have to bear the cost of shipping to me 7 75 and then return shipping to them for their error in either shipping the wrong item or not appropriately portraying the product they refused to do anything about the shipping costs and they tried to blame Amazon for the picture on the website rather than accepting any responsibility I will not order from this seller again and I would caution others against doing so either 
Fabulous Classy Comfortable Shoes These shoes are so classy and comfortable It s my first time ordering shoes online so I didn t know what to expect I ll be buying more colors in this style I get lots of compliments and they look nice I LOVE THEM 
great 8hr shoes these shoes are very comfy if you re looking for an 8 hr on your feet shoes I m on my feet for all 8 hrs walking back and forth and these shoes don t tire my feet There is no strain on the arch and no pinching in the toes Looks great with pants and skirt suits However they would look better with a bit of a higher heel 
Not so great I recieved this today and right out of the bag there was a small hole near the shoulder The material looks very cheap In addition this is not a cardigan type sweater where you can open and close in the front The front closure is made up of a string that loops the two side together like your shoe laces To put it on you have to pull it on like a pullover 
C B Casual 3 4 Sleeve Shirt PLATINUM This shirt arrived quickly It is better than was described and very comfortable to wear I appreciated the coupon to be used for the next purchase Thanks Ann Collin 
Cool and Pretty The shirt is cool in terms of temperature on a hot day and is stellar in terms of looks The striped turn up sleeves which you can adjust are such a nice touch The purple shade is more like a blush but looks beautiful on anyone who likes the pink purple shades It s 100 cotton strong Oxford cloth and feels garment washed I appreciate the speedy service I got in receiving this item from Bealls too Definitely give this one a try 
Great 3 4 sleeve white shirt Item received very quickly and exactly as advertised Excellent quality and extremely comfortable 
Okay I m sold I hate thongs DESPISE them Would much rather go commando I read once in a medical publication that physicians warn against g strings and thongs that wedge themselves in you know where because the fabric acts as a wick for bacteria to migrate forward Try not to vomit Well I m one of those people who can t get a picture like that out of her mind once it er wedges itself in there so I was about as anti thong as a person could be But sometimes you can t or don t dare go commando In that case a thong is mandatory What to do A salesperson sold me on the Hanky Panky thong and I m thrilled to say that she didn t misguide me The fit is loose I know a loose thong but that s the best way I can describe it so the fabric skims the outside of your body and doesn t wedge itself in They re the ONLY comfortable thong I ve ever worn So comfy fit no bacteria wicking you can t do better than that 
flawless the hanky panky 4811 is the best hands down this is the only underwear worth buying 
Great panty Very sexy and confortable panty This is ideal for use under thight pants Also while you are at it why don t buy your man a thong Thongs look incredibly sexy and masculine on men all my girfriends convinced their men to use thongs and now they love it 
pretty comfortable and low maintenance These are very pretty lace but they stay put and really are one size fits most I throw them in the gentle wash and low temp dry heck with the hand washing business These are convenient I would buy them again 
Zen V Snap On case Ok Delivered in reasonable time cheap protecton from scratches looks OK Somewhat of a pain to operate 
in my book this case gets a Consumer s Worst Buy when I saw a case for my zen v plus that was hard I thought it would be something that would protect the zen if dropped I was wrong this thing is really cheesy and flimsy the only way I would recommend this product is if you are looking for some cute case that would make your zen more shiny or if you want something that would protect it from scratches that was not what I was looking for but if it is what youre looking for go for it p s the laynard works fine I dont know what that other review was talking about it is ugly and really long though 
Eh Pretty case but the lanyard doesn t actually work with it Not impressed 
Great wallet Exactly what I was looking for Very smooth feel to it too 
work shorts These shorts are great for working in a warm climate I have several pairs of these I like them The cell phone pocket needs a flap because the phone can slip out when you sit down The people at Andrew Christian who actually provided the shorts were really first class to work with Exceptional 
one of a kind If you have every pair of dickies ever made this is the product for you No one around will have these It s an excelent way to express alittle of yourself when you already have expressing yourself down pat They also came in a very timely manner I was very inpressed They look way better in person 
Excellent Value and Good Product Excellent Product Great Dickies quality and I love that I can customize the item with a screen print that I can choose Love the cell phone pocket too 
Comfortable N Sexy How much can u talk about G Strings LOL I guess the title pretty much says it all They are very comfortable my lady likes the look and they are priced right 
I love my Prada backpack Sure i have bad posture from years of lugging this on one shoulder but it is so handy The interior zipper pocket holds my credit cards money and driver s license The exterior pockets hold my cell phone and business cards It can be washed and goes with everything In a pinch it can serve as an overnight bag The magnets are strong so the only complaints I have is that the interior pouch fabric is weak if you put a lot of change in it so you have to mend it when it springs a leak and the tie strap doesn t cinch up after a while Hey who cares its my Prada If they ever quit making them I will just die 
Beautiful Purse I am very pleased with the purse Color just as pictured size excellent Service and Delivery Excellent Only complaint can t get that awful smell off purse from Shipping material 
great slippers My husband got me these for christmas and they are great It s cold up here and I can wear these outside on the snow for a few minutes and my feet stay warm The bottoms are tough and I can tell that they will last at least two or three seasons 
Comfy soft warm cozy Those are adjectives my son used when I asked him to describe these slippers I had bought my husband the men s version for Christmas but he had not been able to wear them because my son wouldn t take them off I could not find any to fit my son so I bought him a small size in the women s and he loves them He puts them on as soon as he comes home sleeps in them and only takes them off to put on his shoes for school in the morning We highly recommend these slippers 
comfy slippers I purchased these slippers on sale which was great I bought them a size smaller because that s all they had available but they stretched out perfectly Highly recommended 
Shearling Slipper The International Women s Genuine Shearling Slipper is well made and comfortable to wear It s rubber sole makes it a secure slipper on wet floors 
Warm and Cozy These slippers are just what I needed something to keep my cold feet warm and cozy My only criticism is that the toe is pointy so I had to get used to my toes being a little squished And definately buy 1 size up I m a size 8 and the 9 fits well 
Sherling Bootie Slipper These slippers are wonderful They are nicely constructed true to size and very comfortable The sole creates a very sturdy base and gives some support These are a wonderful winter treat for keeping warm 
Christmas coziness These slippers were a Christmas present for a friend She had requested them through my son She loved them and I thought they looked really cozy 
They are a little small These are nicely made warm slippers but if you want to order them be aware that they are smaller than other shoes of the same size number My wife wears size 9 shoes I originally bought these in size 10 thinking they should fit loosely but even those were too tight I had to return them and get size 11 
Nice In my experiences Leg Avenue has always met my expections This time was no different The item shipped fast was packaged effectively and is exactly like pictured This item is body hugging nylon and is great for club night when you want to show a little skin Fishnet and knee high dom boots look great with it 
Great buy This hoodie paired with the matching pants is such a bargain Together the whole outfit is 26 Where else can you find such a buy This hoodie is very well made just to be expected from Soffe Very comfortable But you do need to know that the jacket is a short cropped length It does not meet at the waist of the pants Very cute and stylish 
Fantastic Perfect for a newborn in winter These rompers are well constructed inexpensive and not too thick to prevent layering under other clothes should the need arise The Orange and Yellow ones are especially cheerful I should note that the legs became too short for my son long before the rest of the romper ceased to fit so if you have a long legged baby perhaps try a size up 
Great bra I tried this on in the store but they didn t have it in nude Great bra especially for a bigger chest 
Awesome Thong Quite Sheer and slightly boosts and fits around and each of your naughty bits An incredible thong for the confident man Extremely sexy showing off your rear while hiding the essentials back there Also to the front fits around your package in an incredible way creating almost a seperate pouch for each of the male genitals making an extremely natural fit and feel except that the curvature will lift and extend your package quite a bit to create a significant effect under clothes and definitely when visable although the sheerness will negate some of effect It is quite sheer extremely so when wet near nude beach style so be prepared to be showing off your stuff to that special someone or that nudish beach 
Great thong I own a few thongs and this is the best one I ve purchased the silk is so light you hardly know you re wearing it and I think looks damn sexy whilst giving you support 
Weird feeling at first but then its magnific The first time I used this one was almost as fast as I recieved it to try it on it felt weird at first and I thought I wasn t going to be able to use it as underwear it was the best of all the thongs I have not that many I wore it for college and it felt wonderfull almost like going commando but at the same time offering some protection if I didn t have a roommate I would wear nothing but these when I am in the appartment Strongly recommended 
Really Comfortable and Sexy This thong is the best thing I have ever worn The soft and expandable material just hugs your body and the front pouch is really well designed and holds your things really well I mean unlike traditional briefs these thongs have more room for them I am thinking of ordering more of these babies for daily wear 
Sooooo Comfortable I ve never worn thong underwear before I purchased this on a whim But it is the most comfortable underwear I ve ever worn I m ordering many many more Thanks 
sexy and comfortable I ve always wanted something red and sexy These underwear are exactly what I was looking for I was slightly hesitant to buy silk underwear at first but this thong is quite comfortable The thin sides and the pouch design allow for plenty of movement Some may find the cut in the front to be somewhat low but I like it 
Too cute I searched all over town for Crocs for my little man size 4 1 2 with no luck The smallest size they come is size 6 7 obviously way too big except for the Disney style They are a little more expensive but worth it They are so easy to put on take off and they look so cute on him I was worried that the color might be too bright but they re not they look great with most of his outfits People stop us all the time to ask where we got them I have yet to see them in a store but I will be buying another pair in red black from Amazon 
The cutest things These are the most adorable little shoes My youngest granddaughter wanted Crocs like her big sister I ordered these and she even wants to sleep in them They are adorable 
Moisture Licking Cotton Ticking How can you not like these Comfortable durable and a great bargain 
These are some awesome socks I wear these virtually every day at the gym A great athletic sock I own about 2 dozen pairs Why run out Very consistent manufacturing no worries matching socks if all your white ones are the same exact design 
Easy to work with I ordered the jacket XL Tall Surprisingly it was too tall I had to return and order just an XL during the height of the holiday shipping season I received the XL jacket just fine and it fit properly I used the online chat they have setup and it worked well I also called on the phone and got through to live people easily 
This Sizing Works Having enjoyed Isotoner slippers for many years I was sorely disappointed when they changed their sizing fit several years ago The package sizing remained the same however they decided to scrimp on the fabric Consequently newly purchased slippers though well within my known size range supposedly through a 10 1 2 still ran short in the toe I wear a 10 thus far less comfortable Was I sure you bet I still have an ancient pair that when I slip on are an excellent fit No stores carried sizes beyond XL until I saw these on Amazon I ordered them in XXL and they really do fit Re ordered 2 more pair for each of my daughters who ve had the same problem I have to give 4 stars as I ve found their overall quality is not quite what it used to be but at least they fit 
Pretty prom shoes I was skeptical about whether these slippers would be as attractive as they looked in the picture or as durable as the reviews said They re both Totally gorgeous satiny comfortable slippers which will hold together fabulously Thanks Amazon 
Ballerina Slippers Arrived on time and my wife is very happy with them Thank 
Shoes off Ballerinas on I love these slippers Their perfect fit and feel make them the first thing I slip into when I come home from work and first thing I put on in the morning The elastic is not too tight and doesn t bind The terry insoles cushion and comfort my feet The shiny beige makes them look like real ballerina shoes which adds a whimsical touch I love the leather sole that allows me to go outside without concern I ve worn them while sitting outside with my Saturday morning coffee weather permitting Isontoner quality will allow me to wear these for at least 15 years Proof I still have my first Isotoner slippers which I received as a gift 20 years ago If you see a pair for sale I say go for it 
Great slippers I ve been wearing these slippers for years and they ve become increasingly hard to find in stores so I m grateful to Amazon for finding them for me 
Foot massage They used to advertise these as being like a massage for your feet This is true They feel WONDERFUL It s great when a product lives up to the advertisement 
Very pleased The order was delivered in a timely manner well packaged and as described Thanks 
this t shirt is quality Just a note to say the this t shirt has some good things going for it It is the size that it says it is Medium is really a Medium is NOT really a Large The printing held up well in the wash and the fabric isn t chintzy so there s no see through going on I would reccommend this shirt 
Vote for Pedro shirts The product came stuffed into the smallest possible package which I guess was to keep the shipping down though the shipping costs were higher than I thought I do wonder if retailers are making money off over inflated shipping The t shirts themselves were much smaller than the advertised youth 16 18 size They worked and I got them for a reasonable price so I m happy 
Great product shipped on time This was the first time that I had ordered anything from Amazon and I am very impressed I m happy with the quality of the product along with the process of receiving my order I was sent e mails letting me know when I would receive my order along with a web site I could go to track the item 
Just like the one in the movie My whole family loves the movie Napolean Dynamite and I bought this for my 10 yr old daughter as a sleep shirt It s well made and it looks just like the shirt seen in the film She loves it 
Great price for a great dress I ordered the dress and it came very quickly It was here in less than a week It looked exactly like the picture and came with all the accessories it was suppose to I m having mine altered because it s an inch too big up top The dress is easy to alter It s also very easy to either attach the spagetti straps or use the scarf and make straps to attach to the dress That is if you re uncomfortable with a strapless dress There are so many different things you can do with this dress it s great It s a great dress for a great price 
Beautiful Dress My daughter ordered this dress for her school winter formal The dress was here with in a couple of days and it was beautiful She loved the dress and looked beautiful wearing it I would buy from this company in a heartbeat The price was right and it was delivered fast 
Awesome service I had a last minute call to be in a wedding The dress arrived and was very pretty and matched the description completely The service from the company was also great 
sexy These feel great and look great if that s all you re wearing If you wear you pants so high that you can t see them then you really don t need them If you like really low pants then you can still flash an inch or so of underwear before your pants really are too low The best part is that when your pants have slipped too low you can pull them back up without the underwear bunching up 
Very sexy but let s be practical too Like all 2 x ist underwear I own this brief is made of superior materials and appears to be built to last It was certainly WELL worth the price I paid If you like wearing extreme low rise jeans or simply do not want to flash your waistband for any reason then this brief is for you Period For those men who wear standard low rise jeans or the like then you do not NEED this but you still very well may WANT it Clearly this brief is meant to do two things 1 make it so that you can wear very low rise pants and 2 make it so you look irresistable when you are NOT wearing your low rise pants I found that even though the underwear is cotton as opposed to the synthetics of the X Factor line for example this brief still conforms to my body s contours pretty well Actually very well everywhere except it bunches a LITTLE where it meets the very inside of my thigh Regardless this is going to show off everything you got and subsequently make it look more or less more impressive Practical consideration the pouch and the area above is reduced in size since it is accomodating the very low rise Translation be cautious when you get aroused as there is not a great deal of expansion room Enough said on that but that is why I gave this pair 4 5 stars Everything else is great I never had a problem with my rear being exposed in these briefs If you forsee this as being a problem for you then may I suggest the 2 x ist Contrast Countour Pouch Brief 3103C It is the same price at review time and the same materials but in a standard cut and features sexy contrast lines I own it as well and you may read my review about it on its product page 
The best undies I ordered the 2 x ist No Sho briefs because I wear low rise jeans They re really comfortable and the companies that I ordered them from shipped them immediately Great great service 
Very nice boots These are very nice engineer boots They have that tough guy look to them not to be mistaken for cowboy boots etc while standing and pants hang over them a little Quality rubber and leather Love mine Chri 
oh la la These pants are great Light weight fabric so you don t get too hot 
Very cute slippers BUT These slippers are cute but the sole is VERY thin ergo it s like walking on concrete There is no arch support I would not buy them if either one of these things are an issue 
Olga bras are the best This bra is so comfortable and gives my chest area a nice lift while minimizing by pulling the side area towards the center Very similar in comfort to the simply perfect bra with more shaping Looks nice because of the lace 
Russell comfort Can t go wrong with Russell for sweat pants soft and comfy and wash beautifully and keep getting better with age 
Great shoes great deal I bought these for my husband and they were a great price and he s loved the shoes Rockports are always great 
Rockport Men s Clarksdale Oxford Black 14 M A very good pair of shoes Nice fit and an excellant price 
I like it Can t beat the price for Rockports I noticed the price has gone up since I purchased them for 35 I thought it was a great deal and I am extremely satisfied No problems with the size I ordered a 9 and they fit like a 9 
No exchange The shoes did not fit and i was unable to exchange for a larger size Does it make sense to be in the clothing business and not be able to exchange for another size I would never order another clothing item thru you folks as a resul 
Great Looking Shoe My daughter bought these shoes for her boyfriend and they arrived looking great He has seemed very pleased with them 
Great Comfortable shoes I was impressed with the shoes when they arrived and became even more impressed once I wore them for a day One of the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever had 
excellent shoe The size is perfect and of great quality compared to the ones I got in JC Penny for 60 to 70 This is 30 but of much better quality 
Poor Quality I thought I was getting a bargain Rockports at a discount When they arrived the craftsmanship and finish impressed me Stitching looked even and the shine was appropriate for dress wear They are comfortable enough maybe a little snug but I though it was odd that they creased across rather than to the rear of the cap Within a few days however the skin like coating perhaps the waterproof layer of the uppers separated from the underlying leather creating blisters in the creases Within a few weeks those blisters tore exposing the leather underneath I m not sure where this will end but at less than 2 months old they will soon look too bad for dress wear And I suspect that the waterproofing has now been compromised I m glad I didn t pay full price 
Solid Shoes These are nice shiny shoes that break in fairly well and look adequately dressy 
Super SOCK Unfortunately my experience with this product is less than stellar For one I am a very hairy man A VERY HAIRY MAN The look was completely different from the picture Secondly upon closer inspection of the product pictured it appears that the model has a SOCK stuffed in the front That must be what they mean by super sock Anyway when I crammed my package in there it looked a prairie dog popping up out of its hole Lastly watch out for the string it gets stinky 
GOOD bag I bought this for my son to carry his football clothes in to and from the field it is not to big but just right and the price is great too 
Great Product This is a great product It is well made and just the right size for books and other items The fabric is thicker than a the regular nylon and you can tell it is a high quality product I really like the extra convenience of the outer pocket It allows you to carry smaller stuff that would otherwise get lost at the bottom of the bag 
the best shoe i ever wore salomon karma are water shoes are very comfortable and are true to fit the only problem is i ordered them too big i figured that they would be too tight but what i do is to make them tighter i pull the little belt in the back and then it fits just right 
Spanx Camisole I love this camisole Very smooth comfortable and definitely conceals the areas you wish I do not wear a bar with this item and feel comfortable with the support I receive Highly recommend 
bad sizing the hat is fine but size is not correct the hat is too small and not the same size as advertised or labeled will not buy from this supplier again and recommend against the 
very good quality for the price Excellent touch fabric Very good cut for big men 
Derek Jeter Jersey Customer service was fantastic product exceeded expectations would definately shop here again 
Great price The size is true the look is excellent and the price was great Amazon is the place to find top brand shoes at amazing prices 
Excellent Arrived promptly excellent shape and beautifully designed An excellent product with a good pric 
Comfortable underwear with funky design Nice and comfortable underwear very masculine et flattering The pouch offers comfort and easy access The seat of the brief is full and fits nicely The garment does shrink a little after first wash but the quality is top 
How can you go wrong with fish net I know that I wasnt thinking of Arbys fish sandwiches when my wife put this on 
Full nips = teh own Sexy Thank you for listing your pron on amazon I might buy this for my next girlfriend if she s good 
Great Product It takes a little practice with some of the tools in this kit but with most of them i got right away For the price is amazing compared to what styles you can create 
I was skeptical at first I ve seen the informercials for the hairigami products but didn t think they could possibly work as well as shown I was pleasantly surprised My hair is past my waste and fine but dense I had no problem using most of the product in this kit the first time I especially liked the original Hairigami and the spring rings The other products are good too Some of them do take a bit of practice to get the hang of but none of them are particularly complicated All of the products in the kits are durable and a good value for the money I recommend this product for anyone with long hair who wants to be able to do something with it quickly and still have it look stylish 
It lifts and seperates I bought this for my wife at Christmas At first I thought it would not be a good fit or too much lace It is just fine for around the house and hides just enough that you don t have to close the curtains or always wear a bathrobe over it Nor is it so naughty that the parents will wonder what the heck is going on in the bedroom should they see it in the laundry or in the clothest 
Beautiful This is one of the most sensuous and beautiful gowns I have ever worn The soft silkiness of the fabric next to my skin is wonderful The lace top reveals just enough to peak your partner s interest Worn with a lacey garter belt nylons and maribou trimmed heels they won t be able to keep their eyes or hands off of you Very well made and extremely comfortable 
wonderful product I ordered this in black and am extremely pleased with it It is very well made and the material is silky It is true the bodice was a little stiff when I first got it but this was just sizing and washed right out The generous silky skirt swirls gently around my legs when I walk making me feel very sexy Will order another in another color 
A Real Turn On That s What These Panties Are I brought a couple pair of these to our little lingerie party because I knew the girls would like them I ve been wearing them for over a year and I like them a lot My husband does too They look good turn him on turn me on too You can t ask for more than that in a panty now can you 
Cute and Pretty Darned Enticing I really like the look of these panties all lacy and feminine They feel good on look great and best of all they re low cut so you can were them with your jeans riding low on your hips And if a bit of panty does peek out all the better cuz these are so cute Pretty darned enticing too if you know what I mean 
Stylish and Nice Hot Looking too These are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff Levi s My cutoffs are so faded so frayed so well you know So when I peal them off to reveal this Butterfly Lace up Panty in Black with the pick laces on the back it s like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl We only had two colors at our lingerie party white and the black and pink models but I can imagine all the colors would be nice too 
I love these panties They are sexy an I love I can have different colors for different days 
Jockey No pany line hip brief If you will ever just try these one time you will be hook forever 
Not bad This product fits my Vision M 60GB very well It s easy to work with easy to slip the player in and out My only complaint so far is that the hole in the bottom for plugging things into the Vision is positioned improperly I have to fight with the leather to get the charger plugged in But it isn t bothersome enough for me to care much 
Oh My God It fits Finally I mean it has been a stressful experience trying to find a case to fit the 60 gig Gizmo Finally mission impossible has been accomplished All is well Tell the Lady in the Lake Camelot has a king again It s a sturdy leather case with a belt clip and holes in the right place for ear phone and charger connections It will protect the Gizmo nicely I mean I could just put my gizmo in the fabric pouch and stick it in my pursie or in my pocket to power walk but my son an electrician was banging the heck out of his gizmo Now he can cover his and protect it 
Finally Like the previous reviewer I tried a number of cases before I found one that would work with the 60gb Zen Vision M This one works as advertised My only complaint is that the clear plastic screen protector is a little scratched Other than that its a great product Way better than those stupid silicone skins I also agree with the previous reviewer in criticizing Creative for recommending products that don t work with this device Hey creative how about making some accesories for this product Thanks 
FINALLY for the 60GB Finally after going through many cases this one is the only one I found that works for the thicker 60GB Zen Shame on Creative for their responses to me and their recommendations of so many cases that do not fit this player Huge Kudos to this company that have finally made my Xmas gift functional for hiking and jogging for me 
Review of Alexia BRONZE The product is good It makes the leg look elegant Amazing Price for a quality product

Great City Boots These are lovely boots at a very good price True to size 6M and easy to put on with the smooth side zippers A fairly low heel makes them comfortable for moderate walking about although I would not want to walk in cold weather for extended periods Good quality leather and I like the style and the ankle length 
Beautiful Boots Classic looking boots they fit great and at such a nice price Go ahead Amazon 
Gorgeous and great price I saw these same boots at a high priced department store the day after Thanksgiving 2006 for 129 The leather is like butter absolutely gorgeous and they are SO comfortable I love these boots Thanks for the great price Amazon I joined Oprah s book club and purchased these here for less than 80 I bought the black ones What a great deal 
oh la la These pants are great Light weight fabric so you don t get too hot 
Rebok Club C My husband has always worn this tennis shoe It has been hard to find in black in the local stores I am glad that I can still purchase them online The quality is excellent

Lands End Men s Fleece Clog Slippers This is the second pair my husband has owned He loves them because they are so comfortable and well made They last a LONG time He wears them outside around the yard and the desert sand doesn t hurt them The first pair lasted 8 years He wears them all year round inside and outside A great buy you definately get your money s worth 
accountant love My fiance is an accountant I purchased these slippers for him recently during tax season and he loves the relaxation and warmth they provide when he gets home from a hard day 
Good not great Comfortable and fairly warm But there s a little too much sponginess in the sole which makes them feel unstable at first And your foot never quite drops in without help from your hand you end up crushing the low heal area But in a few days I got used to both of these things and now wear them around the house all the time and like them a lot The price is right too and they arrived very quickly 
mens fleece slippers this was a great buy and the perfect gift for any man who lounges around have recommended and will purchase again 
Sizing was off The slippers are well made and nice looking but they were small for their stated size will have to be exchanged 
Comfy Slippers I bought a pair for my husband and son They both seem happy with the comfort factor and I think they are cute I think they could use a bit more of a cushion 
fleeced slippers Even though they were shipped to the wrong address they quickly fixed the problem and we recieved the slippers Thank 
Very Comfortable I bought these slippers for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves them He said they are both durable and very comfortable 
A COMFORTABLE BOOT HAVE NOT TRIED THIS BRAND OF BOOT BEFORE BUT GLAD I DID OH SOOO COMFORTABLE THANKS FOR THE QUALITY 
Von Dutch Suade Boots beat Ugg boots Awesome comfortable boots at an extremely reasonable price 
von dutch suede boots After reading several reviews had my doubts but well when they arrived quickly and in one piece I was pleasantly surprised I enjoy them Got great compliments and would buy them again 
My dune boots They are very comfy and I love them Wish I could wear them year round 
Good value but they do run small I am glad I read the reviews before ordering the boots I am satisfied with my purchase My daughter needed the boots for a last minute trip east A majority of the reviews recommended buying a size larger and I am glad we did They definitely run small Can t understand how some of the reviews said they don t My daughter wears a women s 6 and we ordered a 7 She won t be able to wear thick socks but they will do the job for this trip 
I thought they were great I got a pair of these for my wife also She loves them that s all I know 
great boots I purchased 3 pair and we all love them warm cozy and fashionable 
Very durable extremely pleased I bought this fanny pack and was pleasantly surprised with the quality particulary the zippers It is a very durable bag Would definitely hold a small lunch along with keys cell phone and wallet 
A gift This fanny pack was a gift for my wife who is busy and off doing errands all day everyday She loves it since it keeps her hands free and carries everything she needs 
Very Nice Shoe You always take a chance when buying shoes off the Internet If they don t fit you have to go to the trouble of returning them to the vendor and I for one really don t want to be bothered doing that I also hate buying shoes in a store and dealing with no customer service crowds and a limited shoe selection I do research before buying shoes from the Internet and really examine the size I m getting before the purchase These Sauconys fit me very well The size is true I ordered size 8 5 wide and that s what they are I have them on now and they give me very good support They are lightweight and give me the support in the ankles that I need because I stand at work all day My ankles can really feel sore by the end of my shift without the proper shoes Also the toebox is tapered but there is plenty of space for my toes The shoes provide enough room without looking clunky I just hope I will be able to buy the exact same shoe when the time comes to replace them Why do shoe companies insist on discontinuing a perfectly good style This makes it so much harder to purchase shoes on the Internet 
Shoes They wear really good I have bad feet and was looking for something comfortable to stand in all day Thanks 
AIR MOVER I HAD THIS KIND OF SHOE SINCE 1996 THIS IS MY FOURTH SHOE I LOVE IT 
Great Shoes Shoes are fairly expensive but incredibly comfortable and durable I bought 2 pair of these about 3 years ago and have been wearing each pair 2 3 days wk since then and they still are very comfortable with minimal upper or treadwear The shoe sizes 1 2 size small I normally wear a US 9 1 2 and got these in a size 9 I definitely plan to get another pair or 2 when these finally wear out 
WARNING This shoe arrived about a full size too small I m usually a Clark s fan and own several pairs but for some reason these shoes are not as true to fit as Amazon claims I could not get my size 9 feet into this 9 1 2 sized shoe It s possible that I received a defective product but you may want to consider this before making your size selection or check other shoe sites for similar comments Good Luck 
Great shoe for a great price Received the shoes right on time as reported The size is good according to my wife She was happy to learn that they were Pu non leather 
Barbie Shoes These look like barbie shoes and fit great not on me great purchase good qualit 
Sexy beautiful comfortable Imagine A stiletto you can really stand and walk in I love these shoes and so does everyone else who sees them 
Rainbow leather sandals review Rainbow sandals are the best flip flop sandals that are on the market They fit well and will outwear any other sandals by 2 to 1 The quality is very good but not quite the heavy duty rainbows that I used to buy in the late 1970 s Island Surf is a very reliable supplier who ships very quickly which I appreciated The product and seller are highly recommended 
Da BEST Flip Flops After 18 years my husband finally let go of his Rainbow Flip Flops bought in 1989 Granted the past two summers of wearing them has been an act of love on his part but they were his favorites and though slightly cracked from lying in the sun he could still wear them He was like a kid with a toy when he received his new pair for Christmas and though the logo was different the name was the same and the quality appeared to be the same as well When he bought his one and only orignal pair in 1989 we gasped at the price since it was higher than the drug store brands but they are worth every penny no gasps needed they last almost forever made extremely well comfortable handsome leather we re fans

The best shirt on the market I have been wearing this shirt the Lands End Button Down Pinpoint for twenty years at least It is the only shirt I purchase period My dry cleaner laundry claims it is the best shirt they launder from dozens of choices There is no better white dress shirt available from any merchant at any price 
silk better than satin I bought this pair of silk sleep pants and another pair of satin sleep pants Although both were fine the silk is superior in comfort and worth the difference in price 
Great but tappered ankle These pants are nice quality and nice flowy through leg but they tapered at the ankle more than I wanted 
Nice Pants My husband really likes the Intimo Men s Classic Silk Pants They are very comfortable and the color is really nice He wears them almost every day The only complaint that we had is that the pants are a little bit short in length 
Luxury for a steal I must say I was very impressed with this item I recently wore these silk pants with a smoking jacket on a cruise ship They were very comfortable they look and feel wonderful and are worth far more than the price Another hit I don t know how these folks do it but Intimo s prices are amazing I would highly recommend these silk lounge pants 
Comfortable Durable I m very pleased with the comfort and design and appearant durability I just wish it would get colder and stay cold long enough in Arizona to wear them more often 
Great Silk Pants Except Great Silk Pants Except My Husband wears a Size Large Pants in everything and with these pants I wish i would of ordered an Extra Large they are a little short on him Looks like he s waiting for a flood I ordered the Burgandy and Blue and the colors are so Deep and Rich Very Nice They wash nice also

Harry Potter Hat and Scarf The shipping on this light weight item was a little high the quality is good but the tassles on the end are sewn on cheaply and get matted easily 
Spiderman is grandson s most favorite I bought these for my 2 1 2 year old grandson to be prepared for the day he s ready to use the toilet He wears 3T and they re too big for him He wanted to wear these over his diapers Last week I bought him some Easy Ups and he wanted to wear Spiderman over them Now he tells his mom when he needs to go to the bathroom and he has no trouble taking them off by himself He doesn t want Spiderman to get dirty His mother is glad I bought them Spiderman motivated him to train himself at least during the day He still wakes up wet in the mornings so Spiderman has to have nightime protection I bought three packages so far 
Nice Shoes I wouldn t have expected any less from Aerosoles Fantastic fit So comfortable 
where are other colors sizes do they only make it in XXL and this disgusting color other colors are shown but you can t chose the 
Unreal Very Pleasing Price These boots and beautiful and very stylish The price was just astounding I couldn t be any happier about that One of the boots rubbed on the ankle for the first few days and felt tighter than is comfortable But after a few days of breaking the boots in they became easy and comfortable to wear 
Must Have Travel Accessory After being forced to re package our suitcases on the floor of the airport we decided that a travel scale was essential The wife s suitcase was 55 Lb mine was 35 The airline people weren t going to average them This scale is the answer It is designed to show the weight of the piece of luggage once it is lifted and sat back down You don t have to struggle to see the weight while holding it in the air It also has a convenient measuring tape built in to make sure you meet not only the weight but also the size requirements It is rugged and well built 
I m very satisfied about this product No comment Everything is OK Regards Cristia 
Good value and great customer service A great example of perfect customer service I ordered two scales by standard free shipping In a few days I received just one and immediately called customer service but the Department dealing with this was closed it was 6PM on a Friday I was told someone would contact me Monday To my surprise a lady did call me and not only did she dispatched the scale same day by next day air but she also refunded a part of the total cost an honest admittance of error and the courage to say sorry The products are excellent and I would never ever think twice before dealing with this seller 
Scale worked wonderfully When a limited weight is required by airlines this scale really helps Airlines can charge for over weight luggage I wanted to be sure I wasn t over the limit 
ZERO STARS First this shoe runs small a full size at that Most importantly the only thing that could make this shoe wearable without mind numbing jaw clenching tear jerking pain is a local anesthetic Steve Madden must Hate Women this is the third Madden shoe I ve bought that was painful beyond description I thought maybe the first time it was simply that particular shoe and it s design but the 2nd and 3rd were progressively more painful than the first Every person involved in producing Steve Madden shoes should be sentenced to wearing them for a full year 
Love it but I choose 3 6 months size but it looks like a 9 months size 
Cute This is a cool little onesie It was only 3 so I bought it cause I thought my husband would like it He did It fit good and I have no complaints 
Cute My husband loves this shirt Also it is pretty soft and seems to be comfortable 
Fun These shoes are comfortable stable and pretty They sort of have a spanish dancer look to them with the way the heel is wider at the top I got a lot of compliments on them Piperlime said they ran large so I ordered a half size larger and they fit well 
beauty and comfort My order arrived sooner than expected Beauty and comfort that s all I can say about this shoes 
WOW This shoe is so much better than the picture shown The red is just perfect The picture does not do it justice and you just cant beat the price 
Perfect Fit I ordered these in red and must say that they are great shoes that can be worn with jeans or a skirt to work or for a casual get together I ordered my normal size and they fit perfect For less than 25 these shoes were a great deal 
These shoes run large I ordered these in my regular size 7 1 2 and had to return them to go down a half size They are adorable and comfortable just be aware that they run a little large 
Forget the PC politics it s just a good shirt Lots of people have issues with Dov Charney s American Apparel s CEO management style Fine Whatever you think of unions sexuality in the workplace and skanky porn star allure it s still a good basic t shirt that s flattering on the female figure The 4305 baby rib works well with both jeans for a casual look or slacks skirt for the office professional I own two kelly green and black and thanks to the soft comfortable cotton and stylishly tailored sleeves they re regular players in my daily wardrobe 
Great Lingerie Cage This is a great lingerie cage It washes all my bras without ruining them in the washer Yay Saves time for me so I am very happy with this product 
warm and comfortable What a great product These overalls are comfortable and warm for the winter without having to wear layer upon layer Wonderful 
UNRELIABLE COMPANY I bought several pairs of these about 3 months ago The price sounded reasonable and was the best that I had been able to find online so far After I finally received them I wish that I had never even bothered to make the purchase in the first place They were slower than a snail to ship them and when I opened them I could see just by looking they were mismarked and way smaller than they should be So now I am out over 100 for merchandise that is worthless to me I tried to contact the seller they have never responded Don t even waste your time here YOU WILL BE SORRY 
Ever Body Looks Good in Overhauls Now if you ask me and plenty of folk do who are in need of both durability and comfort in a workable fashionable statement in their wardrobe these here overhauls are the way to go Not only are they practical work clothes they clean up nice and can be worn out on the town when need arises Plus that this particular make comes in triple X Large and that my friends is almost big enough for Mama to slide in to a pair here real soon See she s been on the Atkins Diet for a few months and she already dropped about 86 pounds but she s got a couple hundred to go before she s back down to her old fighting weight and can get in to these uni sex universal timeless classic overhauls Possum Belly overhauls are the best but you can t really find them on the internet unless you get real lucky and are willing to buy imports which I ain t 
Great Bra I am a large busted woman and it is very difficult to find a bra that fits I purchased 2 of these Vanity Fair Secret Luxury bras and I must say they are very comfortable to wear They are very well made I always try to find a 4 hook bra and this bra has 4 I went to lunch with a couple of my friends the other day and even told them about my find I even showed them how well my bra fit 
skechers review I absolutely love these shoes I love them so much I bought a black pair too They are very comfortable I get compliments on them daily 
great shoes These shoes are super comfortable I can wear them all day and my feet do not hurt Well worth the money 
Clarks Spark Slides Very comfortable and well made I bought brewski first and liked them so well I ordered another pair in black a few days later 
SuperSoft As usual the WebUndies are unbelievably soft The best sleepwear I have found to date Amazing 
great sandals When I got these I was immediately impressed with how great they look They are very comfortable and definitely worth the price too They offer a lot of support and are probably the best flip flops I ve ever purchased The only thing is they run a little small in size 
Great sandals Worth the price I love these sandals They are so comfortable No rubbing or iritation even the first time I wore them I usually buy the cheap flip flops but these were definitely worth the money 
Love these flip flops These sandals are my all time favorites I ve been wearing them for year and years Glad this style is still around after all these years 
Love Them Reef s are the most comfortable pair of flip flops I have ever owned I would wear them every day if I could I never would have imagined that flip flops could be designed for comfort but these are the best The have arch support nice cushoining and have never given me blisters like the plastic slip flops I ve owned You won t regret getting these 
Perfect flip flops I picked up a pair of Reef Sandy s at the beach years ago still love them The tread has finally worn down on them so this year I got two new pairs brown pink both are gorgeous They mold to your feet quickly and the wide fabric strap is so comfortable unlike cheap flip flops Never had a problem with any ripping or breaking One important thing to note these run about a size small In other shoes I wear a 7 or 7 1 2 but a size 8 Reef Sandy fits me perfectly 
Reef Sandies cannot be beat I grew up in Hawaii wearing these shoes and fifteen years later they are still an integral part of my wardrobe I LOVE Sandies for a number of reasons not the least of which is that they re an incredibly good deal For 22 I get shoes that last an average of two years They come in so many colors and each year another one or two is added to the line I wore these touring around Europe and Japan earlier this year walking around all day every day for over a week in each place because they re much more comfortable than my Nikes etc that cost five times as much They go great with everything and don t try to tell me different A great investment at 22 
Favorite Pair of Jeans These jeans became an instant favorite with my 11 year old daughter They look great and she says they are very comfortable She wears them often and they are holding up well under frequent washings 
at my gym Aside from being the default foot wear for anyone who has to clear security to fly I wear mine to the gym both to lift weights and jog the treadmill It s gotten some questions and raised some eyebrows My answer is that no running shoe I have used gives the same comfort nb around boats where you feet will go wet I prefer the beach model which is offered in fewer sizes they try to cover two shoe sizes for each croc I wear both types ALL of the time and wear has been less than with the common loafer 
Comfortable Functional Versatile I love these clogs They are very comfortable but be careful of the sizing you may need one size smaller than usual They can be rinsed off very easily to be kept clean They have no holes so my feet can get a little moist They are easy to slip on and off and don t absorb foot odors 
Very comfortable These are probably the most comfortable pair of shoes clogs sandals I have ever worn I love that they weigh next to nothing and have a pretty generous fit in the forefoot and toes Props to Crocs for a well made clog 
Exactly what I expected These Hipsters are what I expected soft no marks at all Very comfortable 
Goes great with a kilt These socks wear well with a kilt keeping the legs warm in snowy conditions 
It s better than I thought It s a very nice top I had a great surprise 
Italian leather gloves Bellissimo Buttery soft and fit like a glove Very nice quality An exceptional buy Loved the free shipping 
Pujols jersey My son thinks that this is the best jersey ever He never wants to take it off I m really impressed with the quality of the product I m sure that he will enjoy this for years to come 
Excelent product My girl is very happy of your product Thank you for giving us excelent products Regard 
Love these boots The look great are comfortable and the heel isn t too high for me very styling 
Good They do seem to run about a half size big Also they seem a bit narrow in the toe area Otherwise they are cute and comfy once you break them in 
Good price Nice boots I think the brown boots I purchased look better than the black boots in the picture It s a casual boot that really looks good with my jeans 
Disappointing I was very disappointed with this rain suit I bought it especially after seeing the above review since I too bicycle to commute I m not sure if they sent me a different rain suit or what but the one I got didn t have the overall pants I bike an hour each way and after the first ride the pants have holes around the bicycle seat area and the material is breaking down at other points in the pants as well The jacket immediately started coming away from the bottom snap Definitely not a rugged suit I didn t have a problem with being too hot although perhaps that is because this is springtime in New England I wouldn t bother buying this suit unless your commute is quite short 
this is the best rain gear ever This is not wussy pansy type raingear This will keep you actually dry I have been using it to commute on my bike in heavy rain and it succeeds where feeble breathable raingear fails If you are exerting yourself this will probably be a bit hot but if you are not working up a sweat you will be just be warm and dry And it s a great value it looks like it will hold up for awhile and it s way cheaper than the breathable stuff 
excellent baby sun hat I was more than pleased with this this little hat I bought for protecting my baby from the tropical sun where we live It not only completely protects her face but the back of her neck as well The elastic back allows her to wear it now and it will still fit her in a couple of years Great hat 
Can t go wrong with Carters The seller shipped my purchase quickly Carters is my favorite brand for baby clothes Durable 100 cotton and cute I gave these as a gift in a baby shower and the new mother loved them 
sizing This item came on time but the sizing are wrong I normally wear medium and I bought large thinking the cheap price would affect sizing I was right Had to give them away could not wear them They were so tight and the fabric so light I could not think of wearing the 
Great shorts I ordered these short for my husband and he loves them The fabric is soft and comfortable and the colors are great too The shorts fall right at the top of the knee and they fit great Good buy for look and price 
Lee Cammo Shorts I ordered a pair of these shorts in every color My husband loves them Well worth the price 
The Greatest Shoes I love Birkenstock and at this price I just couldn t let it pass They are so comfortable I m wearing them right now 
Ontime and as described I am satisfied with the purchase and price was unbeliavable Thinking of ordering another pair 
the best clog this is the best clog I ve ever worn very comfortable fit true to size also very chic and the most important one is the sale price catch it before it s gone 
birkies The only words that I can say are wonderful The savings were great I own several pairs of birkenstocks and they re not cheap however they are quality shoes that last You get what you pay for Being a health acre provider these are the only shoes that I have found that last Knowing that it prompted me to start wearing them for everyday wear also 
Best price on the net This was a fabulous purchase great product and the price was the best I could possibly have found after hours of research Thanks so much 
great footwear I have had 1 pair of Birkenstocks before that required a bit of foot shaping break in time These were comfortable from the first time they were put on and remain comfortable all day long They were well worth the money 
birks These are the only shoes I wear so I bough tthem for my daughter They are so comfortabl 
BIRK CLOGS ARE GREAT Thanks for selling such a great product ON SALE The shipping was super The fit and comfort are wonderful The foot bed is similar to the Arizona sandals which is softer than most Birks 
Comfortable from the first wear These shoes are extremely comfortable I could wear them all day right away I m extremely pleased with them I found them to be plenty roomy so I wouldn t recommend over estimating your size or width 
Very Good These shoes are great They are comfortable and stylish on You need to wear them like any shoe to break them in then they feel like a tennishoe Wish they had more colors I d buy them all 
The black pair wonderful I bought these in black and I am absolutely enamored with them They feel oh so comfortable and are much more attractive in person Great pair of sensible shoes 
Wonderful Night Gown I bought this for my wife as a gift and she loves it It is soooo comfortable Why do girls always get the soft and comfortable night wear and us boys get stuck with flannel HA Thanks 
excellent windbreaker This inexpensive windbreaker is attractive and does the job My only minor issue was that there was a little too much fabric around the zipper so care must be taken in zipping and unzipping 
very comfortable Let me tell you i purchase alot of underwear and these right now are one of my favorites They are so comfortable and i love the material I will be purchasing more in the future for sure 
These are HOT and pretty comfortable too These shoes are super cool and pretty comfortable considering their height I get compliments on them whenever I wear them I will say that I thought they were going to be a little lighter in color but I actually like that they are more khaki than natural bone I have other Naughty Monkey shoes too I m recently obsessed 
COMFY SLIPPERS I bought three pairs of these acorn slippers for Christmas presents My husband and two grown sons love them They all say these are some of the most comfortable slippers they have ever worn 
Money well spent OK these Acorn slippers won t win any beauty contests but they are extremely comfortable and durable I work out of my home and contentedly shuffle about in them each day for hours on end 
Unsafe at any speed The sole is high profile and well cushioned However the top material is a soft and flimsy towel like material that does not provide any lateral support for the foot With any walking pressure to the side as in turning a corner the foot is allowed to slide and fall off of the sole in a sprain your ankle sort of way I felt very at risk when I walked in them 
slippers I think they are a little pricy but will to pay for a good product fit well very comfortable but the sidewall of the shoe could be strong so you could slip them on without bending overto get your heal in but overall a good product 
Ahhhh at last a pair of cozy slippers There are four sound reasons for considering these Acorn Textured Moc Slippers 1 They are reasonably priced 2 They are among the most comfortable slippers I ve ever worn 3 These slippers have a lot of give to the material so they ll accommodate a variety of foot widths 4 The basic checkered design is casually stylish Above all I doubt that you ll find a more comfortable slipper for the price 
Comfortable Cozy and Casual There is no reason to buy over priced fancy schmansy slippers when you re sitting in your favorite recliner watching your favorite television show These are the perfect slippers to complement your comfort They keep your feet warm and provide a soft cushion sole for those moments when you have to get up and refill your drink or get more snacks from the fridge I love my Acorn Men s Textured Moc Slipper with blue checkers and you will too I promise you won t be disappointed But be careful they are just the right size for your dog to sink his teeth into 
Nice bags to work with I made pockets and sewed them on and I embroidered designs on the pockets and on the bags The fabric is easy to work with and the bags are great for reusable shopping bags or taking stuff to the gym or the beach I d buy them again The shipping was kind of high and I was charged for each bag even though they all came from the same manufacturer 
Canvas tote bags I purchased several of these types of tote bags from Bagedge They re strong enough for every day for light weight items Of course the bags look bigger in the picture than in person 
Poor quality fabric POLYESTER and cotton They looked sharp when I first wore them After wearing these 5 6 times they re wearing out This is the first pair of pants that has developed obvious wear and a hole where my wallet sits They look and feel like something you d buy at Wally World The only description is saw in the original description was Cotton and Microfiber Now I m glad to see that they ve added the word POLYESTER They seem to be made of perhaps 90 polyester and 10 cotton I ve always had good luck with other merchandise from Jos Bank Maybe next time I ll try a more expensive pair of slacks 
Good product Very good material in construction of these pants Good fit good looks good price 
A Great Little Boot I love these boots so much I bought them in every color and leather type available They are very comfortable yet stylish enough to wear with dresses and skirts I hate pointed toe shoes and was worried that these might prove too narrow but the toe area is only gently pointed so they feel and fit fine Also I have a fairly wide foot and typically wear clogs with socks but these again worked well for me The leather is soft and I assume will give a little over time which just means a slightly thicker sock from my huge stash Also there is minimal padding so a sock helps with cushioning Sometimes I unfold the flap to make the boots a bit taller I only wish they had a version that truly came to just below the knee I d buy that in every color too 
Great just love them I love these boots They are comfortable and perfect for Chicago winters 
these boots are made for walkin These boots are very comfortable they look good too 
Amazing My shoes came promptly and in good condition I love wearing them and they looked even better then I thought they would 
Cotton comfortable and sexy For everyday wear with a little hint of fishnet but the comfort of cotton They recommend 4 10 4 8 is probably best I have both the black and the white and can t believe the price 
fun funky Keep warm dry in wet weather with these unique boots that everyone will notice 
UBER FUN i cannot wear these boots in public for more than five minutes without compliments flying my way many people think they are hand painted i bought them because i harassed a woman on the subway about where she got hers i was obsessed i searched everywhere before finding them on amazon they are very comfortable roomy and i will have them forever rain boots never go out of style enjoy 
Very stylish I bought this dress and my wife loves it The dress looks very stylish and can be accesorized so it can be dressed up or down On a cooler day you may want to wear a turtleck and hosiery with it It is kind of short so wearers should keep that it mind Overall it is a nice looking good value dress 
Easy to Fill Easy to Carry I love my new CalPak messenger briefcase I have been carrying it for three weeks now and it is wonderful Lots of space to carry things convenient with holes for pens and little pockets for all your other necessities It could use an area for bottle water but other then that I highly recommend it 
AWESOME bag Plenty of room and made very well A++++ Perfect bag for our needs Made very well and will last a long time Nice bag for an excellent price 
CalPak Soft Briefcase It s a great everyday bag well constructed and durable It s not made for laptops but it never claimed to be I can stuff plenty of items within the bag without any worry that it will split at the seams 
It s good but not perfect You d be surprised about how much this bag holds The only problem is that it s big enough fora laptop but doesn t offer any protection for it It s also hard to move through crowds with it sometimes 
Cal Pak Bag I love the bag but it s bigger than what I had anticipated Still it is durable and waterproof I got caught in a snowstorm and nothing inside got wet 
Love this product Comfortable and seamless All around good product especially if you need a good lift 
great these are wonderful shorts great compression and fit they look and fit the same wash after wash and are so comfortable that I will probably order more pairs 
My favorite of my leotards The Bloch leotard is by far my favorite of my collection of different brand and style leotards It is soft and stretchy and breathable This leotard and any of Bloch s cotton blend leotards are favorable and more forgiving to larger chested girls It is the only leotard I ve found yet that doesn t push one s endowments down toward the ground but instead keeps them close to the ribs It was a good purchase and I m glad I have it 
roomy and practical I purchased this toiletry case for my son s year abroad He needed something larger than the usual kit and this was perfect it is large enough for shaving cream and lots of other needed items is washable and folds flat when not in use 
Tilley s Travel Socks True Test I just returned from two weeks of birding in Brazil We hiked for miles each day and the Tilley s Travel Socks were very comfortable in the hot tropical locations as well as in the cooler mountain regions I took three pair with me as well as some regular socks just in case I did not like the new Tilley s Travel Socks From now on I can save on packing space and weight by just taking the Tilley s Travel Socks 
Very good socks I took the socks to Paris for a recent trip I was pleased with the comfort of the socks as well as the ability to dry relatively quickly 
Nice Cap This was purchased as a gift for one of our grandson s he was very happy with it Priced right 
Good Value I just received 2 and am going for more Love the fit much truer to size as jcrew and personally do not mind the shorter rise 
You Ordered a Kids s Sized Medium About the red flag reviewer This person ordered a children s sized sweater I ordered this same sweater properly for my 8 year old daughter and it fits accordingly Liz Claibourne makes a great product for the price they are pretty much true to size It is VERY IMPORTANT to pay attention to whether you are ordering children s clothing or adult clothing Give me a break It s no wonder it didn t fit 
basic euro thong I found the european back basically a y shape to take some getting used to but all in all this is a decent thong The 100 cotton is quite comfortable This and the adequate waist band makes for decent comfort and moveability 
Aesthetically challenged The 2 x ist has reasonable support and comfort but most thongs do so that s nothing special What s not reasonable is its appearance With its non colors black white gray and jock like look this is one seriously dull undie Considering one of the major perks of wearing a thong compared with lesser styles is how good it makes you look this shortcoming is inexcusable Even my girlfriend concedes that although better looking than boxers or briefs neither of which I wear these are clearly below par for the style There are plenty of alternatives that are more elegant and stylish On Amazon alone there s the Contour Pocket Thong Extreme Thong Glossy Thong Microfiber Contour Thong Microfiber Low rise Thong Skinz Thong and String Thong Amazon even sells some excellent full backs Contour Italian Cutaway Bikini Microfiber Clip Bikini Silk Extreme Brief and String Tricot Brief Thongs are clearly the best style but there s nothing wrong with having a bit of variety in your underwear drawer So in summary Feel C Look F Overall D 
Run forever I love this product Just like the T4 which were discontinued Good response when running 
SEXY FOR SHY This item makes you feel sexy even if you are shy and or not feel so confortable with your body It make you feel dress and undress at the same time I love it because I dont need to take it off at all avoiding the sensation of been naked With this you can enjoy been with your partner having amazing s x 
Best of both world product If you really follow the direction how to wash it then should not be a question I promptly remove it from the dryer or hang dry It dries out very fast and does the job it promises those who can t dance should not dance at all 
Sexy But Poorly Made Okay I admit it I bought this shirt because I thought it was sexy and it is But the labeling peels off after only one wash Who is going to hand wash a workout shirt Looks good if you are extremely buffed 
Necesitas estar pompiado para usarla Solo es recomendable para personas que tiene un abdomen normal 
pretty These are a very pretty pair of shoes and also comfortable They go with practically anything The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because i did find them a little bit narrow 
these run small This shoe is so cute I love the shoe and the style but the shoes run a little small so I would recommend that you get a size or half size larger just in case 
Classy and Casual These are really great shoes They look absolutely adorable with A line type skirts and dresses especially if you are going for the vintage look Also very cute with capris I would suggest tying them while standing and also keeping the ties closer to your ankle I originally tied them up while sitting and when I stood up it slipped down to my ankle anyway 
Good Really nice shoe but if your feet is a little wider at the front then you should think about getting a larger size I normally wear a 6 5M but I had to get a 7 5M because it s a little too narrow at the front I could wear the 6 5 but it would have been really uncomfortable tight 
my summer with tommy Great shoes although some people wrote that they got a slightly bigger size then usueal i found it to be unnecessary use your regular size when ordering the shoes are relatively comfortable as far as high heels go I usually wear flats and I have no trouble walking in these at all The color is exactly as picture describes A great addition to any summer wardrobe 
The best espadrilles ever I m very happy with these pair that I bought I got the dark brown sandals to pair with my skirts jeans and capris and it really compliments my outfit I love it very comfortable and not too high So go ahead don t think twice get yourself one now You won t be sorry Promise 
Cute Shoes These Tommy espadrilles are the cutest shoes I bought all summer I get so many compliments on them They go with everything You can t go wrong with them I am between size 6 6 5 and I ordered 6 5 and they fit perfect 
Mullti Taskers These shoes do EVERYTHING They are the perfect dress shoe but just casual enough to wear with jeans If you want to be classy the ivory and dark brown are great colors If you want to be girly the cotton candy does that for you Or if you want to be funky the blue ithiga is perfect I love it 
good wrapping paper for the price This wrapping paper is good and it s unique I m glad I found it 
Hard to get very wide pants Dunno what I fed to my kid but very hard to get pants in this size He wears them so that s great 
Happy with Tanks These tanks are very cute Infact I am going to be ordering more for my little guy for the summer 
Forces Ankles to turn in I am glad I listened to the reviewer that mentioned the Ankle Pain I thought these shoes were very cute and exactly what I needed for my trip to Florida They are indeed very cute on but run a half size large so buy a half size down I ended up returning them because I wore them around the house and noticed my ankles were being forced to bend inwards The size was correct but the shoe is built to angle inward I didn t wear them long enough to have pain but it definitely was getting uncomfortable The other annoying thing was the straps wouldn t stay shut the velcro kept releasing I was constantly re fastening them just the short time I wore them The style is perfect I hope Skechers tweaks this model to fix what is wrong I ended up buying the Skechers Bikers Tailgater runs true to size which is similar but has a better velcro strap and have suede inserts where the mesh ones are on the Sightseers I would have preferred the mesh given I was buying them for Florida 
Finally the perfect shoe I purchased this shoe at a retail store before just now finding it on Amazon for less of course Buy this shoe It is the most perfect shoe It has the graceful look of a ballet slipper the comfort of walking barefoot and the active sole of a tennis shoe The velcro makes it easy on and off so it is great for the active mom I wish I could get it in every color but the pink is just too fun And it actually looks good with whatever color I m wearing it s just that cute of a shoe Enjoy 
Great shoe Very comfortable casual shoe I stress casual because there is no support Love the mesh ventilation Keeps feet cool Easy on and off Toss them in the washer when needs cleaning Every time I wear them someone stops me and compliments my shoes and wants to know where to get them 
Comfortable and Cute I m buying a second pair of these in a different color They re really cute far dressier than tennis shoes and extremely comfortable Perfect to wear with broom skirts slacks and jeans They seem to run a little large so I d suggest you go down a half size from your normal shoe size 
good fit good price Skecher s shoes have always provided a good fit for me since I am between a size 11 5 and 12 most shoes don r really feel good on my feet THe fit that these shoes provide is perfect for my feet These shoes are great for work since I tend to walk around a lot during the day at a high school and they look good 
very good great looking tought shoes not quiet as good looking in the flesh as they are in photos but good none the less 
Nice looking shoe This is nice looking comfortable and true shoe size as mentioned I am happy with this purchase 
Very handsome shoes My husband fell in love with these shoes but couldn t find this exact color in his size in other stores When I finally found them on Amazon for such a great price we snatched them up immediately These shoes are very nice and also very comfortable They look good with almost anything you can dress them up or down and look fashionable My husband is very picky with his shoes and comfort is a must for him If you have a hard time finding shoes that fit your style and comfort these may be the ones for you 
Looks can be deceiving When I received the product I freaked out because it seemed really small but I decided to try it on anyways As it turns out Poof makes their tops with a kind of slenderizing cotton spandex blend that is very flattering kind of like jersey material The shirt is well made and I will be ordering this in a few more colors Grab these while you can girls This is way better than what you will find in the mall 
Cute I bought this one in red and it s so cute It does run small though I m a size 1 and it was tight I had to cut the edges up top It looks so cute and my fiance thought it was very sexy It s form fitting so if you aren t skinny this top isn t for you 
Cool Comfy I bought these for walking not running They are very comfortable and offer very good support Good air flow for cool feet They look nice too The clincher was that they come in a wide size for my wide feet 
Great running shoes FOR ME But I had better At first I thought it was dumb to review my running sneakers but I chose to share my experiance I hope someone finds it helpful If your new to jogging or long distance running do not place your faith in these reviews Everybody has a different feel If your interested in any type of cardio that involves running go to a foot doctor and find out the type of feet you have The doctor will give you a list of the type of running shoes you can wear If your wearing the wrong shoe your feet is going to tell you because after about a week maybe your going to have pains in your feet ankles and back I know this through trial and error I have spent hundreds trying to find the best shoe In my opinion the dumbest thing anyone can do is buy running shoes online This is not like buying a movie go to the store and try on your shoe That way you can leave happy 
terrific running shoes I am what most runners call a Clydesdale tipping the scales north of 230 pounds As a result my feet and joints take a real pounding no pun intended I run on tar no concrete wooded paths dirt and occaisionally a treadmill and I have found that these shoes are ideal for me I have mixed wearing Asics GT 2000 series shoes with various Nike New Balance saucony reebok and other stability oriented trainers for more than 20 years and the GT 2000 series in unsurpassed in my view While I have a tendency towards plantars fascitis I have never experienced any bouts while wearing the Asics shoes I also prefer the firmer feel of the Asics to some of the Nike Air shoes I have used in the past as you can see I am sold on these shoes But make sure you try a pair on before you order them I believe the reason they are so good for me is that they fit my feet well I have a wide forefoot and narrow heels They may not work for you if not I would suggest you try some new balance as they come in various widths and to me have a similar feel to these Good luc 
Great Running Shoe Great shoe for my milage I recently had my step analyzed by computer to make sure I was using the correct shoe as I prepared for a half marathon I wanted two things Comfort and Stability to protect my ankles I tried out at least 7 different shoes The Asics GT 2110 felt the most natural in terms of the amount of give it had during each step Many others had more cushion but they felt too stiff as I launched off my toes Previously I d run in the 2100 shoe and just for the record I was very willing change brands In fact I was willing to spend a lot more money to protect my knees and ankles Turns out it wasn t necessary I m running 5 11 miles per day both on a tred mill and the road and in both conditions I m pleased with the shoe I have gotten a blister in the same place with both the 2100 and 2110 just forward of my right arch so I m guessing it s my foot not the shoe The 2100 was giving me blisters on my toes but after going up one size when I bought the 2110 s that was resolved After a recent bad sprain don t run in the dark I ve been using a bulky ankle brace Even with the brace the shoe has been very accomodating I ve run in wet conditions a few times and they haven t gotten too soggy but I ve yet to find a shoe that feels great in the rain 
flexees I have purchased several flexees products following a tummy tuck They wash well and are comfortable The only problem with this product is it is pretty long I have a long torso and this was longer I would buy it again though as it is well made and does the job 
Little Slice of heavan They fit like a glove and are extremely warm and comfortable They were fairly quick to get here I reccomend them highly 
High Sierra Drop Bottom Wheeled Duffle Got this duffle for our son who wanted a bag that he could get everything in while travelling the country It s perfect and had so many features that we were astounded The quality was excellent and the drop bottom compartment accomodated his sleeping bag and sleeping pad Very happy 
Great value especially if can get for less than 100 I purchased last years model of the AT202 not as pretty but the same functionally and took it on my trip to Peru for 4 weeks The bag is huge and it is well separated so you can divide your things exceptionally well It can be wheeled carried with top handles or hefted on your back I put the bag heavily loaded on my back and carried it for about 3 blocks in Cusco While it wasn t the most comfortable carry it allowed me to move faster and more easily The one thing I was concerned with the older bag were the zippers At one point the teeth were not meshing on either the top or bottom sections and I was worried they were ruined But I simply ran both the zippers to the same end using small force and the teeth seemed to be fixed I really love this bag and will use it often for all my travels so the potential zipper problem is the only thing I can mention I highly recommend the bag 
hanes underware Above average for Underware can t find locally so this is the place to get it 
Naturalizer women s Janet pump These shoes look dressy enough for business wear but are extremely comfortable and easy to wear 
Just what I expected Comfortable classic and true to size I am happy with this purchase 
more good panties In my last order I bought both Ravissant and Lace Nouveau panties so have had a good chance to compare both As a fan of retro 50 s lingerie I love them both They both have the same silky material that feels so slinky but the Ravissant are not as sheer as the LN Ravissants are more plain jane quotidienne undies than the L N however I like to dress them up by wearing lace top stockings or even better a lacey garter belt under the panties as they are still sheer enough to be revealing One small point is the sizing I usually wear a size small in panties and the size 5 are a generous fit more like a medium I like snug fitting panties but not everyone does Same great bargain as the LN and I wouldn t hesitate to try more vanity Fair lingerie 
Town or Country High Quality Midweight Fleece This is a very high quality product well made looks great in town and performs well on the trail 
Good for the price The retail price listed on the tag 88 is a fantasy price These pants are not lined a fact more noticeable given the thinness of the fabric But they fit well They are not as ridiculously generously cut for the size as some of the newer Jones of New York and Lauren by Ralph Lauren stuff size is just a number but it is supposed to convery some consistency that is completely missing from the new clothing marketing framework These pants are well worth Amazon s selling price 17 but not the list price 
Warm Fingers in Glacier Bay Alaska Living in Southern California there s not much need for gloves But a recent cruist to Alaska made it necessary to find some Couldn t find any in the stores in San Diego in August go figure so I ordered these from Amazon They did exactly what I wanted them to do keep my fingers warm in Glacier Bay Alaska I bought pairs for all the other women traveling in our group Everyone loved them and they are tucked away safe and sound for the next trip to cold weather country 
Can t beat it I purchased this jacket at a discount store for 80 I got the sleeve caught on a sharp object and tore a hole in it I loved that jacket and went all over store hopping by car and foot but couldn t find another one in my size and in black I took a shot at looking for it online Wow there it was on Amazon for 25 The exact jacket I love it The shipping was so fast The jacket is great quality and fits well I get so many compitments on it even from my 18 year old daughter 
gallery women s emboidered quilt jacket I ordered the black first and then the wheat This identical jacket is over 100 at my local mall I ordered a small and it fits perfect You could dress this jacket up or down especially the black one It is well constructed looks expensive and is a medium weight but not at all bulky A very classy jacket I am very happy with my purchase 
Very nice I live in California and bought this jacket for a trip to the midwest in the middle of the last big snow storm I really don t know what I would have done without this jacket It s not big or bulky at all and it kept me warm and dry I really love it very cute 
Love this jacket but I don t like the fact that the side clips are not adjustable Overal the jacket is wonderful great to the touch and warm enough for NH weather most of the time 
Fabulous Jacket Looks good with jeans looks great with dress pants This is a great wardrobe piece Lots of style 
ships slow These have a nice fit They are low cut and fairly flattering I got the red ones and I would say they re of good quality However if you re in a hurry good luck It took awhile for them notify the carrier for pickup Then it was another couple of days before they actually got out They got to me shortly after that 
Tsubo boots are great This is my second pair of Tsubo boots and I love them I completely loved my first pair but unfortunately left them in a hotel room in Atlanta I was devastated when I realized what I did I recommend these boots to all 
Eye Catching Canopy We are very happy with the gazebo and will be excited to use this next football season Unfortunately the cover came with some stitching missing and we have not been able to receive any response from Amazon after sending 4 emails We do not want to send the entire order back for another because the cost of shipping would be more than the cost to have someone repair the stitching We have only asked that our repair cost be covered by the company but we can not get anyone to respond We will never order anything through Amazon again 
Nice This is a nice gazebo It s not the cheap 50 job that breaks the first time you try to use it Consists of three pieces 1 the frame that folds out like a huge accordian deal 2 the nylon like tent fabric top that fits snugly on with velcro straps 3 the case Takes maybe five minutes to set up if you re slow Has three height settings and you can stake it into the ground too if you are on grass It has feet that enable it to be fastened to a wood deck too if necessary Comes with a nice black case with wheels and easy to carry handles It s a little difficult to get the fabric folded up and packed into the case though Other than that it s perfect It s a buy 
Love it Love it Love it Love it Every football fan should have one It is perfect for tailgating This is the only site I could find it Great price and the free shipping is a great deal It also shipped really fast faster then it had originally said 
Staples Lands End s turtleneck sweaters and mock turtlenecks with long and short sleeves have been staples in my wardrobe for almost ten years now I own them in multiple colors and they look as nicely with dress suits I wear at the office as with jeans and leisure wear In addition they are virtually indestructible few other garments I own survive laundry this well no matter how often I wash them they don t fade thin out or shrink They re first rate quality and at a bargain price to boot 
Great Look Great Fit Great Value Land s End Turtlenecks are world famous and rightly so They fit as promised and last many years The choice of colors are plentiful and very fashionable Buy at least one for yourself and every one in your family every year 
World s Best Turtleneck Buy these in quantity every year because they re soft warm and top quality They don t shrink and wear like iron 
full disclosure in advertising Wool and Nylon Blend It is impossible to be a responsible consumer if you do not know what you are buying My poor review is based on this In my opinion technology has yet to replace the abilities of natural materials like wool and silk Of course this is only my opinion and preference However when manufactures refuse to inform and the buyer with more than Wool and Nylon Blend there is no mechanism to a consumer to make an informed choice or even purchase what they are looking for Stretch nylon is certainly nice for form fit and ease when it comes to slipping your foot onto your sock and into your boot BUT if too much nylon is present it will show its downside should the hiker or hunter find themselves in a wet situation and hiking for long periods It would seem that the age of the 100 wool sock is almost gone and I accept my fate but I urge people to NOT buy a sock which does not disclose the details of its manufacture The review reflects on full disclosure in advertising and not the product itself Should Amazon find it inappropriate then a deletion is understandable 
Socks for cold feet These soacks a superior and are excellent craftmanship For the hunter they are a requirement 
Absolutely the best pants I own and hands down the BEST yoga pants These are extremely soft and comfortable they fit true to their size chart form fitting but not tight and work perfectly in a Yoga class What else are they good for Sleeping lounging hanging around outside and on and on They also work layered under a short skirt or shorts or loose flannel plaid pants for an updated 90 s grunge look ^ And no matter how you wear them they look HOT Overall these are an extremely versatile article of clothing useful and comfortable reasonably priced and made here in America FINALLY really American made wear by workers who earn a living wage I highly recommend them 
On the go shoes I love these shoes I ordered this pair and Delectable and they are both great They re both comfortable easy to wear shoes for people who really need to be on their feet a lot I like that the insoles are padded and molded and not just flat This pair goes really nicely with jeans They are a little more dressy and are a nice mix between comfort and looks The sizes are exactly as stated on on the sizing chart so you don t have to second guess them 
Mary Jane Such a cute and comfortable shoe feels like a sneaker but dresses up any outfit 
cool stuff These shoes are awsome My son absolutely loves them He says that they have got to be the most comfortable shoes he has ever owned well worth the price 
Most comfortable shoes I ve ever worn I just received these shoes today and here are my impressions 3 30pm The shoes arrived and I eagerly opened the box and put them on They feel quite a bit different from other shoes The sole is VERY springy The tongue is hurting my right foot and I m concerned that I am going to need to return the shoes 4 30pm I take the shoes off and it turns out that the tongue which is connected to the sides of the top of the shoe where the laces go through is not centered quite right so I fold it in place and put the shoes back on I notice a difference instantly My wife comes home from work and says I don t like the way they look but they are your shoes By 5 30 I don t care how they look because they are soooo comfortable The soft leather uppers seems to fit the foot perfectly and the soft sole is still really springy The combination of these two is magnificent By 7pm I love these shoes so much that I am sitting at the computer writing a review at amazon I generally wear birkenstock and Dr Marten shoes so I have spoiled my feet It is a fantastice surprise to get these shoes and find that they are even MORE comfortable than the Docs or the Birks I just ordered a pair of the Desert treks 
The Only Shoe I Wear I am 67 years old and have worn these type of shoes most of my life I started with Hush Puppies and then switched to Wallabees when they first came out There is a place where you can have them resoled if you wish Wallabees are highly recommended by me but of course they are not for everyone 
Men s Wallabee Boot I purchased the Black Wallabee Boots for my son for Christmas He had a pair of the tan ones but they don t sell them anywhere close to my home He s in college in another town I found them on Amazon less expensive than what he paid for them in the store The black ones are sharp He loves them and said they are very comfortable I will keep my eye on any Wallabee Boot sales when he likes a shoe it s a big deal Thank you Sand 
A Classic for good reason Can t beat these shoes for comfort and durability and the funky classic good looks still appeal after many years these were purchased at the insistence of my extremely fashion conscious 13 year old son Should I tell him Dad I wore Clark s Treks in college 
Great shoe This is a great comfortable pair of shoes My son loves them and wears nothing else 
Highly recommend My son loves these shoes He claims they are the most comfortable pair he s ever worn The brown oily leather is a great look Please know that these shoes run a little larger than most ex Size 10 in these shoes is equivalent to an 11 in others 
Good shorts for price I got the maroon shorts I think it is a good price for what we got The material is a little thin which you can see in the product picture 
Everything was perfect I bought 8 shorts 4 Blacks and 4 Blues in the same order and they are perfect The description and high quality of the shorts the fast shippment a delivery are completly succesfull I m very glad 
Satisfy It woul be good if I could purchase two shorts of different colors on the same orde 
Great Product I recently bought this item in beige color and the zero wasteband feels amazing I mean there was no rolling and the color match my skintone Looks great in boots or any shoes Also with parties weddings etc my boyfriend gives me compliments on my legs 
No waistband is a dream With no waistband there is still a feeling of control but no waistband wedging into your waist and creating a roll of flesh above it 
I like them Great shorts nothing too technical or fancy but do the job Tight on the hips for a large size but once on they fit really well and are very comfortable 
A major difference in riding comfort I ve been cycling with the Performance Canyon Mountain Shorts for three months and they work great They re very high quality shorts and comfortable to wear The Liquicell padding makes a major difference in riding comfort It s eliminated that tingly numb feeling that made my riding so uncomfortable I highly recommend these shorts and they re a great value 
Lovely pair of shoes I bought the boysenberry 7 5M and I am loving it It is comfortable stylish and simply lovely The boysenberry is a beautiful rich colour My only disappointment is that it is not a higher heel and not leather However I still love it 
great flashy shoes This item is beautiful The company is great I received many compliments on these shoes 
Leia Shoes I like these shoes The were comfortable Made of good material Stylish and wonderful design I got alot of compliments on them I would buy this brand again 
Buy Them You Need Them It s unbelievable that you don t get these for free with the Zen But that aside buy these now You re going to want them right away to protect the screen And the other reviewer is right about putting them on If you re not careful when you re squeezing out the bubbles with your nails you can scratch the protector screen you just applied So try to be careful 
Just what I ordered I love these khakis I have worn them for years and suddenly they have disappeared from the stores When I found them on the web I ordered them immediately They fit perfectly and are just as I remembered them to be 
Nice Slippers I have been wearing the slippers for about a month now and find them very comfortable They appear to be well made and for the price I don t think you could do better Lowell Huf 
Extra Nice Slippers Sorry for being lazy but these slippers are very well made and extraordinarily comfortable I ve had several pairs of what were meant to be high quality slippers in the past and they did not compare to these You would not regret purchasing these 
Fantastic Value and Comfort Thank goodness I followed previous Amazon reviews which encouraged me to buy these slippers The only unknown is durability but they seem very well put together and are very comfortable sturdy You won t be disappointed 
Excellent product even BETTER service The ad said it would ship within 3 4 days and I would receive it in 7 10 days after shipment Then I recieved an email telling me it was scheduled to ship on February 12 14 10 to 14 days after the order I RECEIVED the items in perfect shape on the fourth day after placing my order What a wonderful surprise Thank you It is the first time I ever found a pair of footwear even close to my size online and I m well pleased I love them 
EXCELLENT SLIPPERS I purchased these slippers for my husband as a gift He just loves them I bought a 13EEE he normally wears a medium and hoped these would fit they did perfectly He likes the idea he can go outside with slippers and they are very sturdy and well made A great slipper you can t go wrong if you purchase these I will buy them again when this pair wears out 
Superior quality This is a great slipper at such an excellent price It is well made and extremely comfortable So versatile that it can be worn outdoors as well indoors The wuality is outstanding 
High quality for reasonable price Was pleased at the quality and comfort according to my husband of these slippers Would recommend these slippers 
L B Evans Men s Yukon Boa Slipper 9EEE These are terrific slippers well made warm and comfortable The size runs a little narrow if you normally wear D or medium these will fit just fine 
bnabrat EEE s are hard to find in slippers Bought these and my husband loves them 
great find i bought these for my boyfriend for christmas and he s been wearing them non stop since then they are well made and very comfortable 
Nice comfortable shoe I am very happy with these shoes and would only add that they seem to run true to size I purchased a size 8 and it is a little loose for me in the heel I range between a 7 1 2 and 8 medium as a rule 
Great product My son is thrilled with his Tiki Barber replica jersey I was sure it would make a great Christmas gift and I was not disappointed 
Very Pleased I ordered this for my son s birthday It came very fast and was exactly what he wanted We are both very happy with the service and the jersey 
WOW This products does exactly what it says I am very impressed by this garment it does work It does take getting use to wearing it I how recommend you dont go to small But if you want to look like your thinner alot thinner it hold everything in 
The best pants I ever wore After my first purchase of these jeans I had to order another 2 pair because they are the only pants I will ware now These jeans are extremely confortable in every way and the do not get cought under a boot heel like most other pants I HIGHLY recommend these jeans to anyone 
What s not to like Smooth to skin but has static in the dry weather Overall good product and great price what s not to like 
Naturalizer Women s Canary Ankle Strap Sandal Is A Winner Very confortable and stylish The multi colored shoe is sometimes hard to coordinate with clothes but its degree of comfort makes it a winning shoe 
Good support soft Happy with this item The support is good material used in this product is nice and soft Overall a comfortable feeling 
Very soft and perfect for baby s skin I bought this rather skeptically online but turned out that these mittens and other products from this company are extremely soft and don t fade or shrink after washes I d highly recommend these for your baby s tender hands 
Amazing Fit Being a larger breasted woman it is hard to find a bra that fits and feels great this one does both I hardly feel it at all while I am wearing it The lift and support are amazing and is virtually invisible under tshirts I highly recommend the Bali Live It Up to all women 
A fine compact leather companion This is a compact traveling case Compact doesn t mean tiny It is probably one of the smaller of the name brand standard size ones I ve seen Kenneth Cole Perry Ellis Swiss Army Nautica etc but it is not a different size category Just a different shape slightly less deep yet has a nice solid broad base the bottom is of a solid material which doesn t collapse It is definitely big enough for the average man s toiletries I like it It also doesn t have a lot of inside pockets There is just one wallet sized pouch inside which doesn t have its own zipper Not a mesh I m not sure what it s big enough for floss and lip balm The rest of the inside is open and free It has a water proof lining and a wire with flaps to open the compartment wide essential in a toiletries bag really Well crafted from what I can tell The outside is a very handsome patterned leather It looks aged without looking worn It also smells of leather out of the box so much nicer than the faux leather travel kits You won t mind having your clothes rub against it in your luggage I have a slight quibble with the handle it is not as easy to grab as in most kits It s more of a loop than a handle So those are the cons not a lot of compartments inside not huge Pros leather opens very wide looks good durable 
Large size sandals They are sturdy fashionable and run true to size The price was very reasonable and I m very pleased with my purchas 
Perfect Website was easy to use Product illustration was accurate Received order in no time at all Price was better than I expected 
I feel so PRETTY My boyfriend is now the prettiest man in town Who knew pink was his colour 
Fun sexy super soft underwear I originally purchased these for the cut and color But after wearing them several times I ve come to appreciate how comfortable and sexy this thong is The silk is shiny and smooth without being too delicate My only concern is that the pouch shape is a little off often requiring adjustments for comfort Still a worthy product at a decent price 
Birkenstock Arizona Suede with Soft Footbed Product sent in timely manner in excellent condition Very happy with the product A regular customer 
A+ Comfort I bought these for my mom who has always complained of uncomfortable shoes especially ones with heels She loved wearing them in the summer 
sketchers flirt These shoes feel just like wearing a pair of slippers They are the most comfortable shoes i own 
Very pleased I bought these for my wife she has beautiful feet She noticed them in a add and I surprized her with them Simple things keep me a Happy guy Thanks Scott With Hor 
Great Quality Excellent quality made in Italy But the size Mediums seemed a little snug Hope they stretch out width wise 
501 fit without the hassle of buttons Although the Levi s 505 jean is usually referred to as the zipper version of the classic button fly 501 the Levi s 512 model seems closer to me If you are looking for the 501 fit without the hassle of buttons this may be the way to go The 505 is rather full in the seat and crotch technically the rise and can look pretty baggy Though described as a slim fit the 512 is more of a moderate fit snug but not formfitting much like the handsome 501 Rather than slim fit it really should be described as the 512 tapered leg because it has a pretty strong taper to the ankle which means it will not fit over boots unlike the 505 and the 501 The only real downside of this jean is that comes in only one finish a rather milquetoast medium stonewash Over time however it breaks in pretty nicely and looks good 
Pretty scarf nice packing I ordered ombre blue aqua colored scarf The color is darker than in the picture but still looks very attractive It is thin and papery but I believe thats how pashmina silk should be It feels warm when you wear it Shipping was fast and customer service is good May be slightly pricy with shipping but you won t find this deal at any other website I placed an order for two more 
Good for concealment that require low profile Best for outdoor activity investigator press and concealed gun carry or accessories that require low profile Wish the price was little cheaper but couldn t be better 
I am not law enforcement or military But i expected a lot less for the price All the pockets and clips and everything is really cool and it even has a two way zipper While im wearing this thing I feel like i am ready to defend freedom EXCELLENT SHIPPING SPEED 
A Great Casual Shoe This is undoughtably the best and most comfortable shoe I have ever owned They comform to your feet readily and wear like iron You ll feel like you r walking on a cloud Plus they look great and you ll be proud to wear them 
Tracker shoes This is an excellent shoe It is true to fit and looks great Note that it is also airport and nuclear plant safe for metal detectors Very comfortable and fits to your foot shape within days which is amazing compared to other shoes 
got the pants Everthing was fine I wish they could have hemmed them for me We are Cool Chuck 
unable to return shoes After ordering the shoes I realised that the carriage was almost as much as the shoes I tried but was unable to cancel the order on recieving the shoes in perfect condition they were far too small and certainly not the size stated I cannot return them as I would have to pay more again in carriage I have written to both the company and to Amazon but have not yet had a reply Due to the fact I have forgotton my password i have been unable to e mail you about this althoughI have tried on numerous occasions I hope someone may be able to hel 
Great product but where are the headphones I love these EarGrips I got them about a year ago and they ve gotten me through the coldest parts of Minnesota winters just fine My problem with the things is that there s a slot to put headphones in but I ve yet to find headphones that are small enough to fit I ve come across websites that tell me that the headphones are sold seperately but heck if you can find them anywhere Other than that a great product 
GREAT PRODUCT Wonderful product Small compact and keeps ears warm even during high wind chills 
Awesome Product I bought my first ear grip from a home improvement store I work outdoors everyday and really need to keep all exposed areas covered The Ear Grip works great Not only is it adjustable for any size head but it is worn around the back of the head so it isnt as noticeable as other options Since it is worn around the back of the head neck it also keeps your neck warm too Compared to other ear muffs I have seen the Ear Grip wont make you look like a fairy There is no fluff wild colors fur here and you are still able to hear out of them They are made with a plastic loop that is covered with fabric The loop corresponds with your ear so the hole lines up with your ear and the fabric thats covering it is more than enough to keep you warm You can also take them off in a flash and compact them with a push and turn so they will fit in any pocket I highly reccomend them 
Ear Grips Really Work I was introduced to Ear Grips over two years ago Working outside for a school at least 45 minutes a day in Iowa meant some bone chilling days and then you have to go in and face people with hat hair but not with Ear Grips They ride low behind your head and really keep your ears warm Since being introduced to them I have spread them to two other family members and several co workers Seldom do products deliver so well on what they are supposed to do but this product really does 
Comfortable but not great for circulation These are a well made comfortable sock But unfortuately the tops are a bit heavy on the elastic and if you are prone to swollen legs they cut into the calves Still a good sock and a good price 
Good product efficient order processing I wanted a travel kit that does not weigh much because the person I wanted to give it to travels a lot on carry on baggage I was very happy with the purchase Despite its light weight the travel kit looks sturdy and is lined with vinyl so it is perfect for my purposes 
Perfect little bag I purchased this bag for my husband to cart around his daily pills instead of one of those plasic medicine dispensers that make you take the pills out of the bottle on a weekly basis and it works great It also has enough room to fit some travel supplies i e comb shaving kit etc when he goes on the road I got the olive color and was very pleased to discover the color was not at all like the washed out colors shown in the picture It was more vibrant and matched better with what amazon shows you for the color pallets I m very pleased with my purchase It s perfect 
Great product at a great price Fast shipping too Great product at a great price Fast shipping too 
This is a really great scent Whether you are a Britney Spears fan or not if you are a fan of light feminine scents you might want to check out Britney Spears Curious I notice the name Elizabeth Arden on the credits on the box so if you have worn Elizabeth Arden fragrances before you might like curious It smells really good When you first spray it and smell it it seems strong but once it completly dries it s a sweet lasting smelling scent I am totally pleased and the price is just right The bottle is very unique and stands out among my other scents on my dresser 
Nice shoes Very nice shoes look good and feel great Arrived in a good amount of time 
A little short The quality of the tights is great but they are a little short for someone 6 0 and 173 lb 
I look funky shoes I like different shoes and I like to match my shoes with everything that I wear I purchase these without knowing what I was going to wear them with but when I got them I was pleasantly surprised with the diverse colours in them They are also very comfortable for casual dress 
Quick and fast transaction Great shoes and great deal I am very happy with my purchase Thank you 
confy THESE SHOES ARE EXTREMELY CONFORTABLE and CARRY A TRUE SIZE MINE ARE GREEN AND ONE OF THEM IS NOT DIED PROPERLY IS MUCH LIGHTER THAN THE OTHER BUT NEVERTHELESS I WOULD BUY THEM IN ALL COLORS IF THEY WERE MADE VERY HAPPY WITH THE 
Perfect training bra This is a great little training bra I have looked all over and on the internet as well This is a Bestform product and has the best price of just 6 99 each It s exactly what I expected in a traingin bra This is for a 7 year old Most places wanted closer to 20 for a training bra as they called it a sports bra I love doing business with Bealls always a great merchant 
Really Short These shorts are nicely made of a good fabric for practicing yoga However they are extremely short I opted to trade them in for the somewhat longer version These work great and are more modest Sizes seem to be a bit small so buyers might want to go to the next size up 
Yoga Shorts These are very comfortable shorts and I hardly feel as if I have them on 
Awesome yoga shorts These shorts are awesome They fit perfectly they keep me totally covered but they re short enough that I stay cool They re rad I will be ordering more pairs soon 
Great for Bikram or other active yoga I ve practiced yoga for almost a decade and these are the first shorts I ve found that perfectly suit my needs They are short enough that I don t get overly hot especially in a Bikram or Ashtanga class They are snug and I know that nothing will be revealed if I bend over They are also lined in the front and back so I feel extra protected They are also great quality and last a long time Made by a great company who puts attention into the details of their products 
Comfortable for Bikram yoga The shorts are just fine They are much more stretchy than anything else I ve tried for Bikram but not overly revealing even without undergarments They have a sort of front and back lining so you re not uh out there I like them and they kind of look like they re meant for yoga 
Most comfortable WOW I am suprised VERY comfortable Very stable shoe I love them They are very sexy I live in clogs and this one is nice and tall and most important to me they are comfotable I wear them a lot 
Very Cool Shoes These shoes are so cool especially for the price but the color on the Rust is lighter than what it appears in the photos They are pretty comfy but really really really high 
So cute I have nothing but raves about these adorable shoes They give me NO trouble at all walking and they are different I m a real shoe a holic and I love it when I can find cute comfortable shoes that aren t cookie cutters the same shoe every brand makes I have 4 different pairs of Naughty Monkey brand shoes and I love every one of them 
Shoe review I bought these shoes for a young friend of mine All I know is he says they are absolutely awesome He is twelve years old 
Very Satisfied Customer I purchased these shoes for my son s basketball season and he loves them The colors matches his uniform which looks great and they have great support and comfort Not to mention they are very reasonably priced I would definitely recommend these shoes to other mothers and sons Karen Peterso 
Jezebel Bustier What a wonderful garment It holds me in and gives me a wonderful shape but is comfortable enough to eat in It is very light but has amazing control The stays were a little too long for me I m only 5 2 but I was able to have it altered I wish it were available in black and nude 
I have them in 2 colors Love Love Love these shoes they are not nearly as green as they seem online more like brown olively color I have these shoes in black purple too they are so comfortable and perfect for so many occasions I think i prefer these brown ones now though 
Too thin The sweater is the usual high quality associated with Zegna However the material is so thin it clings to my body It was probably due to this undesirable feature that the garment had been discounted so greatly However I knew that possibility existed when I saw the sweater on your website I initially planned to return the purchase but later changed my mind When worn with a jacket the effect is good 
nice change purse The Mundi change purse is nice and I can highly reccomend it to anyone looking for one It is solidly built and can hold a nice amount of change quite a bit better than the small plastic one I replaced with it All in all a definite five star product 
Change Purse This little change purse is perfect for loose change or keeping extra credit cards to business cards that do not fit in your wallet Great space saver 
Key and change holder I ordered three of these types of items They were all fairly good but this was the best I use it everyday 
Wrangler Angler Jeans I have been wearing Wrangler Angler Jeans exclusively for the last 8+ years The fit is the best The extra pockets on the right leg come in handy to carry small tools and a pen The only reason I don t give 5 stars is the material is a little light in weight and color so they tend to look too worn out too fast But I can usually get about 18 months out of a pair The Tan ones wear longer and look good longer I am truly a fan and hope they make these for a long time to come 
Comfy and warm These are an excellent fit great material good craftsmanship Especially for the price 
Very nice very warm yet thin When I first received these a present for my 18 yr old son I was rather surprised at the trim cut of the shearling But he wore them and was very pleased He s very active outdoors and liked that they were thinner but warm offering him a better grip I wore them myself to shovel some snow once and they kept my hands nice and warm 
very nice gloves these gloves are really nice quality very soft both inside and out The suede is smooth and pliable and the shearling is not too fluffy inside but definitely enough to keep your hands warm and it feels so nice to put your hands in these I had a problem figuring out size so if it is any help my husband tried them on and he is 5 9 and wears a size large in clothing I would say his hands are medium in size a bit wide but average length of fingers and the medium glove fit perfectly I hope that helps someone who is having trouble deciding on size for me that was the hard part The gloves came tagged with an Amazon hang tag listing the regular price as 79 99 so I am not sure where the price they show comes from but still a great deal Can t comment on how warm they are since we live in Texas and these are for my father in law who lives in a cold weather state for next Christmas 
515 perfect cut for me I like the 515 cut jeans I have very long legs and some curves so I thought I d give these shorts a try I am happily surprised these are very cute but not too short for this thirtysomething and comfy to boot 
Great Product This is a great product Not only does it make a nice gift for everyone on your gift list but it also makes for nice lawn ornaments Highly recommended 
Very Cute Very Comfortable I bought these for two reasons Number one being that my son started walking very early and any shoes that my husband and I would buy him were too hard for him to walk in Like all shoes they needed to be broken in and at 9 months you arent very capable of that So with these little Uggs he can walk around in a soft comfortable shoe that isnt hard and bulky The second reason that I bought them is because they are so dang cute We get TONS of compliments on them all the time 
Great shoes for toddlers My 21 month old twins LOVE their new boots They bring them to me to put them on them all the time THey have wide feet and they have no problem getting into these They walk great in them and don t need socks The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is the soft bottom If they had the hard bottom they would get more outdoor use but with the soft bottom they can only walk to and from the car They also look ADORABLE At 39 a pair they were worth every penny 
The Fitted Cap My shopping experience was excellent I received very quick shipping and the item I received was just as I had ordered They were very helpful with my questions and very cooperative 
Cheap Head Gear Great price but I suspect most people will want to pay a little more and get a better quality cap Like another reviewer my cap also arrived a little too large I m going to try his suggestion of machine washing drying it 
Fitted Cap Black The hat fits just right material is great and the price is the best I foun 
It was a little too big I printed out their hat sizer thing and cut it out according to the directions My hat ended up being just a little too big I threw it in the washer and the dryer even though the tag said not to and it shrunk enough to fit pretty well now actually and it still looks fine 
Great product These camisoles are so comfortable and run true to size The company selling them has very fast shipping and products arrive in 2 or 3 days I highly recommend both this camisole and the company 
Bra Tank 01 These are perfect since I can no longer open close the tiny hooks on my bras partial paresthesis of arms hands I wish I could get more in more colors too 
nice and comfortable shoes I got 3 pairs of them for my father brother and boyfriend They all loved it Very classic and comfortable Also I recommended a friend to get a pair and he loves them as well Very very good purchase Clarks rocks 
Wearable Slacks The fabric in these slacks allow you to sit for hours and then stand knowing your slacks look neat and freshly pressed They wash beautifully and require little or no ironing My husband wishes all of his slacks wore this well The hidden elastic makes the slacks just as comfortable when you are sitting down or bending down as they are when you are standing Frankly I wish I could find slacks for women that were this well made especially at the price Hagaar offers Haagar has done a terrific job again 
Exactly what I was looking for This windbreaker rainjacket is exactly what my dad was looking for Lightweight no lining nice sky blue color I searched everywhere and am thrilled to have found it here 
i like great long sleeve shirt i wear mine all the time very warm and comfortable it is slim fitting so if you like your shirts looser then get a size up 
perfect fit I love this case I used to have one of the new iSkins but since the ipod wouldn t fit in my car charger FM tuner with the skin on it took forever to peel it off everytime I wanted to use it in my car This works much better for me It s easy to quickly access and remove the ipod from the case for car use but the rest of the time it s a great case to bring on trips The new ipod fits snugly in the case and the openings for the USB port and headphone jack align perfectly The magnetic closure is nice so you don t have to hear the sound of velcro ripping every time you want to open it My only complaint is that dust gets stuck between the plastic cover and the screen but from what I ve read that happens with every single case on the market except for the iSkin If you are going to be taking the ipod out of the case on a regular basis this is a great alternative to the iSkin 
Big Blue Sky Case Nice quality great design quick delivery Was very pleased with the product and enjoying it very much 
God I love these shoes I ve bought variations of this shoe in suede and leather but this little number is flat out gorgeous A low key metallic that is as comfortable as a sneaker and yet you look absolutely kewl wearing it just about anywhere The silver flat actually looks great with a gown when you re walking and don t want to destroy your feet in heels You can dance and have fun in them and look great or just put them on to drive and switch to the tottering heels when you get to the ball But I bet you won t these shoes look great anywhere I m definitely going to be investing in them in all three metallics I m already on my fourth pair of this style of Skechers and I m just praying they keep making them Best walking and looking shoe I ever owned 
Light weight comfort sharp looking too The shirt is true to the description It s lightweight fit s true to size wicks away sweat dries quickly and looks good Heads up it is so lightweight with thin fabric that the wearers undergarment can be seen through the material 
A Great Jock by Bike This is the black verson jock from the new line of Performance jocks from Bike This waistband is slightly smaller than the traditional 3 inch but very comfortable The pouch fits nice and snug and the leg straps don t twist or bind Easy to launder and pretty inexpensive I got rid of my old worn out jocks and bought a few of these new ones A good buy 
Way to go Bike WOW This jock is ten times better that their previous jocks at least by my standards The pouch is bigger softer less constricting and all around just more cofortable It has a nice modern look and feel I actually bought this at a local sports store I am very pleased and will get another one probably the white one I am actually wearing it now under my suit and can t tell I have a jock on It is that comfy Love it and highly recommend it Thanks 
BEST SNEAKERS I use these sneakers for work becuase im on my feet for 11 hours I have no pain on my feet at the end of he day I highly advise any looking for real comfort to get the Adidias Megabounce 
Very comfortable I have always been an adidas man And as usual this time too I was not disappointed Fits excellently Not too sure what to do with those spare insoles though 
Very cool If you are the kind of person who can t stand a big wallet this is for you Surprisingly you can fit a good amount in this and it is no bigger than a credit card Right now I have 6 bills 2 credit cards license and a few business cards 
Comfort and Price Russell Track Pants are terrific Cheap comfortable durable and last just about forever I prefer the ones without pockets though their tough to find in stores now so glad Amazon still had them The elastic ankles though not as fashionable are very practical for in house wear and stretching since the pants won t fall down or slip 
Russell Athletic Men s Sweat Pants The pants seem to be good quality fit well comfortable easy to wash durable reasonably priced We are very satisfied with this purchase 
Great buy Excellent buy for the money Nice quality fabric ingenious construction Great to have in the car for traveling or camping 
Excellent it protects to you totally of rain It is easy to keep and to transport It is excellent It is a great investment cost value 
Vaneli Black Pumps I purchased the Vaneli Black Patent pumps and I am thrilled with my purchase The shoes are true to size and quite comfortable 
Classy shoe This shoe looks classy and is comfortable even for someone who wears a wide width like mysel 
Finally found them After looking high and low for pointed toe navy pumps I was so glad to find these 
Good shoe but There s one major flaw with Bostonian square toes I have three pair so trust me when I say this you can t find inserts insoles for them The shoot fits snuggly and comfortably the backs don t wear out and cause pain to your heels but the insole goes flat in less than a year and you ll be donating the shoes as there s no way to find square toe inserts Bostonian says they neither make nor can suggest where to find square toe inserts 
Fast Shipping great price I saw this same jacket in a store near my house for 75 99 Fast shipping Great service Highly recommende 
It was Greatttt It fit my boyfriend perfectly and he loved it AND I got it before Christmas 
The skirt moves I bought this shirt because it looked great and we call our little bar the Tiki Lounge When it arrived I found that not only is it great looking on a tubby guy like me but the grass skirt is fringe that moves Great shirt gets lots of compliments It s thick and well made You can t go wrong 
for that fan in your family I got the NFL folding tail gate chair to enjoy those times in the park and ball field and especially at draft day for the NLF waiting on line for hours dressed in your favorite team outfit Go Vikings to show support and nothing shows it more then relaxing on line sitting in these football folding chairs in your teams color and emblem it does beat standing for hours or sitting on a cold dirty sidewalk 
wee i got and love it however someone else s product was shipped inside the box it looked like the box came open and someone just grabbed whatever they thought came in the box the product was not mine and the owners name and phone and address on it I contacted them and sent it to them myself it was suppliments for a very serioulsy ill small boy I hope all that get things for others send it to them too you never know whose life depends on it 
giant chair I think the chair is great sturdy and exactly what I was looking for in my game roo 
NFL Arm Chair I was very pleased with this chair It is well built and VERY comfortable The receiver of the gift is very happy I would biuy this again 
NFL Adult arm chair This is very portable and at the same time very sturdy Perfect for the patio or to take to grandson s soccer games 
Great product I bought this item for my boyfriend for his tailgaiting experience this year since he has season tickets He LOVES everything about it especially the fact that it is the Bears = 
Love it Thanks Amazon Product arrived before I expected it My boyfriend LOVES his Redskins chair Right now he s got it set up in his backyard this gift may haunt me I may be seeing this chair for years to come on every beach park or park outing As of now I am winning the argument that it shouldn t be used in our tv room 
Dearfoams Ballerina Slippers I love these They are so comfortable and of excellent quality 
Great winter hat I bought this hat for my son and he loves it It wears and washes well and he will get a couple more winter season out of it 
Very comfy Very comfortable great for working out at the gym These pants do run a bit small as far as addidas pants go I wish I would have gotten a size bigger 
Nano case This product is great keeps the IPOD in place when you are exercise and if it falls it doesn t hit quite as hard 
Great Product Ridiculous Shipping What a fun and stylish way to wear and protect your ipod It is just so unfortunate that the shipping on this item is 8 49 Yes you read that right Over 8 dollars for shipping And I am talking standard shipping within the United States The USPS offers a flat rate Priority Mail envelope which would be more than big enough to fit this item in for 3 85 What a fleecing these people are trying to perpetuate on us It is just like those cheap cell phones on e bay with 35 shipping charges I guess it is a matter of how desperately you want your Nano to be pink 
Best Ever This particular shoe is the best i ve ever worn With my own inserts it is very comfortable i work on my feet all day and at the end my feet still feel good I love the look feel style i just wish they came in black i actually bought two pairs and had 1 died Black and they really look good Looks like they camethat way You can wear them with Jeans as well as dress pants Either way they look grea 
Clarks Writing this review 3 weeks after the purchase wore this shoe couple of times excellent leather ofcourse its Clarks well my brother has Clarks who s been using it for the past 3 yrs its serving him real nice mine goes well with casuals i m lil uncomfortable with the size reason might be the shoe needs more time to blend in with my feet overall its a nice shoe than 
Unhappy that I did not receive this item I was very excited to get these boots they looked to be excellent quality and a great value I ordered them in plenty of time to take them on our planned weekend away They did not arrive instead I recieved some sort of excercise ball in what was suppose to be the boots I immediately contacted AMAZON because at that point I only had 3 days before my trip I asked them to please send the boots immediately because of the mistake They instead said that I had to contact FOGDOG directly I did and FOGDOG said sorry we can only send you the boots if you order pay for them again and pay for the express shipping Then return the excercise ball and get refunded for the original purchase I had to go out and buy the boots at a local store I am still waiting for the refund of the excercise ball and it has been 3 weeks After many great purchases from Amazon over the years I am now saidly disappointed This will change my Amazon purchase plans in the future 
Good Boot I like this boot It is durable warm and practical I leave them loosly tied so that I can slide my feet into them and go Good price too 
Overachiever Jacket This is a great jacket I could not find a decent lightweight nylon jacket at any store locally so I took a chance and ordered this one from Amazon Turfer It is made very well and looks and fits great I could not be happier with the jacket or Turfer 
brand new heavy duty camo pants Great fit great color used for camping for boyscouts Decent price 
This is the best g string I work as a model and this is the best for me professionally and personally Comfortable and no lines 
Great Shoes I got these shoes for my husband and he loves them They wear like tennis shoes but they look a little more dressy 
Very comfortable and rugged sole These shoes are very comfortable and have a rugged sole I use them as business casual shoes as well because they are discreet enough 
wonderful shoes Fast delivery shoes are beautiful and extremely comfortable I had bilateral foot surgery in March of 2005 and these shoes are wonderul Definately would buy from again 
My Fossil Wallet Review I bought this wallet because I had alot of things in my back pocket and was tired of digging through it all to get my id out Initially I saw the leather band around the outside and thought it looked really good so I got it It has alot of slots for cards and other things two clear slots for ids and looks just as good as it did on the computer Again it s form AND function serving it s purpose and looking good at the same time P 
Nice but a little short I ordered this shirt in a large for my husband he is not a hard to fit large This large is a bit short The seller did ship fast though 
beautiful and confortable Sexy practice confortable discrete under clothing I had a couple in 98 and I just loved them I m glad I found it again I just whish it could still have in color Champagne 
Quality Shoes I was looking for a good quality pair of shoes with leather soles Leather sole shoes are getting harder and harder to find in stores The Bostonian line of shoes at Amazon com filled the bill for me They are excellent quality at an affordable price 
well made If you want a well made sturdy camisole this is for you I personally was looking for a microfiber type product This one is not nor is it advertised to be and I find the material to be a bit on the heavy side for my taste BUT I didn t return the camisole and wear it happily nnonetheless 
great Very soft and comfy Good support Straps don t slide or cut in A bit sheer so better suited for layering or lounging Perfect for sleepwear Nice colours 
Good socks Socks are comfortable although they make my feet sweat more so than they would have On runs of 4+ miles they will really be wet feeling Sizing is like any other no show sock A large will usually fit 10 13 so if you wear an 11 like I do buy the medium socks They stretch A large size will be baggy and come high on a size 11 shoe Socks start to fuzz up if dryed with high heat use low heat and cold water to preserve Now buy em and start running Good sock 
My wife loved it but it hurt her feet the first day i bought these for my wife she loved the shoes but the first day she wore them they really hurt her feet I guess that is a normal thing with womes shoes according to her I would have given them 5 stars but the fact that they were uncomfortable the first day i gave them 
great coat Great Service from Amazon Great coat Great price Long enough to keep my husband s bottom covered and warm Medium is generously sized 
Misleading This is a very sexy outfit My one complaint is that the 3 piece set is actually two pieces the top being one while the skirt is attached to the g string This doesn t take too much away from the outfit but it would have been nice to have been given a more accurate description of the product before buying it 
sexy fits well plus comfortable fabric It looks very sexy I m a size 4 and it fits perfectly The items are elastic and I assume it could fit many sizes Besides it s fabric feels confortable Shipping is fast as well I m very happy abouth the purchase 
Very Nice Peek a Boo Look I like the peek a book look you know how you can see a hint of flesh between those stripes The G string isn t as tiny as some of the thongs out there The three bows give the piece kind of a little girl gone bad kind of look if that s the kind of fantasy you re into A real baby doll look I can t imagine a man who wouldn t go gaga over a girl who changed into this when she said she was just going to slip into something more comfortable I know when I saw this drapped over a female form I went gaga 
Sweet and Sexy I think I look really sweet and sexy in this and that s saying something because I ve never seen myself as a sweet and sexy kind of girl The opposite in fact It is really something how an outfit like this can give you a whole new opinion of yourself 
Subtly Shows of the G String to Your Man s Eyes You just have to love an outfit like this It says sexy without giving away the store to your man s eyes He s gotta look keep those eyes glued on you to see what you know he wants to see And I really love the pink trim the way you can get hints of it showing off the G string through those see through stripes 
You Don t Have to Show it All to be Sexy I can t get over how good I look in this I just stared at my reflection in the mirror I almost wanted to make love to myself right then and there This three piece proves that you don t have to show it all to be very very sexy 
Happy Kid My daughter is happy with this purchase and her friends like it to 
Great shoes Great Price These are the best shoes I ve bought in several years They are ultra comfortable AND stylish Buy them your feet will thank you 
Great for any bears fan I bought this for my fiancee as a christmas present I looked all over including the homepage for the Chicago Bears any couldn t find this shirt It was exactly what he had been looking and an awesome price Everything about the transation was 5 stars The quality to it shippping so quickly and a week before Christmas 
chicago bears shirt I bought this shirt for myself I love it it fits well and still looks new after multiple washings I received this product faster than the estimated time and was very happy with the service 
First Rate Service The Chicago Bear Touchdown T Shirt is a great product for all NFL fans I really like the style of the t shirt with the big logo The shirt was not flashy and simply lets people know what team you support The delivery was very timely and I was completely satisfied with my experience Kudos to the people at Amazon 
The perfect gift This shawl is soft cozy warm a perfect wrap for the winter I m getting one for all my friends this Christmas it couldn t be better priced 
Hot swimmer wrote a good review I gave it 1 more star than hot swimmer because I consider the pilling to be very minor I have washed my shirt every week for a year and the pilling is barely noticeable After a year the shirt looks great I bought more because I have been a dull guy wearing the same black shirt every time I go to the gym Oh yeah a major reason for selecting this shirt is it hangs loose around the waist This is good because paunches are not emphasized The competition s shirts Nike allow you to show off your cut abs I don t have any so this is a good shirt for me 
Looks Great and Very Comfortable for Workouts or Casual Wear I am a huge fan of Under Armour s workout apparel and in addition to owning several of these Tech T shirts also own several each of the Loose Gear shirts 0084 and the Heat Gear compression shirts 0039 I ve written reviews on those as well The Tech T shirt 0382 feels really good on your skin like your favorite most comfortable old cotton t shirt It looks just like cotton and has a matte finish it s not shiny silky like the Loose Gear shirts or Heat Gear compression shirts It is very soft comfortable and lightweight and I love this shirt both for working out and casual wear The shirt runs true to size buy your regular T shirt size and it will fit really well and is the roomiest cut of the Under Armour shirts I absolutely LOVE the raglan sleeves on the tech tee one of the features that makes them so comfortable and gives them a little bit of a unique look The tech tee has a small amount of a lycra like fabric in with the polyester microfiber which gives it quite a bit of stretch I like this because the shirt doesn t bind if you re doing something that really requires you to reach or stretch certain weight exercises aerobics yoga etc The shirt works the way it s supposed to and wicks moisture from your skin for rapid evaporation The tech tee is available in numerous colors I have 6 of them and in spite of the fact that the fabric is thin and lightweight the shirts are very opaque The shirts have a nice cut and look great over jeans or shorts in addition to the gym I often wear them out and around or when working in the yard They are super comfortable worn as an undershirt too but are probably a little costly for that Like all the Under Armour shirts they have a self material neck band but it fits just right and says in place even if you get sweaty it doesn t sag like the cotton ones While I have zero complaints about the tech tee be aware that it is Under Armour s budget product if there is such a thing The material does start to pill after a few washings this affects appearance slightly but not performance or fit Although I haven t worn out ANY of my Under Armour shirts yet I m going to venture that the tech t shirt won t be quite as durable as their signature Loose Gear shirts and Heat Gear compression shirts nor does it perform quite as well On the other hand it it s about 20 cheaper so as with anything else you get what you pay for When stacked up against UA s other shirts I d say the tech tee is for you if 1 You like the look and feel of a soft cotton t shirt but want the wicking and performance of a microfiber shirt 2 You don t care for the shiny silky more synthetic look and feel of the Loose Gear shirts or the tightness of the Heatgear compression shirt 3 You want a shirt that s a little roomier 4 You want a shirt with stretch in it 5 You want to save a little but still wear an authentic UA logo shirt 
HOT TO DEATH These shoes are HOT HOT HOT SEXY SEXY SEXY but they are NARROW AND I even went up two sizes to try to fit them boo hoo they are still sexy and if you have a narrow foot you ll get lots of attention from wearing them 
Carlos Santana Pumps The shoes are beautiful Not only are they classy but comfortable to walk in despite the high heel 
Great shoes but big I have these in both black and brown and I wear them nearly every day I walk to work and back and other than the first day of use they required very little break in and they are just comfortable and great Note that my feet are not wide I have no idea what the width of my foot is but I just buy normal sizes when I get shoes if you have to go wider perhaps this would not be the boot for you The only downside is that I normally wear a 13 in shoes but these are too big for me at that size so I really should have gotten a 12 
Modern and sleek I ordered these boots from Amazon at Xmas time I am glad I bought them and I was lucky they were 50 off then Lots of my friends had plenty of compliments about them I wish I had bought them in brown also at the sale price As always the Amazon shipping and service was top notch Too bad this time they are only offered by Macy s and at regular price 
great boots I was a little hesitant to order these as the only size available was 1 2 size below what I usually wear and other reviewers had mentioned true sizing with these boots such that you shouldn t order half a size larger or smaller but rather your standard size These fit great though and I ve loved them 
Love These Boots Awesome looking and very comfortable be sure to get a size smaller than you normally would wear I wear a 13 but ordered a 12 based on other reviewers and they fit perfectly I wear these with jeans on casual Friday s at work all the time 
Worth every penny Those boots are of the excellent quality that one comes to expect from Kenneth Cole products Great price and super fast shipping 
Very Nice Boot I bought these just before New Years and accidentally spilled wax on them being too festive Thankfully Amazon is offering them at half the price I paid at a major B M retailer This boot has great style and very soft leather It fits exactly as advertised so get the size you normally wear 
comfort and light These shoes are comfort and light weight I have arch pain And these shoes reduce some of my arch pain 
Comfortable Shoes Great for work I bought this shoes after reading many positive reviews My work requires me to stand for a prolonged period of the day I have bought many other name branded shoes such as Kenneth Cole Cold Hann with nike hybrid Boss etc they are not as comfortable as Clarks I give this shoes a nice 5 and i refer to others too 
very comfortable I ve been wearing Olga underwear for many years These were a nice discovery I like the wide lace band just below the waist There are no lines under my clothing 
Cute and most importantly they are comfortable These are high quality sandals and cute to boot 
struggle to operate I bought this for a 10 day trek across africa followed up by a North Pole trek What a challenge to get to operate and when it did start to operate it would stop recording mid day Also battery life is weak didn t make it across africa PS I m a computer geek so it may be user error but doubtful 
Best gift for the biker hiker I bought this watch as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it It does everything you can imagine and he has fun showing it off but it s practical uses are undeniable He is a mountain biker and uses it for elevation speed barometer altimiter and the GPS directions He is also a Land Surveyor and he uses the GPS and compass daily He would recommend it to anyone serious about a GPS watch It is the best we ve found and I did my homework before I purchased it others just don t compare 
I love these pants These pants have LOTS of room in the legs I am gonna have to get more of em 
GREAT RUSSELLERS TEES YOU CAN RUSSELL AROUND WITH THESE TEES AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY THEYRE VERY HIGH IN QUALITY AND PRICED RIGHT I HAVE BOUGHT 20 OR SO OF THESE THEY REALLY HOLD UP WELL 
Good fit I bought the navy for my boyfriend He s tall around 6 2 and he often has problems finding shirts long enough in the torso but this shirt solves that problem If you re long waisted I recommend buying the tall size He finds the shirt extremely comfortable and I think it looks good on him It s good for casual or exercise wear The material is very light weight flexible and soft The shirt also has a slimming quality because of how it drapes You really can t beat the price 
russell big white T good looking shirt but in the picture you dont see the tag embossed on the lower front left Thinner fabric than expected as the white is see thru 
Comfortable Effective and Cute I recently ordered this sports bra through amazon and am very pleased with it It is cute on both sides the solid white side with navy stitching and navy mesh back and the solid navy mesh side and it s the rare white sports bra that I would feel comforable wearing alone on runs outside the double layering with the navy mesh keeps it from being see through even when drenched in sweat Speaking of sweat even after a hard workout this sports bra kept me feeling dry and comfortable as well as secure The only slight drawback is the small reflective label in the middle of the back it felt slightly scratchy when I first put the sports bra on but I forgot all about it within a few minutes of starting my workout and didn t feel any scratching from that point onward I imagine that with repeated washings even the initial slight scratchiness would disappear And even though this item did not ship directly from amazon shipping was fast from essentialapparel and I had no problems 
Great hat I bought this beanie for my husband He just loves it Now my 17yr old grandaughter discovered it and she wants to wear it all the time I guess I will have to order another one so they don t have to share Very fast shipping too 
My favorite yoga pants The Beyond Yoga line of clothing is just incredible Very soft and unlike any other yoga clothes I ve felt or seen I wear these Beyond Yoga Capris to class and they perform wonderfully Then I go shopping afterward and don t feel like I m wearing exercise clothing because they re so cute I love the lotus drawing on the back and the way they flare at the bottom I would recommend anything from this line 
Liked it so well I ordered another one Great fit Very warm It s below zero outside with wind chill factored in and I never feel the need to layer something over this beanie The hat pulls down tight and stays put when I strap on goggles and pull up a face neck warmer 
Well it looks GREAT on him I took a gamble over the holidays for my b f as he s very selective when it comes to clothing I picked this one since he prefers beanies with a smaller shorter top After some speculation he was nice enough to try it on He loves it he wears it almost every day And it keeps him warm too 
AWFUL Just AWFUL I agree with D Katz 100 percent This item is horrible I bought it at 5 dollars and I still regret it The worst thing is that it is looks horrible If it performed badly at least I could look good but it didn t even have that 
nice shoe esp for the money nice burgandy ish color leather is sturdy yet comfortable Cute style slightly larger heel than Clarks usually has Also gives a bit of o squeak the first few times u wear them Overall nice shoe should be durable too 
Great looking Clogs These are great looking and overall I am pleased They run about a half size small I was able to make it work because of the open back 
These shoes run really small I bought a pair of these online last week against my personal rule never to buy shoes online because the price was so good I even bought up a 1 2 size to be sure that they would fit I own other Clarks shoes but in my experience clogs tend to run a bit small Even buying up a 1 2 size these shoes are a bit too small and narrow I m going to try to stretch them out and keep them because they are really cute but be warned size up 
Very disappointing I know one person said they could put 4 loads of laundry but I put in 2 pairs of pants a towel and other clothing just about 2 loads The very first time I lifted the bag and put the strap over my shoulder to do laundry it ripped where the top strap is sewn to the bag So it is worthless to me Not durable I am not pleased 
good quality I did not purchse this bag for my own personal use but while being large was not quite large enough to serve it s intended purpose so it was given to me I ve used it quite a bit already and it has held up incredibly well with heavy contents and holds quite a bit well over 4 loads of laundry I like it 
great shoe comfortable and sturdy buy with care Great shoe Very comfortable and lightweight Sturdy and easy on the eyes But buy with care They run large and I suggest you buy a size smaller than you wear My shoe size is 10 1 2 and the men s 9 is just right 
Size runs larger than PJs by same maker I bought this robe and the silk pajamas for my boyfriend for Valentine s Day both in a size large The pajamas fit nicely but the robe was WAY too big I printed out the return label listing the reason for return as the product did not fit the description online Amazon said that this was not their fault and deducted the cost of shipping from my refund and did not offer the opportunity for an exchange So now I have to re order the robe in a smaller size and the price has gone up 7 since Valentine s Day This would have been a good deal if it had run true to size but because of misrepresentations made I will end up paying close to the full price listed MORAL Order one size smaller than you think you need 
Perfect Gift I bought this gift for my husband for our first Christmas He absolutely loved it the color the texture everything After searching around on the internet it was one of the best deals as well The gift arrived quickly and without any problems I highly recommend 
Love this product The robe arrive in great condition and in a timely manner My boyfriend absolutely loved his Christmas gift Thanks again 
I Wish I Had Not Bought It At Amazon The robe does not fit me I wanted to return it got a return item number got busy and did not get it in the mail soon enough They have a strict 30 day return ploicy Nordstroms does not do this I could exchange it there Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules I will go elsewhere next time 
great robe I thought that wearing a silk robe was more an affectation than anything else Happily I was wrong This robe is well made comfortable and it really looks nice 
Review of silk robe The robe was made of a very high quality fabric and held up very well The color and tecture of the silk was truly beautiful 
Perfect I bought this item as bridesmaid dress for my friend s wedding Package arrived 2 days after I placed order Impressive I measured myself but still ordered one size up since this item was described as junior dress Shouldn t have done that Their size chart is pretty accurate Now it needs some minor alteration but that s fine This dress looks absolutely stunning Before making this purchase I ve tried local stores and other websites You can t beat the price of this dress and the quality of the fabric is not bad at all 
They had it in size 12 13 My favorites retail stores never have anything bigger than size 10 And the price is right 
Great shoe This shoe is true to fit in every way It s very comfortable and secure feeling I can wear the shoes all day and never feel any discomfort I bought them in black and they look really nice with any slacks 
Just like the ones I had in 1970 As I approach 50 I find myself in retro mode I sought out the adidas I loved in grade school and found them Having purchased the blue Rom s I found them to look every bit like the orignals I got many flattering comments However you get what you pay for these are not the most high quality shoe They are one size too tight If you buy one size larger you ll be fine but wear them sparingly for looks not performance I m going to buy a second pair but this time a size larger 
comfortable shoe mainly for walking I like the design simplicity of this shoe but don t use it for jogging or running as you will feel uncomfortable I guess it is made for walking 
Perfect Fit These shoes are awesome They fit a little tight but not to the point of being uncomfortable They re also pretty fashionable I would definitely recommend these for anyone men and women It was a great purchase Free shipping is also included so if you are intrested I would tell you to go for it 
Great Item So glad I went ahead and ordered this before Christmas My boyfriend loves them and they got to my house two days later even thoughit could have taken until Jan 10th I knew I could wait to give the present and save money but fortunately I didn t even have to Super light comfortable and look great with jean 
Now I have some Birkenstocks I redeemed a gift certificate to purchase my Betula by Birkenstock Woogie Mocha Nubuck 3 Strap Sandals 742483 I decided to indulge myself and I m glad I did they are very comfortable and also attractive I m very pleased with my purchase 
Best underwear I ve had Very comfortable and stylish Looks great when your wearing just the trunks 
Jockey Pouch Underwear I have been trying to publish a Wikipedia article about this particular brand and cut of male underpanty but after several rejections I am forced to come here At any rate I find this underwear very stylish and I have the unanimous approval of any fortunate enough to see me donning them male or female My problem with them is that they wear out too quickly Granted I alternate between only two pairs They breathe rather well but after 6 months or so they are A rather dingy B have running seams C both When I wear them I have the confidence that I could drop my pants in front of anyone without embarassment Sometimes while waiting for someone to come over I make a point to put my pants on last I enjoy walking outside to get the mail in them and generally walking the line between nudity and clothedness a joy any fellow metrosexual surely shares In conclusion they are the best cut I have found and I have searched the universe so to speak They have helped me close the deal several times because they are simply gorgeous They could be less expensive if you ask me 
Good Choice When I first bought these over the summer as a last resort before I went to Europe I was skeptical and I wasn t sure if I liked them or not Now that I m back in the states to the cold winters of the Northeast I ve decided that I really do like them They re design lifts everything out of the way which is very comfortable no re adjusting necessary They re a good buy 
Nice Package I really love these underwear almost as much as the model wearing them Unfortunately they look bigger on him than mine do 
worth the time these are by far the best pair of underwaer i have ever worn not only do they improve your profile but they keep the package in great position while wearing making them the best fit ever i have already ordered more 
Poor fit Useless sling Who wouldnt want a better profile I was very excited with my purchase however I was quickly disapointed The sling hurt and didnt fit my private area comfortably After one wash the underwear shrunk Love low rise but these pair were too low My crack was showing 
Great underwear FRESHPAIR com POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE I actually enjoyed these underwear and it took some getting used to I consider myself a savvy internet shopper and have had great experiences Freshpair com s service is not timely and quite hard to get a hold of My order took over a month to receive Four emails later they finally responded with a 10 off coupon which was insulting I suggest Amazon com for most of your shopping FRESHPAIR NO 
More of a novelty item The sling doesn t really do much the underwear is sized very small so make sure to order your size accordingly When they say low profile they really mean it If you really want underwear with a sling go buy some elastic and put into your current tighty whities 
Stock Up These shoes are great I bought myself a pair and wear them everywhere I even wear them to work I m getting them for all family members for Christmas Even the babies 
These Are A Must Have Basic Girls this underwear is great for comfort my girlfriend loves them and it s sexy enough to keep your man s interest We don t like no granny panties OK 
Jockey bikini It IS the only underwear I will ever use The quality of the brand speaks for itself 
no wedgies These panties fit and feel great They never ride up in the rear and they don t show above today s lower rise pants I completely wore out my last 3 pack so I m very glad to see these are still in production 
My favorites for over 15 years I ve been wearing these for over 15 years and love them They are cool comfortable cute and sexy at the same time AND they last a long time Although I m a size 4 I have a full caboose and these accommodate that very well One of the other things I just can t stand is when the bottom rides up like those boy shorts in the rear and these don t do that with me 
comfortable I ve worn these panties for years They are comfortable long lasting and attractive Best of all they never wedge up on me Everyone needs cotton underwear and as far as I m concerned Jockey makes the best I will keep wearing these as long as they make them 
good deal received after about 9 days made of authentic material fit well the proportioning might not fit a little boy thoug 
Professional This was a very professional elegant combo set for the price I have yet to find anything that can compare 
LOOK GOOD Underpriced Prompt delivery Excellent quality Waist pockets are fake Matching tie is also really nice Undersized minus 1 star order the next size up 
Nice vest This doesn t come across on the pic as well as in person Well made excellent buy great vendor Prompt have used before and will again 
Very nice I really like this item Its extremely comfortable and very stylish for a man s slipper Also its seemingly strong Great bu 
Casual footwear makes for a happy camper Stylish and durable would describe these men s slides by Cherokee Casual activities around the house can be done in comfort wearing these good looking quality leather slides Thick rubber soles provide support for walking around the yard or the mall 
I am really fascinated with this jacket I love it I ordered it in bronze even though I wasn t sure what I was buying It s more like a brown a beautiful satin brown I can only say good things about this jacket The rouching is elastic so besides it s a roomy jacket it gives more space for movement It can be dressy or not and is eye catching because its rouching is hard to find in other jackets I ve gotten many compliments on it Also it s light weight I ordered size L and wear it with a thick sweater underneath I love it and the price too 
Great cranberry scarf I ordered the cranberry scarf with the matching hat for my daughter for Christmas She loved the set as it is light weight and not bulky for packing for her honeymoon Thank you for making these gifts available 
Warm and Cozy Very Comfortable I like the compression but stays dry with intense exercise Keeps the cold out and body heat in 
Particularly nice for big people If you re tired of the one color dri powers which are very functional this adds a bit of style and keeps the original functionality Particularly if you have a huge expanse of shoulder to shoulder area this breaks up the monotony a little Monocolor dri power tees work fine but these make the wear interesting enough to not look like something you d wear as a shirt and not under your shirt The material is just as good wicking away sweat fast I ve realized that the wicking keeps the dampness from creating that gym sock smell Fresh sweat gross as it sounds doesn t have that sickening odor And when it gets to evaporate fast you can last a little longer before smelling like socks I find the dri powers most valuable if you have to go bike to get a coffee or small groceries and you don t want people in the store maintaining a perimeter around you 
Cute Shoes These shoes were perfect for the occasion I used them for They were pretty comfortable and absolutely adorable They came quickly which was also appreciated I can t wait to wear them again 
Great VERY fast delilvery Excellent quality merchandise Would order from this company again 
Hayne sports bra Wife was pleased with the bra altough she had to repair one of the hooks 
nice handbag Good quality handbag Medium size is big enough to carry everyday necessities even when that includes quite a bit Seller honored return exchange policy 
comfort but dye problems I ve loved wearing the two pairs of these sandals that I have and they ve held up really well The tan ones have been fine but the blue dyed ones got wet once and they stained my feet blue quite badly It was very hard to remove and I went around with very odd looking feet for quite a while I d like to buy more because they adjust to fit my narrow feet but I m afraid the black ones will stain my feet black if I get caught in the rain 
Comfortable Shoes I had one of these sandals and they lasted me a long time They are awfully comfortable sturdy and flexible The adjustable straps lets you adjust the sandals if you are wearing socks and need extra room to wiggle your toes However if you are flat footed this sandal does not provide much of an arch support This was one of the first pairs of sandals I bought before I was diagnosed with a really bad case of flat foot feet and had to swtich my footwear I cannot believe the price at which these sandals are available You cannot beat the price 
I ve gone through several pairs in 12+ years Early in the 90s I happened to buy a pair of these and I have always had a good pair and an aging pair since then They are extremely comfortable and they give me an excellent sense of being solidly on the ground I wear these so much that even over the winter the stripes on my feet never go away completely 
I love Clark s Sunbeat adjustable sandals I bought 3 pairs of these sandals a few years ago and have worn them out The footbed is very comfortable and I like the adjustable buckles for the ability to wear under different circumstances with socks weight loss or gain etc Walking is very comfortable for me in these sandals they are my shoe of choice for walking where a closed toe shoe is not necessary Lately I have been looking and looking for more of these sandals I don t like Velcro fasteners and was very happy to get 2 new pair I m going to buy more in different colors More colors are available online than the department store I recently visited 
Excellent value These are very comfortable and are an excellent value Pockets easily handle 2 tennis balls Would have been nicer if the Adidas logo was embroidered instead of silk screened 
Roomy and elegant shorts Mesh shorts aren t usually that shiney but these are The tissue is very light by which it can be roomy lot of tissue but still keep a nice form The pockets are small but one could not expect more when the tissue is that light Delivery was in a week for Europe I could not expect better 
Truly the Best Sheer Knee Hi s These are by far the most comfortable Sheer Knee Hi s I ve purchased They are available in a variety of colors rather than in only two or three shades The invisible reinforced toe does not cause any discomfort when wearing pointed toe shoes The elastic band does not pinch the leg They resist multiple washings without tearing and once dry return to their original shape The material does not itch when worn in warm climates 
Love the shoe but beware of sizing I bought these shoes in my usual size and had to exchange them for a half size smaller They are great shoes but they run big

Nice I bought these right before Xmas I love them Well made cute boots 
The Best Boot Ever I wanted these boots when they first came out in the fall but I refused to pay 159 for them My mom loves wedge heeled boots so luckly I found them here for 45 WoW I purchased a pair for myself and my mom After wearing them my mom had to have all of the colors in the line Unfortunately I was not so luck to find them again for that price but I purchased them for 89 I still love them they are worth every penny and you can wear them all day They work with any outfit Good job to Aerosoles 
Aerosoles Durrific Wedge Boot This is a beautiful boot Very nice fit and good shape Also very comfortable and easy to walk in Great casual or dressy I definitely recommend them 
Nice Shoes I purchased these boots because I have another pair of Aerosoles that I ve been wearing for almost 3 years that are SO comfortable The heel is a bit high for me which makes my food slide down to the frong maybe they run a little big I do get a bunch of compliments on these shoes though Overall I am not dissapointed 
So comfortable I love these boots I usually wear 7 5 or 8 I ordered the size 8 Perfect fit They are comfortable too Would order again 
Nice boot I really like this boot I wear a 7 5 and a 7 5 fit perfectly with a medium pair of socks I like the look I have wider calves so this was great for me but might now work if you have thin calves The only reason I didn t give it a five was because after a few wears the seam on the back of the boot split by the ankle I went the the aerosoles website and called the service number It had been within a month their guarantee and so they sent me a new pair You have to ask to get the postage sent to you They were very nice and on the phone said this wasn t a normal occurrence so an exchange for the same boot was fine 
Aerosole Wedge Boot I love them they are very comfortable and that is important to me I have them in black and I am also ordering them in the Brown color I just wanted to share the news of my love for these boots 
Very cute These boots are very cute and super comfortable They are even better than I thought they would be and I am thinking of even buying another color I would strongly suggest buying a pair you won t be let down 
great price for great boots I just got these in the mail last week They came free shipping via Amazon in a huge well padded box right to my front door I decided to purchase these after reading the reviews for them on the zappos website and all the positive reviews on there These are MUCH lower priced on Amazon and a great deal I wore these out for the first time Friday night and although they have high heels they aren t the hardest or most uncomfortable things to walk in I m thinking for a neighborhood stroll or most activities these would be fine maybe not a whole day of walking shopping They have plenty of room to stuff in your jeans if you want On jeans with a thinner leg you can t really get by with wearing the boot under the jean or you can see the outline of the boot under there I m definilty satisfied with this shoe purchase 
Cute but different than pictured I m keeping the boots even though they look different than I thought they would In the picture on Amazon the boots looked a lot more reddish pink In actuality the boots are more pepto bismal pink They are still cute but different than pictured Also the sizes seem to run a bit big I am normally a 7 so I ordered a 7 and my feet are swimming in them It s nothing I can t fix with 2 3 pairs of socks though 
Jeffrey Campbell Pink Floral Rain Boots Just gorgeous and so much fun Enough room at the top to tuck your pants in and adorable with a skirt or capris Great quality Lots of prints to choose from 
Style and function These boots are gorgeous fit true to size and absolutely puddle worthy I ve gotten so many complements on the unusual pattern Colors were a little different than the picture suggests there s a little more light green than I thought there would be but this doesn t bother me at all Great product 
Striped Thigh Highs Add lots of fun to any event Lots of attention and well priced too 
Nice little wrap It was exactly as described nicely made Perfect to top my holiday dres 
Naruto Leaf Village gloves these are officially licensed gloves the quality was much more than i expected its made out of a nice leather material and the finger wholes are sewn in a way that they don t loosely move around but actually grip around your fingers there is even some extra padding inside the glove underneath the metal plate roughly 5 6 inches lon 
Creative zen case This product is great It protects my MP3 player from scratches and it arrived quickly 
Very good bundle This bundle includes everything you need to use your Zen Vision M since it comes with nothing I use the portable charger all the time since I have a laptop which is only on when I am using it Without the portable charger my player would be dead all the time I recommend this bundle 
Wonderful package Just having bought a Creative Zen M mainly so I could walk laps on my driveway with it I needed someway to clip it to my clothes Found this and bought it LOVE it Bright magenta skin slipped on easily and works very well The belt clip is good The chargers are WONDERFUL No depending on a computer to charge my Zen Well worth every penny 
Great Deal To begin this package arrived way ahead of schedule and with no problems The skin fits the 30gb just fine and the wall charger works well I haven t timed it but I think it charges faster than USB I haven t used the car charger yet but I would assume it works just as well as the wall adapter The only reason my rating was 4 stars instead of 5 is that I ordered the green skin for my green Zen Vision M and the colors do not match exactly I might have preferred the clear skin but besides the looks I am satisfied with everything else very functional and the price can t be beat 
Basics The chargers are your basic necessities and they work fine The silicone skin is better than average protection but expect some adjustmens as to how you work the Zen It impacts the Zen s sensitivity 
Great bundle Buying these items bundled saved a good deal of money and it s nice that the adapter is built into each cord Priced individually it s like the skin is free 9 99 at Fry s The vendor shipped right away and I received the package in two days 
Zen Premium Silicone Skin Kit I love my skin kit for my Creative Labs Zen Vision M For the money it s a great deal The car charger and AC wall charger are adequate though I wished the cords were longer And the skin is awesome to protect the player and especially the screen I bought my Zen then immediately left for a Caribbean trip It was fine on the beach and I didn t have to worry about sand invasion and scratching I ve also taken it into vapor caves and it s an awesome protector The stand is a little wobbly but works fine I love my kit especially because it s PURPLE 
Excellent Deal The skin fits well and both chargers work perfectly so far Also I was impressed with their extremely fast shipping I ordered it on Friday and had it by Tuesday with Monday being a postal holiday Wow The skin is more flexible than I expected but it stays in place nicely while allowing all the controls to be used normally The belt clip is a little weird but I probably won t use it anyway I really like not having to carry the Vision M s dongle around to charge it now I can leave the dongle with it s USB cable and not worry about losing it An excellent deal 
Beautiful and Elegant Dress Sandals I was thrilled to see that these gorgeous sandals were as beautiful as they looked on the website They are also very comfortable and VERY inexpensive What a delightful purchase 
Great shoes Great price I bought these shoes to go with a black dress I recently purchased I hate having to get a new pair of shoes for one outfit but there was no way around it I m short but have a hard time with shoes with any kind of heels because my feet are fairly wide and somewhat flat I m usually of the mindset that you get what you pay for but in this case its not true These shoes were not only inexpensive but extremely comfortable to wear and they re adorable 
The attache case This attache case is perfect for my court appearances when I go to court to take notes for my employer It has plenty of room for my notes and court documents a small bottle of water my personal identification car keys cell phone camera etc etc I could not be happier than I am with this purchase and besides that the case is far easier to carry than a purse because I can put all I need to carry right inside Thanks a lot for a great attache case 
Good stuff This is a great gag gift for Helicopter pilots I enjoyed giving it 
As expected They fit well and have a good amount of space for growth My daughter likes them and they were reasonably priced A good value all around 
Great Skechers shoes for my boys The hunt was on for comfortable shoes for my two boys as they began to learn how to walk They have been barefoot or in socks for their entire lives up to this point and it was important to me that their first shoes be a tolerable and enjoyable experience for them While the price is what initially attracted me to these shoes I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were constructed in a sturdy manner There was no shoddy workmanship on these shoes The soles were solidly attached to the body of the shoes The velcro closure to the shoes is much appreciated as I did not want to waste time with lacing up shoes that could easily be untied On a cosmetic level the colors of the shoes were nice and neutral while still leaning towards boy s colors I bought several of these in different sizes so that my boys will have comfortable shoes to wear as they grow How nice it is to just reach up in the closet for the next size shoe I would not hesitate to recommend these shoes to other parents 
cute shoe I really like the shoes they are very cute The only downside is the velcro The velcro is thin so after shoe is worn for awhile the strap starts losing its stickines 
Great shoes seemed to be sized small We were unable to get these on my little one s feet They could have been marked wrong but they are not the size mentioned Love the shoes anyway 
Great shoes These are really good shoes My 3yo is getting great use of them They are perfect cause he can put them on himself Holding up wel 
Good Shoe Very good shoe Easy for a child to put on with no shoestings to tie 
my son loves them these are great for the diego fan in your house my son loves them and wants to wear them all the time 
Wonderful Shoes I LOVE these shoes I actually find them to be confrontable but i wear heels everyday They are a pretty color brown and are so fun I wish they were available in more colors because i would buy every pair They fit me true to size 
Steve Madden shoes stink I always do this give Steve Madden shoes a chance when I know for a FACT that no matter what shoe I buy sneakers excluded I love SM sneakers they will definitely be unbearably uncomfortable These shoes pinch my feet in an area that NO OTHER SHOE I VE EVER WORN has pinched me before I d return them in a second if I didn t have to pay shipping now I ll just have to sell them Plus the material is subpar thin and of cheap feeling quality I tell myself this every time but I am never buying Steve Madden shoes again 
Lovely but POOR color quality These were a gift at Christmas and were a deep burgundy color they do appear to be well stitched however after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don t look like a match anymore the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much 
Silk Pajamas My friend was very happy with them They are very good quality and they fit him for the most part The only issue we had was the length of the arms They were a little too long Other than that we were pleased They got here in time for Christmas and they were just what he wanted 
I Wont do it again I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy I made a mistake by buying i 
Size reference Great PJ Really glad i got it It s pretty well built I was afraid it would be a bit fragile but so far so good As a reference I m 6 0 with roughly 200lb I got the Large and it s a bit tight for my taste I ll be trading it for the X 
Best Quality I Have Found These silk pajamas in my opinion have much higher quality stitching tailoring details as well as a heavier weight silk than the closely priced DreamSacks pajamas Sizing Help To help clarify sizing for people there have been conflicting reviews here I ordered a Medium but then returned it for a L I will probably get some minor alterations but I don t blame the company for that everyone is shaped differently I am 6 0 and weigh 175 My suit measurements are a 42 chest 34 sleeves and 32 pants inseam The Medium body fit but the sleeves and pants were too short The Large was the best fit overall although roomier around the chest than I would prefer But if you are my size the Large is your best option 
Good for women too These are great Well made did ok in the wash They also did not split at the seam after wearing them 2x They are still cool enough for summer but nice and warm in winter and SERIOUSLY SOFT By a pair for your wife yourself They are heaven 
I would highly recommed these very nice I was concerned that these silk PJ s would be really thin and on the cheap side But to my surprise they are much thicker then I thought they would be and feel like they will hold up rather well My husband did NOT expect these and is quite pleased with them I am back tonight to order another pair in a different color now that I know they are worth the money I paid for them Plus the fit was perfect I noticed others here said their large was to big so get a smaller size and another person said the opposite That confused me when I went to buy So I just went with my husbands normal size which is a XXL and it was absolutely perfect My husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of PJ s ever The size is perfect color bright looks like it will hold up after many washings Seams looked like quality sewing unlike some I have bought in the past I can t find anything I don t like about these I need to get another pair here FAST before he wears these out lol Anyone thinking of buying these I can t help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least Ja 
Good quality silk Of all men s silk PJs that I purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best The fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well After reading other customers reviews I purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size M and occasionally L It turned out too small I would recommend going one size up 
Good quality This is a good quality pajama set and was worth the price I paid with an Amazon discount Be forewarned that the color is a really bright red though 
make sure u need +size Im 5 9 150lbs so I went for the plus size and they are too loose fitting Otherwise they are pretty sturdy and attractive and working fine w garters 
it does what is says This bathing suit does what is says It does allow some tanning through I still could tell where the suit was but much less that a regular suit There is no support for the top but you cannot see thru this fabic and it dries very easily Good suit for the mone 
Fossil Accessories Garrett Mens Leather Belt Flawless transaction No problems at all Thank you 
I love it It isn t always easy to find a minimizer in a 34DD that doesn t look matronly and that s one reason I LOVE THIS BRA It looks very sexy on but also has great support and is comfortable too My only complaint was that Macy s only had 1 in my size or I would have bought one in every color It looks great under clingy fabrics too I hate looking bosom y and this bra makes me look much smaller than I really am I LOVE IT 
Comfy and no VPL These are comfortable and give a smooth profile under trousers however they are too high to wear with many low rise jeans and pants Still good value for the price 
Very nice This style is sexy or cute or whatever you want it to be This particular pair is a little high so if you re into wearing low rider jeans this is not something you d want to get Personally I was surprised by how high they were and I cut them They re much better for me now and it came out very neatly The high part is sewn above all that you need so when you cut it off the underwear is still seamed together so it won t fray and come apart Felina is a very good brand their stuff is always very comfortable and stylish and lasts a long time 
Wonderful I got the item in a reasonable amount of time The quality was great and it had the seals just like it said I was pleased with the item the price and the delivery 
Great quality Great quality t shirt Even though we are bigger fans of the Miami Dolphins 
Leather waist pack I liked it until I saw the hole or slice in the front pocket But I m stuck with it because I waited 3 weeks for it and I refuse to pay the shipping and handling to return it when I already paid for the shipping to me 
Leather waist packs Just what I needed to carry useful tools in the Emergency department Thank 
London memories These umbrellas are incredible They remind us of the ones we picked up in London 
received quickly We received our order quickly and it was fine The only concern has been that we had to return it because of duplicate gift We are STILL waiting to hear that the return was received and that our account is being credited Otherwise the merchandise itself was great 
Chicago Bears Hooded Sweatshirt My son in law absolutely loved the gift It came with coupons for future orders which they have used because the coupons were such a good deal The company was prompt in delivery Would recommend this company 
Naughty School Girl Costume Review Shipment for this item was super fast and though I was skeptical at first it fits perfectly and has gotten me several very nice comments when I wore it even had pictures taken wearing this item Sizing was perfect I would recommend this vendor for plus size items 
My hubby likes them I ordered these for my husband and he likes them I was hesitant to order them on line but took the chance and they fit great and look great Thanks 
Great bra When I ordered it it must have got lost in the mail so when I contacted figleaves they sent another one asap 
AWESOME Bra Having purchased a TON of nursing bra s in all styles and prices while still pregnant I can say without reservation that this one is the best Being large busted but relatively small around am normally a 32E but am currently a 36E it s very difficult to find bra s that provide adequate support are comfortable and that don t look like a granny brasiere Further it s pretty much impossible to find a soft cup non underwire that does all of the above This bra is supportive comfortable pretty the lace in the cleavage really does look like a cami under tops and your breasts don t look like uni boob One tip for new nursing moms definitely don t use underwire bra s I made that mistake at first for the support and got recurring mastitis not fun AT ALL 
Best nursing bra This is the best nursing bra I have found so far It is far superior to the bras I had when I had my first child 4 years ago Although it does not have underwire support it is very supportive even for my 38DD size I switched to nonwire bras when I found underwire bras to be uncomfortable blocking milk ducts perhaps As an added bonus although it is a full coverage bra it is quite pretty It has nice lace on the top which looks like a pretty camisole under clothes Also the 6 columns of hooks are fabulous I now believe all bras should have more columns of hooks so we can get more wear out of them I would definately recommend this bra It is more expensive than some others but it is worth it 
Great BCBG Shoe I own this shoe in a size 8 and love it It is moderately comfortable for a high heel and really pretty in real life It makes one s foot leg look very feminine It is a tall heel and I think that is probably why Worth the money 
2 x ist tank All in all I was extremely happy with the sturdy product It was off black but it was a better testimony to its advertisement than the phony product I got at C IN2 I was surprised that I ordered a small and that s what I got It envelops my torso and shoulders and doesn t sag like other tank tops Pretty much if that s the size you ordered then you will get it I ordered the product on 23 February and got it on 27 February with regular shipping so I was pretty psyched they surpassed their shipping obligations I know where to get my designer tanks now Great job 
Enjoyed the product It is an exact replica of from the one Naruto carries It is well built and sturdy I have it stuffed to the top with coins and it shows no signs of breaking I recommend it 
I love the boots I love everything about the boots the high heel the fur and the sexy lace 
okay i like this boot and everything but the thing i dont like about it is that the heel is too high and when i walk all my weight is on my front bottom of my foot and it hurts like hell i cant really walk in them too i have only wore these boots three times and i bought them over a month ago well i was going to returned them but i decided not to wait for the my money back so i kept them 
Jacket Thisis a great jacket It will be put to good use Thanks for the super service 
Poor quality Poor quality bad material bad workmanship The velcros around the wrist are not sewn in right it scratches my hand and arm Though I can fix that pretty easily by re sewing it and maybe get rid of the velcros in pockets while I m at it the pockets are made of wrong material I have a rather dry hand and each time I put my hand in the pocket I can almost feel cuticles forming It would ve been O K if they just used the same material as the rest of the jacket but the material that pockets are made out of is just horrible and not pleasant to the touch 
average guy here I am an average guy who just received this jacket today and it is a great buy at 9 99 I always order the next size up to accomodate for differances by the manufacturer My pecs and lats are fine in the XL 
My Favorite I have tried MANY nursing bras This one is the ONLY ONE for me I am a size 36C and it gives great support It gives plenty of room for when your bbs are at their fullest Prone to clogged milk ducts and having had no luck with other bras I was hesitant to waste my money again This bra has given me no problems whatsoever It s like the miracle helper that no one tells you about Don t wait GET IT 
THE BEST BRA EVER After reading the previous review I ordered one on ebay and just got it yesterday OMG WOW WOW WOW It is NOT worth it to keep on buying your favorite cheap bra then after 2 3 washes it comes apart then you buy it again You just need to buy 1 good bra like this one and it will STAY This has SUPPORT with out the annoying wires that get you down when nursing easy drop down cup SO SOFT SO COMFY When you put it on you feel GREAT SO LIGHT WEIGHT and it doesn t make any fat pop out on the sizes WOW WOW AND WOW 
Best nursing bra around After trying tons of different nursing bras and almost giving up hope of finding something comfortable supportive and easy to use I found this bra and now own 8 of them As a breastfeeding counselor I always suggest to moms that they look for something without underwire can cause plugged ducts for some moms esp in the beginning This bra gives the support without sacrificing shape or comfort Some comfy nursing bras Bravado and sleep bras give you a uniboob look not flattering under close fitting shirts This one looks awesome on This bra is also very forgiving of size changes as the cups are stretchy to allow for growth and later shrinking To find the best fit go to a boutique and let them size you Then order the right size online 
Fabulous Just what I needed to get me through the very cold spell we had in February My dog even accidentally chewed on them and there was no damage Great product 
Funny T Shirt This was a gift and the person I gave it to loves it It s a good quality T shirt and it gets lots of comments when he wears it 
excellent money clip wallet design this money clip wallet has space for three credit cards on the money clip side an id window on the reverse side and the top has room for approximately 5 cards before the unit looses it s shape i love this wallet a money clip wallet that is this functional is hard to come by buy two 
DOPP ID Money Clip Great size great versatility Fits easily in front pocket holds right amount of cards with secret pockets to add more things but remember you re buying this for compactness not to hold too much stuff The only con is that a magnetic money clip would have been better but the clip hold just fine as it is 
Husband very happy My husband had stopped wearing his wallet and carrying cash in his front pocket intead I think mainly due to the discomfort of sitting on his wallet I decided to take a chance that he d like a slim wallet like this that fit easily in his front pocket but allowed him to carry his ID and most important credit cards and I was right 
ID money clip card holder The product looks great and is very convenient My Husband loves it 
very pleased with these shoes I found these on Amazon without even looking for them I went to several Dept stores and tried on ALOT of dress shoes and found nothing I liked And one day I was surfing and seen these and was IN LOVE the first time I seen them I took a chance on these and they exceeded my expectations 100 I cant say enough about these Lifestride shoes thanks Amazon for making them affordable 
Nice versatile shoe Incredibly fast free shipping I like the shoe a lot perhaps it runs a bit large but still comfortable 
Life Stride Shoes Great product and timely shipment but found this style shoe did not fit at my regular size No problem I returned them immediately and replacement shoes were received within the week with absolutely no hassle 
Great PJ s Bought these for my son He is so glad to have some PJ s that don t have Sponge Bob on them oh he loved Sponge Bob but is 12 now and wants to grow up He actually told me he loves the feel of the cloth 
camo for everyone My Godson wanted a camo shirt his school colors are orange and black Amazon had all kinds of colors to choose from He was ecstatic with his gift 
Fine coat Living in the south there is little need for this coat but when you need it you need it I don t know what the person below is talking about The coat is not thin perhaps compared to a parka but its certainly heavier than a business suit coat Seems a little big at 44 Regular Mine arrived well packed no problem with wrinkles even after leaving it in a heap in the back seat of the truck Recommended 
Thin and and wrinkled I purchased this coat online for my husband He needed a new topcoat to wear over his suits at work Although it looks pretty nice in the picture it is poor quality This coat is pretty thin and wrinkles fast Because it is so light in weight it doesn t hang well It also had a small white mark almost looked like wax on the lapel It is not the same quality as most department store top coats If you are looking for something that looks professional I wouldn t recommned it I found a better topcoat for the same price on sale at Macy s by Ralph Lauren I returned this coat to Jos Banks 
good item my son has been wearing this sneaker for as long as i can remember this is the only style he wears only one problem not able to find them in the stores in my location must buy them on line 
Wonderful design and quality I love this bag I bought it to organize all of my toiletries for any given day either at a cramped gym or on the road The unique design allows me to pack all of my travel bottles into the slots so that they stay in place and remain upright The other compartments are easy to access and thoughtfully placed The bag is easy for me to hang in the locker room shower for quick and sanitary use The hook can be rotated so once I am out of the shower I can hang the bag facing the other direction to conveniently access my cosmetics The handles on this bag are very sturdy and all you to carry everything with one hand even when the pockets are unzipped This is also great in the gym I have quite a few products I like to use in the course of a day and this bag hold it all with room to spare Like I said I love this bag 
Great bargain for a stylish dress I love this dress Looks good and very comfortable I usually wear it with my other belts I m 5 5 and this dress falls right past the knees 
very sexy and chice This dress is extremely sexy I use different shoes and belts with it to change the look It is very attractive on and has a good vibe when you re wearing it 
My favorite Shoes Florsheim is getting harder to find at retail stores The comfort techs are the most comfortable shoes I ve ever owned This is my 5th pair They last long and feel like mocassins on your feet Great for trade show work Just a dream 
Florsheim RIVA Excellence These are my 5th and 6th Florsheim Comfortech Rivas Burgundy and Black I began wearing them in 1978 when they were sold under the French Shriner label and have not been without at least two pair ever since The design and production rights thankfully passed or were sold to Florsheim when the French Shriner marque disappeared The shoes are the ULTIMATE IN COMFORT The uppers are of glove soft kidskin and the soles of a firmly cushioned synthetic material They are suitable for everyday office wear as well as for use on formal occasions The factory finish is as durable as a patent leather without the extremely high gloss plastic look They are extremely durable as some of them lasted me for more than twelve years of frequent wear I ve never been able to wear out the one piece Comfortech sole and heel Ultimately the uppers will wear through on the flex creases or at the base where the upper is joined to the sole You can easily extend the wear period to ten years or more by occasional use of a good polish especially after the shoes have been exposed to a wet environment They are an excellent buy at the suggested retail price of 100 to 110 that you see most often but are an unbelievable bargain at the 90 pair charged by Amazon If I had a suggestion for minor improvement for Florsheim it would be to make the sole slightly thicker and the heel slightly wider for greater stability I personally would rate these shoes at six stars on a scale that had five stars for the next best shoe I would never go back to wearing dress shoes of conventional stiff leather and hard soles and heels These shoes are not perfect but Florsheim has come VERY close with the Riva Give them a try I think you will come to love them as I do Neil Coddington Albuquerque 
Comfortable durable metal free I ve been wearing these shoes for years They re as comfortable as shoes get and they are available in EEE widths and half sizes so they fit me well Their soles are synthetic not leather this may make them less elegant but it also at least quintuples how long they last The soles and heels never wear out for me eventually the leather uppers get too scuffed to keep wearing them except around the house and yard Except for the tiny little buckle on the strap they have no metal in them which means they go through all airport metal detectors without setting them off The soles are thin so I was never made to take them off at airport security either Well not until the latest pointless revision of TSA rules Someday sense may return to airports and then the lack of metal will be helpful again 
More comfortable than tennis shoes I have lost count on how many pairs of these shoes I ve gone through over the years Don t get me wrong I wear them everyday Monday thru Friday for about the last 10 to 15 years Therefore you have to expect them to wear out after a year or two I haven t found ANY shoe that comes close in regards to comfort Further I personally think they look good This is the first time I bought shoes online and Amazon did their usual good job Highly recommend 
very comfortable I wished every pair of shoes made were this comfortable I bought a new pair to replace my old pair I agree with the previous reviewer that the design is slightly informal Even so I wonder why other companies don t make similar products to Comfortech 
Soft somewhat informal sole hot You can get away with wearing it in the office but the sole doesn t quite look like formal dress attire They re super soft to walk in But all that padding makes them uncomfortably hot except in cold weather I would think this is a niche product but Florsheim seems to portray them as an extremely popular product 
Cheap and formless I was hoping to wear this for my daughter s Easter Christening Well no dice It s extremely cheap very light material frayed at the edges and the embellishments seem just ironed on big and boxy and the lining leaves little to the imagination Sending it back 
Awesome lunch bag I bought this lunch bag for my son and he loves the style of it I was impressed at how roomy it is it easily holds 2 sport drinks plus sandwich chips and several snacks 
great product Simply top quality fatigues Great customer service too I will buy afew more pairs Thanks Glenn Holloway 11 10 0 
good value for money but innacurate size chart I ordered two colors of these pants in size L as part of my brother s birthday gift The size chart shows that 38 waist is L When I gave them to my brother and he tried them on they were tight He said A larger size would ve been excellent Since I wear size 36 I tried them and they were fine So I kept them for me and now I m reordering the same pants again for my brother but in XL Bottom line very comfortable pants thick fabric and good value for money but order a size larger than yours to be on the safe side 
Just right These BDU pants were just right Comfy useful and strong Love the color too 
just perfect This is the travelling bag I have always looked for It is light and hard just perfect to keep your luggage safe and the color so very nice So easy to see among the others I fully recommend it 
Light and Hardy I got this bag 3 months ago and love it It s much lighter than most luggage bag in it s size category and yet it s body is quite strong and hardy And the best part is it s low price tag 
Nic e boots sizing off These are nice shearling lined boots not quite as cute as Uggs but more affordable BUT order up a size I am a standard 8 and my toes were squished up against the front 
Bearpaw Boots I absoutely love these boots They are extremely comfortable I have tried on Uggs and these are actually more comfortable and they kept my feet really warm I normally wear a 7 1 2 and I bought these in a 7 As long as Iwear light weight socks they fit fine I m thinking about buying a pair of these for my sister for Christmas I like them so much 
Wonderful I ordered these for my 9 year old sister and they arrived within a week She refuses to take them off now She does complain that they are slightly tight her toes almost touch the front so size up a bit for these No complaints though she loves them too much 
Best winter boots around These are the best winter boots I have ever owned They are comfortable warm I can wear them with or without socks I love my Bearpaw boots 
Just like Uggs Absolutely no difference between these and Uggs except the price Great quality 
Great and lightweight Took me quite a while to find an appropriate raincoat but I highly recommend this one It is of good quality something very important to me lightweight and stylish enough to be worn over business work or casual clothing It has the added bonus of a detachable liner which itself is quite warm I found something very similar without a liner at Saks Fifth Avenue for 395 and could not see myself or anyone else for that matter plunking down that much for a raincoat Overall this coat is at great price and it is a great buy 
Raincoat Excellent price and just what we needed for those occasional rainy days Since it s usually too warm here for a heavier coat this raincoat filled the bill perfectly 
not tough enough I m a pretty tough guy so clearly I thought these pants would be a good fit But the other day while I was wrestling a shark the inseam on the left leg of these pants ripped Verdict THESE PANTS ARE NOT TOUGH ENOUG 
nice going you can place an order there without becoming anxious at least my experience nice goods good price nice price good goods 
COOL These sneakers are very cool and well built Great quality at an affordable price Not too bulky but sturdy Nice leather I d buy these again 
Great shoes for the price I got these shoes to play indoor soccer and considering the budget I was on these were my only real option I know a fair bit about soccer shoes and how they should feel and for 40 these shoes are great performers They are also one of the few soccer shoes that you can wear outside without being embarrassed one can even say they are stylish gasp Anyways these shoes get you an incredible bang for the buck and you can take those 5 stars to the bank on that 
Samba The Adidas Samba has been a great shoe for as long as I can remember This is easily my fourth pair over the years because these things wear like iron and last forever My last pair were falling apart after several seasons of indoor soccer and general usage The only way I could bring myself to throw them away was to buy a new pair I recommend this shoe to anyone who is looking for grip on turf or a comfortable shoe for any sports activity 
Great Shoes Great Deal I received a quality pair of Adidas Samba Classics at an unbelievable price They were delivered on time during the Christmas season I couldn t be happier 
Adidas Samba Classic M BLACK WHITE 10 M Mens Product arrived safely within the specified time window Thank you very much 
Adidas Samba Classic The product was perfect It got here in reasonable time The shoes fit great and look great I got exactly what I ordered 
Awesome soccer shoes at a great price I ve always had a pair of Sambas since I was started playing soccer when I was 5 They are comfortable and great for indoor sports as well as just casual wear These were a great deal and were received promptly 
Great shoe very wearable and good for soccer too Very good ball control for an indoor soccer shoe Looks attractive and easy to clean as well The brown Sambas retro look better but are not as wearable as this pair 
its a shoe very comfortable stylish and durable shipped very fast great price 100 satisfied I will be back to shop at Bealls 
Just what I had been Looking For I live in rural Wisconsin and don t remember where I had originally purchased my favorite nighty and when the time came to replace it I knew I wanted the exact same style I looked for several months at local department and discount department stores and couldn t find it anywhere One day while browsing Amazon I did a couple queries and WAH LA there it was Found easily reasonably priced shipped fast Many thanks to Amazon and Bealls 
Review of Vanity Fair v neck night gown The night gown is very comfortable and looks great even after several machine washings 
As always another Vanity Fair great product Very pretty and comfortable Vanity Fair is my favorite brand for sleepwear 
For Working Outdoors The Best I manage construction projects and spend a lot of time out of doors in Syracuse NY where quot Lake Effect Snow quot means anything from a few inches to several feet Wind chill temps are routinely below zero in winter months My quot uniform quot consists of long undies and Lands End turtlenecks down vests and Polartec socks amongst other layers to keep me warm when the temps plunge Even my boots are from Lands End The best part is when I come indoors for project meetings I look good in my Lands End gear What more could a woman construction boss ask 
Staples Lands End s turtleneck sweaters and mock turtlenecks with long and short sleeves have been staples in my wardrobe for almost ten years now I own them in multiple colors and they look as nicely with dress suits I wear at the office as with jeans and leisure wear In addition they are virtually indestructible few other garments I own survive laundry this well no matter how often I wash them they don t fade thin out or shrink They re first rate quality and at a bargain price to boot 
ANYTHING from Land s End is Top Quality Stuff Over the years I ve purchased more winter jackets pullover sweaters amp turtlenecks from Land s End than I can keep track of No matter what you buy with their label on it you can be sure it is nothing less than the very best Their clothes in particular never go out of style plus they really do last a long time If you have anyone on your holiday shopping list that really appreciates top quality products then you can t go wrong with buying from Land s End Very highly recommended 
The Best Turtlenecks Lands End T necks are without doubt the best I ve ever worn The necks are seamless and look great turned up or down never stretching out of shape The sleeves are plenty long the cuffs comfortably tight the body length long enough to tuck in and blouse a little without worrying that it will come out every time you stretch your arm out They don t shrink they don t stretch they don t pill they re value priced and I ve only gotten rid of mine because I ve tired of the color If you believe in buying quality clothing this is one of the best buys you can make 
Comfortable and supportive Ok An underwear review Seems a little odd but seriously these are the best boxer briefs out there I ve tried CK Nautica FTL and others These are comofortable and supportive 
Nice but colors bleed while washing It is a nice scarf but I handwashed it and it was a pain It bleeds awfully and stains you haveto be carefull while drying not to stain anything around The colors are slightly different than pictured but still nice 
Very nice black open toe pump I really like these shoes The look is very current kind of fun while still professional enough to be able to wear them with a lot of different outfits I think they will be a very versatile addition to my closet I will also say for anyone who sometimes needs a slightly wider shoe I usually buy most of my shoes at Payless because I can get more things in the wide width there I was pleasantly surprised by the fit of these open toed pumps They fit comfortably on my feet The satin like fabric would not be my first choice but they don t look too overly dressy 
These are great So cute I think they re worth more than they re being sold for 
Brill o Real nice and slim fit light weight get it Do it go on But really I bought 3 items from Andrew Christian real nice stuff and it s always a pleasant surprise to order something from overseas recieve it promptly and most importantly I GOT THE RIGHT STUFF 
comfy tall heels The sole of the shoe is extra padded feeling nice and it s a tall heel without feeling too tight as some do 
Sweatshirts SMALL I m a 5 7 tall guy and finding sweatshirts in SMALL is next to impossible It was great to find them available online They fit well if you ve got an average build I think they d be too snug if you re carrying around extra weight or are muscular 
Clarks Terrain Oxford Great shoe Would be nice if it had a padded tongue Some difficulty untieing because top string buckles that are difficult to work with 
Clarks Men s Terrain Oxford typical Clark high quality shoe It seems to run a little wide in size 
Great boots for the price These boots are a good value They look great and fit very well and seem to be true to size except that they feel slightly wider than the standard size D 
The Best Boots Ever Purchased I bought these boots for my husband for Christmas and he wears them almost every day He is a hairdresser and he says they are the most comfortable shoe he has ever worn to work 
harness motor cycle boots boots were exactly as described on collection from fed ex i climed onto my harley and clocked up 9000 miles in 18 days in all types of weather extreme heat heavy rain snow hail you name it and the boots are showing no sign of any use also walked fair distances to and onto glaciers bush tracks bars to and from they were very comfortable priced right 
Pass on This One Very cheaply made transparently thin weave and much too small for an adult with a head larger than a grapefruit I returned it WAY overpriced even at 7 99 
Nice gym shorts I like these shorts for the gym They are not too short and are very comfortable 
nice combination package the silicon case and lcd protector make for a good combination as another reviewer mentioned the case actually makes it easier to use the buttons around the navigation wheel the armband is a little too snug for my arm which isn t really all that big and manly i haven t figured out the belt clip yet but i was pleased to see that it was black same as my case rather than the white clip pictured i didn t give it 5 stars because of the smallish armband and flimsy belt clip though it s still worth getting just for the case and screen protector 
Pritty Awesome Product This is a great case the arm band works great the clip works ok the screen protecter you stick on is simply stunning and the buttons really are easier to press But it makes the scroll wheel a little harder to spin No big deal the only problems i got with this case is when i got it in the mail it had a tiny tear near the headphone hole the shipping price also sucks 
overpriced shipping Great product The only reason for only 4 stars is the shipping was way overpriced 
awesome I bought this item for my mp3 Its perfect for protection so you dont have to worry on damaging your mp3 The screen protector adds safety to the screen I use the strap for exercising its does its job The clip is perfect if you dont want to carry your player in your pocket and hand all the time 
Great Product This case is great for anyone who wants an unobtrusive sturdy and attractive case for their mp3 player it holds up well and it even makes the buttons easier to push thank 
Great No program needed for this mp3 player You just drag and drop You can buy extra batteries for it I would highly recommend buying a screen protection film or something The screen easily scratches like every other mp3 player 
Sports Armband This armband case is great protection for the Sansa if you re the type of person like me who s athletic and spends much time in the gym sweating it up It is easy to put on and take off to clean And to clean all you have to do is rinse it out in fresh water and dry it off The flexible arm strap is comfortable to wear but the belt clip is very cheesy and not reliabl 
great product This product is great for protecting the Sansa 200 series from sratches and accidents that could occur from dropping The product is a lint magnet if you keep it in your purse but nonetheless it s easy to clean off The protective screen cover that comes with it is easy to apply but mine fell on the ground and therefore has unwanted lint under the cover but when the screen is lit up you can t even tell It is easy to apply bubble free This case is a good deal and I would NEVER use my Sansa without it 
nice little case Feels nice snug fit Very clear plastic overlay protects the screen and the buttons make the e 200 series buttons easier to push 
The most comfy panties you can buy AND very pretty These lace panties are beautiful and don t be thrown off by the one size fits all They are very stretchy so they don t need to be made in different sizes Put them on then get dressed and it feels like you are wearing nothing at all A lot of my women friends are wearing them and our only regret about discovering them is the price quite a bit more than those 5 for 20 panties at Vict s Sec 
best these rule over all other underwear calvin klein does it almost as good but these are the best and when you see a pair you should bow 
Go Sox I sent this onesie to a friend of mine in San Francisco He had previously lived in Boston and this was a gift for his new baby The parents were both pleased and the child looked good What more could you ask for in baby clothes 
Worth every penny Very comfortable I went on trip as a tourist where I knew I would need to walk a lot I don t like to wear sneakers in the summer so a comfortable sandal was the only choice This sandal did it I was problably walking around for 3+ hours and my feet didn t scream once If I changed one thing it would be the fit around my toes I found myself holding the sandal close to my foot as I walked it didn t hurt but walking would take a little less work 
Aerosoles Women s Almity Thong I bought this shoe in black and bronze I do a lot of running around and this is a very comfortable shoe true to size and really cute 
aerosoles it looks nice and very comfortable but runs half size bigger I m size 6 5 and I had to order size 6 
i like this sweatshirt i was surprise when i got the product it is very good quality sweatshirt and i like the color 
names of tie knots great little gift given with a tie the price was exceptiona 
Nice boots good quality comfortable cute I agree that these boots are snug They have a 13 circumference and rise to just below the knee You can measure your calf to be sure they will fit I have a 13 calf and they fit me exactly Foot size seems to run true for Charles David meaning they are smallish in the foot compartment but the length is right They are tight with trouser socks I actually like new boots this way when they wear in they will conform perfectly 
AWSOME BOOTS I bought several pairs of knee high boots before and they were always too big on the calves this one fit my legs perfectly 5 6 102 lbs A wee bit snug around the ankles prolly cuz my ankles are a wee bit bigger than average since i m a wee bit big boned but worth it cuz of how sexy it looks D Very comfy for a 4 high heel 
Great Probably not for the typical person they zip up pretty snug and I m a very small 5 1 100lb person I had one nasty slip with them but it was probably just me For 4 inches they are VERY comfortable and takes little time to break into They look great but if you aren t too into round toed I wouldn t recommend these 
perfect traveling companion Best design for travel documents makes traveling much easier no fussing to access ID and air plane tickets Love thi 
Very Helpful I always get tired of digging for my ID and boarding pass when I travel Many times I worry that I might leave my ID behind while I am messing around with all of my other luggage I recently ordered this product for a trip to Arizona and it couldn t have made things easier I loved it My ID and boarding pass hung around my neck and was easily accessible whenever I needed it 
Needs a better level of quality control re tag issues The slippers themselves are good quality and unlike many current styles were at a flatter level which I like They do not have a built in arch support I do not like built in arch supports so this was a plus for me They are washable which is another plus because in my opinion too many slippers marketed today are not washable and I will not purchase slippers that I cannot wash Even the sizing was appropriately done in my opinion you should be able to order whatever slipper size you are comfortable with without concern The only drawback and it can be a big drawback is the plastic cords inserted into the product to keep them together one was inserted incorrectly with the result the plastic could not be totally removed Because of that I cannot wear the slippers The plastic was inserted through the bottom middle of the slipper and after removing the plastic we discovered a portion of it was coming up through the slipper bed and there was no way to remove it So if you re looking for decent slippers these fulfill but the quality control with the plastic inserts might pose a problem Frustrating but the product itself is a five star 
Can t beat Dearfoams for inexpensive comfy slippers I bought these for spring after living in my shearlings all winter 
warm and comfy These slippers are warm and comfy The only complaint I had is on one side the little plastic tag didn t go all the way through the slipper it was stuck somewhere inside and I had to resort to pliers to pull it out through the bottom so I wasn t walking on it all the time 
Warm and Comfy These are the most warm and comfy boots I have ever purchased I can t wait to wear them again next winter 
Neo Costume This is a wonderfully made garment People thought I paid big bucks for it It looks like real leather and the construction is great This was my second time purchasing this costume My son out grew the first one in the child size and it still looks like new He wanted to be Neo for another costume party and begged me to buy another so I got the adult small which was a little big for him I wish I would have gotten the teen size Even so Its was a great purchase and he will grow into it 
I love this top This top is great It is SO soft and stretchy The only down side would be the cleaning recommendations hand washing It does seem to be a fragile shirt but it is so comfy I now have two 
kbarton I ordered this dress by the sizing listed It arrived quickly but was much larger than anticipated The exchange was extremly easy and we are very satisfied with the product and the excellent servic 
Beautiful Affordable Rewearable Bridesmaid Dress I spent less on 3 of these dresses purchased for 3 bridesmaids than I spent on 1 dress I wore in a different wedding that I will NEVER be able to wear again This dress is gorgeous and I can wear it again for a night out with my DH The dresses were shipped VERY quickly arriving in less than a week 1 was on backorder and that arrived just 1 week after the initial order was placed Sizing is generous so the dresses fit a bit looser than regular dress sizes and can easily be altered down If you don t want to bother with alterations the PacificPlex return policy is fabulous and their customer service is outstanding 
I love love love Steve Madden I own these shoes in red and I just ordered them in black They are so comfortable and cute I always get compliments on the red ones and they make me so tall without making me teeter Perfect stylish wonderful 
buy new laces as always the boots are great docs never let me down except in one area the laces i don t know who they get these from but every pair i ve ever owned has had the laces fray up w in the first week that makes lacing up ten eyes pretty darn difficult 
Husband loves it I like the idea of a storage space for credit cards separate from a wallet The zipper closure is good too Could have a few more spaces for cards but overall it s very good 
Women s Slip on Sheepskin Slipper Review Well made warm and comfortable I wish I d bought a pair years ago 
ipod nano case This is a great product I don t really use the belt clip part but the case protects my ipod well I only wish there was something to cover the screen and maybe the wheel too 
applie iopd skins I love this for my ipod and recommend it to anyone who just wants a cover to protect their ipod I wanted something that I could use to protect it in my purse and this was perfect 
nice jacket a good buy Due more to Harve Benard s questionable marketing ploys cashmere riiiight and they had the lawsuit against them to prove it too than Amazon s product description it seems that this jacket has been short shrifted and maligned D The jacket itself is actually very pretty It s beautifully lined and the cute dome buttons are unique The color Java for me was exactly as pictured The cut is excellent and very flattering to a fuller figure The shoulder pads not detachable are somewhat annoying full but nowhere near making anyone look like a football player For 24 99 this jacket is definitely worth it you would be hard pressed to find a jacket of good quality cashmere claim not withstanding for this price anywhere at least not one that looks more expensive than 24 99 I would not pay 178 MSRP for it but at the current price I just might go back and buy another one As for Amazon I cannot sing enough praises about their excellent customer service I have never had an issue that has not been resolved to my satisfaction 
Love this jacket I wanted a nice jacket and this one is just that I like the cut and the style I recommend it 
Easy to walk Got these to replace some Sketchers and for the price it was a pretty good deal They are lightweight and make you forget that you are wearing shoes I removed 1 cause the color is not one of my favorite 
Great shoe My son lves the light up cars shoes and they fit himm comfortably 
Not Enough Stars I grew up wearing Clarks shoes And had forgotten how comfortable they actually are Well i received my shoes today put them on and was immediately reminded These shoes are terrific Amazon should have a category for people who are thoroughly satisfied with any given product For anyone looking for total comfortability and style you cannot repeat CANNOT go wrong with these shoes I was so satisfied i purchased another pair different kind though Amazon gets props for such a speedy delivery Tarikh Bandele 
Very comfortable and well made Shoes arrived quickly Bought husband s regular size and they fit very well Sturdy strong leather Very good arch support Good heel height very comfortable Would buy them again 
shoebiz excellent craftsmanship great fit flexible and firm in the correct proportions what a great shoe 
Sports Shoe in a leather form I had this shoe for 2 years and are very comfortable Wore them for Beach play and lot of things Now colour is slowly coming out I can polish and wear them again 
extremely comfortable I meant to try these on for a few minutes but had them on for an hour because I kept forgetting to take them off Usually I can t wait to take off a pair of new shoes I m impressed 
Heavy shoe It is comfortable great for outdoor But it is a little biger than its size And overall the shoe is quite heavy 
Nice Shoes Resonable Price My husband has been very pleased with these shoes 
Comfortable They are so comfortable that they feel like tennis shoes to me The actual color is darker than what they appear online 
good shoe I have had these shoes for about a year now they have been wonderful Very comfortable despite heavy use they have held up well Great if you do a lot of walking 
Just what I wanted I bought this armband and case for my Apple iPod nano Product Red It s the really small iPod with a metal shell and it has rounded edges which makes it a 2nd generation nano So if you re looking for a case and an armband for working out as I was then this is the right product The case fits perfectly and has the slits in the back to fit the armband or even a belt if you want I searched high and low for something like this and was extremely pleased when I received such a high quality product for such a cheap price You won t be disappointed in this one 
IPOD Silicone skin case works great Easy to slip on and secure on my arm and very comfortable during workouts or a run 
Good for the Price I bought the black and pink set It s great that this item has basically everything you need to protect and wear your new nano The pink is quite transparent which didn t look very good on my black ipod but the black is nice and opaque Make sure you don t get any dust on the sticky side of the screen protector as you apply it because if you do bubbles will definitely result and it doesn t look very good I had to take the screen protector off and wash it in water about three times in order to get it clean enough to put on The good thing is you can wash it and it will stick again Also any bubbles that are not directly over the screen are covered by the case Overall I think it s a good deal for the price since you re getting everything you need in one item 
Great Deal This product is a great deal for the money Everything has worked well and looks great 
Awsome socks The main beef I have with tube socks is many will state that they are over the calf but they really aren t These however are actually long enough to reach my knees and I m 6 4 So if you re looking for a tall sock these would be the best ones for the price I ve had them for about a year now and no holes yet either 
Great Socks I needed socks for my son and these are great the price was resonable and ordering was easy 
Good Price These are a very good quality set of socks and the web site I used to ship them was on time and fantistic 
Great style and fit for the price I really love this jacket it is great and inexpensiv 
Made in the USA My wife has a hard time finding shoes that fit her as she has very narrow feet I have been unable to find any shoes made overseas China that fit and are comfortable These shoes made in the USA fit great and are very comfortable I just hope that they will always be available I always buy a couple of pair at a time just in case they become unavailable 
Faux Vintage I bought this dress a while back and have worn it several times I ve always gotten compliments and been asked more than once how I found such a perfectly preserved vintage dress I really love it It has even survived multiple trips to the dry cleaners My main concern when I received it was that the unfinished bottom hem would fray but so far it has stayed perfectly The sizing was true to the waist and generous elsewhere due to the full skirt and top so if you have a smaller bust a push up bra may be in order 
Great plus size dress I purchased this dress for an upcoming cruise The dress fits wells and looks great It s hard finding reasonable plus size fashions and this one is a winner 
Great Product This is a great product and very clever Look forward to being the hit of the part 
Comfortable and fun but watch out I bought a pair of these sandals in February 2005 and am still wearing them Like any sandal they are fun and easy to wear Just recently I ve noticed that the front part of the soles has worn down and they are smooth now Also the foam bed has started to crack in several places but for the price I d say I ve gotten reasonable use out of them The bottle opener is a great conversation piece Also rest assured they do hold up to wear and tear I was skeptical when I bought these how long they d stay intact but I can attest that they are still in and functional kinda mangled but still intact and functioning Also if you think you re just gonna swing your leg up and crack open a beer like Mr Joe Cool then think again I remember when I first got these I was at a backyard house party while in San Diego I was flirting with these two girls talkin my game and trying to be super cool So I grab another beer and while talking to them I lift my foot and try to crack the bottle open Well between trying to keep my balance and get the lip of the cap in the opener I apparently shook it up a bit When I finally did open it the resulting explosion of foam shot all over me and the two girls Not cool I would suggest taking the sandal off to use the bottle opener feature All and all a great shoe Fun and easy to wear Another tip Make sure you wash these every so often Stick em in the washing machine I neglected to do this and developed a nasty case of athlete s foot from them Just a heads up Enjoy 
We both loved it I m hard to fit and shopping for something delicate and pretty can prove difficult When this came in the mail I took one look at it and fell in love It s so pretty on I may buy the black one too Sexy without pushing the line of taste Worth it worth it WORTH IT 
Great bag I ordered this bag in paisley and it is just gorgeous I absolutely love it The colors are turquoise blue and green This is a high quality bag I d even compare its quality to that of the Vera Bradley bag I have The bag has 6 inside slip pockets and an outside velcro pocket which has a slip pocket behind it This is a smaller bag ideal for using as a purse The straps are long enough to wear on the shoulder It has a hard insert in the bottom of the bag that is removeable so you can wash the bag It has a zipper closure so you won t lose any of your stuff For this price this bag is a steal I d definitely recommend it 
Totally Agree The Lilyette 458 is the best bra EVER I was a slave to Bali because a didn t really know what cup size I needed but more importantly b most stores don t carry anything larger than the DD cup size that didn t fit so I could see what DID fit NO Bali minimizer fits me regardless of size I cannot seem to fit into the Bali cone rocket design Even if I did it is wholly unflattering The Lilyette 428 has that rocket shaping and it looks ridiculous This cup design gives a smooth curvy high riding NATURAL look No points cones or rockets I love it 
Finally a bra that fits For the hard to fit large busted woman this bra works I had to get used to the underwire coming up so far in the front at first Love it as it keeps the breast separated where they belong and not mushed together as some minimizers do Lace is pretty and flattering even in the DDD sizes The additional support on the side is nice and keeps you out in front and not under the arms Try it you ll not only like it you ll love it 
Well it wasn t exactly what I expected I BOUGHT THIS BRA FOR MY COUSIN BUT SHE SAID LUCK LUCK DUCK I GUESS THAT MEANS SHE DIDN T LIKE IT SO I TOOK IT HOME AND USED IT AS A SLINGSHOT GOAL OH YEAH STARS WIN 
Versitile and Sexy This is a must buy Want to spice up your bedroom life Versitile for everyday wear and super sexy at home Sheer fabric leaves just a bit to the imagination HOT 
This is a SUPER HOT BRA A must buy for your significant other Too HO 
Very versatile IF It s alright if you know how to use it It tends to roll at the ends and its a short shirt Don t get it if you are not willing to wear a shirt underneath it or willing to show off your tummy But it is soft cool and different from any piece of article in your closet i guarrantee that I just bought it and i have been experimenting on differnet styles Its pretty neat actually Hope this helps i think everyone should get one just for fun 
exercise sandal I use to own DR Scholl s exercise sandals back in 1982 and at the time they use to be 19 99 I wore the sandals every day and gradually got my calf in better shape no hip or back problems I eventually worn them out by 1986 and had a hard time finding them since then until I searched Amazon com and found them again and the price is still reasonable I love the navy and the white colors I put mine in my wish list for my birthday or mothers day here is how you measure put you foot if even doesn t matter wich foot if uneven use the loner foot to determine your size take a 11x12 paper and make two marks one at the heel and one at the big toe then look at the chart put your finger on the inches foot measurement and run across to see your size remember these sandals only run in whole sizes so if your half go up one also know your width Women Size Inches CM 4 8 � 21 4 � 8 � 21 6 5 8 5 8 21 9 5 � 8 � 22 2 6 9 22 9 6 � 9 1 8 23 2 7 9 � 23 5 7 � 9 � 24 1 8 9 5 8 24 4 8 � 9 � 24 8 9 10 25 4 9 � 10 1 8 25 7 10 10 � 26 10� 10 � 26 7 11 10 5 8 27 12 11 27 9 13 11 � 28 6 I hope this helps you to determine your size I wear 8 1 2 in shoes I measured my foot and it is 10 inches I ran my finger across the chart and found my size so the sandals I need a 9 in Dr scholls remember each manufacture is diffrent in their sizes so measure up 
great quality shoes very cute These shoes take some getting used to it is best to wear them around the house for a while before you wear them out in order to get used to the feel They are very high quality and very attractive I can wear them with jeans shorts dresses most any summertime clothing 
DR SCHOLLS I HAVE BEEN WEARING THIS SANDALS SINCE THE 60s WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY THEY ARE GREAT S HAMM FARNHAM V 
LOVE THEM Blast From The Past Must Have I was only a little girl when these were the sandal of the 70 s and I remember having a red pair I bought the Navy color once I saw amazon sold them LOVE THEM you have to have them if you remember them They are comfortable stylish and takes you back in life 
Thank you Arrived on time in great condition These shoes are usually hard to find so this is a great resource 
No complaints here I just gave this to my sweetheart and he seems very pleased with it He switched out his old tri fold wallet for this one right away so that tells me a lot He s quite picky about such things so for him to want to use it right away speaks well for it It fits everything he needs without being too big or bulky It looks great and is of excellent quality not to mention a great brand name The Fossil tin it came in was a nice touch as well 
EXCELLENT undies These things are GREAT Any woman that wears pants should own at least 3 pairs of these Super comfortable non bunching They never peek out to say hello unless you want them to P I wish my underwear drawer was full of just these Plus they look sexy too 
Great little case This is a great little camera case for a digital camera I have purchased 4 of them for various family members They are durable yet not too bulky Perfect for what I was looking for 
Too small for Canon Powershot A95 This is a nice case but it is a little too snug for the Canon Powershot A95 I m going to buy the next size up There s a little mesh pocket inside for memory cards and if your camera it small enough you could probably get away with a couple of batteries It s a nice bag overall 
Great Gloves These are very nice gloves The leather is a good quality and the silk is very comfortable I would buy more of these if I needed more I don t like their cashmere lined gloves however as the cashmere is rough mine from Neiman s are really nice so I had high hopes for those from this source but it didn t pan out The silk lined are great though 
Beautiful gloves amazingly fast shipping I ordered these beautiful Italian leather gloves just a few days before Christmas 2006 The gloves arrived in plenty of time nicely packaged I buoght them for my mother one of those women who has everything but appreciates thougthful gifts My mother just loves the gloves Overall a perfect online shopping experience 
Works for me I recently quit smoking and naturally gained some weight We went on vacation and while getting ready for the day I noticed several bumps and buldges that weren t there before Being the lazy person that I am I decided to buy new rather than diet and workout to lose the extra tonage So the quest was on I tried several different brands and Playtex turned out to be the best fit for me The range of sizes and the flexabilty during movement is key for me Not to mention how pretty they are 
breezies My order was fast did not have the color i want the service was so great i do like the bra alot just wish it had the wide stra 
Great product for the price I use this bag everyday and I absolutely love it It fit the niche that I needed it to and it could not be better 
leather backpack Absolutely wonderful Good leather and workmanship I love it Thank you I may even get the black one because I like it so much Nicol 
Leather Purse This is a beautiful leather backpack purse It is light weight and has plenty of room in various pockets It is well made and I got compliments on it many places I have been A great investment for the price 
Leather Back Pack Super I was leary about buying this as it is shipped from Equador and I wasn t sure what the quality would be It is awesome and I love it The leather could not be nicer and although it looks small at first glance it fits so much in it It was a great purchase and the shipment was fairly quick I am real happy with it You ll love it 
Its a keeper I currently own a black leather backpack handbag but I wanted one for summer use For some reason the beautiful light brown reminds me of leather sandals and breezy dresses It is a bit smaller than my current purse but in summer I carry less just my wallet cellphone small address book pen and a small paperback book The leather smells so good The strap is ample and the handle is convenient for carrying the backpack I wish the zippered compartment s lining was a light color but at least it opens up to give you exposure to locate items that sometimes fall to the bottom of the purse The hidden compartment mentioned in the description is very small and doesn t have much room for a lot of items The quality of the item is very good and worth the price although the 18 40 for shipping was a bit more than I wanted to pay All in all a good deal 
Great but small I got this shirt in white and hunter green I get complements on the hunter green one each time I wear it b c that s a great color on you I really like the shirts over all They really do RUN SMALL You will certainly need to order a bigger size They are kind a thin too and the white one is a bit see through 
perfect fit i think this is one of the finest quality of a shirt what a bargain unbelievably cheap i have 34c 25 35 figure and i ordered size small and its a perfect fit for me its exactly look the same in the pic or better i have the same body type as the model so i guess if ur not skinny enough and try to hide ur extra bulge this is not the shirt for u its super stretch and body fit hugging 
WAY too small The manufacturer has sized this shirt much smaller than average I ordered a large which usually fits me but doesn t squeeze me I got a squeeze To get my regular fit I d have to order two sizes larger Plan on a fit like the one in the picture skin tight if you order your regular size 
These swim trunks are incredibly hot Having purchased many shorts and swim trunks from the internet over the years I had low expectations when these arrived However once I pulled them out of their well packed shipping enclosure I was amazed at the obvious build quality Once I squeezed my 6 1 195 lb bubble butt into them I was amazed at their style and fit Be forewarned that these run small and I probably should have ordered a size medium instead of a small as they are very skimpy and barely cover my butt cheeks However if you are an exhibitionist like me you will enjoy them immensely A good buy and hot value 
Excellent Fit Awesome These trunks are just what I was looking for They re tight enough to show off your stuff but not so tight that they re uncomfortable I have worn them twice so far and both times I ve gotten great compliments and plenty of stares If you like getting attention you need a pair of these trunks I ll definitely be picking up a few more of these trunks 
Sexy Wow these are simple yet sexy They do run a little small but the smaller the better for me I love the fit 
Quick and easy Quick easy transaction exactly what I needed shipped quickly to my door 
Navy fleece zip jacket Love the jacket for work I need to get another one Great quality and warmth 
very comfortable I found these to be the best boxers I ve ever owned They are very comfortable and hold up very well after being washed The only thing that can be a pain is the i pocket 
Zeppelin Foever First off I am not a kid it is just easier to write this way This piece of Zeppelin is a Vintage style T shirt from 1977 This should be the first shirt a Zeppelin fan buys But if you have a Hot Topic store near you you should get it there it is 2 dollars cheaper 18 00 Look for my other classic rock reviews Rock On WiseMan 69 
Ode to my youth Growing up in the late 70s listening to Zeppelin my dream was to see them in concert I was oh so close when only months before their next tour John Bonham passed away and then so did LED ZEPPELIN When I saw this tee I know I had to have it It is very well made Good quality shirt and graphics looks like a real concert teewithout the 40 price tag My Large tee seems a little small but that s how we wore them back then 
Getting The Led Out In Style I ve had this Zep shirt for a while and it kicks Looks great fits great and it s for one of the greatest rock bands in history Also gotta love the retro design 77 If you like Zep it s definitely a cool shirt to have Incidentally I got it half off not here though 
LOVE IT This is the most comfortable bra I ve ever owned It really feels like there is nothing on The only problem I ve had is with the straps slipping because the adjustment pieces tend to slip but I just sewed that up and it was fine As long as you are wearing the right size bra this is EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE I highly recommend this product 
careful with the size I love this shoes but my daughter like them better the shoes arrived timely but when I tried them on they were too small My daughter kept them and they look gorgeous 
AWESOME These shoes are great I bought my first pair in green and liked them so much that I bought another pair in red 
Nearly Me Gaff Being average size this gaff has power of hidding the bulge It holds and tucks the genitals from falling out to be able to look down and see a flat bikini 
Very nice and different Would have given this product a 5 star rating except that it had a small stain on the outside Very cool overall though and isn t like every other laptop case out there 
Good case This is a good case made with nice materials it offers a nice fit and buttons are easily usable it comes with a clear screen protector and has a belt clip so you can carry it more comfortably it is just a little bulky but nothing to worry about if you plan to carry it in your belt hand bag or hands it could only fit big pockets though my only serious gripe is about the inner seams they are very rough and could scratch the surface of your player yes Zen Vision M s have very soft coating and this could leave marks anyways you really should consider getting a skin for your zen Best Skins Ever in any case This is a very good case overall 
pretty nice Appears to be good quality At first I had a difficult time pushing the buttons through the leather but now it works fine just needed to break it in A little difficult to plug in the charger while in this case i just turn the player upside down and slide it back in the case when I m charging connecting to my computer Not a big deal because you don t need to use the buttons while charging 
this is the best for your zen From another review the charger and sync adapter brick can t fully engage the player because of the leather straps so it is easily disengaged by the slightest movement slightest movement i dont think so no the adapter doesn t fit in the jack as well when it is in this case but it does fit if your going to buy a car charger for your zen i would suggest you buy the one that you don t need the adapter for it plus it charges faster just like the wall charger i only use the adapter at home the headphone jack lines up fine From another review The fold over flap isn t designed well First of all it gets in the way of the headphone jack so that many times when I opened the flap it pulled my headphones out of the headphone jack The part about the headphones is beyond me You can put the headphones in the jack two ways you can completely close the case and the foldover flap and then put the headphones in like when youre not going to be changing songs alot I do this when I am working out at the gym The second way is to have the headphones inserted with the case on but with the fold over flap screen protector open I do this in my car so if I want to change a song while driving the buttons are right there I have never had the headphones pull out of the jack and ive had it over three months and i wear it everyday to the ymca and then theres Finally and this is a real deal breaker is the fact that you cannot plug in the adapter to the bottom of the player when the case is on You have to pull the player out every time you want to sync or charge you player which is a big hassle this is also not true i didnt think it would fit right either when i got this in the mail but it does fit you just can t button the case closed i can use the adapter or my wall charger which has the same size port as my zen thank god while this case is on my zen and then The case is to small for the player When i tryed to put the player in the case it was a tight fit when i finally got it in the case the bottom buttons on the player were being pushed down by the case This case also adds a lot of bulk to the player as well and is very uncomfortable to use Don t listen to anybody who thinks this product was great they are lying the case does seem tight but thats how you should want it you don t want your zen shaking around in the case do you this case does not press the buttons down it does take some getting used because you have to press harder to get to the buttons but the scroll pad is right there in the open so you don t have to worry about that I have had this case since i bought my zen i bought it on ebay for 10 bucks yes it does seem to add some bulk to the zen but i like it ive dropped it twice all ready while in this case and there is no damage it actually seems to have some shock absorbtion due to its studriness thickness and people whining about the beltclip the only time i put the zen with case in my pocket is at the gym i put it in my pocket and the clip on the outside of my shorts i am upside down when i do decline bench press and upside down when i do situps it has never fallen out or even seemed like it was going to slide out of my pocket if you care about your zen like i do this is probably the best case to get for it best ive seen anyway dont go for them cheap rubber plastic covers you know which ones i am talking about Also on the inside of the cover flap there is a secret slot where you can put money or an ID even its sweet yes high five people seem to be knit picking this thing in alot of the reviews i ve read buy this case and learn how to use it before you get on here and roast it all right ive had it as long as i have had my zen and it is great no matter what you are doing 
Thin Functional Protective Best Case for 2G Nano I did a great deal of research in choosing a case for my new iPod I decided on the iSkin and I have been quite satisfied with my decision I do remember however being a bit confused as to just how this case worked So to clarify for future buyers the case is comprised of First a thin transparent silicone rubber sleeve The sleeve covers most of the front and back including a slightly thinner cover where the wheeel would be placed This ensures that the wheel maintains its touch sensitivity while also being protected The skin does not however cover the screen and a portion of the back is also exposed to attach an optional belt clip This sleeve can also come in various colors but I used the clear one to highlight the natural color of my iPod Second a hard clear plastic front plate can be snapped on to the front of the iPod once it is placed in the silicone This hard case does cover the screen and all of the front of the iPod except for a hole for the touch wheel Once attached the hard cover is firmly held in place Put together this case provides exceptional protection The silicone is very thin yet protects against ordinary dings and scratches The hard plastic protects the front from impact and the screen from scratches The best part for me is that even with both the silicone and the hard cover the iPod Nano still retains its very thin size the case is not bulky in the least In conclusion I highly recommend this case for anyone who purchases an iPod Nano Protect your investment 
Nice Product well made The iSkin fits the nano very well It protects however it doesn t take away from the slim design The clip on the back works for most applications such as belts bag straps pockets The only complaint is that the clip isn t spring loaded so that it will work on jackets and shirts I was impressed that the touch controls still work through the two layers of material Overall it s a good product and worth the price 
iPod Nano 2G iSkin case I love it It is exactly what I had in mind There is the silicone skin complete cover with a plastic shell on the front The shell covers the display and there is a cut out for the click wheel that is covered by the silicone skin The system comes with three silicone skins clear black and glow in the dark and one shell there is the option of a belt clip I don t use that works well too The bottom is open for both connections The hold button on top is a little tough to get if your finger nails are very short however There is an adapter as well for the iPod dock For me this is the perfect case 
Great product This was a great buy I have an iSkin for my 30GB iPod and I loved it So when I bought my mom an iPod nano for Christmas I chose the iSkin for the nano to protect her product The plastic protection for the nano iSkin is different than that for the regular iSkin as it clips OVER the rubberized skin rather than under it but the design carries it off perfectly One small complaint was the instructions for removing the belt clip they didn t adequately explain the removal leaving me worried that I d break the clip but with some small effort I got it Great products and a great price I have researched all kinds of protection for iPods and these are the best 
Good choice for an ipod case The belt clip is a bit fragile so you need to be careful when replacing the cases Good choice for a fair price 
A bit pricey but well worth it The price was the only thing that continually put me off of this product but once I finally decided to give it a try I found that it s really a nice protective case for your nano The inner silicone layer which you get three of in different colors covers the nano perfectly even providing click wheel protection without compromising the sensitivity of the wheel like other cases can The hard outer shell protects the screen very nicely and stays in place well The only things I don t like is that you only get one of the hard outer front pieces two would be nice to have just in case something happened to the first so you wouldn t have to go and buy a whole new pack I do recommend this product though as it protects the iPod nano without changing any of its functionality and keeps the size almost exactly the same 
PERFECT case for the 2nd generation nano I was looking for a silicon skin with a hard plastic screen cover Most other skins use the thin film protector This one has hard plastic over the silicon skin The click wheel is behind a layer of silicon and it is just as as responsive as if there were no skin It includes a dock adapter so the docking is still snug and secure This fit my needs perfectly and several drops later the nano is still undamaged 
Awesome This comes with 3 silicone sleeves and one transparent hard cover to be used with either sleeve Keeps iPod protected while maintaining it s slim profile Click wheel works well even under through the silicone The package also comes with a special iskin dock adapter so that you can dock charge your iPod without having to remove the case extremely convenient The only con I ve found so far is that it can be difficult to move the hold button with the silicone sleeve on but it s fairly minor in my opinion 
Excellent Excellent case to protect your ipod The rubber smells weird at first but it fades away eventually Don t buy a cheap case and get this one 
The shoes were perfect They came just the way they looked Perfect size and style 
beautiful but NOT a sz 9 These boots are sized very oddly My guess is that they are 1 to 1 5 sizes smaller than they say My size 7 5 mom got these gorgeous size 9 boots and she s loving them so not a bad purchase over all 
very stylish and comfortable This boot is nice and sturdy goes great with a nice pair of jeans or a long skirt I love wedges 
Weird Fit I do not have large ankles or calves but these boots fit TIGHT I ordered a 1 2 size too large but I was still barely able to zip them up 
Pretty good I like the color on these jeans since it s nice and dark without unflattering areas of fading like on some other jeans The fit is good as is the length as long as you don t dry them in the dryer My only gripe is that they stretch out pretty quickly and get saggy Other than that they re great 
So ho Comfy These jeans fit perfect in every way Just enough stretch to conform to my curves without being constricting The classic fit in the hip and thigh is perfect for me because my thighs are large Most other boot cut jeans are slim through this area Also the dark wash is perfect for making an outfit look classy while being casual One drawback is that you can t tell they are designer jeans There s no logo or anything to indicate that these are DKNY if I m paying the price for designer jeans I d like some indication of them being DKNY 
So comfortable I love these jeans They are super stretchy and super comfortable Be careful however the dye from the jeans can stain white tops Oh and the inseam really does shrink when washed so skip the tailor if you are petite 
Great They are just what I wanted and couldn t find in our town They fit great and came in timely manner 
BEST SLIPPERS EVER I have been purchasing and wearing these slippers for a few years now and they are fantastic Lots of love for these very comfortable slippers 
My Slippers Best prices online for this particular product very fast shipping and terrific product Thanks so much 
Really Cute and Comfy Sexy too They do seem to run small but it s really more getting used to boy short fit in the bottom Once used to it they re really comfy and sexy too 
Sizes These boyshorts are wonderful They are of good quality and are very cute The sizes run small so I have to go up a size or two when purchasing them but after doing so they provide a snug and comfortable fit 
chonies I think these chonies are great I had a guy tell me you have really nice panties 
Great shirt great service these shirts are great and the shipment arrived earlier than expected Thanks a lot 
The best plain shirt I ve ever worn Funny I know I have to laugh at myself writing a review for a T Shirt of all things but I gotta tell you this is no ordinary T shirt A year ago I bought one of these shirts in a local store and fell completely in love with it It s now a year later I love it just the same and I can t find them anywhere except Amazon thank God The one I have just happens to have a silkscreen on it and after a year of constant use for work the silkscreen still looks great When you compare this shirt to a 100 cotton shirt these wear MUCH lighter cooler even though it says heavyweight Don t let that scare you as it s not heavy at all With constant washing over the last year the Hanes shirt has kept its color unlike my 100 cotton shirts of the same age which have faded much faster Also if you tend to perspire these shirts will wick away the moisture more quickly and will not show it nearly as much as a 100 cotton shirt would Also nice is that they don t shrink or wrinkle I wish I had known about these shirts years ago Don t kick yourself years down the road when you buy one of these shirts by accident and wonder where its been all your life like I did get it now and enjoy it 
Hanes 5170 is the best plain shirt ever I got sick of wearing 100 cotton white undershirts because they would continue to shrink and deform indefinitely So I tried these 50 50 shirts and they ve done the trick 
Good shirts great price Hanes make good products and at this price you really can t go wrong They re certainly comfortable durable and affordable which is pretty much all ya need 
GREAT SHIRT Perfect shirt They have all colors and all sizes for very low price I bought T shirts on here for only 2 66 in a mens XL and a rare color Great Product For Low Pric 
Best Bra Ever I love this bra It is so comfortable and I don t have to deal with falling straps anymore I ve had a hard time finding ones that fit and this fits so good I now own three one in each color Also the online price was fantastic All in all I feel I got a great deal and a fantastic fitwith all the comfort I could ever imagine Thank you Maidenform 
New Favorite I bought this bra in black and I love it so much I am getting it in all colors The lace is not itchy at all It has a great push up effect and it is so comfortable 
Comfortable I bought this bra in all three colors I like the way it opens in the front and it is very comfortable yet sexy with the lace sides and back 
comfy for everyday wear but still sexy I m very happy with this bra a great buy for the price It s very comfortable gives a nice smooth push up and it seems very good quality It s great for wearing with sexier clothing that you don t want your straps showing or you want alittle extra oomph I ll probably buy more in different colors 
Chicago Bears sweatshirt This sweatshirt was perfect as a gift for my son He loves the Bears and this shirt is well made and looked great on him The sale was fast and easy on line I d purchase from this vendor again 
The perfect bag for college students After reading quite a few negative reviews for this bag I thought I would write a review to clarify something This is a messenger bag not a backpack A messenger bag was and is never meant to hold all the items a backpack can So basically if you re using this bag for school purposes keep this in mind This bag can hold items for possibly up to 3 classes So while it s perfect for a college student who might have a class then another class right after it This bag would be horrible for a high school student who might have to drag home texts for six classes Of most messenger bags the Elefunk bag is probably going to be your best choice cause of its size and number of compartments We have 3 of these bags 2 of which are used for education and the third is used as a utility diaper family bag For education as I stated before it s best for college students The main compartment is spans out and can hold 2 college texts binders and study guides snug Keyword there is snug cause it s not big enough to carry more Inside the main compartment is a little sleeve held tight by a velcro patch I use this to keep my study guides from my texts Okay next comes the the front pocket attached to the main compartment This compartment is big enough to fit my 12 inch iBook in a neopreen cover or a 13 inch MacBook bare Warning if you place your MacBook in this pouch careful how you toss this bag around cause it offers no padding and is very unforgiving Inside this front pouch is a zippered sleeve fine for putting loose change or maybe id cards or what not Next to the zippered sleeve are two pouches for pens and pencils even a TI calculator that is if you re not planning on putting your notebook in that pouch Don t worry though cause attached to that pouch on the outside are two zippered compartments opposite one another to the front pouch On one side I put my black leather data file and on the other side I put my TI 89 calculator Then that leaves the flap which is secured to the bag using strong plastic clips On the front of the pouch is a zippered compartment Which I pretty much can only use it to pack up a couple magazines to read if I m waiting between classes You can also use it to pack up headphones or earbuds to listen to you iPod or whatever As for the shoulder strap it s about as comfy as it s going to get Keep in mind you re lugging 20 to 30 pounds of books and supplies it s not suppose to feel like a Chinese massage But I can t complain As for a family bag Eh I wouldn t suggest this to a newly mother who wants to go down to a mall Cause stores will not let your take this bag in there But if you re on a trip or going on a flight this bag is excellent You can pack away all your babies needs and other essentials Anyway I just didn t like seeing a product I use and like getting knocked cause a couple people misjudged how to use it properly Again if you re taking more than 2 or 3 classes at a time this bag isn t for you But if you re a run of the mill college student who takes a class or two at a time then goes home This bag is a must 
He loves it My poor son got deprived of backpacks and bookbags because of being homeschooled but now that he s a college student he can carry books This means the 5 star rating might be biased by the sheer pleasure of simply having something to feel like fitting in with the crowd but to be fair and honest about this product I admit it does look like a quality item It s built practical looks good and having to guess I d say it s probably better suited for college use rather than high school For some odd reason being in college doesn t require as many books to be carried in one day as I see what high school students have to carry If this bag was a dual set with each bag on opposite sides it would seem to resemble the old fashioned saddle bags except it s not leather is maybe a little bit larger in capacity and has plenty of individual compartments and zippers 
Cute and Painful I could not wait to get this bag When I did I found out that it was not all that it was in for I have to walk home and it really hurts my back Plus it does not hold much I had the problem of having to much books This does not help It was a waste of 40 Plus how do you clean it 
Great Bag For years I ve been buying JanSport bags for school and to use on trips This bag I just got to help me through my Sophmore year of High School I love JanSport because they have sturdy bags that can last being packed to the brim with books and shoved down bleachers you know typical high school stuff It is also great for going up in the mountains cause when you kick it down a cliff it won t bust YAY This back rocks my socks and you can decorate it with pins and patches and stuff to make it your own I would recommend it everyone 
nice Fast shipping A+ seller Pretty Good but zip lock bags work the same The bags are huge though 
Best choice They are comfortable warm with out socks too priced affordable easy to get on Get lots of complements What more can I say but the best choice 
Boots The boots are great If i have socks on they fall off when I walk if I don t have socks on they rub the back of my heel a little Shipped fast Decent price 
bearpaws They are great They fit perfectly Anyone who buys these boots will totally love them 
Warm Feet with Flair I love these boots I wanted the style and look of an Ugg without breaking the bank My feet stay dry and warm in the cold Michigan winters but I also feel fashioable I get compliments on my Bearpaw boots wherever I go 
I wear them everywhere I bought the sand color Bearpaws and LOVE THEM I would recommend you buy a 1 2 size smaller because they do stretch a bit I m a college student and being comfortable is key these do the job I m sad spring is coming because then I won t be able to wear them that much 
Great Buy Great boots for a great price Really warm and comfortable Come fast I am very happy with them 
Oh Bearpaw how I love you I have been wearing Bearpaw boots for three years or so they are warm cute and incredibly comfortable I first bought them when I moved backeast Having never lived where it snowed I was very worried about the cold but not about to blow hundreds of dollars on Uggs I happened to find Bearpaws at a local shoe store and bought a pair and WOW On the coldest days I could wear em without socks which is good because I hate socks and be toasty as could be They last forever too and are easy to clean Yay Bearpaw 
Awesome shoe for the Price These really are very comfortable I can wear them for about 8 hours with no problems However I still would not wear these on a day that required constant walking as they are not walking or running shoes I like that they do not have laces to tie or come undone I am a plus size women and these still fit my feet great 
love thes sneakers i absolutely love these sneakers i wish they came in pink they are very comfy and easy to put on and off 
Excellent purchaise I just started wearing my new sneakers yesterday to go to work and im already in love with them I m a dentist in Caracas Venezuela so this purchaise came from far away Thanx for this recomendation 
very comfortable shoes this is a well worth purchase that i ve made from amazon It is well fitted and it s so comfortable Skechers doesn t seem to fail me 
Very comfortable Comfortable from the first wearing They are lightweight great for easy summer days but not so great in support or holding up to prolonged walking The sole just didn t hold up to my first time of day long walking At the right price they re a great shoe for kicking around in 
skechers womens sneakers I have bought skechers in the past from department stores for double the price These are grea 
Love my Skechers The sneakers arrived in a timely manner and the price I paid was way below the price for these sneakers 
Great Shoes Very comfortable I wear this where I work as a nurse and they wear well all day What I love about them the most is that I don t have to tie laces I do purchase a half size larger in Skechers because they seem to run a tad bit short in length Great shoes Highly recommend these 
Great deal Shoes looks great comfortable light and easy to wear Great addition to my casual ensemble Was a terrific deal 
VERY CUTE ON SNUG FIT AT TOES These are the cutest shoes and really sexy on they were a little snug in my toes but hey these are heels you cannot have a tennis shoe comfort fit in a tall sexy heel Just the compromise a girl s gotta make sometime Wonderful value overall 
We just love ours We have several pieces of Skyway luggage including this model All of them take a beating and still look and work great so I was surprised by the other reviewer s problem Our zippers work very smoothly including the interior ones and the zipper pulls are generously sized with rubber inserts Many bags just use thin metal ones that quickly break off after rough handling at airports In addition to the sturdiness and ability to retain it s good looks the organization of the bags are clever and you can choose from some unusual colors making it unlikely anyone can mistake your bag for theirs 
Josh s Reviews These things are awesome Really comfortable and sexy Keeps everything in place and my girlfriend loves the way they look on me and that s always a plus 
Pricey but wears well As somebody else noted it keeps everything in thier place Goes good with tight jeans Comfortable while sitting 
Comfortable and Sexy Stretches to fit you exactly The smooth fabric holds everything in place Contrast waistband and package support make this underwear look very sexy I suggest the black color Highly recommended 
Great Coat Better than I expected and shipped very quickly S K has great service 
Nice shirt unexpected size The shirt was exactly what I had expected but I was unaware that puma sizes run big The medium was definitely comparable to a Large anywhere else but still really like the item Good buy 
Comfortable and no panty lines These are very soft and comfortable Plus because of their boy short shape they don t show panty lines Also they don t ride up like allot of boy shorts do 
These would completely cover a midget s hands While wearing these you can still pick your nose or scratch your crotch If you desperately needed to cut your nails you wouldn t have to take them off What I love most about these gloves is that only the upper halves of my fingers are cold What a deal 
Wash then wear I liked the look of the item but I got the black and it made my skin turn black After reading the label I put in the wash and it came out great no more black on my clothing and skin Very warm and heavy 
Sizing chart for item wrong I ordered this jacket in this size based on the sizing chart provided When it arrived it was not even close to the size as stated I contacted customer service and was assured I would not be charged for shipping both ways However my refund notice arrived today and I was charged 10 for shipping It would have been cheaper just to keep it and eBay it 
Nice jacket nicely made make sure you order it large enough as it runs alittle small the colors are nice and the material is really soft would definately recommend 
This is a wonderful jacket This jacket is beautiful It is washable suede and when I took it out to try it on my 6 year old said it smells good I got quite a few compliments when I wore it to church I love that it has snaps It is excellent quality well made I bought the size I wear never thought to buy it bigger and am very happy with it 
Nice Jacket Wish I Hadn t Bought Big I followed the advice of the other reviewers and bought big For me the 1X is a bit too big even though I often buy that size since I do not like tight jackets The blue color is beautiful though and the craftsmanship is good If it goes back down to 19 xx and you are on the fence I would definitely go for it 
This is a GREAT jacket I love this jacket I bought the crimson color and have received a ton of compliments Only wish I had ordered more at the 19 90 price 
perfect jacket Edited to add 2 13 07 I washed my jacket for the first time and it still looks perfect I think it shrank just a tiny bit which only made it fit better If I can give this jacket 100 stars I would I have yet to wear it arrived today tried it on and I LOVE IT It s the perfect weight for Texas winter and would transition well into spring My only regret like everyone else who has reviewed it is that I did not buy one in each color I monitor Amazon s prices almost every 2 hours so hopefully I ll be able to buy a couple more when the prices drop The jacket is definitely great quality nicely lined and does not smell or stink sign of high quality tanning process I m wearing another non washable suede jacket that cost 4 times more and it reeks of tannins Ugh A caveat though I did not go by Amazon s sizing chart I searched all over the web for Live A Little AMI s size charts and Nordstrom s has it Go by that chart instead of Amazon s for a perfect fit For those who hesitated the last time when this baby drops in price again go for it Well worth the money well worth the time and well worth monitoring Amazon hourly for 
Beautifully made would love to buy more This jacket well exceeded my expectations I was lucky to get the Myst Blue at 19 90 and now that I ve come back to purchase the black the price has gone up I ll watch and hope it comes down again as I could easily justify purchasing several more in other colors at the original price I paid 
Lovely Lightweight Jacket I was hesitant to try a 1X but am so glad I did I only wish I had ordered two at the 19 90 price I got this one for It s soft suede a nice tailored look but not too snug I ll continue to watch if the price goes down in order to get another color other than black 
Unless you have the 300+ for the real thing this is the one you want Quality product from top to bottom Sewn on name patch on the back solid screen printing of other information Team number GSH mark in this case stripes etc make this worth the money you are going to pay for it I told myself I would buy one if the Bears made it to the Super Bowl being a fan since I was a kid and when I got it I couldn t have been happier Actual Reebok product official product license Buy one and Represent and Rally 
Urlacher Jersey Very nice jersey shipping was very fast Wish the Bears would have won the Super Bow 
Replica jersey I purchased this item for my daughter for Christmas and was very pleased It shipped on time and had it not been for the big blizzard in CO at Christmas time she would have had it in plenty of time She loves the Jersey too good quality and looks just like the authentic jerseys for much more money 
Great gift item My boyfriend looked great in this jersey on Christmas day He loved it and it fit him perfectly Go Bears 
My boyfriend LOVED the Jersey I bought my boyfriend this Jersey for Christmas and it was his best Christmas present The quality of the Jersey was great and the size was perfect It was definetley worth the 80 00 I spent and I know he will wear it for years to come 
Cuddlydud products Peek A Boo Camisole We have purchased these items online before and was very happy with them They are reasonably price and look and feel very good when wearing them I highly recommend these camisoles 
Pretty good wallet It s a little bigger than I d like for a tri fold the place for bills extends slightly over the rest of the wallet making it longer than a credit card but good overall It holds a bunch of stuff without being too fat and looks nice 
A Real Jock s Jock It is very rare to find a jockstrap that isn t too tight around the crotch and too loose around the waist The McDavid Black Jockstrap fits like it has been taylored to your body It is made out of materials that feel softer than cotton The waistband and leg straps do not dig into the body and feels great to wear everyday The support you get with this jockstrap is amazing The McDavid Black Jockstrap provides enough support without the feeling of being restricted By far this is the best jockstrap I have ever worn 
Great gym bag This bag is great for people who need a lot of organizing space for their gym stuff Lots of pockets yoga mat holder is great bottle holder fits all standard sized gym and water bottles The only con is that if it is not filled the bag tends to fall on itself 
Great bag just needs shorter handle As a spinning instructor a good compact bag for my gear is essential This one is a very good size easily fits my shoes water a change of clothes wet clothes and bathroom products The large side pocket is great with all the smaller pockets inside and an extra side pocket outside perfectly protects my video iPod Only problem is the carrying handle which will not stay tight to fit correctly on my shoulder Otherwise an excellent buy 
Love Love Love this bag I am so used to having a gym bag that I have to throw stuff into and dig around for my ipod in and when a workout is one of the first things in the morning it always feel I start the day off so unorganized But not any more this bag has a compartment for everything I swim so it has a dry compartment that will keep my fins away from my clothes and it rolls up and expands to accomodat those who would not use it The front pocket has a pocket for everything so no more digging through a black hole to find my keys there is a nice little hook to hold them and a pocket for my ipod The strap and handles are padded so the days when your gym bags gets weighed down at least it doesnt cut into your shoulder The straps on top are perfect for an extra fleece jacket and the option for a yoga mat to clip to the outside is ingenious No matter what your sport this bag is built for it Really couldnt be happier with this bag 
Really good workout for core as well as cardio I Loved this workout it really got the heart rate up and gave me a good cardio workout as well as toning For those who said it hurt their back or neck you have to roll your shoulders back and down and relax your neck also you have to have your abs tight throughout the whole workout or you will strain your back I will rotate this workout it s Great 
Not your usual FIRM workout but still very good I am sort of a workout junkie to be more specific a FIRM workout junkie I like how intense the FIRM is and I sort of look for that in the workouts that I do Now this workout is good not as intense as the TransFIRMer workouts that were just out Don t get me wrong I have the 6lb ball and you use it for 90 of the workout At the end I was definately ready to put it down so it did work me out Pros Different change of pace using the ball lots of moves that strengthen your core a fun and different stretch at the end using the ball Tina Smalley is a precise leader that is easy to follow Cons I miss the old FIRM master instructors that were in all the other videos Just Allie and Allison were in this one They didn t even introduce the others There was no changes in weight which used to be the way to spot an ineffective workout according to the old FIRM tapes And lastly In my humble opinion the ball is a little gimicky A good 5lb weight held on the dumbell ends would work about the same Still worth giving it a shot for different days You ll sweat but you ll wonder Is this REALLY the FIRM 
Had to return am left without any product I ended up having to return the Cargo Pants to exchange them for a larger size I used the accompanying instructions and form returned them on time to the company of origin but have no pants now after quite a few weeks Could someone at Amazon help me 
Cargo Dickies lots of storage I bought these for my boyfriend for christmas As a mechanic pockets and style are essential He has a drawer full of the cell phone double knee dickies but when he receieved the CARGO dickies he makes me wash the 2 pair in between wears so he can continue to wear them The Right Cargo Pocket has an internal smaller sectioned off pocket where your cell phone fits nicely at least ours it does we have a tmobile slider T809 
Quick shipping product as advertised Very happy with these they re very comfortable and TWO colors each Pleased with transaction 
Keep it with you anywhere you travel Aside from being both great looking and exceptionally light and amazingly waterproof water fears this thing I use the Minimal whenever I travel It packs away very small so I can keep it in a small pocket of a carry on When ever I need it I can unfold it give it a sharp shake and presto it looks like new The red accents are a subtle plus 
Adam s Rib by Gold Toe These are great socks I ve been wearing them for years They last forever and never lose their stretch and form 
Who Needs Victoria s Secret I ordered this for my wife and we were both very happy with the product In the beginning we weren t sure how one size can fit all My wife is 5 6 and about 125lbs We took a risk and it paid off Both pieces fit perfectly and we will be back for more Good bye Victoria s Secret lingerie 
a product best avoided piicture is misleading The garment is very loose fitting It is a thong not a jockstrap Sorry I bought it 
WOW New to the gstring thing but I got these so that I could model for the wife They are quite comfortable Dont even realize the string is there The only problem was the price But hey the ladies money on Vicky Secrets we can spend some change on some Gregg Homme s 
The most intense my wife saw me in these and lots of sperm flowed all over the gregg homme 
Sexy I gave this bag to my girlfriend for a trip to denver CO where she was presenting to a large group of people She said that the bag made her the hottest sexiest woman at the meeting I agree 
computer tote Lots of space for computer and all items associated with the computer plus extra space 
This bag is the perfect accessory This bag is very stylish and also very functional The interior pockets for pens and cards come in so handy I highly recommand this bag 
U S Luggage Tote The bag is perfect if you are looking for a computer bag however there is not much room for anything else I was expecting it to be a little bigger but it is a great bag otherwise 
Durable and roomy inside Very roomy I can put my mouse celfon charger etc Plus it s padded inside so I don t have to worry about my Macbook being tossed or getting wet the material is water repellant when I m bringing it around with me 
Stylish Durable This product is made of nylon which doesn t allow for rain to penetrate my items I load it full of school books and my laptop and the handles haven t even thought of giving out this bag is tough I ve had to force the zipper shut and it has never split I highly recommend this bag it s amazing 
laptop bag I just recieved my bag and I love it The bag arrived about 4 days after I ordered it The bag fit my laptop perfectly At first I was hesitant since the description states fits most 15 laptops I have a DELL INSPIRON E1505 and it fits just nice There is still plenty of room for my 5 subject notebook and cell and battery charger mouse The material is nylon and the handles are very sturdy I also like that it zips on the top The padding inside is also nice I would definitly recommend this product to someone looking for style looks more like a purse and also durability 
good item great item looks smaller in the picture then in real life perfect for laptop 
Perfect This laptop bag is great because it has the following features 1 Zips up on top which you can t really see in the pictures 2 Light interior so you could find everything easily in the bag I got the green so cute 3 Very roomy inside Plenty of room for laptop thick files or notebooks books plus additional pockets for phone pens and other doodads we find essential in this day and age 4 Very padded so that it can be tossed around in your backseat and your computer will still work 5 Femanine chic without that faggy man bag look 
Outstanding I have been looking for this kind of tie tack for a very long time becasue it is great I helps you keep your tie down while still being able to see the whole tie 
buy it these work great stay behind the scenes and last longer than expected not a big fan on metal tie clips tacks bars or don t want to pay for one then these are perfec 
LOVE IT My husband thinks this is the best invention and the price is great I buy several at time and they each last for several months 
Works exactly as advertised I have to say this works perfectly and serves its purpose better than a stupid looking tie bar unless you re a security guard or used car salesman or something I don t think you want a tie bar showing The one caveat is if you don t line up the tie perfectly with the tiedown it will bunch up a bit but I don t think there was really any way they could ve designed around that You just have to adjust the length a little to make it work if that happens 
Does what it say This thing is very strong and serves its purpose just as it says It does not help with the smaller end flapping but it will keep the long end at bay 
great product keeps tie from flapping around and can be worn with any color shir 
Brilliant What a great item for all I use these in my business and are tey are the best A must for your purse or wallet 
Garunteed best value for your money I really did not believe that this item would work I lit three on a match and ordered three to prove it I still can t believe just how well it worked just perfectly as promised Where has this product been all my life I just happened to stumble over it looking for ties Thanks for your great product placement I can promise anyone reading this one thing YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY ANYWHERE on the internet 
Great Very tight and sexy but comfortable and great to wear Love it like it red 
Like nothing on Great design Excellent fit It is a minimal piece of cloth that you feel like you re wearing nothing the pouch area fit perfectly and looks great Like better in black 
My Favorite Sports Bra This sports bra is a great improvement over typical sports bras The fitted form provides solid and even support in a figure flattering manner Plus the bra looks good enough to wear with jeans under a transparent top

Light but very stable I purchased the Samsonite Aspire Lite 29 Expandabe Upright Suiter My suitcase is usually very full and close to the 50 lb weight limit with the airline Due to the weight of the suitcase I didn t have to worry about it this time My husband has a smaller but heavier Samsonite with very little packed and his weighed in at 48 lbs and mine at 44 lbs My suitcase is even larger which is wonderful We travel all over the world and now I don t have to sweat during baggage check One less thing to worry about 
FAST SHIPPING AND BEST WARMTH THIS COMPANY IS GREAT AND SHIPS OUT THE PRODUCT WITHIN DAYS I RIDE 4 WHEELERS EVEN IN THE WINTER AND THIS WAS GREAT WARMTH ON MY FACE WHILE RIDING 
cold weather mask This is a very good quality and funtional mask I use this under a full face helmet for cold weather Motorcycle riding priced right Velcro adjustable Long enough to cover neck area 
order a few sizes large Great jeans overall They really help keep you warm However order them the next size up from what you need My pair shrunk in the wash luckily I had ordered them one size up 
Assome Sexy tight mens Jeans Assome sexy tight mens low rise jeans Fast shipping Great low price I m getting more of the same jeans 
Great Fit Fashionable Levi s are usually my choice of brand for jeans and pants So when Levi s introduced this new fit the Slim Straight I purchased a pair and tried it out The 514 has a very large range of sizes and trendy washes and is usually on sale for a very reasonable price at 30 I recommend this fit for thin men tall or short who I think look best on Men who aren t comfortable with wearing tight jeans shouldn t purchase this fit because it is certainly figure revealing It s slimmer around the thigh unlike the Skinny 511 jeans where it s much tighter around both the calf and the thigh The waist is a low rise which I find very comfortable while wearing and the leg opening is a straight cut The 514 shrinks slightly when washed and dried I personally think this fit is better looking than the Skinny 511 which I believe is just a fad for now The Skinny has a sort of tapered mom jean look to it and I don t think anyone will agree that a guy looks good in that I suggest you try these jeans out before buying them and see how you like them As for me I like them so much I think I ll be purchasing another pair in the future 
I would not recommend this mat I was having trouble with slipping during my power yoga practice and thought that this mat might help It was worse than the mat I was already using In addition it has a terrible chemical smell The claim that they will give you a free yoga class requires that you enter all kinds of personal information before you can even see if you are eligible I would not recommend this mat 
Yoga Mat This is my first yoga mat and I am very happy with my purchase It sorta smells when you first take it out of the package but after a few uses it disappears Plus it is very pretty to look at 
Great Mat I bought this mat because it s not boring and I wanted something to inspire me to actually use it I ordered Amethyst and it s beautiful It s very sticky and I don t slip at all It is definitely a 5 star yoga mat but I have to say very thin even though I know this is the standard for yoga mats at 1 8 On top of my hardwood floors it still hurts the small of my back to do simple poses I am 23 and petite and I should have ordered a thicker mat 
Stunning soothing and won t fade Tired of sad slightly smelly mats at the gym I set out to find a yoga mat that would inspire me to put in the time even when I was busy Success Just normal thickness but the cushier mats tend to make me feel slightly unsupported The grooves provide good solid grip for your feet and though it was a little slick at first after I washed it and used it for a while it became nice and sticky But above all the reason you are probably considering this mat rather than a cheap er one is the beautiful pattern I selected the blue one and I ve gotten so many compliments More importantly it makes me enjoy my workout even more Ah and the kicker the pattern isn t just surface as the other reviewer pointed out but continues through the entire mat so you can t wear it away with use Certainly recommended 
Two Sides to All Yoga Mats Know Which Side is Up Yoga mats come in three basic thicknesses At 1 8 this mat is of average thickness Mats that are about half a thick as this one are good for travel or placing under a thicker mat to provide more traction The thick mats 3 16 are about 50 thicker than this one and are designed for those who need or want extra cushion At 24 x 68 it s of average length and width These mats are really beautiful As a professional I m normally not concerned with the look of a mat it s performance and ease of use are of primary concern However these mats are stunning You ll definitely get oohs and aahs from your fellow yoga enthusiasts when you roll these out The blue one looks like the ocean and the orange on looks like liquid lava I especially love how the design goes all the way through the mat and isn t just printed on one side The design on your mat will last as long as your mat will There are two sides to this and nearly all yoga mats Look carefully at the bumps on each side of the mat The larger bumps are designed to face upwards to cushion your hands feet and knees during poses while keeping your body from dangerously slipping out of alignment The smaller bumps are designed to face downwards to grip the floor and keep the yoga mat from sliding Many mats have a label on one end with the name of the brand This is typically but not always located on the up side The bumps will tell you for sure This yoga mat will increase in softness and stickiness with use So do most mats They start out mildly sticky and increase in stickiness the more they are used You will want to wash your mat when it first arrives so as to remove the thin film they get on their surface during the manufacturing process Instructions for washing the mat are included Once you ve washed and dried your mat you re ready to begin After using it for a while if you find the mat decreasing in stickiness each time you pull it out this is the typical sign that a light coating of dust or too much body sweat has accumulated on your mat and it needs a light hand washing with very diluted soap and water After washing roll your mat in a thick towel to squeeze out the excess water otherwise it will take forever to dry in the air Then air dry your mat unrolled inside and away from sunlight Hanging over the shower bar works nicely When you first unroll your mat you will find one end to be a bit curled Simply alternate the direction you roll your mat top outside once then bottom outside next or the end you start from curled end once flat end next time and you ll find it straightening out more or less over time I recommend buying your own yoga mat even if your yoga studio or gym provides them for you I ve worked in many studios and gyms over the years Sometimes management has mats cleaned often sometimes not If you bring your own mat you always know where it s been o Plus owning your own mat may encourage you to begin valuable practice at home For my students who have trouble with their knees in some of the poses requiring the body weight to rest on a knee I recommend temporarily folding over one end of the mat to get double cushion under the knee while still leaving one layer under the rest of the body This saves you having to haul more than one mat out each time you practice which can be discouraging especially to the beginner 
most comfortable This is the best sports bra I ve ever owned and I ve had many Highly recommended 
Nice to have This product is OK I can hear static sometimes and I have to find a station with the least amount of static When it works though it is a good product It also takes a few minutes to set up I can t set it up while driving 
3 in 1 car kit ipod The fm transmitter is awesome I would suggest anyone to buy it 
Great service and commitment Besides the service or quality of the product the service of the provider it s great due that for some reason the first attempt of sending it fails so the provider send me an e mail to confirm if I received the item as soon as I let him know that I didn t he do not wait for anything and he sent another one immediately so I appreciate his gesture and professionalism Thank you 
Effective product This item is not any fancy tech gadget just did what it said transmit FM signal on all frequencies between 87 5 108 0 Practically it is a bit combersome if your cigarette lighter is in a tight space for me my drink holder cannot open if this is in use Functionality is pretty simply just three buttons On off UP and Down for frequency tuning No programming functionality PRO Does exactly what it says it does Has a USB port to power other devices cellular phone PDA etc CONS No programming functionality some cars would not have enough space some feedback on the frequencies this may not be the fault of the device probably noise in atmosphere 
Fast delivery good quality Product arrived in a very timely matter and the item works great 
Fantastic I love how thin this product is It fits the iPod nice and tight and keeps one of the nano s best features its small size I also learned to appreciate the screen protector while on vacation in Florida on the beach The sand could have done a number on the nano s screen I use the armband while exercising and it works well Good product 
Acessory Kit I recieved this item very promptly and it was all that I asked for and more One issue I suggest if your buying the item for a mp3 mp4 it is somewhat too long but fits comfortably inside 
iPod Skin I m so glad I got this for my iPod Now I don t have to worry about scratches 
Great Experience Low price great product and quick shipment what more can you ask Highly recommend this seller and product 
iPod skin and lanyard I great value for the cost Fits the iPod well and makes for easy use 
Good to go as I m told The item was a birthday gift for a niece in which she says that she loves it So off of that response I cannot have any complaints 
Beautiful product fits perfectly Some skins don t fit well or can t be put on quickly This product was easy to fit and fit perfectly For an inexpensive yet effective way to protect your ipod nano this is the product you want 
new socks I was happy with my purchase Even though it took longer then I would have expected to recieve it it was still earlier then stated on the purchase receipt 
Great Socks These are the best over the calf tube socks I have ever purchased I plan to buy more of them 
Wonderful price comfortable but lose support Great item soft and comfortable but lose support around legs Stretches out not a major concern but could be improved 
Fantastic I bought these slippers as a Christmas gift for my husband They re comfortable easy to slip on and keeps his feet warm Not to mention he loves it cause he s such a huge Cubs fan 
Great shirt This has been a great shirt The color has stayed and is easy to wash and wear 
I love my shirt Thank you so much for my awesome shirt It s great 
not that comfortable^^ many people said this shoes is very comfort but it wasn t for me I feel little I don t know it is little narrow and the heel is not balenced 
Good for a narrow foot without a high arch These were beautiful shoes that I had to return I am taking a moment to write this in case there are other people who are sensitive to the shoe pressing down on the top of your foot at the part above the arch These shoes were so comfy I have several pairs of Clarks and haven t had this problem with them The leather was very stiff and just hurt on the top of my foot 
Comfy One of the MOST comfortable shoes I have ever worn No need for a break in period immediately comfortable and with wear the leather conforms to your foot Excellent shoe 
im an athlete who loves underarmor yea ive been an athlete in high school and college i like the fact that underarmour provides the technology to keep you cool or warm in different temporatures since i live in cali now the heat gear is something that im enjoying alot i highly recommend this product to all the people out there who love to work out or are athletes the product is also comfortable to wear 
Great Shoes These shoes run true to size and are super cute on Very comfortable and great price 
Now I want one I bought this purse as a gift off an Amazon wish list Now that I have seen it I want one for myself The purse has a lot of detail and looks expensive Very unusual The person I bought it for collects and knows purses well She immediately empied out the purse she was carrying and put her stuff in this one 
Exactly what expected This was exactly what I expected it to be It is long enough to view the ipod while it is charging We use it all the time and it is a great product The only thing I don t like is the bright blue light when it is charging It is a little distracting at night But other then that it is perfect 
good value I like capri pants for workouts due to being tall Most long styles don t come in tall sizes except Lululemons they are expensive These are nice for the cost color lasts longer than some more expensive pants Fits curves nicely not baggy I researched over 15 brands decided on these due to the cost fabric content I recommend 
Love em in black forest brown I just bought these today and I love them I was first dran to the sierra brown ones but quickly found they didn t go so well with my skin tone because I m a brunette So I tried on the darker ones and I love them So for blondes the sierra brown is better but I recomend the darker for darker haired girls They are so cute too and comfortable and supposedly last for a LONG time Hand made and the stitching is used on parachutes A little expensive for flip flops but not for what your getting 
When you re too skinny These are the best When they say skinny they mean it I cannot find any jeans that will fit this tall skinny child and not look to baggy which she hates We still needed the adjustable waist believe it or not But the difference was the slim cut through the hinnie and hips she looks like a regular little girl instead of a skinny girl with pants that are way to big 
Small bag is an excellent day bag I have a small microfiber Ameribag and I highly recommend it Carrying this bag is not going to eliminate your back problems or make it feel like you are carrying nothing at all on your back But the small bag is great because it forces you downsize the basic items you need to carry instead of bringing a backpack full of things The beauty of the bag s design is that you can place it in a variety of positions on your back shoulder based on where you are feeling back pain The pockets inside are very thoughtfully designed there seem to be just the right pockets for everything I carry this to work each day instead of a purse I also use it for day trips it easily holds a wallet digital camera phone travel umbrella and even a small sweater 
Just got it and loving it Shipping was fast and painless I just received this bag in size S and I already love it It truly does feel lighter I was looking for a bag that would fit me messenger style but sit on my back and not feel too heavy This fits all my essentials including a water bottle a thin one and feels light as a feather I can t wait to use it for school and travel I am 5 tall and the small size is perfect for me I suggest underestimating on size 
Secure comfortable holds a lot not just for bad back folks I recently purchased a small AmeriBag Healthy Back Bag in anticipation of a long summer trek through Europe I didn t think my backpack would be secure from pickpocketers and I wanted something a little more grown up Here are some reasons I am very happy with this purchase 1 Comfort My Healthy Back Bag is more comfortable than either a backpack or a large purse Its wide strap sets securely on my shoulder without a hand on it and it adjusts easily so I can carry it across my chest You can put a lot in it and not feel the weight you will not end up with your shoulder in knots at the end of the day 2 Security The zippered compartment openings fit neatly beneath my armpit there are interior zipper pockets as well so it s pretty hard to imagine someone s hand slipping into the bag without my knowing it The wide strap is reinforced so it would be hard to cut 3 Convenience This bag has supremely well designed features On the outside there is a flat zipper pocket good for your subway pass and a separate velcro pocket on one side a velcro pocket with a flap on the other and a small pocket suitable for say sunglass on the end The main zipped compartment has a wide variety of open pockets for perhaps a pen a camera a PDA or Ipod including one conveniently placed sidways so you can easily get at it from when it s still on your shoulder That one is perfect for a cellphone There is a flat inside zipper pocket that serves me well as a wallet 4 Capacity I ve got the small version of the bag and it will still hold a wide variety of daily essentials wallet phone camera ipod a paperback a compact umbrella and even perhaps a very light sweater The biggest problem with these bags is figuring out which one you want err on the small side they are more comfortable then choose whatever fabric and color suits your fancy You can even get them in a premium leather but my microfibre one seems easy to clean and a good value This is my favorite bag I can easily see several decades in my future with a Healthy Back Bag under my arm 
This Bag Really Lifts I really like my Ameribag It is much smaller than my last purse but it holds everything the old bag did What s more it feels so much lighter It has a compartment for everything and the compartments are a silver grey color which makes it so much easier to see something that is in my purse This bag is well worth it 
Ameribag Classic Healthy Back Bag I am very happy with this bag It is exactly what I thought it would be Thank yo 
Best Training Wear PERIOD I am an avid road cyclist and triathlete I train year round in all conditions Without hesitation Under Armour is the best gear to wear Wisks moisture stays tight you feel as though it is just a second skin Rile 
Under armour heat gear This is one of the best workout investments one can make It makes your skin feel cool even under a T shirt In a breeze or at a run the effect is amplified I was hesitant to try it at the price but I don t play or practice without it now 
Awesomely comfortable boots I bought this boots for an upcoming vacation to Colorado wanted to get in the cowboy mood and absolutely love them The wedge bottom makes them comfortable for hours on end The price was a steal and of course they look great with jeans and really cute with shorts too They fit true to size Warning When you first put them on the instep feels like they are going to kill your feet but alas they don t 
These boots are ROCKIN I have had lots of different styles makers of boots over the years and these are by far the best I have ever owned They are comfortable AND stylish I can wear them all day and night long and tootsies have plenty of room arch feels great feet don t overheat I love them and want more colors Black red turquoise I d buy them all especially if they were on sale for 29 like this pair was 
Very Small Bag This bag is very small The zipper does not have the ability to separate making the bag much smaller I returned the bag very disappointed 
Quirky humor I got this as a gift for my archaeologist outdoorsman brother He loves it 
my picky son says these are cool Hi I wanted to get my grandsons each an Army outfit cause Dad said they wanted army stuff grandpa was an army retiree He was telling me exactly what to get What was army and what wasnt When he saw these he says cool when I told him the price he says doubly cool I am proud to give these to my grandsons for Christmas They are the real deal Thank you for helping to make my grandsons Christmas a little more wonderful We will be back for sure

I love the shoes I where them everywhere they are the most comfortable shoes I own 
Like Walking On A Cloud When I purchased these I received them so quickly I could hardly believe it They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I have low back pain knee and ankle pain But since I started wearing these I feel so much better They are great and I would recommend them to anyone 
Fantastic Products The clogs are perfect They are very comfortable and the color is exactly what I wanted 
Amazzzzing I got these shoes about a month ago and I LOVE them They are very comfortable and I wear them to school evry day I broke into them in a few days and they feel great I would definitly recommend them to anyone 
Betula Suede Clog I love them just what I was looking for Just like a Berk but half the price My only disatisfaction is that they are not as comfortable as I hoped but I guess you get what you pay for 
Best Fit Ever These are the best fitting and most comfortable shoe I have ever purchased Thank God for the Birkenstock footbed 
very comfortable I didn t expect this material to be as comfortable as I have found it to be If it were ten dollars cheaper I would stock up It s more structured and not floppy 
Great wallet This wallet has everything Places for checkbook register cash credit cards ID pen and more Attractive leather smooth and supple Once fully loaded with all your daily needs it does tend to be a bit bulky This is not a wallet for someone that just wants to carry a few bills id and 3 credit debit cards It is too big for that I am on my 2nd one so far the first got all stretched out and loose from all the things I had crammed in it 
Convenience No more wallet in my back pocket for me this wallet is ideal for credit cards money ID and check book all in one Super soft leather makes it comfortable to wear in front pockets Large enough to carry and it even has key holders that you can hook keys onto Great wallet for hassle free access to all your valuables without having to bend everything in half like a regular wallet I never leave home without i 
Buy this now The leather is super soft There is more than enough room yet it s not bulky Top quality for less than a couple trips to that fast food place I ve had more wallets than I can count and this one tops everything You ll also get some free stuff in the box that makes it all the more cool Thanks Fossil 
Turfer Rainwear Awesome product You don t need to spend big bucks for some designer Keeps out all the wind and rain I bike commute and wear this over a suit and tie Works great Got product right on time Highly recommend 
Very Nice Was very pleased with the quality of the backpack love the leather feel Very good value 
Leisa This looks and feels like it was a very expensive bag I m so pleased with the purchase

Interesting product Bought this bag for work and its real nice Made from good material and the bag is spacious Has a suitable number of compartments Its good for students to carry books and also good to carry a laptop around Bag has a real nice design Great bu 
Very comfortable and sexy too If you re a man looking for a practical thong that you can wear all day this is it I know a lot of people feel that thongs should only be worn by women but for a guy nothing looks better under a well fitted pair of jeans and they feel great However never forget that mens thongs should only be worn by guys with slim to athletic bodies you women out there know exactly what I mean 
One of the best but not perfect This is the 3rd travel clothesline for me not because the previous ones broke but because I keep finding clothelines that offer better features This is the best one so far since it eliminates the need for clothespins is better at holding wet heavy clothes and the clothes don t slide My only complaint is I wish it had suction cups and clips on the ends like my other travel clotheslines so I could hang it in the bath shower or attach it to poles My previous clotheslines had those features and I used them alot To work around this I use a small carabiner on each end This travel clothesline would be PERFECT if it offered all those features 
Strong lightweight durable a great clothesline I have used this clothesline all over Europe and South America on multiple trips and I love it No clothespins are needed because you can attach your clothes inside the braid of the rubber It packs up into almost nothing and weighs almost nothing You take one end of the clothesline wrap it around something such as a pipe or a bedpost or even a doorknob and loop it through itself You then take the other end of the clothesline along with a small hook you have to get one separately and hook it to itself This can hold a lot of weight I ve had two pairs of wet jeans along with 2 pairs of wet shirts socks and underwear all on the line at the same time Sure it ll sag but it s no problem Don t get any of the clotheslines that have suction cups on the end what if all you have around is wood and concrete Then there ll be nothing to suction the cups to You can t really hang your clothes to dry in a bathtub when you share the bathroom with other people 
comfy and great i ve had these shoes for about 3 weeks and they are great it s hard keeping them clean but worth the time to keep them that way if i had more money i would buy another pai 
nice and comfy These shoes are very comfortable and nice enough to wear to work They fit very well 
Classic style but narrow I have this shoe in black size 10 It s comfortable and the style is classic yet refined However it is a bit narrow so if you have average to wider feet you might want to order a wide 
like the model name finnomenal this shoes are my favorite a very nice shoe Very confortabl 
Muy buenos zapatos O zapatillas no se Me compr� las negras y estoy muy contento Las uso para casi toda ocasi�n 
Great and comfortable This is one of the few shoes I ve had that literally doesn t require any break ins Fits snug and perfect Very comfortable 
very cool and good shoes i like it very much and its quality is super 
I love Crocs I have 10 pairs of Crocs and they are the best shoes I have ever bought I have the Beach 2 Mary Janes 2 Athens flip flops 4 pair and Endeavor 2 holeless Beach Crocs I have to say the Mary Janes are the cutest by far I wear Crocs all year round and have to make myself wear other shoes Everyone in my family wears them even my Dad who had never owned really comfortable shoes until he tried Crocs 
Better than Barefoot A cuter more feminine version of the ever popular clunky crocs Love mine Comfortable versatile and last forever Good support And in the hot AZ summer the airholes help keep my feet cool 
Perfect for the frequent flyer Holds everything I need for 2 4 day business trips in terms of toiletries lays flat and fits perfectly in my carry on luggage Exactly what I was looking for 
Back Up Bulb We all need a little light whenever we feel we ve lost the power in our home or a little light just to help us into those hard to reach places That is where the Stick Up Bulb comes in handy This bulb is a very convient and easy to use device that adds a little light without the need of electric wires or plugs It is simple and easy to hookup onto your walls and if you need to take it off it just just simply slides off the base and you can carry it with you I like it because it is inexpensive and really a great idea for any home big or small I definitely recommend this a whole lot Price B+ Convience A Overall B 
Great help in an emergency If there is a power shortage or any other type of emergency this is better than a flashlight because it can be lifted off of it s base and carried to any location you want to light I have put one in every closet and they have been very helpful in locating clothes in dark places 
BRIGHT idea I have been trying to find something like this but everything I tried just wasn t very bright But the StickUp bulb is actually bright About 10 times brighter than those little discs from Sylvania Now if they could just make one that looks a little fancier Still I like it because it s actually bright 
Great Comfortable Pump I m a flight attendant and this is the most comfortable pump I ve come across I like that the pointed toe isn t too pointed and the heel is just the right height If you are in between sizes go with the smaller of the two 
Great shoe very comfy This is a great shoe to wear at work especially It is comfortable and stable I don t wobble in it It feels about 1 2 size larger than marked I wear 8 5 and had to return for an 8 Wonderful cute shoe 
chemise I and my boyfriend enjoy this lovely little chemise However I wish the thong didn t tie together it s a little difficult putting it on Over all very good 
Chicago Bears Slippers Amazon had the slippers when the NFL Shop was sold out Awesome slippers Quick delivery 
Best Slippers ever I bought these for my dad for xmas he loved them they are so soft and very high quality 
Cute I was looking for the perfect case for my new Ipod This caught my eye immediately Roomy enough for both my Ipod and cellphone Perfect because I attached it to the handle of my purse for easy access I love the design Bought one for a friend s birthday and she loved it too 
Okay but not fabulous The best thing about the flexee bra camisole is that the bra is good and supports well The rest of it is okay but does not pull in my spare tire the way it was advertised in fact it tends to ride up Needs to be about 3 longer 
Awesome sandal This price was way less than retail and even below what I found at TJMaxx Very nice fitting and neutral wear anywhere sandal 
rockport bolivar sandals Sandals look and feel good However after using for a while they tend to flop a little on your foot 
Rock on ROCKPORT These are super comfortable shoes I thought they might be a little high for me but since they are a platform style they are great 
I got a big head Yes despite being labeled one size fits all this is a hat for big headed folk I wear an extra large about a 7 1 2 Nice and warm though It has a nice stiff brim Looks good with a fleece jacket 
beer drinking sandals Their cool just not as comfortable as i thought they would be I dont like that thingy holding my towe unlike other sandals that dont have a string in between your towe 
Fantastic Shoes Great Buy I had never bought shoes online before I was having bad luck shopping in the stores in the malls and not being able to find my size in what I liked So I decided to give online shoe shopping a try The shoes arrived on time and they fit perfectly I love them They are very comfortable I get lots of compliments on them They worked perfectly for dressing up a casual outfit when I went cruising on the Mediterrean 
Life saver for early pregnancy I am so happy I got these bands When I first noticed my clothes weren t fitting anymore around 11 weeks I went maternity clothes shopping and was completely discouraged by the lack of clothes for early pregnancy When I got my Bella Bands I automatically felt better about myself So far they have four fabulous functions that have been a life saver 1 Make shorter non maternity shirts appear longer so you can wear them for longer 2 Allow you to wear non maternity pants with the button undone even jeans 3 Hold the bands of maternity pants up so you can wear those earlier 4 Keep everything tucked in a supported so you feel more confident and less flabby So far I m wearing them tucked over once but I m sure later in my pregnancy I will expand them to full size and they ll be an added comfort and peace of mind EVERY newly pregnant woman needs to get these by month 3 
Totally worth it When I first purchased a bella band it was with my 1st pregnancy and I was still very small in frame to fit into ANY maternity clothes but my old clothes just didn t fit I reluctantly bought a bella band at a salesperson s suggestion thinking that it would be one of those products that I would come to regret spending so much money on Surprisingly it was the best thing I purchased when I was pregnant I actually was able to get away with not buying any maternity clothes and just wearing my old clothing but with the pants or jeans unzipped and unbuttoned In the last month however I had to wear more stretchy clothes even my jeans would not fit with the bella band But it is great because you can have it peek out from under the shirt you are wearing for a layered look It is just a great product Can t say enough good things about it I am now pregnant with my 2nd child and have used the same bella band It really keeps its elasticity Overall it was really worth it s weight in gold because I saved myself from buying so many maternity clothes 
A pregnancy MUST HAVE These bands are incredible and a must have for all pregnant women I work a corporate job and did not want to buy a whole new wardrobe of pants so I wear the bella bands every day with my work pants unzipped and no one can tell They look like you are wearing a tight camisole and even help to streamline unwanted pregnancy love handles I bought the 3 pack and have worn all of them several times I literally wear them everyday They are really comfortable and definitely buy the next size up I was a size 6 8 and a size two is perfect Fold them over in half for a tighter fit or wear the top half over your tummy like a cummerbund so it keeps warm in winter I am 20 wks and have been wearing them for 3 weeks now so buy them as soon as you start having to undo that top button They are really good quality and I washed and put mine the dryer by accident and it didnt even shrink Worth every cent 
Great Buy Great Look I am so happy with my Bella Band bundle purchase and so happy I bought the pack of 3 I was hesitant to spend the money on these but after searching the net for this and similar products figured I d give it a try BUY THESE EARLY LADIES I waited until my 24th week to buy the bands and today slipped on a pair of pants I haven t worn in 2 months unbuttoned and unzipped even but nobody could tell with the bella band on The look was cute and layered and not bunchy The nice material even felt great under my shirt and no more belly button hole showing I m going up to my skinny clothes box to pull out items I can wear with my bella band on I m so excited to use this now and post pregnancy PS they even came with a nice surprise bag of Skittles heaven to me 
Da Bears I love this long sleeve I got it quickly it fit and it s Da Bears 
Very nice shirt I bought this The colors are great the fit is great I highly recommend it 
Great Design Poor Quality This shirt is one of a kind It was the only dark navy shirt with a large Chicago Bears logo on it that I could find It was a little large for me but looked great the first time I wore it However after just one wash some of the logo started peeling off I can t imagine what this shirt will look like after next season probably will just be a navy long sleeve shirt buy this shirt with caution 
Chicago Bearns Touchdown Long Sleeve T Shirt The shirt had a small hole in it when it arrive 
GREAT FIT CORRRECT SIZE I love these sweats The only drawback I find is that they do not have pockets However most sweat pants don t have pockets so I am used to that They fit great but then again I ordered the correct size and did not count on my washing machine to turn them into the right size 
HORRIFYING FIT HORRIBLE QUALITY I had several of these shipped to my Mum in law s in California for sending to me in France where we work and live Because of a decent delivery speed and her thinking they looked OK I gave them a rating of 5 Stars Today after even having BOILED them in water hoping for shrinkage I am sad to say that nothing happened They are horrid to wear I oredered size small for all colours and the fit is that of XXXXXXXL DO NOT BUY THIS HORRORS I wish I could get my hard earned money back as now I m wondering if I was the brunt of a joke in Nightmare Alley You ve got to be con artist to sell these things 
Good Product It looks excellent My girlfriend said I looked more mature in this jacket The only thing is 14 99 is a little expensive 
Pretty nice jacket but some sizing issues This is a nice jacket at a very nice price The trouble I had with it is that I generally wear a medium and this jacket would have also fit me best as a medium So what s the issue then The problem lies in the sleeve length I had to get a large because the sleeves would have been too short at medium size Now it looks a tad over sized at the chest and waist but I rather have that than too short sleeves Also I purchased the brown jacket and it is a lighter shade of brown than what appears in the picture 
Awesome baby jeans I love these little jeans They look fantastic on my daughter I love that they are plain without any embellishments She s a skinny little thing and these jeans actually fit and stay up on her I probably wash then twice a week but they are holding up really well These are the best kids jeans I ve ever seen 
Great PJs These are all cotton and they hold up really well We received some that were owned by another family of three boys before they were handed down to us The hand me down PJs were the only ones that ever got holes Stains seem to come out really well too I haven t had any of the problems that were listed by other reviewers 
Great sleeper I m a mom with 3 kids All I can say is that I wish I had some of these sleepers when my oldest was a baby the zipper design is very convenient I highly recomend it 
Inexpensive leather boots I could not ask for more for these boots the price quality strong leather and design After all Charles David is a high end shoe designer and I got these for 59 99 and they re worth 259 00 However if you have wide feet prepare to having to take these boots to the shoemaker to be stretched I ll never buy shoes that I intend to wear very often from Guess again 
Pleased These are really good boots I am definitely glad however that I read the reviews before I bought them and ordered a half size bigger or they would have been extremely tight They actually were even a bit tight even at the bigger size but they have stretched and are quite comfortable The only thing that annoys me a bit is they are tighter on the calf than any other boots I have purchased I solve for that by only zipping them up about 3 4 of the way Otherwise I am happy with them I didn t think I would like the rounded toe as much as the square but have gotten use to it and like it 
Good quality but Beware Due to the previous reviews I did buy these a 1 2 size bigger but they re still tight in the ankle which is strange to me because I have bigger legs but small ish ankles I m hoping they break in though The quality is nice and they smell pretty good but the sole is INDEED SLICK I would NOT want to wear these boots anywhere treacherous and have already slipped on a rainy sidewalk so beware Oh and one more thing the toe box is VERY rounded and not exactly what I d hoped for but the square toe CD shoes were 40 more and got HORRIBLE reviews across the board for quality 
The Perfect Boot I received my boots yesterday and I love them They are very feminine I was happy I read other s reviews prior to ordering my boots I am typically between sizes and I order the larger size The larger size fits like a glove with trouser socks but thicker socks would make them too tight Thanks to everyone who wrote a review 
Way Cute I just got these boots in black and absolutely love them Too cute They look great for work and with jeans I can finally throw my old ones out YIPEE I would buy them in brown too if they had my size It was a good thing I read the reviews because they do run very small I normally wear a 6 or 6 1 2 and I bought these in a 7 and they fit perfect 
What a joke What a joke I baught it for my girlfriend and just got it today by UPS When I opened the box I found there is a huge crack on the sole Also there is a scratch on the leather The workmanship is not so good too I m going to return it Still not sure if I have to pay the shipment by myself 
CUTE CUTE CUTE CUTE CUTE CUTE Runs true to size which is kind of small by Charles David standards CD usually runs bigger so buy your regular non charles david size GREAT boots for everyday wear and very comfortable even with the high heel due to the rounded toe and platform Good material and construction Interestingly these boots are made in China not the usual Spain 
Satisfied These sandals are very bright in color and surprisingly comfortable there is extra cushion for walking Good summer shoe Delivery was prompt 
5 stars I was plesantly surprised at the comfort of the shoes and speedy delivery 
Azaleia Deco sandal I just received these sandals today and they are so cute and comfortable I had ordered Azaleia Fab last year and they were too narrow so I was afraid that these would be the same They are not the same They are wider and fit my feet just right I have a medium width foot and they are very comfortable and can t wait to wear them with shorts and pants Cute 
very good and sexy my girlfrind love this sandals they are very good looking confortable and easy to clean 
reef sandles all was great although i thought the shiping was to much other then that it was all good 
pants It is hard to find pants for my son but Dickies have pants that fit wear well and cost a fair price 
Best wallet I ve ever owned Been carrying the same Taxi brand wallet for about 5 years Well made durable and takes up very little room in my purse Highly recommended 
Well Made Super Functional I ve had this wallet now for about a year It is the most handy functional wallet I ve ever used The two seperate cash pockets are great I use one for receipts for business and one for checks and cash When the wallet is snapped close there is an external slot pocket that works great for ID and credit cards I routinely carry a few quarters and dimes for parking meters in the coin pouch Very comfortable to wear and classic styling that looks great when you pull it out I imagine this may be the last wallet I ever purchase 
It is ok The description of the item said it came with I Pod face screen protection but it did not I emailed the customer service team at cover case with hopes to return the item but they told me instead they would send me the screen protection and never did After waiting 2 weeks I emailed back the costumer service and asked that they either send the screen protection or directions on how to send the item back It has now been a month and they have failed to correspond so I decided to just deal with the fact I spent money on a case that didn t have what I wanted I ve been using it and the rest of it is ok although the silicone fits weird on the top and sometimes it bunches up making it hard to toggle the hold switch I ll probably by a new better case soon Oh well 
Perfect product When I excercied I carry my iPod in my hand So I needed a cover that would take the wear and tear of my running this is the exact product that I needed It is easy to get on and off and it provides an excellent gripe 
Rubbish The rubber does not go around the screen and is generally poorly designed The bit of sticky backed plastic thet supply to go onto the screen leaves bubbles of air on the screen I shall now be ordering the official Apple one in the hope that that is a lot better than this thing Hope that helps 
Much nicer then the picture This is a nice waist length jacket It is warm but not too thick probably to 40 degree weather It felt true to size The color I got was purple frost and it was a very nice color It had a lot of pockets Great deal 
I love these I bought these pants recently and I notice that I do more laundry so that I ll be able to wear THESE pants to as many yoga classes as possible They are awesome 
These Roll Down Yoga Pants are AWESOME I have to say that these are probably the best yoga pants that I have I love the fit even after many washings I have been partically concerned about the length and the length on these pants are great I would highly recommend 
Hardtail I bought the hardtail pants and I do like the way these pants fit But I really don t like that they fade pretty quickly I will buy them again I buy bebe sport and I have to say their pants are pretty good they don t fades as quickly I notice with their pants they either fit perfectly or they are too long and don t fit as good I want to try the SO LOW pants 
Great yoga pant I ve been looking for a roll down yoga pant for a long time and have always been disappointed They re either too long too tight or too loose around the waist These are perfect They are comfortable and continue to look good after many washings though the color does fade a little but that s normal I am about to buy my second pair 
Wonderful Fashionable Suede Clogs I have these clogs in the chocoloate color they look great The sheepskin lining is very soft and looks adorable They go with SO many of my outfits Plus they can worn be with or without socks 
Warm Feet Good quality Comfortable Color as shown on line Well fitted Very satisfied with style of fit 
Exactly as described Shopping with Land s End has always been a pleasure These slippers are exactly as described and delightful to wear My trust in Land s End continues 
Love mine I love these slippers my favorites so far I chose these for the soles so I could run outside if I needed to mailbox trash I toss them in the washing machine and the dryer Two complaints They make my feet a bit sweaty and hold on to smells so my feet get smelly so I throw them in the washing machine more often than I probably should Also the back of the heel is smushed from my wearing them and I can t get it to stay un smushed 
Wonderful Slippers These slippers are wonderful They really are warm and they are strong and supportive enough for you to go outside in them like to get the mail the soles are thick enough so if you step on a rock you won t get hurt When they get dirty you can throw them in the wash with all your other clothes and theyu come out like new I recomend puting them in the dryer though to bring them back to their brand new quality even though they do dry just fine without a dryer The only reason thses slippers are not 5 stars is because they tend to hold smells so the inside footbet can get kinda smelly after a while but despite this I strongly reccomend these slippers 
Charcoal Heather The soft fuzzy fleece is comforting and keeps your feet especially warm They are also washable You can toss these in the washer I don t put them in the dryer just in a bag and run them through the washer They dry fast just sitting on the dryer Favorite color Charcoal Heather but the other colors look especially tempting tonight It may be time for a second pair The Rebecca Revie 
Perfect for weekend hangout I bought three different colors of these pants Give you a sleek look with slim fit 
Skechers Women s Headway E2 Sneaker I love these So comfortable price great looks good very happy If you are looking for a great walking shoe this is it Will buy again in the future would highly recommend 
Scetchers Headway sneaker I purchased this sneaker for the beginning of school I am a teachers aide and I have many classes that I work in I have to do a lot of walkin in my job and I have troubled feet These sneakers are very comfortable and I only wish that you made them in black patent leather so I could wear them as a dress shoe Thanks so much 
The most comfortable boots I ever owned I m a boot guy My family and I just got back from a four day trip to Washington DC We walked many many miles in those four days visiting all the museums monuments the White House and everything in between My Skechers Tap Boots were the only pair of shoes I took with me In any other pair of boots my feet would have been killing me by the end of each day I can honestly say that never happened These are the most comfortable boots that I have ever owned The look and quality is 5 star too When this pair wears out I m definetly buying another 
dealer ok they sent wrong size i called they sent correct size pronto no return needed size chart had wrong inf 
Needs Better Packaging I m happy with the shirts from Land s End The package arrived in very rough condition There were about 5 large holes in the packaging and I could see the shirts through the holes The package survived either rough handling or possibly being tampered with enroute I don t know if I ll order from them again because of the packaging 
Good quality good price I ve been wearing this shirt on a regular basis and after a number of washes it still looks good 
Great dressy raincoat I bought this raincoat for my father who is of the generation that regularly wears such long coats He loves it and has been wearing it since Christmas It wind resistant water beads up quickly and it s good looking It was a great buy 
Jockey No Lines This underwear is great and doesn t give you lines The problem is that you can t expect it to last very long The problem is the elastic which is a very flat band of some type of rubber y material It just doesn t last very long It usually ends up breaking at some point after a few months and I NEVER dry these in the dryer either Nonetheless it is still just about all that I wear under most pants because I hate butt floss 
They live up to their promise I have more than 10 pairs of this Jockey No Panty Line Underwear I don t like wearing thong underwear but don t want visible panty lines either So these are perfect Jockey makes this underwear out of two different fabrics I prefer the ones made out of Tactel Nylon and Lycra Spandex There s another version made out of a fabric called Model That fabric tends to develop little balls and they take forever to dry Enjoy 
don t buy these slippers i know they re cute bunnies but the hole to put your foot in is to small to actually put your foot in i don t know who designed these things but they didn t think it through i ended up sending mine back so after tax i paid about 15 for them then i shipped them back for another 6 and i got refunded 9 99 WTF 
squeeze the jingle out of your pocket change The Rolfs squeeze coin pouch is easy to use and works great to keep your change handy However it also eliminates that annoying jingle of loose change rattling around in your pocket everytime you take a step making it sound like you re rattling a length of chain 
Great dress great price I love this dress It s adorable not too short I m 5 7 and everything is too short and looks great with leggings It s very deconstructed but that is OBVIOUS from the picture I wore it over a tank and w leggings it was very cute and not too over the top 80s for someone who has worn the stuff the first time around Also the seller is great fast shipping for a small company and very customer oriented they have great response time from a REAL PERSON not an automated system almost unheard of in online shopping I have 2 and am going to order another one 
Cute and easy I bought this shirt 3 weeks ago and love it so much I ordered 4 more Its cheap and super comfortable It can be dressed up for work worn casual with jeans over a bathing suit or even as a night gown after a long night out Its a great piece for the summer Does run a bit small the gray is a lot darker then the photo shows and isnt the highest quailty shirt I own but come on it s 9 All that said I love this dress and its a great base peice to build many cute looks 
Quality Item I love this dress but think it is a junior cut I will wear it with tights I think The material color and structure of this dress is very very nice I know I will have fun wearing the dress However had I known each item I bought had separate shipping charges I may not have made any purchases The s h on a few items were as much or more than the item cost Of course this is not this seller s fault and I thank him for this quality item 
Great fit When I first received my dress shirt I was dumbfounded It looked like someone had just cut the sleeves and made a hole on top of a plain sheet of fabric What it is this thing But once I got home and tried it one it was perfect It was fitted along the waist and loose on the top It looks nice with leggings I tried to wear it on it s own around the house but it is too short although very sexy I do not blame the other customers who did not appreciate the cut or style of the dress shirt Just like what the other customer said you probably would not like it if you ve never shopped at American Apparel before Also I wouldn t recommend this on someone who is skinny I don t think it would look the way it should on you And when I say skinny I mean Nicole Richie scarecrow skinny 
lovvve itt great fit great cut great fabric great color comfortable dress t shirt dress up down its perfec 
J Gu It s a cute dress Looks good over jeans Anyone who has a problem with the cut of it has probably never shopped at American Apparel before It s worth the 9 bucks 
duh I dont understand why people are complaining about this dress First of all I went to the American apparel store and the style is meant to be trendy aka the bottom was cut and it wasnt sewn together so dont blame Andrew for the quality and if you paid 9 for a dress dont expect designer stuff its a basic t shirt dress it looks cute it is on the small side the edges are cut but not finished you get what you pay for 
Not worth it I bought the jersey shirt thinking that it would look really cute over jeans When I opened the package I was apalled It looked like a pillow case with holes for sleeves The edges weren t stitched and the fabric was thin and cheap looking I have yet to return this item I will not buy from this company again 
Great Shoe I just got this shoe and it s awesome It comes about a 1 2 size too big though Nice leather and sooo comfy There is actually a little padded arch support Great shoe 
Pretty much useless My TSA cut it off the very first time I tried it Locks pretty much need to be disposable not special The TSA approved thing is a somewhat cruel joke Not all luggage is opened any more and if your lock survives it is likely only because it wasn t inspected and any lock would have If you are inspected it is unlikely the TSA people will bother rooting around for the TSA tool at least as far as my statistical data indicates If flying into the US from a foreign country use the cheapest disposable lock you can find If flying outbound if you tape a lock or a zip tie inside your luggage with a note for the TSA they have in my experience resealed my luggage after inspection 
Nice boots These boots look great and are pretty comfortable The only problem is they are not good for walking much because of the heel but the fit is very good I was impressed overall with them 
So comfy I purchased one of these a while ago and I just fell in love with it I have since purchased a few more from Amazon They so comfy and silky and I really love the design how it sits higher on the chest They are also very stretchy and not binding at all Definitely my favorite camisole 
Very useful travel tool A very useful thing to travel with The suction cups were absolutely worthless would fall as soon as anything was placed on the line and sometimes even if nothing was placed on the line but since you can wrap the line around something and hook it to itself that s not too much of a problem unless you can t find anything else for the cord to loop around The two twisting strands were very helpful no clips required The only challenge I ran into was finding places to hook the cords onto I had to get a bit creative with curtain rods and window bars and it won t stretch across an entire room but that is to be expected Overall I highly recommend 
AMAZING After having my baby my bust increased by four cup sizes to a G and I could not find anything supportive enough to workout in baby fat is not so easy to lose This solved my problem It is strong and comfortable and takes care of the cleavage problem Keeps the girls from bouncing around while running and exercising I recommend this highly for busty women who desire support It is worth the money And if like me you need a bigger band size than they offer buy bra extenders 
The best shorts I love these shorts They look great wear well and make me look good 
I hate shoes but these are ok As a person with short wide feet I have a terrible time finding shoes that fit and are comfortable These are really comfortable walking shoes neat enough to pass in a business casual environment 
great shoe I wanted a flat shoe for my wedding and didn t want to pay the 45 00 for the ones with full soles This shoe will do the trick I would probably like it even more if I could dance 
A tad too small Description says to order 2 sizes smaller than street shoe I normally wear a 6 5 and ordered a 4 5 They are just a little bit too small I should have ordered 1 5 sizes smaller than street shoe Other than that no complaints They are great shoes 
Outstanding Online Experience Great all around order experience Immediate shipment rapid delivery and product was exactly as described on website Top quality material same for workmanship Meets my need for transporting widescreen notebook and accessories Will do business with US Luggage again 
good boot for good price This boot is neatly styled if somewhat undersized A a good deal for a GOOD PRICE suggest you order one half to a full size larger than what you normally wear for most comfortable fit 
Good shoe but get a larger size This is a good deal but as others have stated it is smaller than normal The last time I got a pair of Skechers it was 8 � so I figure I d order 9 this time based on the other reviews That was a mistake I returned it for a 10 and it fits fine So order 1 to 1 � size larger This is my fist dress boot and I noticed that they do not fit as snug as slip ons but that s probably inherent in the boot design itself Anyway the boot is well constructed The heel and sole look like they are hard but they are very soft so it is comfortable 
Skechers With the price this is a great pair of low ankle boots I was thrilled by the quality and style when I received the product I bought a pair of Kenneth Cole boots same style with the price of 100 but the material was so cheapy 
Can t beat it These socks save my mornings from pulling out my hair My daughter is a fanatic when it comes to seams and it was well worth it to me to spend a few extra dollars and get all seamless socks She won t wear any of her other socks now 
Scored a 10 My Mom has looked for seamless socks for a long time I found these and ordered her a set for Christmas She loves them so much that she has already put in a request for Mother s Day and her birthday Oh and she put the red pair in a white load of clothes by mistake and she said that it just made her sick because she thought they would be ruined but they did not fade or blotch at all She was really impressed 
Socks that saved my life Every morning my son would be so upset because he hated to put on his socks with seams in them Thank goodness we found TicTacToe Seamless socks They are excellent and morning is now a happy time 
ATTN Parents of Kids w sensory issues These socks are wonderful My daughter is 11 and in the Autism spectrum Socks in general feel bad to her She can feel the seam at the toe The key is to buy handlinked seams which these are They are soft and made well My only concern is as my daughter ages her feet are getting bigger will the sizes go that big I hope so Great socks 
Best ever If you are looking for socks that fit your foot and don t stretch out of shape these are the ones And no seams at the toe They are perfect Have spent so many on so many pair of socks and then given or thrown them away due to poor fit it was such a pleasure to find these 
the best sock ever wow just with this sock and my morning are good again my daugther is happy again and no more the sock are auchi 
Amazon stands for Amazing Putting on socks for my daughter was always a nightmare for both of us She would kick and scream Line Line Line Socks and shoes would go flying across the room and we would both break down in total frustration So I looked up the seamless socks on Amazon and found these I checked out the reviews and decided to buy The triple pack of just white socks was not available in my daughter s size Being the desperate mom that I was I opted for the pink ivory and white combo They came to my home within a week Mornings have never been so good Needless to say I am back on the internet ordering more These socks are just amazing Who knew that putting on socks was no big deal 
the only socks my son will wear Having never worn them myself I can t testify to these socks greatness from personal experience but my super picky son will wear nothing else 
Happy Mornings Mornings used to be filled with the cries of my daughter rolling around on the floor flinging socks and demanding to wear flip flops in the middle of winter Then I found the TicTacToe Seamless Toe Socks These are great for kids who are sensitive about toe seams Good quality product Good value And best of all my mornings are now peaceful and filled with smiles 
Great looking comfortable shoe This is a really comfortable shoe I would definatly recommend it to anyone who needs to look professional while walking a lot I have to walk outside up and down hills and this shoe feels like a sneaker The heel is not too high and it has great cushion I have been wearing it for a couple of months and it still is in great shape Great buy 
Wonderful quality shoe I can highly recommend this shoe I also own it in brown croc and they are wonderful I am VERY picky with shoes they HAVE TO be comfortable HAVE TO look good and I need to be able to wear them for extended periods of time without any problems such as blisters discomfort or that my feet begin to sweat If you have senistive feet like me you will love these shoes 
for that fan in your family I got the NFL folding tail gate chair to enjoy those times in the park and ball field and especially at draft day for the NLF waiting on line for hours dressed in your favorite team outfit Go Vikings to show support and nothing shows it more then relaxing on line sitting in these football folding chairs in your teams color and emblem it does beat standing for hours or sitting on a cold dirty sidewalk 
giant chair I think the chair is great sturdy and exactly what I was looking for in my game roo 
NFL Arm Chair I was very pleased with this chair It is well built and VERY comfortable The receiver of the gift is very happy I would biuy this again 
NFL Adult arm chair This is very portable and at the same time very sturdy Perfect for the patio or to take to grandson s soccer games 
Chairs Manufactured by this Company are Defective I purchased six of these chairs in August for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting They were all made by this manufacturer North Pole and had different NFL logos on them I only bought one through Amazon the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues At the first game of the season my chair Steelers broke At the second game of the season two more chairs Bengals and Broncos broke They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded They all broke in the same exact place the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked Therefore 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3 5 hours Needless to say at 25 30 each I would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere 
Love it Thanks Amazon Product arrived before I expected it My boyfriend LOVES his Redskins chair Right now he s got it set up in his backyard this gift may haunt me I may be seeing this chair for years to come on every beach park or park outing As of now I am winning the argument that it shouldn t be used in our tv room 
Good for a cold winter Slippers are nice and comfortable but I should caution that they run slightly small I m a 9 5 and the large size is snug for me 
Ked s mules Almost too comfortable to be believed It s like slipping your feet into a cloud Don t waste your money on bargain basement imitations 
It s REAL I own many Prada Items Purchased from NM and Saks I bought this as a Gift It came the other day in a huge UPS box All you have to do is look at the workmanship and the Leather engraved Prada label inside the bag to know that it s the real deal This is a closeout price happens all the time 
Honeymoon or Beach Vacation SUMMER TIME I love my PRADA bag Seems genuine to me ladies and gents What a neat wedding shower gift this would make for the bride to take on her honeymoon This beach tote is adorable and well made Even though it s plastic the trim is a bright red leather that looks great I wish they still had the FISH one in stock I might get that too The bag is HUGE and came packaged in a GINORMOUS box Even though the other reviews mentioned the size I still was not prepared The bag is one large compartment with no interior compartments so it s practical for a day at the beach I can fit a huge beach towel sandals a book my INSTYLE magazine sunblock a water bottle and a wristlet inside You ll definitely want to bring a seperate wristlet or wallet coin purse along with you to keep inside I can t wait to bring this bag on my honeymoon The handbag came with an authentication card the original ITALIAN price tag it really WAS 500 Euros and a dust bag for storage It looks genuine with the PRADA triangle tag on one side and a leather PRADA label inside the bag the labeling is subtle and not at all in your face Perfect gift The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is that I would have preferred the FISH one with the orange trim but I think it s out of stock Still this is an unimaginably great price for a Prada bag Happy Shopping 
Great value Okay Maybe it s real maybe it s not I LOVE IT It s still a great looking bag for the price Comes with all the authenticity for those who care For those that don t It s fun It s huge It s fashion forward A great bang for the buck 
Prada Printed Plastic Tote I love this bag I purchased it to take to the Miami boat show I used it as my carry on for the plane It was roomy enough to hold my purse and whatever else I needed It was also pliable to slip under the plane seat Everyone asked where I got it I also used it as a beach tote This was a great purchase 
Beautiful tote bag great price Highly recommend this you cannot get a nicer tote from Prada at this price 
very satisfied I sent this bag to my friend as a surprise for her birthday and she was overwhelmed She is a beach babe and said it is just perfect for her Pronounced it adorable and very chic I want one too 
Super cute tote It is really cute and playful just like funtote or marimekko bags 
Beautiful Bag Talk about being the envy at the beach or pool I received my bag and tore into the box I was so excited The bag was beautiful Being a Prada expert this is a true Prada Bag The detail and leather trim was beautiful Makes a great gift at this price WOW 
So comfortable These undies are not only attractive but are extremely comfortable They also don t give you ugly muffin tops if you know what I mean 
Lovely peasant dress but yes it s more brown than purple Have to disagree with first reviewer this dress is what it says it is It s a PEASANT DRESSS made of GAUZE Not sure what else one might expect but there s no problem with quality It s lightweight the seams are all finished in a rough peasant y kind of way and the gauze is well gauze y It s a lovely dress Grazes the ankle Lots of give in the elastic midsection order up a size if you re large chested Make sure you ve got a good strapless bra because you ll want to wear it off shoulder 
Nice Summer dress good price It is Brown not Eggplant First of all This dress is BROWN not Eggplant Other than that it is a very nice summer dress I received it very quickly with no problems The fabric is a nice thick gauzy cotton The sizes tend to run a bit small with some of the things from this company but not with all of their items 
Fossil Wallet If you like wallets that have a sliding compartment than you will like this one a lot When i first got it i felt that the material wasnt very good but now that i have worn it in its great 
A Great Pair of Jeans I am a homeowner who lives in the country and is constantly fixing something Whether it s woodworking or small construction projects I tend to stress jeans in three places the right pocket where my tape measure slides on the back pockets and the crotch area The Riggs jeans are reinforced in all three areas Also I am 6 7 and weigh 260 lbs Needless to say it is difficult to find clothes that fit I read about Wrangler s Riggs jeans in a magazine article about work clothing and decided to try them The jeans I bought were size 40x36 I have been wearing them now for two months and have no complaints The cloth is thicker and hardier than normal jeans something I found helpful when cutting trees for firewood The pockets are deeper something I very much appreciate and the build quality of the jeans is excellent triple stitching in all the important areas I think the part that really tops the whole deal off is the price These jeans were priced at 27 with free shipping Excellent product excellent price What more can I say 
Not what I thought it would be I had owned a pair of Sketchers a few years back and was happy with the brand then When I got these shoes I was surprised to see that they were not to the quality standards that I remembered I like lace less shoes but these were not adjustable so for my narrow foot they didn t fit and they were still hard to get on I decided to send them back within 10 min 
Excellent Pair of Shoes cute too I wanted something different in a pair of shoes so I ordered these fun orange colored shoes THEY are awesome One of the best pairs of shoes I have ever owned They fit nice it is weird the first time you put them on because there is no tongue or laces on the shoe Take a little to get used to BUT they are really comfortable Great buy 
Love them Very comfortable I love these shoes They are very comfortable and go great with my jeans and sweatpants They need to fit perfectly because their is no shoelace to tie so make sure you get your correct size I am usually a 7 5 8 so I chose the 7 5 and they fit fine 
Width not adjustable I normally wear 9 5 10 in sneakers and I bought the 10 just in case It fits snugly I failed to realize that the laces are not able to be loosened so the width of these shoes is too narrow for my wide foot I usually only buy wide in dress shoes so if this is your case don t get I am going to keep and hopefully they will relax a little if not I might cut off the bungee lace and see if that helps Very cute shoe worth the trouble if it ends up working out 
Great shoes I may get the 4th pair soon I also found the same model in different colors at SEARS on sale for 39 99 plus tax I gave 4 stars because they are not as cushy 
loveshoes These shoes are very comforable and easy to wear I love these shoes I bought another pair in blue and beige I wear them for exercising such as walking 
Most comfortable shoes These are the most comfortable shoes I ve ever owned I love them and I get lots of complements on them as well They look great with jeans too that s the main reason I got them I m buying another pair cause I never want to wear any other pair of shoes I have the off white and they seem to go with anything almost 
They feel like slippers I just bought these black shoes after having the tan ones for about 5 months These are so very comfortable They feel like ballet slippers They do not have much rubber under the front half of the shoe but have a decent amount under the heel They are easy to slip on and off and i have gotten a good amount of complements on the tan ones 
ehh they re ok Pros Great cushioning support Simple design and not too flashy Very breathable allowing plenty of air circulation around your foot Cons Not really comfortable They seem to really wrap around your foot which is fine if you go out for a run but for walking everyday life you can t really let your feet rest I did have minor chafing back of the foot after the first run in them 
Nice running shoes These sneakers are great for people who don t want allot of flash but want to be able to go for a walk or jog I have never had any comfort issues with any Adidas running shoes A great nice pair of everyday sneakers Great buy 
nice shoes for running less for walking Got the shoes one week ago I found that the shoes are very good for running as it s pretty springy But not very good for walking with the narrow bottom It is also pretty airy inside perfect for my sweaty feet 
Comfy and cute The Skechers Bikers Escape is a veratile option for the sensitive footed Decent arch support for my tiny flat feet with enough cushioning to keep them happy for hours of shopping Initially the band across the instep can be a little tight and had a touch of a heel rub but both have improved during the break in period They seem to dress up a pair of jeans and so far have gotten away with wearing them with a skirt hee hee Bought a pair in brown as well 
Columbia for the win This is a steal can t imagine a single con about this jacket Water resistant ventiled comfortable interior pockets are excelent Perfect for moderate cold and moderate rain Just ordered my second one Columbia = Quality 
Great fit bad zipper placement This Jacket fits very nicely It is impressively waterproof while still is breathable It is fairly warm which makes it good for colder weather but not so good as a casual jacket The only major flaw is the fount outside pockets have zippers around the openings so when you take your hands in or out of them it scrapes against you which is discouraging enough to inhibit the use of those pockets 
Girls tights I bought both the ivory and the white colored mid weight tights There is not much difference in the colors so if you are looking for a truly ivory off white colored tight do not get this one However quality wise it is a good tight My daughter wore a size 2T clothes and these tights were sized 1 3 and they fit her very nicely They aren t as thick as I thought they would be but they are opaque definitely not thin or cheap and are made from a strong material my daughter loves to run and as a result fall and she hasn t ripped them yet So overall I was pleased with these tights 
Very high but comfortable The heels on these shoes are very high a full 5 I have had no problems with them though and they are actually quite comfortable 
Lock Laces rock I m an amateur triathlete and busy girl on the go and I love all of my Lock Laces I ve pretty much replaced the laces on all of my shoes with these and not just my running ones I have to say I really like the elasticity and secure grip they provide across the top of my foot They re snug but not constricting so I never experience numb toes or pinching anywhere 
good quality These are of good quality and I like the lock it s not too big and does not look like something that will break easily They also come with instructions on how to use them I bought them for my 7 and 8 year old kids too and they like them 
Plenty of breathing room I purchased the wide leg pants just because of the wide leg I have purchased other items that claimed to be wide leg but I am happy to report that these truly are I could have gone a size smaller and still be comfortable wearing them around home to run a quick errand and of course to exercise in They are light weight full cut pants that should come in every color You won t be disappointed 
very happy Well I got a great deal on them Adorable pair sure to add a spark to my shoe collection Fit perfectly comfy I wore them once to the party and can t wait for summer to wear them more often Very feminine look Worth every penny 
Good Fit Well Made Very Warm I love the warmth of these gloves esp with liner glove They don t feel bulky and seem to be holding up better than another brand of thinsulate fleece gloves I have 
imperfections MINOR great price These scarves have a nice jingle one had a tiny run that is not visible when worn They are a GREAT value at this price perfect for practice or even a costume Most coin belly dance scarves run about thirty dollars for comparison 
Carlos Santana Look at this shoe It speaks for itself plus it has shimmer and shine and it glitters 
Fabulous These shoes rock They are stunning They run true to size I had seen them at Macy s for 99 but didn t think I should splurge What a great price 
Nice shoes Shoes are very pretty I wore these all Christmas Eve day night by the end of the day my feet needed a break They fit true to size 
Love the new Lee These are great jeans Perfect fit Comfy Very comparable to my fav Levis these days To me they are now interchangeable which I never thought I would say 
Comfy Sassy Falling just at the mid rise it holds in any unwanted bulge sightings and stretchy just enough so it fits to a more slender leg thigh FINALLY comfortable fit fashion all in one 
Suunto Mosquito This dive computer might not have more functions than the others on the market but it has something that none of the others have user replaceable batteries and its smaller than the other ones 
Elegant The jacket is very elegant and I can use it with any clothes I recommend it 100 
Very comfortable Love this pair they are form fitting to my feet and the material feels soft against my skin When I walk to the beach they don t slide around They feel stable and solid When my feet are wet or sandy I still feel comfortable They re well made and will last a long time Despite being striped which I think is a selling feature they go with everything and are very stylish 
Adidas shoes These shoes are so comfortable with plenty of arch support for my high arches I bought my first pair as a freshman in college and they lasted for 7 years Now I m on my second pair 
Best sports shoes ever I ve had three pairs of these in the last 10 years and I love them Note Be sure to order one whole size larger than your shoe size for some reason I think they started making them smaller recently 
So Sweet They ll give you a toothache but baby s toes will be warm I had a big newborn and these were too big for her little legs at first but they fit great and are among the few socks booties shoes that stay on for a long time are soft cute and go with many outfits They have rattles in them so they are like a toy too Tooo cute I love them 
Cute and Pretty Darned Enticing I really like the look of these panties all lacy and feminine They feel good on look great and best of all they re low cut so you can were them with your jeans riding low on your hips And if a bit of panty does peek out all the better cuz these are so cute Pretty darned enticing too if you know what I mean 
Stylish and Nice Hot Looking too These are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff Levi s My cutoffs are so faded so frayed so well you know So when I peal them off to reveal this Butterfly Lace up Panty in Black with the pick laces on the back it s like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl We only had two colors at our lingerie party white and the black and pink models but I can imagine all the colors would be nice too 
I love these panties They are sexy an I love I can have different colors for different days 
If you re a briefs fan You won t be disappointed with this pack I bought them along with another pure white briefs but specially these ones fitted me perfectly and had a nice selection of dark coluors that I particularly like They have the exact combination of comfort soft feel and appearance You can t go wrong with this item I you like briefs like I do and don t plan to change to boxers any time soon these will be by your side for as long as you need them 
Great value Soft slippers have been using all Winter The fake fur lining is very comfortable and the soles seem to be holding up in the morning walk to get the papers The size is a little loose but the fur lining keeps it snug 
great produce prompt service I needed this item for a gift and it arrived in great condition right on time 
Large Good value for the price However I should have ordered size 9 or possibly 8 the size 10 med is way too large Couldn t afford to return for smaller size wouldn t make sense to me since the price is so reasonable to begin with return postage would have taken away the great value j iv 
Comfy well made slippers I bought these slippers for my husband for Christmas They were on sale when he received them he was quite pleased with the quality of the slippers He lives in slippers so they had to be durable and they are They have long wearing non slip indoor outdoor rubber outsole which is great because he loves to wear them EVERYWHERE and best of all the slipper is made of man made materials which is all we wear 
overall good These would of been 5 star slippers except the bottom sole of these were not rubber or another waterproof material The buying page says they are indoor outdoor use but the bottoms will get wet or absorb whatever you step on Other than that they are good slippers and comfy change the sole and they will be perfect 
good for trhe price My husband thought these were very expensive slippers x mas present due to the quality He really likes them they have rubber sole so he can step outdoors in them too 
VERY NICE THEY ARE TRUE TO SIZE IF YOU WEAR A SIZE 10 ORDER SIZE 10 MADE VERY WELL 
Excellent This was a Christmas gift for my 9 year old niece she absolutely loved it I enjoyed the easy order process and quick delivery Thanks Thanks Thanks 
Exactly What I wanted The product was satisfactory The service was satisfactory A friend had told me about these pantyhose and I had some doubts but they were a perfect fit 
My Son Loves These Shoes My son found these shoes at Famous Footwear and was so excited that we broke down and bought them for him They are by far his favorite shoes He likes to wear them and he likes to play with them as cars when he s not wearing them I would have rated them a little higher if there was more leather in the shoe For the price I prefer to see a shoe with better materials The best part about these shoes is that my son has very wide feet and they fit his foot 
Ridiculously cute My 2 1 2 year old son almost had a heartattack when the UPS man finally brought these to the door He was so excited he could barely breathe When he opened the box put them on immediately and he will not take them off He loves how they light up The velcro elastic makes them super easy to take on off I would recommend buying a size larger than what you think your child would wear because I think they run a little small 
Really pretty but kinda wierd I love this bra it s so pretty the lace is gorgeous especially in Black and it fits like a glove which Is rare BUT the only thing I have a problem with is the underwire it protrudes just slightly too much and looks kinda wierd on It s fine with a low tank top but doesn t really look right under a sweater All in all it s a nice bra and really beautiful only complaint is the underwire 
Fantastic Bra My review from another shipper The Lilyette 458 is the best bra EVER I was a slave to Bali because a didn t really know what cup size I needed but more importantly b most stores don t carry anything larger than the DD cup size that didn t fit so I could see what DID fit The Lilyette 428 has that rocket shaping and it looks ridiculous This cup design gives a smooth curvy high riding NATURAL look No points cones or rockets I love it 
lovely Very soft beautiful and cozy I wear these everyday The only thing that would make it a 5 star product is if it had a more supportive cushy sole The sole is hard and stiff But I still like them a lot 
great product I am an EMT and have ben looking for a good pair of 6 boots for a long time I found these and just love them They were a little tight at first but after a few days they just molded to my foot graet boots 
Great Boots Great Boots I am not sure if the teen liked them or not because it was an Angel Tree anonymous giver and receiver gift for children of incarcertated parents But I loved them 
comfortable The footbed feels just a tad different than the original birkenstock somehow it hugs your heel more but still a most comfortable sandal The shape of the heel is also not the conventional birkenstock it is very slightly angled out hardly noticable and still attractive For the price any slight differences don t matter It is still an extremely high quality flat sandal that will mean happy feet and legs and a happy back for years to come Highly recommended 
Kavu Lago Bag This bag meets all of my needs that I purchased it for as a day tripper with my child I purchased this bag to use to carry diapers an epi pen wallet hand sanitizer etc in it and all of it fits plus more This is one of the best purchases I have made in a really long time 
nice jacket This leather jacket is made of a nice quality leather It fits well and was true to size My husband wasn t sure what to wear it with but we ve decided it is useful as a jacket in cooler weather or to wear with jeans for a cool way to dress them up Very happy with our purchase and he has received positive comments about the jacket from others 
Suede Birks They re great They re soft and are of perfect comfort to my feet They are QUIET when you walk no sqeaking or other annoying noises I entend to purchase a couple more pairs in the suede And they look cool 
Birkie review This is the first pair i have bought i wish i had put out the cash years ago I was advised to buy my padiotrist they are the only shoe i DON T have to wear an orthodic for 
The VW Beetle of footwear The Arizona isn t pretty but it will get you where you want to go comfortably and will outlast any other shoe you own 
Great Fit I have a hard time geting shoes that are wide enough sometimes even if they say W But I could not have asked for a better fit These are very comfortable and they look great too 
Beautiful Pants These are perfect dance pants but do run small Should be labeled Junior Size S M L Definitely not for anyone wearing woman sizes And they run long Daughter is 5 3 we will need to hem these 
Great pants a little long I ordered these for a performance and they are exactly what I was expecting The only thing I can say that isn t positive is that they are kind of on the long side I m 5 4 and these a medium drag on the floor just a little 
Belts Are Great But The belts are great quality and thicker than the belts I bought before Only problem is their customer service is awful I ordered 2 belts and they sent me the wrong size but still charged me the higher amount Forget about trying to contact them it s worthless I will never buy from them again 
Excellent for the price Well why not You ve got a very decent amount of colour choices and you can pick between a brass and silver buckle I picked the silver black combination when it shipped it was more then I expected for the same exact thing at a local mall you would pay twice as much and that s not considering tax The only difference between this one and other belts of similar design that I ve seen is that they all seem to have logos either engraved or cut out I don t enjoy sporting I giant logo on my waist I much rather get what I want AND pay less for it The buckle is not a design that opens and closes rather you slip the belt through the buckle and tighten it by sliding a metal bar foward If you close it tightly enough it will hold a LOT of weight far more then the open slip belt through close buckle on belt design I carry a bunch of things on mine including a heavy multi tool a knive a phone several pouches filled with a various manner of junk a tape measure and occasionally heavy construction tools Granted the belt wasn t meant for this kind of weight but normally after a few minutes my old buckle would just pop open from the weight no such problem here It opens and closes without trouble and will fit a large waist easily What more do you want from a belt = Andrew Christian were speedy enough in shipping it it came a few days after my Amazon order which was 3 5 business days Great deal 
Great buy I ve had this briefcase for about a month now It s held up perfectly so far The closure mechanisms are not buckles but clips behind the buckles It s been roomy enough to put a palm pilot pens and multiple files with papers The leather looks great and it s very light The shoulder strap is also comfortable Assuming it contiues to hold up for a reasonable length of time I d buy this product again One note If you are looking to store a laptop in this briefcase I d think twice It s not as large as most laptop briefcases and definately does not have adequate padding in my opinion But for carrying documents books and other items it has met all my expectations 
nice attache The leather is nice The price was great The delivery fast Would buy it again 
Silver metallic sandals I wore these to my daughter s wedding a few days before Christmas and the shoes were comfortable throughout the ceremony and reception People complimented me on them The silver color was beautiful with my green dress 
Harry Potter Wand The wand was a gift for my nephew who loves it It looks very much like the wand Harry uses in the movies and it s one of his favorite toys 
Great for Kids Play The wand is sturdy full sized and nicely designed even if made of plastic The kids wanted their wands so they could play Harry Potter so this was much more appropriate than the beautiful but more fragile and very expensive collectors versions available 
Underwear that rules I like underwear that does its job with minimal impact These define that I hate boxers and tighty whities are too much fabric for what they do This is like wearing an athletic supporter Comfortable and high quality 
Excellent Choice It might be a bit pricy But offers very good support even for athelics Materials are very high quality the parts are finely sew together ensuring to last a long time 
Jockey Elance My all time favorite undies for sleeping in and wearing around the house It s the only thing I ll ever wear to bed because it feels so good 
stylish shoes The Shoes are comfortable and stylish The only problem is that they slip at the heel so it you have a narrow heel you may want to consider a different style or brand 
Beautiful black beaded bag This is a beautiful bag A great deal too The color is a combination of charcoal gray and black giving an overall look of black It has handles and a shoulder strap that can be tucked into the zippered top Perfect for carrying your necessities for a dressy evening out 
Speedo women s swim suit This is my second Speedo suit Obviously I liked the first one so much that I bought this second one This suit is similar to my first one in that it has the full lining This is especially nice when it gets toward the end of the lifespan of the suit and the material gets thin My last suit lasted about 1 year and about 52 hours of swimming Not as long as polyester suits but I like the lycra suits 
Excellent I like this product because the fabric is excellent and it fits very well Comfortable adjusts to your body shape 
Warm Fuzzy Great slippers snuggle up your whole foot and keep your toes nice and warm This is my second pair of this style I wore the last ones until they fell apart 
great Customer Service Great customer service My father husband loved the foot comfort 
boot socks they feel rather bulky around the toes and they do not stay up very wel 
Buy this Fleece I could not be more happy with this purchase The fleece is fantastic I look the feel and the fit It is definitely warm and so comfortable Many people have asked me where I got it and I have actually sent them the link to purchase it for themselves I had not ordered from Avalanche previously but would do it again without hesitation 
Gift made a hit I purchased this gown as a gift My daughter in law was thrilled with the quality and fit 
A Wonderful Stylish Suit This is another item you MUST GET It s a fabulous stylish comfortable professional suit by Jos A Bank and it s a MUST HAVE 
Silk Pajamas My friend was very happy with them They are very good quality and they fit him for the most part The only issue we had was the length of the arms They were a little too long Other than that we were pleased They got here in time for Christmas and they were just what he wanted 
Size reference Great PJ Really glad i got it It s pretty well built I was afraid it would be a bit fragile but so far so good As a reference I m 6 0 with roughly 200lb I got the Large and it s a bit tight for my taste I ll be trading it for the X 
Best Quality I Have Found These silk pajamas in my opinion have much higher quality stitching tailoring details as well as a heavier weight silk than the closely priced DreamSacks pajamas Sizing Help To help clarify sizing for people there have been conflicting reviews here I ordered a Medium but then returned it for a L I will probably get some minor alterations but I don t blame the company for that everyone is shaped differently I am 6 0 and weigh 175 My suit measurements are a 42 chest 34 sleeves and 32 pants inseam The Medium body fit but the sleeves and pants were too short The Large was the best fit overall although roomier around the chest than I would prefer But if you are my size the Large is your best option 
Good for women too These are great Well made did ok in the wash They also did not split at the seam after wearing them 2x They are still cool enough for summer but nice and warm in winter and SERIOUSLY SOFT By a pair for your wife yourself They are heaven 
I would highly recommed these very nice I was concerned that these silk PJ s would be really thin and on the cheap side But to my surprise they are much thicker then I thought they would be and feel like they will hold up rather well My husband did NOT expect these and is quite pleased with them I am back tonight to order another pair in a different color now that I know they are worth the money I paid for them Plus the fit was perfect I noticed others here said their large was to big so get a smaller size and another person said the opposite That confused me when I went to buy So I just went with my husbands normal size which is a XXL and it was absolutely perfect My husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of PJ s ever The size is perfect color bright looks like it will hold up after many washings Seams looked like quality sewing unlike some I have bought in the past I can t find anything I don t like about these I need to get another pair here FAST before he wears these out lol Anyone thinking of buying these I can t help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least Ja 
Good quality silk Of all men s silk PJs that I purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best The fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well After reading other customers reviews I purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size M and occasionally L It turned out too small I would recommend going one size up 
Good quality This is a good quality pajama set and was worth the price I paid with an Amazon discount Be forewarned that the color is a really bright red though 
Comfy and sleek pajamas What a great pair of pajamas these are So soft non binding roomy and great for lounging I ve already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays Very good quality silk well sewn and tailored I m normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine 
awesome It s a very nice hat really good quality The only thing I dindn t know it is not a flex fit hat but if you get the right size you won t regret it at al 
O Neill Rashguard I thought this product did exactly what I wanted it to However in order to get a loose rashguard fit which is what most people want if you re using your rashguard as a cover up instead of its most often intended use you will need to get at least two sizes larger 
Easy spirit = Easy walking I was experiencing constant pain in my left heel and had read natural healing books on eradicating heel spurs Adding to that I m hefty The big thing to ease the pain of a heel spur is to wear a quality shoe with rubber soles Trusting to find a good quality shoe was becoming a nightmare when I happened upon an Easy Spirit ad during online holiday shopping I ordered them and ohmigosh You can t get me out of them 
blister First time I wear it I ve got a blister Look stylish but I guess that s i 
Smooth Tee Good for any weather Idle for the warmer climate Wether active or just relaxing it s a goes with jeans or sweats 
Sturdy Little Bag I bought this bag to carry books one mile each way from the parking lot to the building It already has a lot of miles on it It is easy to use I like the front pocket with easy access to pens and calculator I have had to clean the wheelwells twice my route is not solely sidewalk The case otherwise still looks like new Just what I needed 
A tiny leather purse just what I wanted I ve been looking for a small leather purse for quite a while My idea of small is obviously a lot smaller than most I saw this purse read the dimensions and figured it would be perfect and it is I m very happy with it It is well made Nicely stitched inside and out The strap is adjustable The leather is soft flexible and smooth It smells great too The hardware is sturdy and a dull brushed silver color I bought the black and I m thinking about getting the red one too I wish it came in green If you want a bag to cram stuff in don t buy this It will only fit the essentials If you want a tiny purse that isn t the wallet on a string type this is it 
Excellent Service Article description was accurate and detailled enough to make a buying decision Delivery was prompt and in good order 
Awesome when your feet adjust to them I love these shoes It took me a while to get used to walking in them because I m not used to thin heals The more you were them the more comfortable you are in them I don t recommend them though if your feet are easily irritated pained 
great product great service i live in trinidad W I i ordered this product on amazon and within two weeks it was in my hand i bought it for my wife and she loves it it s just what she wanted the only reason i m giving it 4 stars is that i would like to see more notifications on order status and it being updated promptly 
BE ASHAMED OF YOUR SHAPE THIS BRA IS BINDING STIFF AND RESEMBLES SOMETHING THAT ATILLA THE HUN WOULD DESIGN I AM OFFENDED AS A WOMAN THAT WE FEEL THE NEED TO CONTORT OURSELVES INTO A FAKE FORM WHAT IS WRONG WITH OUR BODIES THAT WE NEED THIS CONTRAPTION TO MODIFY OUR TRUE SHAPE 
Get a larger size I purchased this bra because I had heard so many good things about it When I received it it seemed to have a crease on one of the cups I figured it would go away once I wore it It did not It really did not matter too much any way because the size was to small I have been wearing the same size for years and this was just too tight I thought it was too expensive for the hassle I guess this is one of those things you should NOT buy online 
Modest Excellent to wear in the cold along with a wonderful fit and form I bought the 36 and found it to be too tight it fits now either from weight loss or stretching I bought a 38 in the T Shirt model and it fits pretty good My suggestion is to get a professional measurement before choosing your size This bra is Wonderful 
Wonderful I don t mind spending money on something so beneficial I ll take comfort over beauty who sees it anyway besides me I ll search online for lower prices but am overall very pleased with the garment 
not ugly check the size I don t think this is an ugly bra just plain plain plain which is what I was looking for The bra is sleek and doesn t show though The shaped cups give a beautiful silouette It does feel more substantial but not like body armor Honestly it is wonderful to have the support I need without feeling like I m wearing old lady underwear The low rise lets me wear scoop neck tops I did have some frustration over figuring out the correct size I wear a 34DDD in Wacoal but a 36F in Le Mystere 
Beautiful and busty bra prevents nipple show through The slightly padded molded cups on this bra are wonderful to prevent nipples from showing through even if you re cold if you get my drift As a buxom woman 36DDD I m cursed with wandering nipples bra lines showing through shirts and sweaters bossoms that swing low and other embarrassing problems This bra is relatively comfortable generally speaking and it is VERY comfortable compared to minimizers and other hold em up and hold em in place bras Personally I think the svelt look of the bra is gorgeous With a big chest I ve never been able to wear those lacy little bras from Victoria s Secret so this is actually a big improvement over what my husband refers to as industrial strength bras like our grandmothers wear I only give it four stars because the underwire is not comfortable if you sit for long periods of time at a desk like I do it begins to dig in a bit right beneath the rib cage Overall it s a great bra to 1 hide nipples 2 provide your breasts with a wonderfully rounded shape 3 hides bra lines great t shirt bra and 4 show off your cleavage but not the bra itself if you wear a low cut blouse I think you ll like it and remember you tend to get what you pay for these days The days of 18 bras are far behind us 
Great bra I first purchased this bra in a specialty bra boutique for 139 00CA I know it s a lot for a bra but I was too happy that I found a bra that fit great Up until that day I wore a 36D or 36DD after getting fitted I am now a 32 G You have to understand that I hate shopping for bras I never found the right one and always walk out of the store thinking that I should get a breast reduction This bra is the one that Oprah wears and loves Now it is my favourite thing I have to agree with the other customers that it is not the prettiest bra if you are a bigger chested gal like my self but you forget about that when you put a t shirt or blouse on because you really do look 10 pounds thinner around the waist and you chest is where it should be If you are a bigger chested gal I would suggest before buying this bra if you are not too sure what size you are go and get fitted at a proper store a specialty store Most stores only sell bras in the A DD cup that is why you should go to a specialty store the sales women know a lot more 
10 Years Younger I m giving this bra a 4 instead of a 5 because it is an expensive and ugly bra I ll give it a 10 on how it makes you look though which is at least 10 years younger If you ve ever put on a T shirt and felt you weren t looking perky anymore wear this bra and at least part of you will look like you re in your twenties again In case you re wondering I m 45 and wear a 36D 
Buying this bra for the second time I agree with the previous writer This bra is supportive and does the job but it is not flattering there is a lot of fabric I also agree that the price for a GOOD full figure bra is outrageous My only other wish is that I could get a different color Large busted ladies like blue green etc too 
no toes please oogled and googled this shoe for months got the BEST deal at Amazon i would have given this shoe a 5 except for the short lip on this shoe and it seems to run a little small not a full size i havent worn them yet but i know that they will stretch a bit beautiful sho 
Fabulous Sandals Great sandals at a great price Very Stylish Super comfortable Have received lots of compliments on them 
This is a beautiful shoe but order a half size larger than your regular size This is a beautiful well made dress shoe that combines traditional oxford design with high quality materials It features a smooth full grain blemishless fully lined leather upper and a flexible leather sole with rubberized contact patches There is not much more that an Allen Edmonds costing hundreds of dollars more will get you I got one in size 15M which is my normal shoe size Size 15M in this shoe is relatively tight fitting at the arch in comparison to my Florsheim 15M oxfords two different models So the gentleman that remarked in earlier comments about the size being a tad smaller is correct If I had known I would have gotten a half size bigger However that would have added unnecessary shoe length when all I needed was a quarter inch of additional coverage at the arch I wish shoe makers had an arch fitment scale like they have with the width of the foot i e medium wide extra wide etc an earlier commenter mentioned that the rubberized outer lining on the sole started to come unglued after only a few months of wear I cannot comment on this aspect yet as I have had these for only a few weeks yet and have worn them only three or four time to date I will update this review if I discover that I have this problem also 
Great dress shoes I could not believe what a great price I got for these pair of dress shoes I wish Amazon would have sales like this often Need a few times to break them in but well worth the price 
Great shoes and excelent price this shoes have a excelent price and they like too much to my girlfriend 
GREAT RUNNING SHOE These running shoes are very comfortable Everything about them is terrific I didn t need any break in time with the shoes The fit is perfect and they provide alot of stability and cushioning Running is a pleasure in these shoes 
best fit for your buck I am a 38c and this is the most comfortable strappless bra ever I bought one from a boutique and after wearing it out I found this one online for less than 1 2 the price I have support I don t have to wear straps It fits and keeps the girls where they belong 
Perfect size and they are wonderful The medium size is the perfect size I use about two per load of laundry They keep my unmentionables safe and snag free 
No shoe better for foot problems I had plantar fasciitis two years ago and the suede Arizona Birks were the only shoes I could wear comfortably for months It took a couple of days to break the shoes in due to the firm footbed and heel cup but once they were broken in it was bliss A good friend of mine recently had plantar fasciitis herself and also began wearing the Arizona Birks Ever since my own PF episode I ve avoided going barefoot around the house and wear only the Arizona Birks while indoors They ve held up remarkably well and I dread the day something accidentally happens to them which means I have to buy another pair of Arizonas just in case I know they re more expensive than most sandals mine cost 110 at a mall store but they re worth the money I have flat feet while my friend has a really high arch yet the Arizona Birks work wonderfully for both of us I now have about 12 pairs of Birkenstocks in a variety of styles and plan on buying more Birkenstocks give tremendous support with its toe grip and molded footbed especially since it conforms to your foot within a few days If you want the best variety of Birks you should check out the QVC website They have dozens of styles and some of the best prices on Birkenstocks around 
best in the world If you wear sandals this is the best ever especially for your feet Just wear your birks a few hours a day to break them and your feet in Order one size smaller for proper fit Great service from ShoeBuy and Amazon 
Best Sandals You Can Buy I have had many different types of sandals but have never owned a pair of Birkenstocks I think the price is what has kept me from buying them and have always gotten sandals without reguard to who makes them as long as they were in the 20 range After my last pair fell apart I decided to spend the extra money for Birkenstocks I am glad I did You can tell how well made they are right out of the box They are extremely comfortable to wear and the footbed is firm but soft The longer you wear them the more comfortable they get I like the birkibuc material better than leather as it seems to be more water resistant The arch is solid and in just the right spot for proper support The part where the strap is attached to the sole is seamless and very well done I am very happy about purchasing the sandals and I recommend them highly Your feet won t hurt wearing them all day like some sandals or flip flops One thing to watch out for it says the size measures true but the first pair I ordered were much too big and I had to send them back for a smaller pair I used the conversion chart the seller has but you may want to order a half or full size smaller than you normally would The ones I have now are size 41 and are supposed to be for size 8 US but I am a true size 9 and these fit me with room to spare 
awesome don t particularly like cotton or stretch cotton panties These I have to say are awesome fit great comfie They will shrink when you put them in the dryer so I suggest you don t put them in the dryer or buy the next size bigger and then put them in the dryer However for bikinis in cotton these are just perfect I personally love Jockey or if I must I do like the Hanes microfiber Just my opinion Hanes does make a lot to choose from so they are great and reasonably priced I find you need different styles for different pants or jeans Don t like thongs so the string bikini in nylon always works well and they do run big nylon always does so get your perfect size The most important thing ladies let s get comfortable in what we wear LOL Thanks and good luc 
SUPER SOFT The Hi Strung shoes are the most comfortable dress shoes I have EVER purchased They feel like slippers The leather is really soft just like gloves as the description says I m a medium width and they fit just right I wouldn t recommend them for someone with a wide foot because the leather is just right no extra room for a wide foot 
Cleo Crocs Just bought my first pair of Cleo crocs and they are wonderful I wear regular crocs for comfort but they are really unattractive The Cleos are not only comfortable but very attractive and look nice with slacks as well as shorts I have received so many compliments on the style and look of these sandals and plan to buy more colors If you have problems with your feet and back these are the shoes for you 
Classic yet trendy A great shoe I m in love with the Tribeca line right now and these shoes took my breath away I ordered them in Stone a gorgeous neutral color that goes with just about anything I m a true 8 5 and they fit well The heel is high but not uncomfortably so and the footbed is slightly padded I usually put ball of foot cushions in my shoes but these didn t need them I can rock these all day with skirts dresses and pants with no discomfort Whatever the current trend this is a spunky shoe that will never go out of style 
Didn t fit The size 6 which I am was too small I returned it for a 6 5 which was too big So no shoes for me 
Cutie pie I love this little bag I get compliments all the time about it Looks small but can fit a lot and arrive on time 
Great little bag I was looking for something smaller than a regular backpack but more versatile and roomy than the typical backpack purse This product is exactly what I wanted I m VERY pleased 
Perfect size comfortable looks great I bought this for my daughter to use as a handbag She requested it and loves it She carries everything in it and although it gets heavy at times with her belongings it is still very comfortable on the shoulder 
Great Quality and LIFETIME Warrenty Hey I decided to review some things I didn t buy off Amazon but I have owned for sometime that are really great items the kind I would buy again for sure if they were lost I would say lost or broken but Jansport has lifetime warranties If anything happens to your backpack all you have to do is mail it to Jansport with a note of the problem they will fix it for FREE and send it back to you They will even send you a card while they have it telling you it misses you and will be back soon Overall these are such great products you just have to get a Jansport if you re thinking of a backpack Also I am in a review writing competition with a friend of mine and if this review is helpful which I hope it really is I would love to have your yes vote With Care Sa 
great little purse I use my half pint as a purse during the day when I m at school or out with my son It has a key holder in the front pocket and just enough room for my wallet mt daily planner a water bottle and whatever else I need to carry with me Plus you can throw it in the washing machine and dryer when it gets dirty I get tons of compliments on this little bag 
Nice basic slippers They came to me just as described Very comfortable A good buy for 4 but would never have paid the advertised reg price of 20 
comfortable and stylish I ordered a brown pair of these slides directly from amazon and I m really happy with them I only tried them at home yet but they look really comfortable Even though the heel is moderately high it is a very stable and no turning ankles The size is true size and the width is a little wider than normal perhaps my feet is a little to the wider side and the width of these shoes was ok with me If you are in between two half sizes you may try ordering down that s what I did The look is really contemporary I first tought it might look a little bulky but it still looks lighter than the popular wedges of this year I ordered another pair of shoes from bandolino along with this pair and i was suprised that the craftsmanship of the aerosoles pair is far better than the bandolino one I would recommend these slides if you look for something comfortable to walk but with heels 
Pretty and excellent for the price I gave this as a gift and was warm and comfortable It s pretty 
Men s Robe Product is just OK I will use it but don t expect it to last Fabric is light and sewing is average at best 
It looks girly I think it looks more like my mom s robe silk smooth purple color all leads to same conlusion it s girly robe for girly guys 
Very Nice I bought one of these robes 3 4 weeks ago Am very pleased with it especially after washing Thought it would be in a million wrinkles but following the washing instructions it came out just like it arrived And there is a button hole that keeps the belt in place so you won t lose it Extra touch Was so pleased just placed an order for another one as a spare Very Nice 
Awesometacular I purchased this and I really like it I don t know what this person is talking about I think you might have put on the plastic wrapping instead of the actual robe The robe is really nice and is very soft I would buy it again but I have one already so that would be silly 
Men s Classic Satin Robe My husband had been looking for a robe like this for several years He is very pleased with it Would purchase it again Nice quality beautiful color 
Nice Cool Robe Robe is really light and has a sleek silky feel Great for wearing around the house on a hot summer night Great buy for the price 
Congratulations the item Nike B2 9 Gymsack arrived in foreseen time and it is the great usefulness for my because it is comfortable 
Very very comfy Poof uses a type of cotton spandex mix that is very slenderizing which makes this tank perfect for those skimpy summer fashions I find this style looks really flattering with a cute skirt and some heels Beware this tank is VERY THIN so some of you may want to buy two or three at a time so you can layer Great quality product too I ll definitely be ordering more of these before it gets too hot down here 
I love these tanks I would be ordering more if they came in more colors I ordered a medium as I m 5 8 and it fits perfectly 
Poor description This was TOO SMALL The description says women s but there is NO way a woman will fit into this top 6th grade girl would be a better description The price was great so I ordered a large but I usually wear a medium so I was shocked when it didn t even come close to fitting 
I just love it This tank is exactly as it looks in the photo or better The quality of the inside bra is high I bought the white one and it covers and hangs my chest properly Straps can be adjusted I really would like to have it in other colors but they only sell them in white and ivory 
The best briefs in town Hanes makes an excellent white traditional brief for the gentlemen amongst us who just don t want to wear boxers The relatively snug fit ensures that these briefs will not bunch up like loose fitting boxers so often do and many men prefer these briefs for that reason alone The briefs are easy to care for they are essentially permanent press so any washer and dryer set will clean them well They seem to last forever too which makes them an excellent value If you can try to get these without a tag in the rear so that you won t get an itch caused by the tag However even with a tag you usually don t feel any discomfort I ve worn em that way for years without a problem The 100 cotton fibers of these briefs add to the comfort you ll feel too My only real caution and the main reason that this product gets four stars instead of five is that these briefs can be tight the first several times you wear them This may be true for some of us men even if Hanes does claim that these briefs are preshrunk before they hit the store s shelves I personally would suggest washing them once or twice just to loosen the fit up ever so slightly Another relatively minor concern is that the elasticity of the waistband eventually does wear out At that point you do need to buy new briefs but then again nothing lasts forever right Overall gentlemen who want a close fitting brief that still gives them comfort will be very satisfied with these white men s briefs The three pack gives you value and they last a long time 
Stylish shoes Great price Shoes are beautiful A little stiff for the first few hours but the Brazilian leather breaks in easily and they are COMFORTABLE Price was WAAAAY below MSRP but for last season s shoe the price was fair to low The AMAZON folks have GREAT integrity feel safe with your purchase and personal info 
Big Boy Music rocks These people offer great customer service with shipment notices that come super fast Had shirts within a day of ordering Great quality too These are nice regular thickness shirts Thank you 
My new favorite These are perfect for working out I am a Pilates instructor and love them for class So light weight you have complete freedom of movement and they dry quickly My new staple for the gym and Pilates 
Sleek and Comfortable These are comfortable and versatile since they look great with almost anything The strap on the back of the heel doesn t rub like other slingbacks I ve worn and after many hours of wear the strap has not stretched out The only reason I gave it four stars is that I may have preferred a little higher heel 
Cheap I loved them at first dainty and shiny bought the black patent Hard to find flats that are stylish They ONLY LASTED 2 WEARS and that was at a funeral and church about 2 3 hours a time CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP The hole for the back strap stretched so big it s nearly ripped off and I was sitting nearly the entire time so how could this happen I thought Nine West had quality shoes but DON T BUY these 
love them I usually wear a size 9 but went with an 8 and it fit great My feet an so nice and warm but not sweaty Best slippers ever I wore them all weekend 
Awesome slippers My wife loves them Her shoe size is 7 5 The 7 fits her perfectly They re cute durable Nice firm sole 
Awesome Slippers These are the most comfortable pair of slippers i have ever own I have not taken them off since i bought them a year ago except to wash them of course I throw them in the washer and dry them in the dryer and they come out good as new 
a favorite I love these for running down to the basement or just walking around the house on a cold day 
Very comfortable slip on slippers These slippers are easy to slide on as soon as I get out of bed They are warm comfortable The hard sole keeps them where I left them No more fumbling under the bed for that one slipper that always seemed to slide there by itself 
good value not everything on amazon is a good value but these slippers are very good for the money and good quality 
excellent I bought these slippers for my daughter for Christmas but I find myself slipping them on when she is not home They are so comfortable and so soft she loves them as do I 
Warm but clumsy I bought these for warmth so they re fine with me Your feet will not get cold in these But they are like walking in flippers There is no arch support and the sole is like a frozen slab of steak for all the flexibility weight and thickness it posesses I should also mention that buying a size smaller works fine They d be even clumsier if too large 
Really nice leather gloves and very cheap I love these gloves and I love the leather They are also very warm My only issue with them was that I had been looking for dark brown leather gloves and in the picture they looked dark brown but when I received them the brown almost looked black which was a dissapointment but I kept them anyway 
black leather fannypack We bought this item as a gift for a woman who loved to gamble She loves it and uses it to carry her coins and other items without having to bring her purse She says it looks nice with everything she wears and has a hidden compartment in the back where she stores her keys Great item for such a low price 
GREAT FIT BUT COLOR IS WEIRD This pink is very weird It s not quite pastel baby pink more neon pink but not THAT bright either I don t know how to describe it The photo is not accurate Because it doesn t quite match any other pink I own I tend to only pair them with a black top They are super comfy though so I still recommend them Soft fabric nice pockets 
Great Product Great Service I ordered these boots for my daughter We were in the midst of a major snowstorm and her boots had been stolen She had to walk to work so boots were escentual I live about an hour and a half away from her and the roads were terrible I placed the order and she received them a day later She loves them likes them better than the ones that were taken I appreciate your service and the quality of your products 
A Real Turn On That s What These Panties Are I brought a couple pair of these to our little lingerie party because I knew the girls would like them I ve been wearing them for over a year and I like them a lot My husband does too They look good turn him on turn me on too You can t ask for more than that in a panty now can you 
Cute and Pretty Darned Enticing I really like the look of these panties all lacy and feminine They feel good on look great and best of all they re low cut so you can were them with your jeans riding low on your hips And if a bit of panty does peek out all the better cuz these are so cute Pretty darned enticing too if you know what I mean 
I love these panties They are sexy an I love I can have different colors for different days 
Excellent briefs Excellent briefs They are form fitting With a lot of brands of briefs I ll have a big sag in the butt portion but these fit nice and snug They are very durable and last for hundreds of washings 
Best sock EVER Well I live in Texas i can t ski very often however I slipped on this pair of socks and got a running start at a freshly waxed wood floor and relived the 69 winter olymipcs It was great oh and they re really soft and fuzzy and feel really good on my feet too 
Excellent quality I ha ve been wearing the windsor wool socks for many years My feet perspire more than the average bear and because of the wool blend my toesiesare always warm and dry They also last for years 
pillowy but slightly pinchy I love these shoes because they are at once elegant and comfortable a sometimes rare combination in women s shoes Somehow the platform manages to be both supportive and squishy as a cloud My only gripe is that the straps bind a bit in Florida s summer heat Perhaps if my foot were slightly narrower or I lived in a less humid climate this wouldn t be a problem But all in all these are great shoes 
Shearling coat The coat quality was poor It was very thin and looked cheap I returned unworn 
Furry The outside is so soft and the inside fur is long and warm The pockets kinda fold up at times and since it only has two hook buttons it comes open a lot while carrying stuff but it s like a chocolate blanket 
Pedro Shirt i think think this shirt is very cool Plus the movie rocks 
Control It s not quite as slimming as it was described but it does work quite well compared to other similarly priced control undergarmets 
JOSHUA LIKED THEM I purchased the shorts to send to a Katrina evacuee from NO living at the time in the Astrodome He is a big guy size 5X and he was happy to have them He arrived with only what he was wearing and all the donated clothes were much too small 
Dress shoes with a lot of headspace I bought these shoes for myself after trying them on locally due to the low price on amazon I have problems with most shoes due to their low profile and having a thick foot Additionally I like to wear arch support inserts due to my feet overpronating I found that these shoes would allow me to have my inserts in comfortably I would recommend these shoes to anyone with thicker feet 
A very high quality dress casual Oxford shoe Although I personally prefer the now discontinued Jefferson and Washington models from Dockers which were very similar to these Rockports in design and style but more comfortable I ll admit that these are excellent They have a simultaneously casual and dress casual styling and aura and go well with both khaki pants and jeans As with most Rockport shoes the overall quality of both craftsmanship and built is excellent 
One of the best This is one of the best and confortable shoes I ve had Thanks Rockport 
Good product Great vendor This case works very well for the price It fits my 30G video iPod very well and functions as indicated The armband stays intact but the device seems to slide ocassionally when doing high intensity workouts running Overall this is a good product and am pleased with its performance 
Lee Slacks I was unable to find these slacks locally so I went on the internet and typed in the style number and brand from an old pair like this What a delight to find that I could buy them again and they are great just a little bit of spandex and they fit beautifully I will definitely order more 
not so bad very pretty shoes in person gets dirty fast beware sizes run very small fast delivery 
Great Storage Poor Operation We collect a lot of DVD s I was quite excited to file them in this system We have a smaller version that DOES have the three rings Huge mistake in changing that It is extremely difficult to file in DVD s in this storage system the smaller one is great Also to ensure the movie is protected we like to place the whole sleeve on top of the player and then refile after viewing Can t do that with this system Buy the pages individually and put them in your own three ring binder 
This product poorly inaccurately described Having bought this I am disappointed to say that IT IS NOT 3 RING It has the 2 straps as shown in the photo It is not a snap to add pages and alphabetize your collection I would buy another for the rest of our collection if it wasn t for that Adding and removing pages is a HUGE hassle Given it s size I like the carrying handle and the slots in the inside front cover for putting away discs quickly if you or more likely a lazy child does not want to search through the pages to put it back into its correct slot Because of the zip closure you can also keep booklets that will not fit in the sleeves in the binder without them falling out 
Quality products I bought one of these for my 18 yr old son for Christmas so that he could change out buckles as he desired The fit was dead on and the leather quality is very nice My husband liked it so much I ordered one for him just after Christmas 2bHip did a great job with getting everything to me before Christmas even tho Amazon said that it might arrive after The buckles this site carries are also awesome Quality products and great customer service 
Very Nice Robe Great quality cotton The One size fits most label should indeed fit most people Great packaging 
Very plush excellent for price I purchased this for husband for Christmas as he needed a warm robe to go to and from the hot tub in cold weather I was nicely surprised at the heavy weight and beautiful quality of this robe and loved the box and packing along with personal note that came with it I m often disappointed in apparel purchased online but this was definitely NOT the case with this robe Thick thirsty high quality Well worth the money 
Want to make your wife girlfriend very happy I got this robe for my wife for Christmas and she LOVES it All of her girlfriends are super jealous and have been asking where I got it and telling their husbands they need to get them one She says it is very comfortable and warm It s long enough to curl up in and just hang out and enjoy the day Very nice quality and comes nicely packaged 
I love this robe Last year I bought my then fiance one of these robes for Christmas I love to use this thick and thirsty robe and so does my then fiance and now husband It shipped promptly and I had it just in time for Christmas last year 
best robe I could find I had had the same robe for over a decade and frankly my husband was finding it rather unattractive Yet all the robes in department stores were light and not nearly warm enough I found this robe after a long search and have been very pleased It keeps me very warm and is easy to throw on and off It s made of absorbent material so that I don t feel cold water spots on my back after getting out of the shower It s the heaviest robe I could find I can t say there are any complaints It is a little big for me one size fits all and the sleeves do get in the way and knock things over on my bathroom counter but warmth is what I was after and this fills that bill 
everyone who travels should have this I travel a lot I would recommend this for everyone It is extremely compact and convenient And it helps to know ahead of time what your luggage weighs as to avoid switching and swapping items from bag to bag and or paying extra fees for overweight luggage not to mention holding up the line 
great idea not the most solid design This is a really handy little gadget to carry around it fits in your suitcase s pocket and works quite well The only drawback is that the tape measure part slides out and exposes the metal inner workings I was able to get it back together without injury but those tape measures are sharp I put some electric tape around the sides to keep this from happening again Even with this flaw it s definitely worth the 10 bucks 
Valuable Travel Accessory With tougher airline baggage scrutiny overweight luggage can cost you a bundle This little gadget paid for itself on our first trip Much easier to use than the old bathroom scale we found this to be quite accurate and close to the scales at the check in counter Now our neighbors all want to borrow it 
Use with caution on heavy bags Theoretically speaking this seems to be a handy little doo dad gizmo thingamabob for the well organized obsessive compulsive traveler but please take note of the following pros and cons Pros 1 It gives you a fairly accurate preview of the weight of your luggage + a few ounces saving you the irritation of arriving at the airline counter with over heavy luggage and having to repack and shuffle potentially embarrassing items around in full view of the other passengers 2 You can use the tape measure to verify that your carry on luggage will fit in the overhead compartment or under the seat This saves you from participating in the dreaded and ruthless shoving tournament of the skies where people try to stuff bags the size of newborn elephants into the overhead lockers Cons 1 It has the capacity to weigh suitcases up to 75 lbs but when you re traveling alone it s very awkward to lift a suitcase even half that weight with your arms extended so that it doesn t touch your body and still read the tiny numbers on the dial 2 The handle is small and ergonometrically challenged and people who can t lift a 50 lb suitcase with one outstretched hand will find it very difficult to get two hands in there Even if you do manage to get this far you won t be able to hold it for long before the handle sinks deep into your palm cutting you a new lifeline 3 You need to try to balance the suitcase by centering the hook on the suitcase handle but if you lift too quickly the hook slips to one side causing possible grievous bodily harm as the suitcase comes down on your toe 4 Another hook problem you can see that the hook is an open design If you are lifting the suitcase the hook can slip off on the way up causing the suitcase to fall as in 3 above Even worse the momentum keeps your hand moving upwards and not only can you give yourself a shiner or broken nose with the back of your hand but the hook can swing up and jab you in the eye True story You can use it on lighter luggage without too many problems but then again if your luggage is light you have no need to fear the scale do you On the surface this sounds like a great travel gadget but beware of the pitfalls Amanda Richards September 22 200 
A must for all frequent travellers I do lots of a travel some international too and often get into trouble at the check in counter because usually I would have done more shopping than I could carry and my bags are atleast 5 6 lbs over the limits After buying this luggage scale I now measure each of the bags distribute load well and know how much to shop and pack The scale is pretty accurate the weights that I see in the airline checkin counter is pretty much the same as what I have measured at home Highly reccomended for all travellers 
Great pair of shoes I love these shoes they go with so much and they are very comfortable If I could afford it I would buy them in every color I also love the fit and style you can dress them up or down I have received compliments on them every time I wear them I will wear them well into the fall 
Good things don t last Had a pair of these and they were awesome Left them in the car one hot summer day and my size 12 s now fit my 14 yr old daughter Size 8 woman s Very comfortable but don t leave in your car on a hot day 
Cross Generations We ve been wearing Shakas ever since we discovered them The only negative is that after wearing them we can t stand to wear anything else It s like going barefoot only with foot protection and support We have four generations wearing them My mother in law has a pair my husband and I have two each plus one for our daughter and two for our granddaughter Now my sisters are wearing them Anyone who tries them won t regret it Unlike the rigid versions sold by Walmart and Target these are extremely comfortable We want them in every color 
wrong size high price I recently ordered a pair size 12 13 Upon arrival I wore them While they seemed a little tight it was my size I ordered While at Walmart yesterday they had the almost exact pair They measured the same length as mine but were marked size 11 PLUS they were 80 cheaper In fact I paid more for shipping than these molded rubber shoes sold for in Walmart 
Shakas Shock my husband I bought a pair of Shakas for my husband these shoes sandles are not what he would have picked and he is surprised how much he loves them He is going to order another pair in a differnt color I have a pair as well and love the comfort and support 
Picky boy Great fit wash well did not shrink and I cant keep them clean as my son wants to wear them constantl 
Happy to finally find them I have worn thigh highs for over 30 years when only one or two manufacturerers made thigh highs These are some of the best made and have such a pretty lace top To comment to the previous negative review Not all women can wear them One must have slim thighs to prevent slippage becoming stretched out at the top loosens the elastic which makes them difficult to remain where they should Since I no longer live near a Neimans I m thrilled to be able to buy them here 
Jockey heavyweight muscle t shirt I bought the Jockey heavyweight muscle t shirts for my grandson He told me that the fit was true to size and the material was of excellent quality 
Nice Slipper Slipper is very soft and laundries well The only reason I didn t rate it 5 stars is because they slide off my heel Only a little frustrating Wish they had stronger back band 
This is a very comfortable slipper I really like these particular bedroom slippers because they cover your entire foot My feet stay cold year round so I wear bedroom slippers all the time The slippers are very soft nice to walk around the house in and I plan to buy more like these I recommend them to anyone who wants a comfortable shoe at a good price 
My 92 yr old mother LOVES these My 92 yr old mother has quite a bit of difficulty getting around she does use a walker 100 of the time She has a high instep and many slippers do not fit her well This style of Dearfoam slippers have actually assisted her from falling I hope Dearfoams continue this style 
Absolutely worth the money I ordered 2 pairs from Amazon One is black and another one is chili The whole quality of the black shoes are very good as I expected Stiching has no problem Outsole is integrated Interior shape looks very nice While the chili pair has one with some wrinkles on one side and looks that leather material is not good But it is OK since it is not so easy to be spotted 
Wonderfully soft It comes with the typical Bostonian comfort fit and much softer than it looks I d planned on spending the first week breaking it in before my trip but it was hardly necessary 
Above Average with Great Price on Amazon I bought a pair of these shoes at Mens Warehouse for 135 and I really liked them They are comfortable made well and look sharp The one problem I had with them is the bottom grip on the sole started to come off after 8 months of regular use That did not stop me from buying another pair for 80 from Amazon 
fun striped stockings These stockings are the BEST They fit well and look great Everybody loved them I got lots of compliments 
Princesses What little girl doesn t like feeling like a princess and with these panties she kind of does They are well made the pictures on them are sweet they fit well and wash well 
Great Boot Rockport s are always comfortable and I like the style Can t beat the price 
Nice fabric and fit I bought a size 16 As usual the waist was bigger but the tailor took that it I loved the feel of the fabric against my skin Everything else about it fit very very well Can t wait to wear it 
The WOW Factor beautifully constructed comfortable gorgeous shoes a work of art I can t stop looking at my feet 
nice bra This bra is very comfortable to wear but when a cup is pulled down to nurse the fabric pulls and binds a bit on the bottom of the exposed breast Even so I would recommend the bra because it fits so well especially as a sleep bra with a little support 
Not that comfortable If you have large breast be prepaired to keep fixing them so they stay in I bought this while I was pregnant to contain sore breast while sleeping I woke several times in the middle of the night to adjust myself Make sure you get the right size I think I could have gone a size smaller but I still think gravity would ve won 
Cotton Wrap Nursing Bra Excellent easy to wear easy to wash I d like to buy several more of different color 
Flower Embroidered Belt I bought this belt for my daughter in law for Christmas and she loved it 
ok shirt The material of the shirt is good fits good except the fact that it is shorter than it looks on the pictur 
So perfect thrilled with these shoes These were so gorgeous I bought them in two colors black and wine I wear them mostly to work and I ve received tons of compliments I also wanted them in the whiskey too but that color is 89 99 while the black and wine were 24 99 I hate that Amazon does that has different colors and sizes at different prices Also hate when the price changes while an item is in my cart the price changes 
Excelentessssssssssssssssss Mi hijo de 2 a�os es loco con estos tenis cada vez que se viste no importa la ropa que tenga estos tenis es lo que se quiere poner Y son muy bonitos a mi me gustaron mucho Estoy muy contenta con el producto 
The cutest I purchased a pair of the Disney Cars Toddler Boys Lightening Strap Sneakers for my grandson s 4th birthday He loves them They appear to be well made and have details of Lightening Mc Queen from the movie Cars 
A Happy Kid We just received these shoes for our almost 4 year old He LOVES them The soles are nice and the single velcro strip is quick and easy Difficult to tell from the photo but McQueen has a little toothy grin at the toe He is convinced he is now fast as lightning It was nice to find a Cars shoe in a color other than black 
Sneaker Review My son loved these shoes Even though he is two all he could say was CARS 
My Daughter Loves Her Lightning McQueen Shoes We bought these shoes for my 3yo daughter in August She wears them every day and they still look great But I have to admit that she s not really hard on her shoes She usually outgrows them before she outwears them Here are just some of the reasons why I ll probably have to buy her a new pair when she outgrows her current pair Everyone comments on how cute they are with the tires chassis and flashing lights They re easy for her to put on and take off by herself No one has noticed or commented that my daughter is wearing a boy s shoe The dark color helps to hide dirt and scuff marks These are great shoes for any Cars fan whether you have a boy or a girl I only wish they came in grown up sizes 
How Precious I ordered these for a little boy as part of a Christmas package for a non profit that helps parents get gifts for their chidlren due to crisis each holiday season I was so pleased when I opened the box before sending them to the parents through the annoymous match program I just know that child was thrilled with his little shoes on Christmas Morning I am so glad the shoes were sturdy cute and will bring joy to a child until he outgrows them more than likely HE will be stylin 
I was very pleased with my purchase This item came in a very timely matter It was new and still in the wrapper and they even threw in a free bandana I was very pleased 
Great hat A bit of a tight fit at first but when loosened up it looks good Shipping made it a bit heavy in price but service and hat was very goo 
Size runs larger than PJs by same maker I bought this robe and the silk pajamas for my boyfriend for Valentine s Day both in a size large The pajamas fit nicely but the robe was WAY too big I printed out the return label listing the reason for return as the product did not fit the description online Amazon said that this was not their fault and deducted the cost of shipping from my refund and did not offer the opportunity for an exchange So now I have to re order the robe in a smaller size and the price has gone up 7 since Valentine s Day This would have been a good deal if it had run true to size but because of misrepresentations made I will end up paying close to the full price listed MORAL Order one size smaller than you think you need 
Perfect Gift I bought this gift for my husband for our first Christmas He absolutely loved it the color the texture everything After searching around on the internet it was one of the best deals as well The gift arrived quickly and without any problems I highly recommend 
Love this product The robe arrive in great condition and in a timely manner My boyfriend absolutely loved his Christmas gift Thanks again 
great robe I thought that wearing a silk robe was more an affectation than anything else Happily I was wrong This robe is well made comfortable and it really looks nice 
Review of silk robe The robe was made of a very high quality fabric and held up very well The color and tecture of the silk was truly beautiful 
Just Great Great My wife fit in the dress right away and she looks great 
pleasantly surprised I bought this dress for my daughter s wedding I looked all around the local market and was not pleased with my choices I figured that I didn t have anything to lose looking on the internet Well I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and fit The price wasn t bad either and I even had the option of returning it if it didn t work something you don t have with a bridal shop It is perfect doesn t need any alterations only pressing 
This dress is amazing This dress is GORGEOUS The company is really nice too The dress shipped in less than a week and I had gotten a large just because the waist measurement was a little bit off well when the dress came i got the teal it was BEAUTIFUL but it was also huge on me so we emailed PacificPlex and they were so helpful in walking us through the exchange process I exchanged it for a medium in the lavender and it s on it s way right now the fabric is thick and the skirt twirls BEAUTIFULLY I felt like a princess when I put the dress on Just make sure to buy your normal size i m usually a medium 
How could you not feel like a bombshell in this dress It s fabulous and fits like a dream Ladies if you re looking for some extra oomph in the bust area or help with hiding larger hips this is the dress for you The satin is a heavier material so it hangs well and the skirt gives you an extra flounce when you walk Shipping was extremely quick and though there is no size chart for this particular dress the Rhinestone Pin Satin Halter Gown Bridesmaid Prom Dress is similar so you can use that as your guide I m seriously in love with this dress and so is the bride 
Worth every penny My son got the honor of playing ring bearer at a friend s wedding but the problem of finding a tux to fit an 18 month old was difficult Everywhere we looked the price was actually going to be more than renting an adult tux As much as I try to help the local economy I hate to say I was delighted to find a tux online for nearly half the price as the local stores The suit fit my son nearly perfectly and was very easily adjusted in places that were slightly too large my son has little to no bottom so all of his pants will eventually fall off if I don t clothes pin them in back that was nothing new In addition to this being adorable it s COMPLETE Even the comberbun Needless to say he and the suit were a hit I am very very happy with this purchase 
The Color I REALLY LIKED THIS SHIRT THE COLORS ESPECIALLY IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A EASIER WAY TO GET THE SIZE RIGHT BUT I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN 
cropped tee The Tee was too light weight the neck line was too low and I will chalk this up to experience and probably not wear any of the three I bought Probably will use them as rags to wash the car 
Nice Shoe bought my husband a pair of these to replace his vans and they have held up very very well look great too 
Great fit These glasses have a comfortable fit and do a great job of blocking out the sun 
Movie Star Glasses I absolutely love these they are dark which is a plus in sunny Texas They fit well and are very flattering The best part is that my grandson says they make me look like a movie star what could be better than that 
A return to the past Sometimes there s a need to feel the nostalgia of the past and only if you appreciated vintage Wear this glasses with a pokka dots or petit pois pattern pants for es or just with a white simple blouse yippie you ll look great A larggggggge round beach hat or Toyo would fit and match even better 
Love it Love it Love it I live in an incredibly sunny climate and not only do these glasses protect my sensitive eyes from the sun they look fabulous while they do it Highly recommend 
real awesome i bought this for my girl friend and she really loved it its very spacious and has soft leather touch a real buy and at awesome price 
Great Value This is a very well made nice wallet It is much nicer than I expected for the price 
Very nice wallet Very nice wallet Very soft Would have liked a bigger choice of colors Well worth what I paid for it 
Great bargain This wallet was exactly as described I ve been using mine for a couple of months and I m very pleased I m ordering a couple more for presents 
Great But Late This t shirt is a great product it is just as described on Amazon However it took 14 days for delivery it arrived too late for the recipient s birthday It was advertised available to ship on the day I ordered but obviously didn t ship for at least 7 days Love the shirt but disappointed in delivery time 
Great conversation starter People who know and love Napoleon Dynamite will love this Pedro Offers You His Protection shirt I love it and got 3 
Best Little Fanny Pack Made Hi I bought this for my little seven year old grandson and he was thrilled Thank you 
Adorable AND comfortable These are definitely some of the best shoes I ve ever bought They re adorable and super comfortable to walk in even for an all day thing not just an evening event 
lovely to look at delightful to touch The pashmina wrap that I purchased is beautiful The color is exactly like was displayed on line and nothing could compare to the way it feels when you touch it Smooth soft and rich feeling When I put it on I feel pampered 
Thank God the Rumors are FALSE All of my friends and I do mean ALL of my friends have been worried sick We just love these tights Not ALL of my friends wear the tights but those that don t wear the tights DO notice when the others those who do wear the tights aren t happy Why would those who do wear the tights be unhappy you might ask yourself Well we have been worried sick that these tights have been discontinued Well you can read it here yourself thank God these tights have not been discontinued I think that the company who makes these tights though should listen to my suggestion why call these skating tights I don t skate and I think these tights are just fabulous I sometimes put them on over my underclothes if I am going out and then I put another pair of pants on over those It just feels good and as they say in the Bible If it feels good do it So you can just put those rumors to bed the skating tights are here and you can buy them 
Quality Good but Sellers Fees Too High I feel that the shipping and handling fees for this item are entirely too high This is obviously an ad placed by the Skatebuys company I clearly recognize the wording of the ad as precisely the same as in their own website I have ordered many items from SkateBuys in the past and I still fail to see why I am asked to pay almost 10 00 in shipping fees for three pairs of stockings Ridiculous M Charbonnet in Tennesse 
I won t be wet I love this rainsuit It s comfortable looks great and works well 
Very Comfortable and Stylish This bra provides great support traps wetness and is stylish as well I sweat in the breast area during my workouts and I can t even feel the sweat until I get home and take it off It also provides great support so you won t get that droopy look under your tees and tanks at the gym Worth the money for sure 
good solid bra but not so sure for high impact activities I love the look and feel of this bra it is not a classic compression bra but encapsulation it has separate cups in addition it is not made of all cotton but a special moisture wicking material very comfortable I have purchased this bra three times and it was perfect when i was a 34B provided plenty of support and i loved how it was thick enough that i never showed through my tank top when exercising but now that i am a 34D i don t think this bra provides enough support when i am doing high impact activities like running or kickboxing for low to medium activities this sports is perfect still but since i have taken up more rigorous activities i have bought the panache bra make sure to buy your EXACT size in panache 
Skecher shoes win again Hi I think that these shoes are great especially if you cannot tie your shoes They still look like ties shoes and that is inportant to me The price that I paid wast even better Skecher has always been a good brand for me and these shoes continue the trend Scecher shoes are the only brand of shoe that I do not have to break in They are comfortable from the very first time you put them on 
Women s Saddashers Love them Exactly as pictured Got two pairs one in gold and one in silver 
Women s Sladdashers Love them Exactly as pictured Got two pairs one in gold and one in silver 
Little Black Bag The only thing that could make this bag better would be a small side zipper for easy access to your wallet or glasses 
Exactly what I wanted I searched for a long time on the internet and found this bag I ordered it and was pleased that it was just as I expected It s not too big but big enough to hold wallet cell phone folding umbrella and more It weighs practically nothing and the leather is very soft I would definitely recommend this bag 
ipod protectors great keep your ipod in great shape you pay alot for ipod and this is a great price love i 
Sleek beautiful comfortable Soft shoe the embellishment can be a bit uncomfortable because its solid but it is easy enough to move it around when the shoe is on your foot and the issue goes away Other than the fact that a shoe of this height is going to be uncomfortable after hours of wear i wore these for my sisters wedding AND reception the shoe is very comfortable 
New York Yankees Pink Knit Cap It was a good quality for the money but they get you on the shipping 
Can t Improve on the Best Well constructed well padded case for your small digital camera I like that it has an ample storage pocket for extra batteries and SD cards and I like the easy open U shaped zippers No corners to negotiate and no top cover to flip up and hold out of the way while you butterfinger your camera in and out of the case Pretty weatherproof and shockproof too It provides great protection for your camera I got a little carried away and kept the USB cable for my camera in the accessory pocket along with two extra batteries and a media card And this actually worked for several months before I broke the zipper I could have bought a differently designed replacement case locally there are dozens and dozens of them but none were anything like as suited to my needs and tastes as this little CaseLogic So I ordered another one from Amazon exactly like the one I ruined If there s anything I d change about the case it would be to add a small hand strap But that s not been an issue for me If I want to carry it in my hand I just slip a finger through the belt look and carry it that way I ve learned my lesson about storing the USB cable in the accessory pocket So I m expecting the replacement to easily outlast my camera 
Versatile durable small bag This case will barely hold my 5 1 MP Sony Cybershot digital camera in the large zippered pouch The small zippered pouch is nicely configured for holding extras like batteries extra memory sticks etc with the padded pouch and a webbed rear wall with velcro to secure the webbing giving two practical accessory sections The belt loop is well made strong well secured and doesn t have velcro or snaps which I hate since I fear losing the camera that way so this thing will stay on your belt worry free The zippers appear strong and don t bind or act sticky It feels light and fits comfortably to my side or back via my belt It is reasonably attractive as such bags go especailly for the low price The display cardboard it came mounted on I bought mine at a discount store said it had a lifetime warranty and it looks like it was made with a LONG life in mind The padding appears sufficient all around to resist normal bumps etc though I would fear a drop on concrete I actually bought this to hold my tiny memory stick based MP3 player and related accessories I already have a similar bag for my camera When my Creative Muvo player s el cheapo case that came with the player cracked badly and I feared it breaking completely I wanted a cheap durable reasonably sized case I really wasn t able to find ANYTHING made for such a player Then I looked for small camera bags figuring if I could pop the earbuds in with the winder and a couple extra batteries I was set Now this is what I carry my MP3 player in It is easy to carry 1 to 5 extra AAA batteries and the player and the earbuds and winder The player stays dry padded and secure The very versatile zipper two zippered tabs to leave any zipper hole where you want and as big or small as you want for the large pouch makes it perfect to let the earbud cord peek out without fear of any rain getting in I think if you have a SMALL digital camera OR a SMALL MP3 player and care more about functionality durability and a VERY reasonable price than the latest fashion fad you can t go wrong here The only three small drawbacks for tiny MP3 player use I can see are 1 I used a piece of bubble wrap to pad the player in the large pouch It was actually a bit big for the small pouch and would flop around a lot in the big pouch 2 Of course you can t get to the player controls when it is secured in this case This doesn t bother me as I generally just turn it on adjust the volume to the circumstances pick the music I want close the pouch and enjoy my music IF however you want to fiddle with the player controls a lot you WON T like this solution 3 Instead of a custom made hole for the headphone earbud cord you need to use a zipper gap as described above I see no practical harm and in fact it makes where the virtual hole goes extremely versatile However it may be a fashion disaster which I couldn t care less about personally 
my contessa di roma gown and kimono robe i just love my robe and gown it s so compfortable i just want to wear it all the time but of course can t do that huh thanks so much for my gift peggy spangl 
Gotta have one I wish I d found this bra years ago it is so hard to find a bra that does what it is supposed to This does it all Support comfort washes well This is a great product 
Support not the best I like the flexibility of a convertible and it s always tough to find them in my size However this one seems a tad flimsy 
Undergarment Purchase This item was exactly as described Very reasonably priced and very fast shipping Would definitely purchase from this merchant again 
Bra lelujah This bra is GODLY It fits like a dream 38DD and it gives AMAZING cleavage It s comfortable it s discreet beneath clothes and geeze I m ordering another one RIGHT NOW lt 
Just what I wanted Clear straps for ample bust It s difficult to find stylish bras in large sizes but this was great Long straps mean you really can criss cross and the clear straps are why I bought it I actually ordered the wrong size too large in the rib cage but it is still wearable 
Best shoes ever I d buy these and the gigaride shoes again and again until adidas would stop making them i have a pair of megarides that i ve been using for two years now very steady perfect cushioning and support i d buy another one right now if only amazon had them in my size 
Very pretty I really like this gown I love the color and the beading The fit is very flattering 
So comfortable I bought these underwear when I was 8 months pregnant and they were the most comfortable underwear I bought them in my prepregnant size and they absolutely did not cut into my sides or feel tight at all Great buy 
Silicon Skin Protective Cover for Sony PSP Console Clear Excellent quality cover which will protect my childs PSP 
i like it i think the item is real good but i was disappointed when the screen did not have a screen protector 
Excellent Product and Delivery I bought this money belt as a present for my brother and he liked it so much he went to the website and purchased another one Website was easy to navigate ordering was easy and the belt arrived within the specified time frame 
No Disappointment Here I was a little concerned with the product ordered until my friend opened the package She loved it thought it felt great when put on If she is happy I am happy 
Great Stuff and Value This really turn me on Specially when my wife wear this the night I received it 
Great gift item Ordered this for a gift Great quality nice colors and fit nicely too 
Good bodysuits Made of soft and stretchable cotton fabric The words are funny and the size is appropriate unlike some other less known brands Overall the product is pretty good The fabric is fairly thick so maybe warm for summer time 
Great Value These are by far the most comfortable and versatile work pants I own I spend a great deal of time working outdoors and I have found that they hold up well to all sorts of abuse 
Very Cute These are very cute shoes I ve gotten plenty of compliments on these shoes They are actually comfortable The color goes with just about anything The only thing I have to complain about is that the strap has the tendency to slip off no matter how tight you make it 
Good enough It s pretty much what I expected It s got a good feel to it and the clip is easy to attach once you figure it out For the price I can t complain 
Great buy This is an excellent buy for the price The shipping handling charge is a bit high though No instructions on how to attach the belt clip to the skin Took a while to figure that out I am very happy that I bought this product 
Great Skin Case I bought this case for my Creative Zen about a week and a half ago When it got here it was very easy to put on my Creative Zen It s very stretchy It protects it really well too It s a great deal If you have a Creative Zen and want an inexpensive but good case this is made for you The belt clip is awesome too It swivels around so you can still look at it even if it s on your belt 5 stars 
Cute but very uncomfortable They are very versatile You could wear them with anything but they are not comfortable Definitely not for alot of walking 
Magnetic Front Pocket Wallet Good quality leather The magnet could be stronger and the card pocket a little bigger 
Decent Not bad at all Just tried it on haven t worn it a full day yet Feels comfortable so far no digging nice lightweight material comfortable I prefer it over the Outlooks Thong Panty 
comfy These are awesome Very comfortable best thongs i own you cant even feel them this is like not wearing anything at all 
very comfy These are among the most comfortable thongs that I own My previous favorite was old navy s cotton thongs but these now take first place 
Awesome Black Socks I could not be happier than when I am wearing my long black socks 
The BEST Dress Shirts These dress shirts are the best Wrinkle Free Breathable Durable Material Plus lots of styles sizes and color options Compare side by side to other dress shirts and you ll see and feel the difference 
Best shirt I own I own three of these shirts and they are great I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are I packed one in my carryon bag to go to my sisters wedding reception wore it to the reception packed it back in the suitcase to take home then a few days later I was leaving on a business trip out of the country and decided to take this same shirt no I had not cleaned or pressed it again and packed it back into the carry on and brought it with me to Germany unpacked it upon arrival and the next day when I went to put it on it still looked pressed I was in awe Great shirts 
An unbelievable shirt My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out I was very skeptical of the quot no ironing quot claim I couldn t believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time not a wrinkle to be seen The material is truly miraculous We both love this product and plan to buy more Thank you Jos Banks 
Bought 2 and now I can t stop buying them I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I can t see myself buying other dress shirt 
Fantastic Shirt I own two of these Traveler non wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts 
Great I researched this thouroughly before buying I wanted a nice looking case that would protect the entrie thing with little extra space added to my iPod This case does all of that I got the red blaze color and I love it It even feels good to the touch I did cut out the space for the hold switch and the area around the headphone port but I don t see that as any sort of problem i just got my iPod today and have already dropped it but I feel safe and secure knowing that I have my evo3 case on my beautiful iPod Definitely worth the price 
iskin evo3 This is a great iPod case I researched these very thoroughly before making my decision and I made the right one Everything fits perfectly and is protected even screen and click wheel Save yourself the time and the money and just get this case It is very nice and I am a hard person to please I chose white and it looks great I ve seen others in person and white definitely looks best Also quite inexpensive Trust me just get it 
Protect to the Fullest My iSkin is great for keeping my pod scuff scratch free The skin is easily removable as well as putting it on I hav the 80gb ipod and the skin itself is very thin not adding to the size of my ipod The clip on it is extremely sturdy and rotates The skin also has a slot to place in the connecter to keep it clean from dust dirt The only disadvantage is you ll prob have to remove the skin if you play your pod thru speakers 
What I expected from the description and that s good Previously I owned a leather flip face cover for my Ipod Video and it worked fine for a while but the flexible screen cover became loose and began to scratch the screen This product is exactly what is described The iSkin eVo3 Athletic Protective Case has a hard plastic see through cover that fits over the entire front of the iPod The silicon cover is soft and sticky so it prevents sliding especially if you remove the clip and is easy to put on The case covers the whole ipod except the headphone jack and has a flap that fits over and into the connection on the bottom You use the click wheel and the slide on top through the silicon It also looks pretty good The only thing that takes some getting used to is the silicon over the click wheel It like the click wheel was when I first got the iPod takes some getting used to It s pretty thin and tends to buckle if you push hard Don t worry though It fixes itself when you pick up your finger If you re looking for a good quality semi cool looking funcional cover this is a pretty good choice Either way enjoy and share your music whenever you can 
perfect i ordered one of these dresses for my bridesmaid i received it in the mail sooner than i expected the color i ordered sage matched the color shown perfectly i only ordered one so far so i could determine the sizing on my only bridesmaid that lives near me the sizing is bigger than shown on the size chart i reccomend going down a size this was a great buy i surely am glad i found this instead of paying an arm and a leg for bridesmaid dresses 
Pretty dress This dress is high quality material and is very comfortable to wear The top part of the dress has to be altered but the waist fits fine I agree with another reviewer that this dress runs a little big It even came with optional straps and wrap Definatly a great bargain 
Beautiful The color was vibrant and shining The dress was gorgeous and just looked like good quality Another seller called PacificPlex sells this same dress called a 50 s satin strapless dress but I prefer this one by the seller GoJane It costs a few more dollars but it s worth it Go with GoJane for better quality dress 
Absolutely wonderful I ordered 5 of these dresses for my bridesmaids Two of them were too big for the girls so I sent them in for smaller sizes Not only was the exchange free but the new dresses arrived within a couple of days Now all of my bridesmaids have dresses that fit perfectly and look beautiful I would definitely order from GoJane again 
GREAT FIND I purchased 3 of these dresses for my bridesmaids The dresses showed up in less than a week The color matched what it showed online and same with the sizing This was truely a FABULOUS find 
Bridesmaids Formal Dress I purchased two of these dresses for my bridesmaids and I love them I didn t know what size to get so I just called them and they were very curtious and helped me determine which size I need to order The fabric is beautiful and will make my bridesmaids shine It comes with straps that someone can put on if you need This was cheap and beautiful for my bridesmaids 
Good buy I bought this dress for my brides maid It is plain which is what I like The fit was pretty good I would say that is runs a little big in the sizes I got the one they call champagne but it is actually more a gold You can t beat the price 
just perfect After looking and looking for the perfect prom dress for my daughter I chanced on this one The minute I saw it I knew it would be perfect We were looking for something elegant and not too trendy She wanted to feel like Audrey Hepburn not a fairy princess This dress fit the bill beautifully She looked stunning and said it was absolutely a dream to wear A quick word of praise and thanks for the people at Pacific Plex I ordered this dress on Monday night and had the dress in my hands 36 hours later We will definitely be ordering from this company again 
Loved It This dress was great I wore it to a wedding I even have a picture where I look like a movie star in it However I was glad I read the review about the sizing I am normally a medium and I had to get a large to fit me Thanks 
Stunning dress for an amazing price This dress is a BARGAIN I m chaperoning prom this year and this is perfect Who would have thought one could get such a lovely dress for such a low price It is pure ELEGANCE 
Great quality low price I ordered this black XL for a bridesmaid dress as well At first I was concerned it may be too casual but out of the package it looks quite elegant The material feels like a good quality not thin and cheap and the broach doesn t look like a kiddy toy I also had to double check measurements with the sizes because it didn t quite match up with my normal size It definitely wears well without being clingy or riding up Definitely pleased with the price for what I got 
This is the best buy I ordered this dress in white for a summer wedding dress I have to say that the picture doesn t due it justice It fits perfectly and I am so pleased that I got it in only a few days All I have to do is to have it pressed and its ready for my wedding I will be telling everyone about this site and how pleased I was for what I got We are on a tight budget for our wedding and this really saved us time and money Just be sure and check your sizes I had to oreder a size bigger than I wear 
BEAUTIFUL Dress Better in person I bought two of these dresses in Icy Blue The color is JUST what I was looking for These dresses are for my bridesmaids I have been searching everywhere for this color and all I could find were turquoise colors not what I wanted But this dress is perfect Even better in person and fast shipping 
Glamourous Dress I ordered this dress in black for my 15 year old daughter and this dress definately is more gorgeous than you see on line One small problem is size you can not order your correct size since this dress runs smaller My daughter is a size 16 18 and she needs a 3x The bust line has to be altered on the side and neck line I love this dress though I will be ordering this dress for my daughters Sweet 16 for 8 girls in Ice Blue I am just looking for a size chart You will love this dress also 
Very Nice Dress I got 2 of this dress one in White and one in Pink I love them Just be careful when getting a size I am a size 12 13 and had to order a 1x And that was a little snug on my bust line I will buy from them again just ordered anther dress like this one So just make sure you know your size when you order 
The Perfect Prom Dress I saw this dress while surfing the internet and absolutely fell in love with it I ordered the red one for Prom this year 2007 and I got it 5 days later While all my other friends were running around looking in malls for their dresses I found mine in a lot less time and for a lot less money I will definitely look here first for any more formal dresses I will need Thanks so much 
Good for the money I purchased 2 pairs of these shoes one black and I thought one brown The brown is actually a bronze color I was looking for a more chocolate color I kept the bronzy colored shoes because I didn t have a pair this color Make sure this is not a color you would want The wear is very comfortable 
Excellent Service I was VERY pleased with the product and the service My order arrived within 3 days of my placing my order and I didn t ask for any type of express shipping Bravo 
Great Clogs I am so pleased with these shoes I can t tell you how much Not only were they comfortable to wear they were very affordable Shipping was quick and easy 
Sally M I paid over 100 for the same ones years ago I recently bought these in 2 colors and LOVE em Anyone thinking about buying it go for it 
great deal I m not one to splurge so I picked these shoes for the good price and got the standard shipping I was so suprised when I got them only one day later =D They look great and they are very comfortable However they do leave scuff marks on the linoleum and hard wood floors and there is a bright white made in china logo right inside the tongue But no worries For the price and quality I m very happy with them 
Very Comfortable But Has a Marking Sole I use these Betulas as a pair of slippers in the house and they are really comfortable I ve had them for about 6 months From what I gather Birkenstock makes the cork supporting footbed which gives the support and comfort Betula does the rest I rate them very highly for their comfort and looks but unfortunately the soles tend to leave black marks on our tiled and laminated wood floors when I shuffle my feet The marks are easily washed away but it s disappointing that it doesn t have a non marking sole Also the buckles on my pair have a silver coating that is now wearing off Great comfort at a great price but it s not perfect 
Birki s Black Suede Clog You can t go wrong with this shoe especially if you are a tried and true Birki lover like me The black suede looks really rich and as always the comfort is superb 
Birkenstock Rock Black Suede Clog 740303 Size 43 Fit well and looks as fine as its photos Also was delivered in a timely fashion standard shipping 
Very comfortable These Clark s shoes are the most comfortable informal shoes I have ever had they fit to my feet like gloves and look very nice in fact I have two one in oily brown and the other in black 
Durable Plus These were a gift to my son who has difficulty finding comfortable shoes in large sizes He finds these to be durable comfortable a good fit and nice looking Highly recommend Clark s Brand Shoes 
gift for husband my husband was very happy with this jacket adn the price was great 
Good casual jacket I ordered this for my dad he liked it but he didnt like the material in arm holes he wanted it to be the same as on the chest but over all for the price this is a nice jacket 
comfortable and fits for any ages my husband is very pleased with this jacket lightweiht high quality for every occasion we have even ordered another jacket for our son S Faleev 
Great I am 12 and I love these they are so comfortable A lot of kids in my P E class wear briefs so i dont get made fun of I sleep in them and they dont irritate my skin like others do I used to wear boxers but i switched over because i hated the wedgies Im never going back They are good for lounging and if your gong through puberty the restrains the errections which is ALWAYS a good thing 
What You Would Expect for Good Underware These are good quality as the waistband has three lines of stitching to the body of the shorts rather than the more usual two The grey elastic waistband streaches to about 140 of its normal size and although it isn t as wide tall as the one found on men s shorts it is thicker The leg openings are reinforced with double stitching Your little boy will out grow these before he wears them out 
helpfull I am 12 and I used to wear pull ups due to accidents One day when I was at Walmart I had to go potty really bad I went to the restroom and it was full I realized I had to make the decision to use my pull up even though I wasnt supposed to I pottyed in the pull up I ran to the underwear department and grabed these hanes I went to another bathroom took off my pull up cleaned up and put the underwear on To my amazement they were comfortable Later that night my step dad came in to put me in my pull up I surprised him by taking off my clothes and revealing my underwear He was so proud of me and my decision Problem with these is that sometimes I wet the bed and they show stains but I keep on wearing them The briefs gave me the confedence to breakaway from the pull ups and be a real big boy 
Briefs 4ever Briefs feel comfortable and they help support your penis during puberty when boys need briefs the most when boys usually switch to boxers The briefs support your scrotum and keeps airborne fungus and other contaminates out Boys just don t understand why they need briefs They need to be educated on boxers vs briefs The only problem is these are white and wetspots left over urine will show 
Good Briefs Bad Time I m 12 years old and I wear Hanes briefs all the time every day and I ve never worn anything else before except for a pair of boxers one time that I really hated Well I have a bad story to tell The other day at school me and my friend were changing in the lockeroom after PE Well while I had my pants off I was only wearing a shirt and my tighty whities and while that was the only thing I was wearing this other boy came up to me grabbed the waistband of my underwear and then gave me a super wedgie What s good about it is that it didn t hurt because wedgies in briefs never hurt If you wear boxers and you get a wedgie in them it s gonna hurt bad Seriously boys you should try these Hanes white briefs out They re great in all ways 
beifs are cool i am 14 but i have a large penis i was wondering if these would stretch much i normaly wear breifs two sizes up and safety pin the band can you hel 
Nervous I once switched to boxers thinking that they are cool and that people would make fun of me if I wore these in the school locker room Now that it s 3 years later I want to switch back but I am afraid that my brothers and school mates will make fun of me 
My briefs My mom makes me wear briefs i dont mind them but i would rather wear something else because other kids give me a hard time about it most of the pantsing and wedgies in the locker room is in good fun but sometimes i get my head flushed in the toilet The briefs fit and feel great exept for when the waist band is up to my neck 
Warm Jacket Fast Service I got this jacket around 5 days after ordering Fast service The jacket is warm and stylish Love it 
wonderful jacket This is a real bargain Pretty jacket with good quality and incredible price The material is really good medium warmth and it looks like expensive coat By far this is the cheapest winter jacket i have with quality the same like my other jackets Definitely will buy from the same brand again if they have model i like 
Heaven for feet You ll love these slippers If only I could wear them to work 
Red hot slippers These were exactly what I wanted for my new daughter in law The insole is cushy the outer sole gives traction The red is beautiful for Christmas The velour looks elegant They are easy to get into and slip off 
Never received my order I waited for months only to find out my order was not available Would have loved to have received it 
Pelican Case Excellent product very easy to customize Very well designed and constructed Won t regret ever 
Pelican perfection There are several choices on the market for foam filled cases and some are cheaper than the Pelican but in my experience none have been so consistently high in quality The integrity of O rings the durability of the latches and the color choices all made the decision to buy this Pelican a simple one My company owns about a dozen in various sizes and they are just great 
Hot Hot Way Hot Ouch I m so hot you ll burn if you touch me That s how I feel when I have these oh so micro crotchless panties on Hot hot way hot I have not introduced these to my husband yet but I think I can pretty much darn guarantee you he s gonna love em Spread your legs in these and your guy s gonna get the message 
These Almost Nothing At All Panties Really Set off a Girl s Body I shot the heck out of my sister and her friends at our lingerie party as they tried on these panties At first the girls wore different tops with them sexy bras skimpy tees but after a bit I got them to shed those and I clicked away Then it was my turn and the camera was clicking at me Kind of thrilling These almost nothing at all panties really set off a girl s body in a photo 
Sexier than Naked I dare say these are just about the sexiest things I ve ever worn Oh I ve had and have G strings have some pretty skimpy ones too But a crotchless G String masqurading as a crotchless pantie what a concept Try going outside in a short skirt with nothing under it but these Might as well be walking around naked under that skirt But then again I ve done that However wearing these panties slash G string just seems sexier than naked 
backup compass a good backup compass when knowing which way is north is importand to getting back alive 
Cool and Useful This is a cool Gadget for a jacket or bag and useful too 
Received on time I actually ordered these when out of the country but am familiar with Birkenstocks I was just pleased that the price is what it was and that I received it early at the address they were shipped to I still won t wear them until a few months still overseas but glad to know they ll be there when I finally do arrive 
The shoe that fits Love these shoes Very comfy and good for your feet Every orthopedist and podiatrist I know recommends these Wears forever the other pair I still have is still going after 5 years of continuous wear but I needed to get one with a shinier leather finish for dress up days I have really put the other pair through the ringer Rain and puddles these come out perfect I may just have the old pair retreaded and use them in rain and yard work Don t leave home without your Birkies 
Arizona Birk I have worn Arizona Birks for years I have Plantars Fascitiis and the arch support in these sandals is just what I need I wear them daily This is one of the best products for my condition aside from the obvious benefit of wearing sandals 
Ware these everyday except I ware the Arizona sandal in warm weather and the Boston Clog in cold weather These Birkenstock shoes take some getting used to at first but you soon find these are the most comfortable shoes you can put on your feet Recommended to me by a doctor friend for my heel spur syndrome worked for me I now ware Birks not sneekers as my everyday shoe There are places and functions where sandals and clogs are inappropriate Most of us know where these places and events are 
They re all I wear well on my feet anyway I have worn this particular style of Birks for over fifteen years now and except for an occasional dress up occasion they are all I wear if the weather is warm They mold to your feet wear like iron and your local shoe repair shop can give you a new set of soles for around 30 This is the lowest price I have found except for a German site on ebay Love em 
It s all I wear Briefly I had a childhood accident 30+ years ago that caused arthritis in my foot Not bad but a constant nagging pain sensation that I learned to just live with Finally I saw a podiatrist who referred me to a pedorthist to be fitted with footwear that could alleviate my pain I wound up with a pair of Birkenstock sandals and I ve never turned back They re great No more foot pain period I wear dress socks and the sandals to work everyday in an office environment I got flack for that from co workers but the needling didn t bother me and management never took me to task either to church everywhere I ve a different pair of Birkies for the beach and lawn work not as comfortable as the suede uppers on these Arizona s The mocha suede straps have held up wonderfully despite getting wet and lightly soiled from time to time Admittedly it s a lot of money to spend but the shoe store my pedorthist works in re soles the Birkies for about 30 and will replace the cork and sole both for about 50 The re soled sandals last about a year but remember I wear them daily and I often walk a few miles each day In short these sandals have dramatically improved the quality of my life and foot arthritis is no longer any concern for me Not bad for a little more than 100 
Great sandals I Bought these sandals for my husband and he loves them His feet are happy Its a very comfortable sandal it worth it s price 
WON T EVEN TRY ANYTHING ELSE My husband purchased his first pair of Birkenstocks in a little town in New Mexico about 30 years ago He is now on his third pair and will not even try any other kind of Birkenstock or any other kind of sandal And he would still be on his second pair if the new puppy hadn t chewed up the cork they wear like iron and according to my husband get more comfortable with age 
perfect fit I Love these Jeans They fit me so well What a convenience to be able to have them delivered to my home Of course you must know your size and the fact that I knew how they fit because I have another pair really helped 
Great Panties I bought these panties for my 15 year old sister in law when I found out she liked thongs I got her 6 pairs because they are so cheap She has been begging me for more because they re the best panties she has ever had My wife bought some as well and she looks so great in them 
The Kind of Under Stuff Women Were Meant to Wear What my gal Sara and her friends like about these panties is that they are worn low way under the waist so you can wear those low cut pants without your panties showing What I liked about them is that they are just oh so bloody stand out sexy This is the kind of understuff women were meant to wear 
Tango Tanga has My Vote I really feel good in these panties and they re so doggone inexpensive They looked good make you feel good when you see yourself in the mirror and girls if you re starting to put on a few extra pounds buy a few pair of these and wear them a lot Look at yourself in the mirror a lot You ll work hard at keeping the weight off just so you can keep looking good in these fabulous panties It s important to look good important to feel good about yourself Pretty underwear can help keep you thin if you just wear it look at yourself in it and imagine the woman you want to be Do that and it ll give you a little more resolve when you are confronted with donuts and coffee at work For me it s celery and carrot sticks People think I m nuts If they only knew what I wear under my clothes then they wouldn t think it they d know it 
Oooo So Cute these Panties Are And at the 6 00 price I can afford a lot of them They come in colors one for every day of the week I ll be wearing these a lot they fit nicely are comfortable they are real low riders and they are just oh so cute mega sexy too 
Gotta Get a Lot of These These Tango Tanga panties just make you want to get up and dance they are so so sexy Made of lacy nylon and spantex they conform to your curves and you can hardly tell you have anything on at all I like the low fit I love the name so catchy Gotta get a lot of these 
Tango Tanga All Night Long Wow are these hot Makes me want to hop a flight to Rio and dance a vacation away These guys are way cool and they don t show through your clothes The lace is soft and sexy not machine washable though but at six bucks if you forget you can just buy more You ll probably want them in several colors I know I do 
Comfort and Sexy It was more comfortable than I suspected My husband had a positive response which was good I was defenitly satisfied with the product 
Higher Quality than Expected For six dollars I expected a rough uncomfortable but still sexy product The pair that I got feels incredibly soft I am impressed Unfortunately I have not yet seen it on my GF but it does look good in the picture 
Super sexy comfortable boots These boots are so sexy and will make you so much taller when you re wearing them I absolutely love my new boots and they look so good with a pair of jeans and comfortable enough to wear all day long You ll love them as much as I do The size fits a little on the big side so best thing would be to go to a Nine West store to try out the size before you purchase online but online prices are definately cheaper What a deal 
Nine West boot review These boots are great I got them on clearance for 39 99 and couldn t be happier They re comfortable and stylish and look great with jeans Nice quality 
where are my shoes I have not received my shoes until today Whare are they 
Nice boots I just bought these boots in Med Brown today and they are very nice True to size I always enjoy purchasing boots from Nine West because the quality is always good and the prices reasonable My only suggestion is that if anyone is going to purchase these boots I suggest shop around because I got them on sale for 59 99 at Century 21 Amazon usually has good deals but not this time around 
Big turnaround Just received this item excellent fit great quality and the free gift was a nice surprise Had one disappointment before but I m glad I bought Andrew Christian this time 
Love these swim trunks As a 37 y o biathlon who s pretty fit I m sick of wearing those mid length baggy swim trunks I ve had since I was well forever When I saw Casino Royale new James Bond flick I realized I wanted to get some of those 50 s era boxy shorts That s exactly what these are Very cool Also prompt shipping and excellent support from Andrew Christian Update your beach look to something other than 1982 
Happy Hubby I purchased this shirt for my husband He is thrilled Good quality garment Washed well 
A Perfect Christmas My nephew had requested a Babe Ruth t shirt for Christmas I am notorius for buying LATE and there were only 4 business days left To my surprise during the busiest time of the year the shirt was wrapped and under the tree My nephew was so excited when he opened his gift The shirt was exactly what he wanted and the quality was excellent The shirt was from Fans Edge and they did an EXCELLENT job shipping the item out F A S T 
Authentic Pigment Tote Bag Excellent Roomy enough for my shopping yet small enough to carry without endangering others Strong and well made too Wonderful earthy pigment Definitely a great purchase 
EXACTLY what I wanted I just received my tote bag It is exactly what I hoped it would be The pigment color is soft The bag is very strong well sewn and roomy I like the sturdy handles and the neat snap at the top I received this item in 6 days from the order date It s a great bag 
great socks for a good price These socks are of very fine quality and the price is very good 
Bought these on the strength of the other reviews and I second their opinions I bought these socks on the strength of the other reviews I won t repeat what these reviewers said except to say that I agree they are the best white socks you can get However I will add some additional information that they did not necessarily mention These socks are obviously well made and fairly thick However they are not too thick which is a concern that I had They are much thicker and softer than Gold Toes Cotton Crew socks but you must also pay for this i e 9 00 vs 15 00 On the other hand I estimate these socks will stand up to laundering better last much longer and will stay up with repeated washing The exact composition of these socks is 84 combed cotton 15 stretch nylon and 1 spandex The less expensive socks I reference above are 82 combed cotton 17 stretch nylon and 1 spandex One would think this wouldn t make much difference in terms of durability but there seems to be more weight and material overall in the higher quality socks I have also had some experience with the WHITE COTTON CREW socks and while they are absorbent because of the high cotton content I don t feel they held up to repeated washing well I also don t think they are much better than less expensively priced socks by other manufacturers However the WHITE FLUFFIES are a quantum leap up and worth the extra money 
The best white cotton casual sock you can buy These are NOT the Cheap O white socks They are the Gold Toe White Fluffies we all look for Extra heavy cotton weight to absorb sweat and provide that soft cushion feeling for your feet The elastic bind holds the socks up just fine without the top coming undone after many washes I wear white socks everyday and buy 2 dozen at a time These socks will last me 5 years Remember wash them with cold water and tumble dry on low heat to make the cotton fabric last a long time 
Navy is a very very dark blue I would never give Gold Toe Cotton Fluffies anything less than 5 stars they are one of my favorite things but I want to caution people that the color Navy is to my human eyes at least virtually identical to Black I love my socks but I have a real problem matching them up when I sort my laundry and it s not as though I am color blind I fear that it will be a challenge to distinguish these from true black socks when they come out of the dryer About 25 years ago Gold Toe manufactured Cotton Fluffies in a much wider variety of colors I would pay a lot of money for a new pair of Kelly Green Cotton Fluffies should they ever be re issued I think Gold Toe may be missing out on a real opportunity to market their socks in limited edition colors like VW Beetles or Beanie Babies 
great product great product for the price only complaint is that the clip becomes loose after a while but all wallets like this are the sam 
Smaller than expected Very nice but this runs real small I ordered 2 one small and one XL The XL would be about a medium Hope this helps others when ordering 
East bay gym sack Great bag very durable I was concerned about how well it was put together and this bag is great 
I LOVE these shoes Just recieved these yesterday and fell in love They are even cuter than they look in the picture This is a very lightweight shoe with great cushioning in the heel I think KangaROOS is my new favorite shoe brand 
Comfy and cute This sock is great It s the cute argyle pattern just the right thickness and the fit is great even for a larger calf 
I love these socks Warm and comfortable What else would you want from a sock 
Cute socks These were very cute socks and have become one of my favorite pairs Not as stretchy as I d like them to be but I love the colors and would definitely buy them again 
Very Satisfied Those shorts were just right Generous tapes allow excellent adjustment to size Pocket layout is fine Very satisfied 
Nine West Women s Boot s This boot fits true to size and is a very sexy boot for a woman biker I just love it 
Great boots I love these boots but given the other reviewers comments I think that these boots aren t for everyone I am 5 2 110 pounds and my calves are normal to thick The boots fit me just fine The upper part that s supposed to hug your calves is bigger than on most boots but I like it that way I m so short that these boots go up past my calves to my knees so I appreciate the extra space They re very well made boots 
Not for Girls with Thin Calves i could not wait to get these boots in the mail the boot itself is great looks just like the photograph if not better and it s very very well made but since i am on the thin side the top of the boot did not fit the way i had imagined and i tend to wear longer styled pants and gauchos with these the space in the back of the boot is quite noticeable on me but again the boot itself is great just a tip more than anything 
CROCS ROCK This is my third pair of Crocs and I love every one of them This new Mary Jane style is the best Everyone wants to know where I got them 
Excellent Product This product was an excellent buy This clogs are so confort and light I love them 
Love Crocs I already have a pair of crocs but I really like these maryjane style crocs They are very cute and I like the gold color because they go with a lot of things Crocs are very comfortable and a great product 
Great Jersey Jersey is great price was great and my son loves it What more could I ask for 
Sorry I only bought two Grab them up while you can ladies and gentlemen if you want an impressive gift for a lady you love These are absolutely the most beautiful flawless A one quality silk scarves I have ever purchased They are lovely for wearing table toppers to wear in your hair or just draped casually around your head on a cool night I need about a dozen more The colors are indescribable the shimmer in the light changes the fabric colors as you move They are like fluid fabric I can t describe them any better than this and I am a professional journalist and critic I can t find the words to convey their beauty and the delight they gave me The plumber was here when I received mine and he wouldn t touch them but was amazed at their beatuy and had to know where I got them so he could get one for his fiancee As I said get them now and buy more than what you think you want because when you get them home you ll want more Sincerely a VERY picky person who would rate these scarves a ten if possible 
Not really a briefcase I bought this as a Christmas gift because it is shown and described as a briefcase however potential buyers should be aware that it is actually a case for a laptop computer We were planning to buy a laptop anyway so we kept the bag As a laptop bag it is high quality and plenty roomy 
Great Jacket The leather jacket was just as described It fit as I expected and it is made wel 
Great bargain This jacket bought on sale at a fabulous price would have been worth the full price It is quality from top to bottom 
Great Black Leather Jacket I ordered this jacket on line for my husband for Christmas It is a great jacket The quality is great and he loves it Shipping was quick we are very happy with this purchase Thank yo 
Great customer service LeatherUp shipped this to me via DHL DHL shame on them just left it on my front door and I never got it must have been an easy pick for anyone walking by I expected to spend a lot of time trying to sort this out but LeatherUp shipped me a replacement via FedEx personal delivery after 2 short calls Did nt spend more than 10 min total with them on the phone The jacket is very good quality and my wife really likes it Took away one star for the zipper which could have been a little more solid Great value for the price 
Perfect Just what I was looking for Like everyone else I was skeptical but decided to take a chance and was not disappointed I m 5 11 and 175lbs I purchased a Large and it fits me perfectly The only negative I have is that the zipper is not as easy to hook together and when zipping its not as smooth as I like But 95 of the time I leave the jacket unzipped 
Fantastic Bargain As most of the other reviewers here have said the quality of this jacket is excellent for the price Not only is the leather very decent quality but the overall construction lining buttons etc are all very good quality Normally when I buy something of this sort that is this inexpensive I don t expect it to last for long but I definitely expect to be wearing this jacket years from now Shipping was fast and affordable I had no issues with sizing as long as you know your jacket size such as for a suit you should have no trouble In my size the jacket fit perfectly I m very pleased with this puchase 
Just buy it before its gone best jacket at this price Well what can I say I bought a leather jacket last year from Amazon Giovanni Nevara even then the stuff was good but still their sizing information confused me and I had to give it to my dad Then I found leatherup jacket and they got good stuff all the stuffs are good and at very reasonable price The sizing is perfect the leather is near excellent but not the ROYAL thing The ineer lining is very nice and warm One thing to note if your size is 37 38 or 43 44 then measure like this for 37 38 dont get 38 42 you will get the 42 size which will be large get 34 36 and you will get 36 which will be alright and for 43 size order 40 42 you get the point If your looking for a sub 100 jacket this is the one and its the best gift for anyone If I want to buy a gift I will buy this one again 
Good review I just received this jacket and the quality was good and I definately will order agai 
Best jeans ever I normally don t write reviews but these jeans are the best ever They run SMALL and still fit over my wide thighs and hips and somehow manage to fit my smaller waist Wide hips narrow waste almost always = gaps in the back but not with these 
Execellent underwear The best support EVAR You definetly get what you pay for with this product 
great boot This boot was comfortable right out of the box and I ve gotten several compliments on how they look 
Just what I was looking for These are plain white undies just as the image shows They are confortable and simple which is just what I was looking for 
Men s Columbia Fleece Jacket My son in law says this is the nicest jacket IT is warm made very well and fits nice It was shipped and received with in five days and packaged very well This is the second time I delt with this company and have no complaints Thank You Twila Moberly M 
Pleased I got the cap when promised I like the quality it was a positive experience I recommend them to anyone 
alp 1910 6 pigment dyed baseball cap white The baseball caps are fine I m wearing them to play tennis 
fabulous suede sheepskin slippers These are wonderful slippers My daughter is enjoying them immensly in this frigid weather 
great quality sheepskin slippers loved the slippers great sizing very stable so they should las 
These are the only heels for me I m 37 and I HATE high heels and do NOT wear them I actually feel comfortable in these I can walk without wobbling unlike every other pair of heels they are comfortable when I walk I ve worn these to work all day been on my feet standing for hours and they were completely fine I m astounded 
loved the shoes I love these shoes They look better on your feet than from the picture Pretty comfortable and fit me well esp since I have wide feet The heel height is perfect too I m planning on purshasing more in red dark brown and light brown 
Smooth Purchase loved the shoes Comfortable Shoes great delivery as described FAST delivery too 
Nice wallet A little bulkier than I expected given that it has six card slots Still I m happy with it Seems better constructed than the Dockers front pocket wallet it replaced 
Just What I Needed I was looking for a compact wallet that would fit in my pocket when I went to the beach It fits the bill 
Nice product The quality is just excellent on this product I am very picky about the wallet so it could be improved if the money clip was a different style and held the bills on the inside If you are used to a money clip but want room for credit cards and ID to stay secure you will love this 
Great Case I could not believe the price The three cases are very protective and the shipping from My Gear Store was very fast 
Great Color Options This is a great deal I got 3 cases for the price of one I like the colors and the options I haven t worked out with them yet but it looks sturdy Great dea 
disappointing You can use them as a skin but to use them excercising or on the move is no good The attachment to the strap is poor and the ipod is on a clip that can rotate so when you re moving it is swinging around and just not useful for anything other than standing still 
Review of sweatshirts The materail was a little thin but the size I requested fits well and has held up well after several washes 
Great hat great look and fit I bought this as a gift and it went over very well Nice bold color and the small size fit perfectly for her Good stuff 
Exactly what I was looking for I wanted an inexpensive bike short with expensive styling and that is exactly what I got Not too tight in the legs as many cycling shorts can be and I like that Perfect for indoor cycling classes which is what I ordered them for Comfortable and affordable perfect 
almost perfect This bag is just about perfect If like me you re tired of of lugging around a duffle or similar single shoulder strap bag this bag is for you It has pockets for your shoes pockets for toiletries a pocket for your wallet keys and well it has a lot of pockets The trapazoid design makes the weight of a fully loaded bag easier to carry The option latch that connects the shoulder straps across your chest helps too Also the shape the bag allows it to be easily folded in half and stuffed in a locker when it s empty I have only two minor complaints about this product The main cavity of the bag isn t as roomy as I d like making it difficult to carry a lot of clothes and a abdomen level strap like the chest strap would be useful for better distribution of weight when the bag s full and heavy 
good order easy to find and order Arrived in good condition Received what I ordered No surprise 
Very Soft I am very difficult to fit The material used in this bra is very soft however the fit is not very comfortable It is probably just me I would say the product is great 
Very Nice The material and fit is perfect I try to stay away from underwires due to discomfort but this one is great 
I m Impressed I have heard of the Breezies bras before but never had the chance to order one When I came across this particular one online the price was too perfect to let go I ordered 2 bras and was amazed to receive them within 3 business days I was very pleased with the softness and quality of the bra The overall fit was true to size and the support was also good No bulging or underwires poking at the skin 
Wonderful Bra I love breezies I seen this bra on one of the t v shopping networks and I was very interested in trying the product but the prices were actually more compared to amazon This is the most wonderful bra I have EVER owned and I have tried many brands I even went online to buy a few more breezies I used to wear victoria s secret but NO MORE Not only is breezies SO comfy but they are stylish and ACTUALLY fit 
Wonderful Fit I received this today a day earlier than the first day of the estimated delivery I already tried it on and it fits perfect It is definitely the quality I would expect from Leg Avenue It is soft to touch beautifully made and the perfect fit I know my husband will be pleased 
Awesome ship speed lots of colors and good price This set is perfect for that weekend getaway or valentines or anniversary or No it s not a 25 50 set but that s not how they sell it You could have 3 different colors and sets for that price Anyhow they ve served their purpose Thanks 
great shoe great fit shoes are amazing i bought a black and brown pair fit perfect comfortable although the brown is darker than it look 
Great shoes I love this style can be dressed up or dressed down and has the comfort of a sneaker with the style of a dress shoe 
Comfy work shoes I am a chiropractic assistant and on my feet alot I wear these shoes to work and my feet do not hurt at the end of the work day 
Cute and Comfortable Shoe Both my 31 year old daughter and I LOVED the look of this shoe She bought a pair in black and I bought it in brown They are very comfortable are true to size and absolutely adorable I have had several compliments People have said that the velcro comes loose but I have not had that problem I thoroughly recommend them 
wonderful comfort fashion Absolutely love these shoes Not only are they stylish cute can be worn with more dressed up casual but they are very comfortable for walking On a warm weather vacation I brought these because I still wanted to look fashionable but be comfortable for all the walking we were going to do Even now I wear them a lot They re extremely easy fast to get on off I ve received many compliments I will get many more styles of this type of shoe Best dressy comfort shoe I ve owned 
Perfect blend of comfort and style When you first slip your feet into this pair it feels like you re wrapping your feet in foam When you start walking in them it still feels like you re walking in foam They re so comfortable and light it s incredible The sequins add a touch of glam to an otherwise casual pair of shoes Highly recommended 
Feels Like a Sneaker Looks Like a Dress Shoe These have got to be one of the best pair of dress shoes you could ever get for yourself It feels like you re walking around in sneakers but they obviously look more like a dress shoe This is a highly recommended alternative to heeled shoes for all you sorta tomboy girls out there who are trying to be just a lil more girlish or those who just hate the heeled shoe in general anyway Great shoe 
Sketcher s Mary Janes Have always love Sketchers for being comfortable But the Mary Janes are not only comfortable but cute A dressy tennis shoe what will they think of next 
Super comfy I love that these feel like athletic sneakers but look so much nicer I have worn these to the office with slacks They look great with jeans as well The have more support than a regular ballet flat and look every bit as cute 
comfy cute The unique jeweling and cross over straps sets these guys apart from your average mary jane The shoes are comfy but not as cushioned as I thought they d be Fit like a glove 
Heaven for your feet Once while traveling I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn t rub my heel I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs very cushiony soft like walking on air Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don t get sweaty either I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home It s wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step They ve replaced my slippers mocassins surf shoes and sandals 
Super Comfortable I have plantar faciitis heel pain and my feet don t hurt in Crocs However the beach are only for indoor or days when it s not wet as they have alot of vent holes Beware of the rip off versions of this shoes which are not as comfortable I recommend the Croc ENDEAVOR and Croc RX as well 
Crocs They re crocs They re awesome I got them for my mom for Christmas and she loves them 
Thigh hi s that stay up Great thigh hi s that stay up The natural color is a great tone it truly is natural I ve had trouble in the past finding a flesh toned hose color that wasn t too orange or too dark 
style and comfort I wear these thigh hi s with skirts and even under pants they are so comfortable that I forget I have them on Best of all they stay perfectly in place which is hard to find Plus they are incredibly sexy 
Awesome This was my first purchase of thigh highs and I was skeptical of the first review I just received them today and after trying them on I don t see how they could come off easily Just be sure to get the right size They have this band its not plastic but silicon maybe I dunno on the very top that helps the hose stay put The only thing I didn t realize was that its kind of sheer I usually wear the very dark hose but this one is very sheer They are also very comfortable I would recommend buying these 
Sexy and Comfortable These thigh hi stockings are amazingly comfortable I forgot I was wearing them They stayed up the whole day I didn t have to constantly adjust them or pull them up The only problem is that they pull somewhat easily 
good prduct Ihave owned this item before but was having a hard time finding it in the local stores and I did not think it was being sold until I saw it on your Web Site Robert B Linneman 
VERY NICE THESE SHIRTS ARE VERY NICE THE COLORS ARE BRIGHT AND THE SAYINGS ARE CUTE THE PRICE WAS GOOD 
O my goodness every kid should have these shirts They are the greatest for photo ops I took a picture of my 4 week old napping in the Diva shirt just as she grinned a mischievous grin and it has become a family favorite The shirts are soft just the right fit for a growing baby so adorable wash really well and I just can t rave enough I love them so Gotta go buy more now Goodbye 
Great Comfy Boots These boots are very comfy warm stylish and durable I am going to get another pair in a different color I have received many compliments on them and I wear them regularly 
Great boots The boots were purchased as a gift for my daughter and she just loves them Good quality and affordable Thanks 
Yak Pak Nobu Sashimi It was exactly what i wanted I took a while to ship The quality seems to be less than a purse i would by in the store threads of the satin lining are always coming off but its not unsatisfactor 
Great Bag Usually when I order a bag online I always find something wrong with it when I get it But with this bag I found nothing wrong It s comfortable and not too big It has a good pocket for my cell phone I like how it s just one strap and the shape make it easy to carry It s now my new favorite bag 
Good quality good price The item was pretty much the quality I expected but at a much lower price than most other retailers I d definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a pair of casual shoes 
Good warm deal The bundle can be worn on warm and chilly days to support my favorite college team and alma mater Material is good for both the t shirt and hoodie For the quality and price can t beat it anywhere 
Overall satisfied Shirt quality material thickness is comparable to undershirts On a scale of 1 5 with 5 being thick I give these a 3 Size I purchased large and was happy with the fit and length as I am tall As you may know some larges are too tight and some too big these fit good The burnt orange was a bit brighter than expected Shipping the more you buy the better the shipping rates One shirt was going to be approx 6 where as four shirts cost approx 8 50 Delivery was as advertised 
Very Handy I was planning a trip to Las Vegas and wanted a fanny pack so I wouldn t have to carry a pocketbook I was very pleased with this fanny pack because it has plenty of room for your credit cards license etc it has a change purse attached to it and a place for your bills It opens up in the front to make it very convenient to get at your money or credit cards There is also plenty of room in the pouch in the back of the fanny pack and also the top pouch I was able to carry just as much in this fanny pack as I do in a pocket book Also I m a BBW and had plenty of strap to go around my waist I was very happy with this purchase 
These run small Order at least 1 2 size larger Nice looking boots I got them in the mail yesterday I wear size 11 1 2 for every other brand and can sometimes comfortably wear a size 11 but these are waaayyyyy too tight I am going to need to send them back for a larger size I am going to try a size 12 but am afraid that they ll still be a little small 
Comfort Comfort in a boot is often hard to find but this boot has it in spades Would recommend this boot to any tender foot who s afraid of wearing boots Another plus is that they are very well made 
well made The Deluxe Top Side Entry Checkbook Cover is a well made leather product It has the feel of a sturdy long lasting product The only down side I find with it is the size It is very large This may be a good thing to some as there is plenty of room for deposit receipts register etc For women it really isn t a big problem if they have a pocketbook with ample room It isn t a feminine item by any means It is designed more for men Though it will take the room of a whole pocket to carry it Being a woman myself I really don t mind the fact that it isn t feminine looking I don t plan on using it for fashion I just want a checkbook cover that won t fall apart in a years time and one I can keep more than a few checks in For my needs it is working out fine I wish it was a tad smaller but then there wouldn t be all that room You always have to trade off one thing for another in almost anything you have All in all this is just what I wanted 
Love em I got these in black and from day one they were SO comfortable and wearable Didn t need to break them in at all I ve gotten lots of compliments on them too A this price I may order them in brown too 
Very nice The gloves were exceptional Very good quality They seemed to run just a little large but not enough to get a smaller size 
well exemplary Very well put together and comfortable pair of classic leather gloves Supple yet substantial Please don t lose them Bought on sale but worth full price Get better with age starting almost immediately 
PERFECT I am happy with this product excellent price a quelity material and great looking very confortable for the beach or summe 
Very dressy looking This is a soft sheer long scarf I love it looks nice to wear to church with my dress or suit very light weight and comfortable I would purchase it again 
best option out there I went by the size guide on their website but upon receiving it I wish I had gotten a size smaller it was a bit too loose in some areas Also you need the kind with the straps around the bra because without it this thing inches its way down like they are all prone to doing Other than that this does smooth out problem areas quite well 
Not your mother s girdle FINALLY Want to lose 10 lbs around your midsection without plastic surgery Buy this immediately This is truly amazing You will look and feel better in your clothes especially low fitting pants and slim knit dresses A tad tricky to get into practice or give yourself plenty of time when getting ready But other than that this thing is worth its weight in gold I m buying at least one more 
awesome This is the great suitcase I have never owned one like it And the yellow definiatly stands out at the airport I can find my luggage fas 
The best If your looking for a great looking baggage a clasic that calls everybodys attention u got it here it is very strong great colour and you can carry easily 10 day clothes in there 
Great Addition to a Man s Work Wardrobe These are quality shirts They don t need ironing can be dried in the dryer and last a very long time I highly recommend them P S If you remove the Dickies label from the bottom of the shirt a woman can use them as overshirts I put them over a tank top leave them unbuttoned and use them for casual wear They look great 
Dickies 1574 SS Work Shirt A very comforable and durable shirt that remains unwrinkeled after more than one days wear The tails are long enough and don t pull out This is a keeper and a re buy 
Great Shoes They re Perfect I love them They match my wedding dress perfect I m not sure if I ll dye them but they re still great Shipping was fast and the product was exactly what I wanted Thanks 
Yummy Mummy Ireland A fabulous jewellery bag and exactly as described Mine is in hot pink and I LOVE it it has all the pockets and spaces you could need for store your valuables or valuable costume jewellery it can be zipped closed or rolled and tied and is soooo pretty Kept couture stuff is just gorgeous and they are super friendly and ship really really fast and I live in Ireland Fantastic experience with lovely people kind of restores my faith in the human race and in great quality items too Thanks a million 
Darling sexy jacket This jacket is so cute You can also wear it as a vest It fits very true to size I love it 
daughter loved it i got this for my daughter it is an attractive coat and versatile as you can turn it into a vest she like it a lot can t say more because she took it and i haven t had a chance to examine it 
I LUV Chocolate I ordered this jacket and trust me I didn t expect for it to be as beautiful in person as I did online I ordered a medium and it fits perfect It s not meant to be worn in very very cold weather unless you like to layer because it s not a heavy coat but it you don t like heavy coats and don t care for layering then this is the jacket for you The fabric is amazing and the fur is almost as close as the real thing I highly recommend it it s assume Oh and who can beat a price like that 
Great Coat I bought this coat last week for this great price It is very stylish and warm I have recieved lots of complements on it already 
Superb item very sport and athletic looking This is definitely a tomboy bag with lots of buckles straps and a strategically placed pocket to carry your cell phone Blackberry or PDA The main compartment can fit all the daily essentials and then some and its also got a long shoulder strap that you can sling across your chest The only downfall is that there are no studs on the bottom of the bag and if the bag is handled roughly over a long period of time there is the chance that the bottom will be damaged stained or torn that s why I took of 1 star If you like sports and are inspired by athletic design in luxury handbags Prada s sports line is the winner and this bag embodies feminine athleticism superb design and every day practicality 
Great Running Shorts These are very comfortable to wear and run in Downside is that the neighborhood kids might laugh at you because they are so short Extra kudos for putting a back pocket with a zipper to hold my iPod 
Amazing shoe stylish and comfortable The most comfortable pump I ve ever put on my foot The shoe is very stylish yet it offers great arch support The fit so well that I feel like I don t have shoes on It looks great yet it s not too formal and could be warn for business for a day in the city or for a night out 
Great product Its not large and tedious as a regular backpack but its not small either Its perfect for placing folders in and this bag can ever carry a lot for a light backpack Its durable and I ve been using it for school PE and much more By the way it s pretty water resistant On a rainy day my books were barely wet 
Excellent everyday bra I love this bra and bought extra Runs true to size 34B=medium Highly recommended very comfortable with support Not a sports bra but an everyday bra Probably the best one I have owned 
Best Bra I ve ever owned I agree with the previous review but I am not small I am a medium to large sized person who wants a natural look in a bra support without too much construction light weight and invisible under both work and casual clothing I found everything I wanted in this item Straps don t fall because of the cross back material is comfortable and cool I will buy more 
THE Best Bra Ever I am such a fusspot and have strict requirements from a bra Cotton comfort form fit and durability I practice a lot of Yoga and was verging on desperate for a discreet stretchy fit that would still look good under a sleeveless tank Well I found it all in this bra I am small and athletic This bra gives me a natural looking shape where others have flattened my small chest completely It is so cleverly designed to hold everything in place very naturally without any hardware The sizing is perfect I ended up buying half a dozen and will go back for more The price and customer service were unbeatable 
Passport covers Just got our passports and ready to travel These are perfect Right size excellent quality Will buy one for each of my children 
Very pleased It was scheduled for delivery dec 26 and it actually came days before Since it was a gift I couldn t be more pleased 
Quality hat The hat is very well made I decided to buy it to support the people in all our services 
Classic Dude this is the classic shoe Well not THE classic shoe but it s versatile and it looks good with jeans It s a good alternative to a pair of Pumas it s good in the rain I guess you can play indoor soccer with it But it s just a good all around shoe and it being cheap is irrelevant 
Good Received product promptly Item was brand new and i love it 
Cheap thin awkward It is a cheap soccer shoe with little support the tongue extends about 1 past the last lacing hole and digs into your ankle one inch is also not enough for it to be bent back over the laces so it is sufficiently awkward and was enough for me to return the shoe unfortunately no free returns so i ll be shopping elsewhere for my indoor soccer shoes typically i wear a size 13 however these were about a size too large on me so i d wear a 12 in this shoe i have a pair of asics running sheos lotto cleats and new balance cross trainers that are all 13 
Samba For Casuals I bought this pair of shoes not for soccer but for everyday use It s quite comfortable and stylish Pretty good for its price 
Amen something comfy The white royal blue sambas are really good looking and very comfortable I dont play soccer and I wear these shoes because of the comfort and the style they have Very good shoe choice I would reccomend these for anyone 
Good Shoes Very comfortable shoes and they fit the purpose Shoe laces are too short so order an extra pair of these These are classic sneakers that beat any of the the new ones out today 
Excellent Shoe I ve had every color of Adidas Sambas except the blue and the white I was reluctant to purchase the white because they re bright large looking and get dirty too easily But now that I ve purchased these I m so impressed These white Sambas are unique and stylish definitely suitable for casual or athletic activities 
Cool but not Durable Enough Okay I got this along with my other costume parts two days ago I like it a lot but today one of the studs that holds in the glove part disconnected so its all saggy and I hope it doesnt break anymore in time for Halloween otherwise ill have to buy another one and i have no idea where i would get that nearby or one day shipping on the internet It is fun overall I highly reccomend it 
Great First Impression This was my first purchase through Amazon com and I was thrilled first with the fact that I found exactly what I was looking for and second that it came much quicker than the expected delivery schedule Thank you 
Great shoe I am not sure why these shoes were on sale I love Carlos by Carlos Santana and these are a fantastic work pump 
Beautiful They look different then I thought they would But they are very beautiful 
Great shaper that has a built in bra This shaper is great for all of my off the shoulder tops and dresses It really keeps everything in my stomach looks great in this shaper even after a full meal My only problems are with the gusset which is really not that easy to use without making a mess and standing like a cowboy to get it open and the elastic around the leg starts to feel very tight after a while also on some tighter pants you can actually see an indentation from the elastic if you look for it I see it but no one else ever notices it it just bothers me But I really like this shaper no matter what and it comes with great straps that you can attach as well I definitely recommend this shaper unless you have to wear it for more than 5 hrs 
Good Product I ordered this item to wear under a white and black sheath style spaghetti strap prom dress for my senior prom I ordered it in body beige which is plenty light and does not show through my white dress It was a little hard to put on but that s to be expected with the firm control stuff also the bra part didn t want to stay up very well I felt like I had to keep tugging it up but it just felt saggy it didn t look saggy This may be because the back of the unitart is a pretty low V shape to accomadate most back styles of dresses I think adding velcro to the bra and the inside of my dress will solve this problem Also the two pieces of boning on the sides poke my waist in rather unnaturally Alone it looks kind of funny but with the dress on you can t tell There is a gussett in the crotch to allow for trips to the restroom but I m not sure how well this will work as I have not tried it yet I m hoping I won t have to Overall the quality is very good for the money and it does a very nice job of shaping and smoothing without showing under a white dress 
black jacket i bought this as a gift for someone but after seeing it and trying it on it is a great out on the town jacket nice and warm stlyish too 
my favorite shoes I have always loved Clarks shoes and am very glad to see the Artisan collection which have more style Hopefully more will become available These shoes are very comfortable attractive and of high quality 
Gorgeous shoe This is a gorgeous shoe but runs a good l 2 size small If you normally wear 7 l 2 then order an 8 in this shoe 
very accurate description of size color and quality Product was as advertized and delivered promptl 
Too big I know that the 569s are a loose jeans I usually use 33 but i should bought 32 in this kind of model 
Lightweight and comfortable Great pair of track pants lightweight and zippered ankles Runs a bit large normally a Medium I ordered a Small which fits nicely 
Stay Dry I purchase this for myself for those Spring or Summer soaking rains drop 
Good wallet Very soft nice look and feel however is kinda small my checks don t fit in 
Comfortable good quality I own 2 of these shirts and for the price they re great They re the perfect length for me hitting just at the hip The material is thin and stretchy enought that they re easily layered with camisoles long sleeved shirts etc but it s not so thin that one MUST wear another layer They re really easy to wear and seem to be of decent quality 
Great Buy Never thought I would have the courage to wear these but I must admit they are great 
Perfect This item was exactly what i ordered in the exact condition that i ordered it in Would definitly do business with seller again Thank you 
Excellent Robe but choose size carefully This is a wonderful robe I agree with everything mentioned in other reviews except for the feather leakage not a problem I have noticed However I bought a Small it fit perfectly until I washed it gentle cycle cold water tumble dried on low and it shrank up to be too short in length and sleeves and too tight across the shoulders I love it so much that I am going to buy a Medium and give the Small away I don t do dry cleaning and I wear the robe enough so that it needs washing more than twice a year So choose your size carefully if you plan to machine wash it 
The BEST robe I ve ever owned Our house is drafty and chilly and every winter I tote around my down blanket But not anymore Received this robe for Christmas and I haven t left the house since It covers to the floor keeping my feet warm I m 5 4 and the sleeves can be folded back if too long and it is still comfortable and looks nice A fantastic quality product highly recommended 
Heating Bill Saver I love this robe It keeps me warm from head to toe I have gotten robes in the past and they always fell apart Not this one I can t hardly wait for winter so I can save more money on my heating bill Best thing ever 
my girlfriend loves this down robe this down robe from warm things was the best present i ve ever given anyone my girlfriend absolutely loves this robe i was a little nervous getting it since she s very picky about clothing but she really likes it and says its very well made guys forget the candy and flowers this is a great present for your girlfriend or wife thats both practical and romantic she ll be thinking warm thoughts of you every time she puts it on 
Quality Tote I was surprised at how fast the item came It was high quality canvas very sturdy and made for an excellent present I recommend this item for anyone hunting for a quick bag for work shore shopping etc 
The Ultimate Boxing Shoe Boxers who want ease of mobility in the ring can expect a lot from this shoe Everlast lo tops are fantastic Very comfortable to wear ultra lightweight and it looks great as well I think that if there was only one boxing shoe you would buy then this would be it For really serious boxers get the hi tops which do a great job of protecting your ankles 
Surprisingly comfortable I am a wheelchair user and I ve been trying to find a shoe that is a reasonably heavy b comfortable and c nice looking I like boots but the boots I have are hard enough to cause me pain from the limited weight on my legs Athletic shoes have much more comfortable insoles but not the weight I was really happily surprised with this product It was better than I d expected It s a nice weight I can pick my feet up but the boots help my feet stay on the footrests and it is astonishingly comfortable It s pretty easy for me to have problems with things on my feet rubbing the skin off While I recognize that walking around in them wuld be more likely to cause a problem I ve just worn them for several days and I m not getting sores anywhere I m not really qualified to judge it as a workboot but it fits my purpose exactly and I m quite happy about that 
soft warm slippers I got this as a present for my sweetie and he loves them It is a great bargain for real shearling moccasins 
Lovely but POOR color quality These were a gift at Christmas and were a deep burgundy color they do appear to be well stitched however after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don t look like a match anymore the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much 
Silk Pajamas My friend was very happy with them They are very good quality and they fit him for the most part The only issue we had was the length of the arms They were a little too long Other than that we were pleased They got here in time for Christmas and they were just what he wanted 
Size reference Great PJ Really glad i got it It s pretty well built I was afraid it would be a bit fragile but so far so good As a reference I m 6 0 with roughly 200lb I got the Large and it s a bit tight for my taste I ll be trading it for the X 
Best Quality I Have Found These silk pajamas in my opinion have much higher quality stitching tailoring details as well as a heavier weight silk than the closely priced DreamSacks pajamas Sizing Help To help clarify sizing for people there have been conflicting reviews here I ordered a Medium but then returned it for a L I will probably get some minor alterations but I don t blame the company for that everyone is shaped differently I am 6 0 and weigh 175 My suit measurements are a 42 chest 34 sleeves and 32 pants inseam The Medium body fit but the sleeves and pants were too short The Large was the best fit overall although roomier around the chest than I would prefer But if you are my size the Large is your best option 
Good for women too These are great Well made did ok in the wash They also did not split at the seam after wearing them 2x They are still cool enough for summer but nice and warm in winter and SERIOUSLY SOFT By a pair for your wife yourself They are heaven 
I would highly recommed these very nice I was concerned that these silk PJ s would be really thin and on the cheap side But to my surprise they are much thicker then I thought they would be and feel like they will hold up rather well My husband did NOT expect these and is quite pleased with them I am back tonight to order another pair in a different color now that I know they are worth the money I paid for them Plus the fit was perfect I noticed others here said their large was to big so get a smaller size and another person said the opposite That confused me when I went to buy So I just went with my husbands normal size which is a XXL and it was absolutely perfect My husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of PJ s ever The size is perfect color bright looks like it will hold up after many washings Seams looked like quality sewing unlike some I have bought in the past I can t find anything I don t like about these I need to get another pair here FAST before he wears these out lol Anyone thinking of buying these I can t help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least Ja 
Good quality silk Of all men s silk PJs that I purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best The fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well After reading other customers reviews I purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size M and occasionally L It turned out too small I would recommend going one size up 
Nice its a great and new style of Puma the front is little narrow so if u got a wide feet this wont be comfortable for u otherwise go for it its worth i 
Absolutely love this belt During the summer I bought a belt at Gap Very similar to this one My friend wanted one all stores were sold out so I come on here to search found this belt I paid a very reasonable price for this belt and use it all the time Very well made 
quality belt This was exactly what I was looking for It was provided through andrew christian Receive quickly without special shipping 
AK Anne Klein Shoes Great comfortable shoes Color in AD was lighter then what I received when merchant was contacted refund was offered for item only not return shipping 
Love the waistband I searched high and low for these briefs no store in my area had them They have a cloth covered waistband that doesn t roll and is very comfortable I recommend them to anyone who s waistband on their briefs rolls causes marks on your stomach and is uncomfortable 
My new favorite I love these briefs They are so comfortable Love the waistband Love the upscale but affordable styling I ve had a hard time locating them in retail stores On one website I noticed it said it was discontinued Not sure how much truth there is to this so I think I m going to order as much as I can now 
My husband s first choice Hane s comfort briefs are my husband s favorites The first pair he had came free with another multi pack of regular briefs I then sought out the comfort waist brand and bought the colored mid rise style that he didn t care as much for as he prefers the fit of a regular waist The only similar comfort waist style I could find were these white briefs He loves them I wish Hane s would make colors in this style but I find that it s even somewhat difficult to find these white ones I can t imagine that they have no market for men that enjoy comfort would appreciate a variety of tastful colors but like a normal waist fit Regardless of that minor frustration I highly recommend these My husband has never mentioned that they were too loose around the legs though he does have quite muscular thighs 
comfortable to start but These briefs are very comfortable when starting the day especially being tagless I found them to be a larger fit then other Hanes briefs When buying Hanes briefs I tend to buy a size larger because they fit better and bind less These briefs don t bind at all In fact they tend to loosen too much permiting your baggage from exiting through the leg holes At the end of the day they become uncomfortable 
sexy and affordable gave it to my older sister as a birthday gift i was surprised of the quality of this product compared to the price affordable sexy and top notch 
Nice Quality This camisole is very pretty and the quality is great Highly recommended 
Great Purchase These are wonderful slippers very comfortable they don t easily slip off the feet and very warm 
ipod skin Product was great very cool colors The shipping was not so great though We choose the fastest method 1 2 days paid more and it got here in the regular amount of time Needed them before a trip too bad Otherwise great company 
Great Fleece I LOVE THE FLEECE JACKET GOOD QUALITY AND FITS WELL IAM GOING TO BE GIVING ONE EACH TO MY CHILDREN FOR CHRISTMAS AND WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN SOON 
New Balance I should preface this review with the statement that I do have a painful medical problem in my left foot My podiatrist recommended New Balance 811 I am only a little pleased with them as I expected my feet to be well padded by them They do provide excellent support but I still have to wear pads They are comfortable on my good foot On my bad foot I am resigned to the fact that nothing will be perfect 
Comfy Shoes I am a die hard 100 Nike ONLY wearer but since Amazon does not carry Nike and I needed new running shoes and I had a gift certificate I bought these adidas They are not bad Not quite as comfy as a good pair of Nike s but they are pretty close Very lightweight 
Only OK I have cashmere lined leather gloves from neiman s which i love and wear all the time when i want to be a bit dressy in cold weather So I was excited to find these for about 30 percent less as they should be for an online source I think However I was disappointed because the cashmere is of a poor quality so they are a bit rough like regular wool The leather is good though so at least they look good I have the silk lined from this source as well and i like them though they are not for really cold weather 
Mrs Firefly These sandals were extremely comfortable from the first wearing They are flat but with all Clarks shoes flat or heeled the leather footbed conforms to your foot creates ample arch support I wore these every day all summer Also the sandal has superior construction as do all Clarks shoes 
Comfort with Style This shoe is comfortable and looks nice The leather is soft and the sole is comfortable and light weight True to size also 
Confort for a bargain Great price for such a comfortable sandal Clarks are very stylish and come in such a nice array of colors 
Great Summer Thong This is a stylish leather thong from Clarks England I bought it at full price and thought it was a great value and now Amazon has it on sale so it is an even better deal I selected the birch color which is a wonderful neutral color but the other colors would be wonderful as well Another plus no breaking in time this sandal is super comfortable 
Great buy Very happy with the product especially for the price Fit great and are comfortable 
Love Them These are my new favorite boots They are more comfortable than most shoes with this size of heel and fit true to size 
Very Comfortable for Stilhetto Boots LOVE THEM I bought these cause I wanted the look of a pointy toed shoes but as a boot and I absolutely LOVE them They are VERY comfortable With my experience with pointy toed shoes I have learned to buy a 1 2 bigger than my regular shoes size which is 8 1 2 I I bought a 9 and they are perfect I also have wide feet and they are great for persons with wide feet because they stretch but don t make it look like you trying to squeeze into shoes too small If you are in the market for boots and like the stilhetto look These are PERFECT Happy shoe shopping 
Very comfy Very comfortable and stylish This is the first time I have bought shoes over the internet and was pretty surprised and now hooked on the fit I have gotten a couple of wow s from co workers 
Very Nice They do require a bit of a break in period but fter that they are wonderful I got some in black and brown and love them both 
Comfortable I liked them a lot They re very comfortable and seem to be better than others I ve bought I use them as undershirts so I wear them all the time and they are great For whatever you want to use them I m pretty sure you will love them 
Comfortable and pretty I bought the Krona wedge sandal because Clark is known for quality and comfort I was impressed by Clark s new styles especially the Indigo selection The reason I chose this shoe was that I wanted some height and I needed something comfortable Walking is pleasant due to the shock absorbing base These shoes have recieved many compliments might I add they have a beautiful sole also Definitely a shoe worth wearing 
Perfect for the occasion and quickly delivered These are well priced good quality for the price too and they seem to always have them in stock so they ve been great for my dance team 
Overall worth the price The size of the mesh on this is quite good since it s still very much fishnet but woven tightly enough so it doesn t tear easily The method used to keep the fishnet down towards your hand is a single clothen loop that goes around your middle finger if you keep the fishnet pulled down far enough this is fine and comfortable but if you allow the bottom of the lower part of fishnet near the heal of your hand to slip upward to your wrist this will pull on that loop and likely leave a deep mark in your finger for about 10 15 minutes after taking off the fishnets Overall a pretty good product and what it says it is well worth the price these are of a pretty decent quality 
Great Quality This is the cutest swimsuit ever Very good quality and delivered quickly I can t wait for summer 
The best dress shirt ever This is the very best shirt that I have ever own I bought all 4 colors that were available I wish there are more and I would buy them all Tencel is the newest fabric and keep you cool in the summer and warm in the winter it feels like silk and you can wash in machine cold and last for more than 4 years in my last batch In this day and age of disposable shirts this is totally worth it I wish they would manufacture more but Amazon and its supplier is the only place I find after search in google I just LOVE LOVE LOVE this shirt 
Nice This is a nice gazebo It s not the cheap 50 job that breaks the first time you try to use it Consists of three pieces 1 the frame that folds out like a huge accordian deal 2 the nylon like tent fabric top that fits snugly on with velcro straps 3 the case Takes maybe five minutes to set up if you re slow Has three height settings and you can stake it into the ground too if you are on grass It has feet that enable it to be fastened to a wood deck too if necessary Comes with a nice black case with wheels and easy to carry handles It s a little difficult to get the fabric folded up and packed into the case though Other than that it s perfect It s a buy 
A Great Little Gift This leather ID and Business Card Holder is small enough to fit comfortably in a man s front trousers pocket but capacious enough for driver s license credit cards and a ton of business cards It s a tremendous and inexpensive step up from the short lived plastic holders that come free with business card orders 
Leather Card Holder It was exactly what I wanted needed Very satisfied with the product 
GOOD PANTS WONDERFUL PANTS FOR THE PARALYZED PERSON BECAUSE IT HAS GOTTEN HARDER TO FIND SWEAT PANTS WITHOUT POCKETS 
It does the trick With the need for ids and other things that need to be mobile and visible this ID and Business Card Holder works perfectly The one side has the photo id window and the other side has snapped over closure Very nice 
mommy s little boy onesie My daughter is going to love this for her newborn son Item came shipped as promised and is so cute 
cute this onesie is really soft and looks so sadorable on my son the downside is the writing Mommys little boy started peeling off after the very first time i washed it 
Durable and inexpensive This bag gets the job done looks nice and is durable My only complaint it that the straps could be longer so it could go over my shoulder 
Comfortable but less formal than the picture suggests These shoes are very comfortable and pass the test for a long day on one s feet The waterproofing appears to be effective The only complaint I had was that the shoes in person appear much less formal than I had anticipated based on the picture shown They are not as appropriate a fit for my business casual attire as I had hoped 
Perfect for the gym Unless you re a rich girl i m not you probably go to a gym where there is more than a fair bit of riff raff floating around the poolside enjoying the view of a lady in her skimpiest workout outfit the swimsuit Now you probably want something just for this occasion that functions to cover you without making you look like a total grandma This is a great suit for that The fit is a bit skimpy around the sides under the arm if you re accustomed to buying a sport suit a little tight maybe just go one size down not two If you have doubts get your regular size and you ll be fine Also if you re a bit more on the ample side of things this suit does a nice thing for you by emphasizing your topside w the red stripes and downplays your midsection in total black 
Size runs larger than PJs by same maker I bought this robe and the silk pajamas for my boyfriend for Valentine s Day both in a size large The pajamas fit nicely but the robe was WAY too big I printed out the return label listing the reason for return as the product did not fit the description online Amazon said that this was not their fault and deducted the cost of shipping from my refund and did not offer the opportunity for an exchange So now I have to re order the robe in a smaller size and the price has gone up 7 since Valentine s Day This would have been a good deal if it had run true to size but because of misrepresentations made I will end up paying close to the full price listed MORAL Order one size smaller than you think you need 
Perfect Gift I bought this gift for my husband for our first Christmas He absolutely loved it the color the texture everything After searching around on the internet it was one of the best deals as well The gift arrived quickly and without any problems I highly recommend 
Love this product The robe arrive in great condition and in a timely manner My boyfriend absolutely loved his Christmas gift Thanks again 
great robe I thought that wearing a silk robe was more an affectation than anything else Happily I was wrong This robe is well made comfortable and it really looks nice 
Great Apple alternative I only needed one sock and saved a lot of money over the apple 6 pack at 30 Thank you My Gear Store 
Uniform Skort This is a great uniform skort It runs very true to size if not a little small but my daughter loves it Nice soft shorts under the skirt Not those thicker ones that ball up once you wash them I m happy with this purchase 
Great slippers I gave these slippers to my husband for Christmas and he hasn t taken them off since Nice price too Good value 
Adorable Can t get any cuter than this And you can t beat the price either 
Durability and Comfort I purchased the Boston Clog in the summer of 2000 have worn it every year since then and am happy to report that it is still the most comfortable shoe I possess Since many of the other reviews here have praised its comfort I will briefly pass over a few of the problems that will probably occur over long term wear First after about a year of wear the outsole began to detach itself from the rest of the clog This was easily fixed with some shoe glue that I purchased at a shoe store Since applying it in 2001 or so I have not had any further problems with the outsole coming off Second as mentioned in one review the part of the outsole where your foot hits the ground most often will wear out fastest This is to be expected Nevertheless after close to seven year s worth of wear the outsole is still holding up quite well the heel being the only place where there is no grip pattern left Still plenty of outsole remains Finally about a year ago the leather lining of the footbed started to detach itself from the cork underneath the heel Again any good adhesive will solve the problem This time I used super glue problem solved Overall the leather reflects seven year s worth of use but it is still holding up very well both on the footbed and on the entire upper part All things considered I have worn a lot of shoes in the past seven years many of them overpriced European brands fabled for comfort Ecco Camper Clarks but the Boston Clog has outlasted all of them in terms of durability and comfort I highly recommend this quality shoe 
Love Those Birkies I ve been a huge fan of Birkenstock since purchasing my first pair of Professional clogs that I used both in the OR and in Labor Delivery Wanting a casual pair to wear on a regular basis I sought out the Boston for its good looks Not only is this clog great looking it s incredibly comfortable just like they were made for my feet This will not be my only pair nor will they be my last pair of Bostons They coordinate well with jeans and casual pants and are an all around fun shoe to wear NOTHING can beat their comfort 
A Lot of Comfort goes a Looong way I bought my first pair of berks from QVC and I loved them I wore them as many places as I could because of the comfort and I simply refused to change shoes The only thing with that is the shoe ran over quicker than I anticipated so I had to buy three more pair The heel does not last as long as a walking or running shoe from esprit that is the only draw back Since the inside of the shoe molds to your feet it will reflect your shoe size if you lose or gain too much weight When I lost weight after having my baby I lost weight in my feet as well and I had to start wearing bulky soxs with my berks instead of stocking When I first tried on my berks they were a little tight and slightly uncomfortable but after walking around in them for about two days it loosen up and molded to my feet once that happened they were very comfortable from then on Another thing I love about it my sister cannot borrow my berks because she says they don t fit her right and they are uncomfortable We wear the same size shoe give or take a few minor width inches here and there but because the berks are molded to my feet imprint and my walking pattern she can t wear them comfortable Yes Yes I love that little feature 
Birkenstock Boston Soft Sole Clog I recently bought these shoes and they are soooo comfortable I got the ones with the soft sole and it makes a tremendous difference From the first minute I put them on it was like they became part of my foot I don t even realize that I m wearing them No break in required It s also important to make sure you get the right size and establish whether you have a narrow or regular foot before you buy them 
they re the best I just love Birkenstock Boston clogs I ve owned them in black leather in dark gray suede and in bright yellow suede The last of these turned some heads but they were cool enough that in a situation where some rough characters were afoot nobody bothered me They are awesomely comfortable My tour guide in Israel was stupefied by them when I demonstrated the following flex your knee raising your calf until parallel with the ground keeping your foot perpendicular to the ground and even without having to clench your toes the clog WILL NOT fall off Eytan watched spellbound as I did this over and over The secret You ll notice that your foot gets slightly wider behind the metatarsal heads and then narrows again in both directions phalangead AND calcad as podiatrists might say The Boston is so expertly crafted and so balanced for an anatomically perfect foot that the material will stretch just wide enough to admit those protuberant metatarsal heads then spring back just tight enough to hold them in place It was fun mesmerizing Eytan he was so arrogant 
Classic touch It is the perfect belt for all casual occasions Must have it in your wardrobe 
red black leather patent shoes The shoes are lovely and pretty sexy They are actually nicer than how the appear on internet not to say the internet presentation is not also sharp and representative of the product I love high heel shoes I have a collection of them My husband through surfing the internet for Valentine s Day found the site What is exciting about the whole thing is I am pretty sure no one will have the same shoes in Ottawa Not having half sizes we ordered size 7 They were too small so we reordered size 8 We will know for next time Spike Angel company is very professional and easy to deal with They exchanged the shoes for the right size in no time 
The Most Comfortable and Adorable shoes I own I ve become a big shoe heel fan this year and this is my absolute 1 favorite shoe of all time The first day I got them I wore them to work AND had to move furniture around my house AND go out that night and I don t wear heels often Despite the thousands of compliments I got on the shoe my feet did NOT HURT or have blisters at the end of the night let alone at the end of a few hours like my other shoes I heart Naughy Monkey 
It looks hot I got this for my wife and she looks great in it got the pictures to prove it too Ha ha You can t beat satin lace 
Best looking gstring at a great price This is one of the best looking gstrins I have ever seen I highly recommend it for everydaw wear Also another recommendation buy your man a Male gstring and surprise him You won t believe how sexy men look when wearing gstrings 
Great bra Great bra even with t shirts More natural looking than lots of scupted bras Little bit of a pain to wash but most are as far as I can tell 
Good Yup they re pretty much the regular aviator They fit my face after a little tweaking which is no easy feat One pair did come with a cracked lens but I have emailed the company and hope to hear a response soon Good Deal Too 
Decent Transaction They re your run of the mill aviators which is a good as it s a classic design They sent me the wrong one s at first but this was quickly rectified All in all I m satisfied 
Nice Shirts Great material dries in seconds and is really comfortable They seem to hold up real well also Recommended 
Best Workout Shirt or Casual Comfort Available It s not just the brand and certainly not just the name Under Armour just uses better material designed and sewn better than their competition I ve tried shirts of similiar material from dozens of manufacturers Some I still own others are long since thrown away None are as comfortable or fit as well as this one Simply better than the rest 5 Stars 
I cant say anything against this one The first day i wore it i got compliments from two complete strangers It Might be me also But it definitely is worth the 25 and it can be worn anytime of the year Mine didnt have any problems as did one reviewer The sunglow jacket looks better than the the grey one Overall a good buy hence the 5 stars 
Good cheap jacket Decent lightweight jacket for anytime not sure if it is just my jacekt but one of my sleeves seems to be sewed slightly skewed so I have to twist it around to get my arm to go in Could send it back but not worth the trouble 
excellent overall especially at the price but watch the fly These are top quality jeans as one would expect from this major manufacturer Given a choice I would opt for the relaxed fit version I am a senior The big reason is not the seat or leg but the fly The fly is a bit shorter in the regular fit version And watch out for other makes their flies are apt to be way too short I returned Calvin Kleins and Costco s own brand of jeans for just this reason 
Good quality I got 30 x 30 for my son and they fit just right I think they re a bit baggier in the butt than the 501 s though They are well made and should last quite a while The color is regular stone wash not dark as it states and somewhat lighter than the color on your screen We prefer dark denim but for the price you can t beat it 
Levi Strauss Signature� Straight Leg Regular Fit Jeans Very good They are that i was looking 
Good basic jeans What would you expect from Levi Strauss These are comfortable 5 pocket jeans that wear like iron They are not fancy jeans but I live in them on the weekend 
Levi s has a winner for the big chains stores take a look same quality more affordable I was a bit skeptical at first with these Levi s at first As a long time 505 guy I thought their must be a lower line of jeans of Levi s that they are releasing to big chain stores saving their Regular Levi Name for Department stores Well finally I broke down to look at a pair of these jeans when I say they were on sale I was astonished they are exactly the same jean for an average of 10 less Look closely the stitching is the same even the position of the inside labels The buttons and rivits are the same as well The main difference is that the Back Pockets don t have that little red Levi tag and the V shaped decorative detail stich Otherwise these are the same jeans They fit just as well and I think even better but that may be because my wallet is a bit fuller fit after buying these After 15 years of 505 s I have found a new favorite Seriously check these out you wont be dissapointed Even better they do have a kids line so for your growing kids you can get the same levi quality for less nice when they grow out of jeans so fast If you are worried about where they are manufactured I can tell you the last 20 pairs of Levi s I have had have been made in either mexico Columbia or somewhere in asia so these being made in egypt is not a big deal at least they grow cotton their Note button fly 501 people they do not have a line of Signature button flys so you have to stick to regular levi s Probably a smart marketing move but these genes suprised me and Levi s may suprise again 
comfortable I love these jeans I have worn Levi s all my life and just happend to find these Same fit Just as comfortable Much lower price Little style details mean nothing to me Fit and fabric is everything 
Signature is a new line of jeans Levi Strauss Signature is a fairly new line of jeans developed by Levi Strauss especially for the discount store channel mainly Target Wal Mart and Kmart The fit of the regular Levi s Strauss Signature is similar if not identical to the fit of the zipper fly 505 Levi Strauss s most popular model of blue jeans The main difference is that there is less sewing detail on the rear pockets and on the side just below the waist and no red tab on the rear pocket The finishes are mainstream stonewash in light medium and dark If you can live with this limited choice of finishes you can save a few bucks by buying the Levi Strauss Signature jeans However they offer no advantage over Levi Strauss Red Tabs other than a lower price 
navy shoes They look better in person are very comfortable The service grea 
Great shirt Nice fit great quality A must for the business world 
buy if on sale This is a nice warm hat If you re not used to cashmere you should be 
great shoes for the price for 34 you can t really ask for more Comfy imported nice looking casual shoes The leather is super soft Only thing I am afraid of is getting them dirty but that is a concern with all white shoes They don t have much padding either but they aren t intended for intense activity either so thats not a down Buy these shoes I did 
Like Hot Sex on the Beach I love these shoes These are real tennis shoes made for tennis That means lightweight durable and good for walking They re beautiful little things Many people do not know the full history of these Italian leather babies but those who do know are of the upper echelon The Ellesse name is based on the initials L S of its founder Leonardo Servadio an Italian tailor with an innovative approach to styling and manufacture In 1959 Servadio created a revolutionary stretch ski pant which established Ellesse among the elite alpine social circles making it the ultimate aspirational brand The immense success of Ellesse in winter sports clothing provided a perfect passport to expand the brand and transfer the design philosophy into the equally prestigious world of tennis In 1976 Servadio seized the opportunity to take the brand onto a worldwide stage and embarked on an aggressive sponsorship programme signing tennis legends such as Boris Becker Chris Evert Lloyd and Guillermo Vilas Ellesse became synonymous with tennis and skiing and as a testimony to the success of Ellesse in these highly competitive fields the Ellesse logo consisting of half a tennis ball combined with 2 ski tips surmounting the company name was created I must also warn that there are a few pairs in this particular line that have a minor defect in which there is one shoe where the sole comes loose This can be fixed with a little rubber cement but if you don t want to be bothered just send it back and have it easily exchanged with the shipping costs reimbursed back to you Even with that small hassle you can t beat the sharply reduced price featured here My favorite pick is the White Tan Brown Just be sure to keep the laces clean 
Sweatpants are great I received the sweatpants quickly and they were a little nicer than I expected 
Three strikes your out 1 They run extremely small I wear a ladies med I ordered a man s small which I normally swim in and these are skin tight 2 Then they shrank on low heat damp dry I gave them to my 11 year old granddaughter 3 Even though they are called Heavy Weight they are light weight at best and not even heavy enough to keep away the chill on an Arizona winter day 
Love them I am very pleased with these sweatpants They are comfortable soft on the inside and not too chunky They run big but that doesn t bother me at all I like them roomy And they were cheap These are a vast improvement over the wide variety of ugly low rise tapered leg sweatpants out there I like them so much I m going to order a few more pairs 
No problem at all I own these sweats and I really like them They are mens sizes so I ordered a small I am a womens med and they fit great I like the fact that they are long with elastic at the bottom of the leg No shrinkage so they still fit fine 
Rockports are the best shoes for my feet I tried surfing for the best price at shoe stores but Amazon found me the best price at Bealls in Florida I walk on hospital cement floors all day Rockports are more comfortable all day for me than other brand names I have tried Thanks Amazon com 
Merchandise not new The shoes which I received appeared to have been slightly used I would not use this merchant adain 
Great Working Shoe I bought this shoe for work and it is a great pair nice and comfortable A little pricey than most shoes but they are quality 
Nice Shirts ToysRUs foreign owners now making hourly employees purchase shirts on their own We found these online at a very good price So far wife is happy with them and so is Geoffrey 
Shirts For Me I ordered 3 shirts at least I got 1 out of 3 That was pretty good odds Well I will be ordering more here soon They got here on time when I needed them Prompt Service 
Good enough I really like this wallet at first It has all kinds of little spaces for the multitude of cards and ID s I have to carry around The reason I knocked it down to four stars is because the outside has begun to wear a little earlier than I expected Not to the point of needing replaced yet but still noticeable I d estimate it ll last about two years 
Clarks Women s Bethal Clog Love them Very comfortable and nice quality I can wear them with anything I would definitely recommend them 
Are you fricking kidding me Five hundred bucks for some average looking jeans with paint splattered on them If you are interested in that sort of thing talk to me I can set you up for much less And don t buy jeans online anyway they are one of those things you just have to try on The best part is how the pre worn look and paint are supposed to make them look like they didn t cost that much Please head on down to a department store get yourself some forty dollar jeans and a paint brush and give the other 450 to some charity 
Sweatpants with pockets Fit was good and consistent with size anticipated Arrived in a timely manner Quality of fabric good Washes very well with no pilling 
great product I work in the most magical place on earth walt disney but in the magical place there is a lot of walking I tried out so many shoes that didn t hurt my feet in the first few hours then I found these reebok on a general search on amazon these reebok are great the insole feel great when I stand for a long time and these shoes still feel great after an 15 hour day I told many of my co workers and they all agree with me on this product Thank you 
Duty shoe I m a full time firefighter On my feet most of the day 24hour shift Needed a good fitting comfortable shoe that was easy to kick off to jump into turnout gear Has more than met my expectations It has held up well Good traction great fit and nice looking All that I m looking for at a much lower price than regular duty footwear I m on my second pair in two years I would order them again Thanks Reebok 
Reebok Shoes When working long days at work or running around town I only wear Reebok My feet mean to much to me to put them in anything other then Reebok 
Nice Shoes This shoe has worked out well for me as a work shoe I am on my feet all day and they are very comfortable 
Great Shoes Finally a shoe that my son and I agree on Stylish enough for a 5th grader and constructed well enough for me He has very flat feet and had been experiencing pain but these shoes help a lot 
Great Walking Shoe This is an excellent shoe for anyone who s on their feet all day The slip and oil resistant outer sole are an added plus for staying safe on all kinds of surfaces even in rainy weather This is the second pair I ve bought for my husband and it probably won t be the last He likes them because they re comfortable affordable and he doesn t have to worry about slipping and falling 
Wonderful bra for larger sizes It can be difficult to find a soft bra without seams that doesn t have underwire especially in larger sizes This bra was exactly what I was looking for It fits well and is comfortable yet it doesn t have the typical scary look of bras in size D and up 
nice track jacket This jacket is comfortable and looks nice I bought the stone navy and I was expecting it to ge more gray but the stone is actually more blue than pictured I got a medium and it is slightly larger than I would have liked so if you want a slimmer fit I d go down a size 
Sorry for not responding sooner I thought I had already rated this product Sorry The credit card holder is beautiful and very very useful The service I received was excellent I started my Christmas shoppng much too late this year and was really nervous about things arriving on time Well this arrived in plenty of time in excellent condition and as I said my husband just loves it and finds it meets all his expectations and requirements Thanks you again 
Pretty functional good deal for money The leather is not premium and should not be for this price but the wallet does hold great number of cards in pretty compact size package If you are like me have to carry tons of cards and hate thickness of other wallets and also like to see all cards without pulling them out then this is the way to go The only drawback business cards do not fit plastic inserts so the only place you can have them is in the leather pocket on inside part of the cover If you have to carry a lot of business cards that wont work for you But for me it s not big deal as long as I can have 3 of them and they are not getting dirty Overall I m satisfied and definitely recommend this product

soft pretty I got the grass color which is actually a nice blue The gloves are lightweight soft and pretty how can you go wrong 
the best blanket this blanket is the coolest it makes my room look ten times bette 
Great X mas present Quick delivery response and it made a great christmas present for my brother Thanks 
my adult leather ballet slippers I am very happy with my slippers They were just what I expected and the customer service from National was very good I will order from National again 
Great cheap and durable I bought a bunch of these a while back and am very happy with my purchase I m not a hardcore dancer so I look for the cheapest around and this was certainly it They ve done well for me thus far and are quite comfortable 
LUV LUV em I have a lot of shoes in my closet but I continue to go back to these I use them nearly every day and they last about a year before they get scuffed But I do a grat deal of walking I have problems where my feet feel pinched in other shoes but these are super comfortable I have these in black and brown and I can t get enough If you wear these year round make sure to invest in nice socks enjoy 
Dependable Shoe I own the French Rise in black leather and I love them I wear them year round with socks in winter because they are so comfortable The leather is soft and supple For the amount of use these shoes have had I certainly got a good value for my money plus the soles have held up nicely 
Mens Sketchers Great price for NEW sketcher shoes Perfect fit perfect price I will do business again with Amazon again and again as long as the service and prices are as great 
beautiful and feels great too the best thing about this shawl is the soft feel and the color goes with the dress plus jeans to 
Great gift I gave this to someone for Christmas because I have one similar and use it as a winter scarf over a nice dress for a date out or when I m cold around the house When they opened it they were really surprised I checked it out and the quality was great and the size good for someone larger You get alot of bang for your buck here 
not the item i ordered i ordered a plain white puma shirt with a lime puma design instead i got a white puma shirt with black design and lime collar the shirt was ugly why would they even design something like that it was the second time in a row i was burned trying to order this shirt that i want and it sucks because you have to pay shipping twice to return it but i double checked the shirt i was ordering before i ordered and i stil get sent the wrong shirt 
Warm nice and cozy At first I thought this scarf might not be that good quality since it was so cheap but I was wrong This scarf is really warm and its fleece which is great for cold weather There s really nothing to get excited about since it is just like any other scarf but its really good if you re looking for something that ll keep you from strong blowing wind in the winter 
Decent scarf This is a good functional scarf The material is typical polar fleece It s soft but not exceptionally so It s very warm but you can breathe through it if you use it to cover your face It s made from acrylic and polyester and it is machine washable One complaint I might have is that the edges are finished with stitching that feels rough to the touch Also I would have liked to have seen a few more inches of length But it s certainly long enough to use Overall this scarf is nothing to get excited about and the full retail price seems a bit high but if you get it on sale you won t regret it It does what you need a scarf to do 
Super Warm This scarf is WONDERFUL It is really warm and so soft I bought 2 for me and a few as gifts 
Nice shoes They really look great and I had crush on them at the 1st sight 4 heel does not come to me frequently so I had to try on these shoes for couple of dayz To tell the truth they are not that nice on foot as they look 
Love Jessica Simpson Shoes They fit perfect which hardly ever happens when you order shoes online and they are made very well I now own 4 pair Really if you can catch them on sale grab them 
Jessica Simpson LaDonna Love the shoes I had to get a 1 2 size larger than my normal size They were a little tight on first wearing but conformed to my foot well I get compliments every time I wear them They look great with short or long clothing So classy looking 
Get Noticed Great looking shoes I ve received lots of compliments on them I ordered 1 2 size larger than my usual size based on other reviews and would also make that recommendation Although told these shoes were somewhat uncomfortable I find they feel better than most of my other higher heeled shoes The color is a little darker than shown more berry than candy apple red 
JS Ladonna Shoes came in super fast and they were in brand new condition The transaction went very smoothly 
Great sexy shoes Never bought shoes online before but knew I really wanted these shoes I saw them on another women at work and found out the brand and where she bought the shoes Well our local Macy s did not have my size but I didn t stop there I went to the internet and found them at Amazon com Great site by the way The shoes showed up when they were scheduled and fit Love them Beautifully made color outstanding 
Very satisfied I was hesistant as a first time buyer of a product like this but I was very pleased with the ease of the transaction the prompt arrival of the correct product and the quality of the product It was exactly what I had wanted and my son was thrilled 
nice pants These pants were pretty good except that they are a little tight around my rear They tended to stretch out while I was wearing them so I wasn t too worried They keep me dry and I love the color 
Great pair of pants I snowboard often and find these pants to be very warm I also like the fact that they are 100 waterproof I will buy more in other colors 
Great deal I shopped around and could not find a better deal on Columbia snow pants at the stores I am very happy with this purchase 
Stretch Belt I been looking for a beat for a while that fits good and this belt fits very good thank 
Stretch Belt If you are looking for a quality stretch belt that looks sharp this is a fine choice 
Traveling with kids to Disney This is a great little pack for kids to carry their own camera and money in when you go to a theme park The waist fits even slim kids 
Back to briefs I ve always worn boxers but when I tried these on I thought they were so comfortable that I went back to wearing briefs Now I wear them all the time and for all occasions Plus they are perfect just to lounge around in 
Pleased with nightgown This nightgown is very comfortable as well as pretty I am completely satisfied with my purchase 
Beautiful color and fabric just as pictured This was a first for me buying a nightgown from the internet and I am very pleased with both the quality and workmanship on the gown My husband loves it 
love this line I really like this gown I have 4 of them They are good especially for women who have arthritis because they do not cause friction moving around in the bed They assist you in sliding but not slipping so that moving is not so difficult Also they are very cool to the skin especially helpful for those of us whose body temp tends to um run a bit hot You can buy the gown and the matching robe or just the gown which I like I keep one set the rest just gowns 
Super jeans These jeans are just precious They look so cute on The biggest plus for us is the adjustable waist Our little princess is inbetween sizes and these jeans fit her so good that we have already ordered a different style for her birthday 
Mad comfortable These shoes are great Comfortable and light weight I hope they still make these cause the sole on mine has worn thin 
good looking shoe that comes in wide If you have block feet like I do you know how hard it is to find wide shoes that are not awful looking This shoe is good for casual wear handsome but not an a athletic shoe still seems that new balance is the only athletic shoe company for people with wide feet sigh The leather took a little while to break in but once it did these became one of my favorite pairs of shoes 
Great Shoes to wear The shoes i bought are great i even went dancing in them they are very comfortable 
Lunch Sacks I ordered the lunch sacks for one of my son in laws to carry to work He loves them They are big enough to hold multiples of sandwiches and snacks The food stays the right temperature They are a hit 
Ear Warmers The ear warmers arrived on time and the kids love them They keep there ears nice and warm 
Fleece TEC Ear Warmers Arrived in timely manner and seem to fit well Haven t had much cold weather yet to really evaluate 
Very pleased with beach towels I had a hard time finding this color so needless to say I am very pleased with the beach towels 
Good choice This shoe is really comfortable even for the heel height Sexy can be worn with any outfit from jeans to dressy A great choice 
Size runs larger than PJs by same maker I bought this robe and the silk pajamas for my boyfriend for Valentine s Day both in a size large The pajamas fit nicely but the robe was WAY too big I printed out the return label listing the reason for return as the product did not fit the description online Amazon said that this was not their fault and deducted the cost of shipping from my refund and did not offer the opportunity for an exchange So now I have to re order the robe in a smaller size and the price has gone up 7 since Valentine s Day This would have been a good deal if it had run true to size but because of misrepresentations made I will end up paying close to the full price listed MORAL Order one size smaller than you think you need 
Perfect Gift I bought this gift for my husband for our first Christmas He absolutely loved it the color the texture everything After searching around on the internet it was one of the best deals as well The gift arrived quickly and without any problems I highly recommend 
great robe I thought that wearing a silk robe was more an affectation than anything else Happily I was wrong This robe is well made comfortable and it really looks nice 
Review of silk robe The robe was made of a very high quality fabric and held up very well The color and tecture of the silk was truly beautiful 
The Best Swimmer Jock Available Like the other Jocks in this line from Bike the swimmer style is a total WINNER Made from high quality materials it is the height of performance and fit The smaller waistband allows for greater movement and a less restrictive fit especially if you re doing any kind of cardio exercise like running biking or on the eliptical machine The contoured pouch is made of a blended fabric that allows for maximum moisture absorption and breatheability while cupping and supporting you The leg straps are a comfortable width that don t roll or cut under your cheeks My only complaint is that I wish they would come out with a black version like they did with their standard Jock Get rid of your old Jock and buy a bunch of these I did Of course look around the jocks here on Amazon seem to be a bit pricy this 6 95 jock I found at a local sporting goods store for 3 99 or a 2 pack for 7 50 
Perfect jockstrap for work play or everyday This is a very comfortable jockstrap that s perfect for jogging as well as normal everyday wear I ve worn it as regular underwear and found that the comfort level support is excellent Normally I like to wear the Jockey Next to Nothing thongs but need more ball support when I m jogging on the treadmill The front pouch conforms to your bulge perfectly and has the right amount of fabric to completely cover cup your balls unlike other thongs and jocks on the market that leave some uncovered space I love the textured look and feel of the ribbed mesh pouch while the support is consistent and comfortable The thin colored waistband offers a great look when compared to the excessively wide waistbands of other jocks The straps that go around your cheeks give you the same feel as other jocks Just keep in mind that the straps of a jock offer a different feel from that of thong type underwear so it may take a little getting used to if you re not accustomed to wearing a jockstrap All in all this jockstrap by Bike offers the most when it comes to support look and feel 
sharp boot I love this boot bought brown and black Got lots of compliments when i wore them Well worth the money 
I love this shoe I absolutely love this shoe Its comfortable and looks awesome with many outfits I have gotten so many compliments on my red Sybels and I can t wait to buy another pair I might have bought a half size larger than I did because it took a little while to break them in 
Steve Madden Sybel Shoes Great price for shoe that is still available at Steve Madden stores for 60 when I got it for 30 The new reinforced stacked heel is much better than the leather covered ones 
Another pair of gorgeous Steve shoes No wonder Steve Madden is my favourite brand These pumps are typical of the quality fit and style I ve come to love from Steve Madden Beautiful colour comfortable heel and toe and good quality leather A lovely pair of shoes I d recommend to anyone 
okay its okay looks and feels cheaply made however my torso is long and it comes to right blow my belly button 
Tank Top This is my new favorite undershirt The sizing chart on the website is accurate and I plan to order more of these camisoles 
Excellent I bought two of these and very pleased with quality I am medium sized and bought medium it fits perfectly and has proper trim fit just like on the model shown Textile is excellent quality no show through and although it does not have built in bra it actually perfectly supports my 34B It s comfortable soft and strong It also looks expesive I loved the fancy trimming around the edges almost unnoticeable but does the trick of good looks The tops look great either separate or layered It worth it s price 
Columbia Sneaker I love these shoes They are just as comfortable as sneakers but are more stylish to wear with jeans 
Great Quality Sneaker This shoe is probably the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned I would have given it 5 stars but the patern of material resembles a bowling shoe They really are cute if you don t see the bowling shoe resemblance I love shoes and would recommend this if you care about comfort or a sneaker style that s unique 
Comfortable and MANY compliments Every time I wear these I get compliments on them and people ask where they can find them The quality is very good as with any columbia shoes boots I ve had I wear them for a full day and my feet still feel good by the end of the day No complaints and if they came in different colors I d by more 
cute i love the tulip hem on this and it fits great the corduroy is such a fine wale it s almost velvety gorgeous runs quite long if you re petite almost ankle length size seems to run a teeny bit big i ordered a 6 and it s definitely comfy if not loose and i m usually an 8 
Not bad The skirt arrived pretty rumpled but after I ironed it the swirl part at the bottom looked pretty nice With some boots and a sweater it will make a comfortable casual outfit for travel I would have given it 5 stars but the fabric is thinner than you would expect from cordoruy However it is stretchy and flattering and an amazing deal I can always put on leggings under it 
Can t Beat the price If I had paid 15 dollars for this wallet this review would be completely different This is a simple little genuine leather wallet not too many fancy features and the leather is a bit stiff That said a Leather wallet for 1 plus shipping You cant beat that I got one for each of my nephews They thought they were great Their first grown up wallet 
convenience I love the wallet it makes all my transactions quick and easy and everything is nice and tight and everything stays in place I am in construction so this is very importan 
Great Little Sandals Perfect for anytime Super comfortable You don t even know you re wearing sandals and the price is right 
For petite people thin fabric I am 5 9 tall and found this was too small for my frame and full front The string is run through the sides that loops around your nect you also tie that string to keep it on It is really short for taller and wider people The fabric was too thin for my taste in the kitchen 
love my aprons These are great and cheap enough that I can keep aprons in rotation I use them in the studio kitchen and even when I am feeding my toddler great product 
A beautiful shoe I bought these shoes for my 5 year old daughter who is standing up in a wedding They are even cuter in person The hardest part was getting her to take them off to wait for the big day 
Wonderful shoes We bought these for my daughter to wear for her flower girl debut She absolutely loves them and feels beautiful in them They are well made and fit her well I was initially concerned about the heel height but she has no problem walking in them Great shoe 
fast and great quality They shipped these almost overnight My daughter was a perfect little flower girl No trips no blisters and they ve held up great over the past 9 10 months with great durability for dance and lots of play She was a size 10 at the time of the wedding but the shoes were a 9 Her feet were fine She can still squeeze into them now and she s an 11 Very pleased Good value 
Very Nice Item Very soft t shirts reminiscent of the 70 s when I was a kid I bought two of these shirts one each for my teenage nieces They loved the style and color 
Wonderful Chaps I am VERY happy with these chaps I looked at the ones carried in the Harley Davidson store and the only difference between these and theirs is about 230 
Wallets I really like this wallet There really is not a whole lot you can say about a wallet It has alot of room and it is very nice 
Wow I simply loved this wallet And it came in a cool package beautiful butter soft leather supple and smellin great 
A Super Cute Classic Rain Boot complete with todays Style Love this boot It is perfect for the stormy weather we get here in Seattle and I get compliments on them all the time Sperry has long made quality shoes and this boot is no exception I orderd them on a whim and was thrilled when I opened the box I have the black ones with the white black tie bow and they are adorable They are super warm but not too warm and are comfortable The wedge bottom gives the rain boot a new sense of style and I could almost guarantee that anyone would love and be very happy with this boot it is a classic that will never go out of style I am a mom of two very young ones in my mid late twenties and my friends LOVE the boot as well as my mom and her friends A winner 
Great Boot What an adorable pair of boots the ties make it work I have had so many compliments on them I love the height of the heel and they work beautifully in the rain great fit I could have gone a 1 2 size larger to wear with thicker sock for warmth but the boots are fine with a regular sock Wish the company would make them in leather suede or anything else as well I repeat the ties make the boot Really cute 
Lovely It took a while to be delivered but it was well worth the wait A lovely outfit for my baby girl I m 100 in love with it just sad that I bought it a size larger so I have to wait for her to wear it 
Too Large Item was nice but not true to size The extra large was hanging off of me 
Pretty good coat for 25 I was a little worried when I opened the box and saw how thin the coat it but was pleasently surprised at how warm it kept me Michigan Winter is not the most forgiving but this coat has so far been sufficient The zipper does stick sometimes and I have a feeling that at some point in the next few years it will break but so far it has been nice 
Nice panties These are really cute and very sexy They will make a nice valentine s day present for the giver and the receiver 
Ladies Durango� Shoe Boot Nice but the fit is a little big needed to order maybe a half size smaller than true shoe size Otherwise love the shoe and the look 
Great Bag I bought this bag for my college books and everything fits in it It is very durable and easy to carry I love this bag I plan to get one for my son who is in middle school It was a great price also 
Great Buy Great for the money a nice jacket to just grab and go 
These pants rock Packed perfectly I absolutely am ecstatic with these pants Order them and you will not be disappointed If you are a size 8 or 9 go for a small since they run pretty roomy However the drawstring is perfect for keeping them up The look of the moment is camouflage pants and this is the place to get them Serious Quality 
Love Love Love these pants I had searched high and low for camo pants that fit well and were already broken in One would think this an easy task especially since I live in the epicenter of the fashion industry Manhattan NYC Well to no avail even on the internet that is until I found Captain Dave s I ordered them thinking they would have to be altered at least in the length and that I would have to wash them a few thousand times to achieve the well worn in look that I wanted Well they arrived very quickly and packed extremely well and I was pleasantly surprised that they fit like a glove and the texture has the subtle worn quality that is so fashionable at the moment Thank you Captain Dave s I ll be purchasing a lot more items And ladies don t be hesitant about ordering the men s sizes they fit fabulously 
Great T Shirt Got it for a friend for bird hunting and he totally loves it 
Excellent Jacket but This is a great jacket and will last many many years However the sizes run very true and and xlarge is really an xlarge so I had to give the jacket to my son in law when I really intended to use it myself 
Very pleased The jacket arrived quickly and packaged well It is just a windbreaker but a very nice one It s not the heavy plastic kind crossing guards used to wear but a very breathable and comfortable jacket It has an inside zippered pocket that is quite large and adjustable cuffs It seems to run a bit on the large side but not so much that I would have needed to order a different size It rolls up nice and small for traveling in your suitcase or backpack and hardly weighs anything It is just what I was looking for Thanks 
Great Buy This is a great rain jacket Well made and looks like it should wear well The company has great customer service 
if i chased twisters this would be the count not a winter coat ok for 50 s and above excellent in the rain and wind higher quality material than just some wind breaker you would buy in the store roomy too and comfortable 
Stormbreaker jacket Cannot give a review of this item I had to return it because I ordered a size that was too large I will say however the customer service I received from Turfer Sport was excellent The return was approved through their toll free no in a courteous friendly manner with no hassle I received my refund with very little delay Again an A+ to Turfer Sport for their cust svc 
Great Jacket But Price Lowered After Ordering I am a larger guy and needed a light windbreaker type jacket with a hood that would also keep the rain off my head that s Seattle for ya Since none of the local stores had these in stock I searched Amazon and found this one The jacket is of excellent quality and is better than I expected it to be It breaks the wind extremely well and if you really need to bundle up there are velcro strips on the sleeve openings draw strings around the waist and snaps that go over the zipper All in all this is an excellent wind breaker jacket It won t keep you warm in very cold weather but it is one of the best light jackets I ve ever owned When I placed my order on November 16 2006 I chose standard shipping and was promised a shipping date of Nov 20 to Nov 27 I received the item on Nov 27 I can t say for sure whether I would have received it sooner had Thanksgiving day not fallen within that week so I won t really complain about the receiving date My COMPLAINT with the order however is this From the time I placed my order to the time I received the jacket the advertised sale price DROPPED by 25 percent 10 00 I ordered the jacket and paid 39 95 but by the time I got it the price was 29 99 This didn t seem right to me I ve written to Turfer for a resolution but have not yet received one If this is resolved favorably I ll edit this review Except for the price dispute I highly recommend this jacket if you need a light windbreaker type jacket It will serve you very well Just make sure that you get the right price EDIT Still no response from Turfer on the price change but Amazon s stated policy is that prices and availability may change without notice so I guess it s buyer beware I notice that as of today the price on this item is still 29 99 I ve been using it for 2 months now and I must say it s a fantastic lightweight jacket I want to buy another one but I m afraid the second I order it the price will drop to 19 99 
turfer for unbelievable quality and value this is my second jacket purchase from turfer i couldn t be more satisfied with the product s quality and value excellent excellent manufacturer don t hesitate buy from turfer i know it s not a big name company but who cares when they offer incredible merchandise at great prices a gem in outerwear apparel 
Excellent Windbreaker I was taking an Alaska Cruisetour and looking for something that would be warm had a hood would be light and easy to pack I was also shopping at the last minute They were out of the color I originally requested but called me immediately we changed colors and I had the item in my hands within a couple of days It was perfect for what I needed It was easy to carry and the hood was zipped inside the collar I was very pleased with the product It was a man s windbreaker so I just ordered a medium and it fit perfectly I would definitely buy from them again 
Great shorts no key pocket I really love the shorts I own 5 pair but the thing I hate is that there is no key pocket inside No big deal really I just tuck it somewhere else like in my shoe but the little pockets are nice Otherwise these shorts are awesome and allow for full leg movement 
This is a great running shoe This shoe is very comfortable during runs and also during high impact classes such as kickboxing I would highly recommend this plus it looks really good too 
Only buy if you live somewhere were it never rains Well for 99 I thought that this would be a good running shoe So far it seemed okay maybe takes a while to break in cause I haven t felt the bounce yet When I received my shoes I noticed the hole in the bottom and sides of the shoe and thought this was not a good idea But then I figured if it rains the insoles along with my weight would block any water from getting in the shoe Well I was wrong It had rained and the road was muddy so now a good pair of white socks have to be trashed The wet mud came through all the holes in the shoe including the insoles which also have holes in them The shoes are covered with mud now so I don t think I can send them back 
Looks pretty good I just received my new jacket and from the looks of it I can t really complain The photo is pretty much what you get I m a bit disappointed that it s not more Antiqued but I ll have to get to work on that part The delivery was 2 days earlier than the maximum quoted date which is pretty good considering I live in Alaska where things tend to take longer P S The zipper is a bit weak but for 120 ish it s a steal 
Leather Jacket Nice jacket for the price very similar to uniform jackets costing 3 times as much Fits normally Snaps come off easily but spares enclosed just tap with hammer before wearing 
Leather Bomber Jacket Although made in China I find this jacket to be an outstanding buy for the money This 120 buy measures right up there with the 275 300 jackets 
Not for the insecure I bought this swimsuit because the current style of baggy surfer shorts was extremely uncomfortable for swimming laps OK I admit that I was also inspired by the Bond movie Casino Royale But I didn t want to go all out and get those tiny suits that Olympic swimmers and Europeans wear so this was a nice compromise Remember that it s a snug tight suit so if you normally wear a Medium pair of surfing trunks you ll want a Large size here cause it will feel uncomfortably tight and make you feel VERY self conscious when you step out of the changing room Material is very good It stretches well dries quickly The elastic in the waistband however is not attached so everytime you take off the suit the waistband elastic gets all twisted around It s not difficulat to manually twist em back into shape but it s still annoying Because it s so snug there are no pockets of any kind and no place to put your locker key Overall it s a good product But you better not be self conscious about your body this is the man s equivalent of a thong bikini considering how modest men s at least American men s swimwear has become I felt very self conscious at first but since I only wore them to the gym to swim laps I didn t care so much about how I looked and I really appreciated the fact that this was comfortable to swim in But now after a year of dedicated working out I m starting to look GOOD and these swimtrunks really accentuate the broad shoulders and tight abs I even wear them around the house cause it drives my wife nuts in a good way And now that James Bond wore something like these in Casino Royale it won t be too weird for me to wear this to the beach this summer 
This suit suits me just fine This is a great suit for the casual beach bum or the serious swimmer The color and shape have held up well even after many times wearing it while swimming in a heavily chlorinated pool Plus and most importantly I look hot in it 
Mens Swimming Trunks Fits and feels good esp for doing a swim race Highly recommend this Be careful when wearing board shorts with velcro zipper straps over this material The velcro from the board shorts tend to stick very easily to the material of this swim trunks Have to be careful when removing the velcro from any shorts or pants I had this happen and the velcro almost damaged the swim trunks when I was removing it 
speedo suit My husband loves the speedo suit As a family of Speedo users he tried this as a new item and really likes it 
Lightweight comfortable I made the switch to this suit after months of wearing a board short style suit for my workouts It is lightweight comfortable and dries very quickly It is modestly styled and fits well I no longer feel like I m wearing a tent when I swim and I don t have to carry around a heavy wet suit after working out I also saw an immediate reduction of five seconds to my 50 yard lap time Highly recommended 
Very Happy Customer I am well pleased with the merchandise and the service that I received I will purchase through Amazom com again 
Good deal great shorts Not only were they the right price but these shorts look hot Perfect fit very comfortable Almost a little too comfortable These will definetely turn a few heads at the lap pool 
Good quality but a bit expensive Good quality material but more expensive that it should have been 
It is a nice design The design in this shoes make my feet look good it hugs them in the right places my feet are a bit wide They look fun too I got the blue ones They feel comfortable enough to walk for a couple of hours they have light cushioning they are somehow stable but becareful during those hot days because you can get blisters on your feet since they are not leather Size I m 7 5 in sandals and 8 in boots In these shoes I have to get an 8 so they fit my wide feet and they are just fine They make me look really tall and yet the are more comfortable than other high heel shoes I like that It is true that after a while of walking with them your feet can hurt on the front after one or two hours 
Rick Steves I could tell it was a well made bag as soon as I used the zippers The zippers on this bag are smooth to operate The material has a soft feel and makes a great bag for day trips Has shoulder straps for longer hikes or strap on top for easy carry Three different size compartments which makes it easy to separate and find stuff So far I am very happy with this bag and expect it to last a long time 
Chunky arms The quality of these bodysuits are good and the shipping was super fast The only problem is the arm sleeve holes are on the tight side so i have to pull to stretch them when my son wears them Other than that fin 
Present 5 for Carter Mom and Dad loved it and the shipping was really fast 
A Change for the Worse I agree with MOLLIE from Ohio I ve also purchased the petite version of these same pants for years and after they came out with the newer version I can longer wear them for all the same reasons she mentioned They just don t fit right Please Land s End go back to the old style chris s wife 
Ipod car transmitter Be Careful I bought this transmitter for my daughter s birthday and it broke off in the cigarette lighter the first time it was used It also blew the fuse I would look for another brand with the same features 
AWESOME This was perfect I was amazed at how well this worked I love it It charges just what I needed it hold it up right so I don t have to look around for it and it plays the music perfectly LOVE IT 
FM XMITTER Great transmitter only problem it takes a while to turn on You have to hold it for a few seconds besides that a great FM TRANSMITTER 
If I could give it a zero I would This product broke the first time I used it Then part of the jack on this unit got stuck in my accessory plug in my vehicle costing me money in repairs Then tryng to return the item was a joke Needless to say I wasted my time and money on this item 
Excellent product Easy to use Great sound I love this It is very easy to use Press the on button tune to an empty FM station and you are listening to your iPod through your car stereo I love it for long drives No more earbuds which I just hated 
Very Comfortable I purchased this bra and I am really pleased with it It is very comfortable as it is cotton lined It is definitely one of the better maternity bras I have worn so far I would definitely recommend this item to anyone looking for a comfy bra to wear during and after pregnancy 
Does the job This bra is just what I needed and the price was awesome It gets the job done Because it s lightly padded I thought it would give me a funny shape but it s great and comfortable too I recommend it By the way I can even sleep in it and be comfortable No need to by one specifically for bedtime 
Great Bra I like this bra because it s soft washes very well and there s no underwire to cut into your pregnant belly You can even wear this bra long after you re done breastfeeding your little one 
Good fit material For those who don t usually wear boxers and usually wear boxer briefs this is about as good as it gets in the conversion category No ride up no twist up no mash up No tug just good fit and a little less tightness than boxer briefs 
Nice Shirts Took too long to get here Shirts according to my father are NOT long enough And now I m on a stinking MEN S underwear mailing list I m not a MAN STOP SENDING ME those stinking MAGAZINES SHEESH 
ADIDAS MEN CHILE 62 One of my favourite adidas shoes Definitely the best SLIM sneakers around also talking about colors 
Just in time Perfect I m very happy with my excelent buy The sport shoes are perfectly paking and it came very fast I place my order only 11 days ago and I m from Spain I m very pleasant with Amazon Sure I goingo to do another buy Thanks a lot because this model of adidas isn t in Spain and is easy buy with you Sar 
A Great Gift I got this for my sister for Christmas she is notoriously hard to please and I was worried about my order but she was thrilled everything she wanted and if she s happy I m happy Thanks 
Wrangler Capris I am very happy with my purchase of these stretch capris It is very hard for me to buy clothes over the internet but I am pleased with this purchase 
Very Pleased We have struggled to fing girls jeans that are not tight fitting and imbelished with this and that These are the jeans They are just a nice pair of plain well made jeans We were very happy to find them Finally 
great jeans great fit look so cute on Run a little big but I like them that way Room to grow 
Cute Shoes I love them However I was expecting something a bit different when I opened the box The color is hard to match but no one ends up looking at the color just the really cool 60 s style shoe 
Funky Cool I was a little apprehensive about ordering these because of the previous review but I am glad I did I love these shoes and how tall they make me They are a little chunky but that is the style of the shoe 
Funky but uncomfortable It s a cool and funky style but it was too wide and bulky I returned them 
Yukon expect a great deal These are the best slippers he has ever owned They are well made and are a great deal The uppers are actually sewn onto the sole which means you will a get miles out of these slippers 
Quality slippers for a change Most men s slippers I ve seen are flimsy poor quality and fell like flat sandals The LB Evans Yukon slipper finally fills the bill for a quality men s slipper There is a slight heel in the slipper which makes walking in them feel almost like a shoe but without the weight of a shoe The sole provides comfortable solid support and is suitable for the occasional dash outside for the newspaper I have been trying to find a quality replacement for my old Thom McAn deerskins and this Yukon slipper has finally solved that problem 
Super Nice and Sturdy These will make excellent camp mocs for my husband The leather is beautiful and the terry insides are soft and comfortable A great buy 
The MUST HAVE bra I love it You could not ask for more in a super soft wireless I liked the feel and weight Nice touch with the pillowsoft back closure Fits larger sizes well 38DD even I have an order bra that is similar from Victorias and it cost me 45 I like this one better 
Bali Bra The product was what I believed it to be before I purchased it it arrived on a timely basis 
Cute coin purse nice feeling and look I got the red one It is a rich sedate crimson red and has a smooth quality leather feel The inside is lined with polyester fabric but the material that divides the two large pockets is just cheap plastic The pockets are surprizingly deep allowing for more than change Keys lip gloss bills and even my cell phone fit in it that was a tight fit and not practical either The flap on the front unsnaps to reveal a narrow shallower pocket Cards will not fit in it but it works nicely for folded bills An attractive seam runs down the back of the purse Worth the price 
Great product This is a great little coin purse and has been especially handy for me at work when I needed that spare change to pay a bill Very handy durable and pretty all in one Worth every cent that I paid for it 
THEY FIT GOOD PRODUCT GOOD QUALITY AND GOOD SIZE NOT SKIMPY WOULD RECOMMEND 100 JOYC 
They re soft they stay on I live in these during the summer months Wearing these is almost like going bare foot but more sanitary They slightly hug the foot with a soft light weight yet substantial fabric I ve tried many different brands of liners but these are the only ones that I could get to stay on All others tend to slide around and the heal eventually falls off Most others have a nylon synthetic feel too But these feel wonderful 
Love this shirt I really love this shirt because it is extremely comfortable The screen print is still extremely visible even after several washes 
High Quality and good company to buy from I had an excellent experience with this company who is selling this shirt At first my tracking number was wrong and they got it fixed right away when I e mailed them The shirt is high quality The only thing I noticed is that in the picture on Amazon the shirt looks like a lighter blue but it is actually navy blue That s good more true Bears colors 
so cool i was a little worried when i got these because they ARE fisherman boots and i wanted to use them as just simple rainboots but they re really awesome and for only 20 very very durable i m glad i got them 
Excellent boots I have these boots in the sand color and I love the Many times I wish I had them in black I searched everywhere trying to find these boots in black and was so excited to find them here on Amazon thanks 
blue windowpane cottom sweater I purchased two of these after seeing them in a local department store My son is a North Carolina Fan and the blue was perfect I was very disappointed After washing it in cold water the XXL became a L both sweater shrank VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE PURCHASE WILL NOT BUY CLOTHES FROM YOU AGAIN BOBBI JO JOHNSON BARNESVILLE OHI 
Great skirt for this price I was very surprised about the high quality of this skirt for only 9 99 USD It looks simply great Maybe if your are too much overpounded this is not the skirt for you However I m not too much overpounded and liked this skirt very much I own the faded denim color and it s really beautiful A good quality skirt True fit 
Really comfortable I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it He said it is the most comfortable belt he has ever worn It is a nice looking belt as well I highly recommend it 
I had the boots now I have them all Since I bought the boot model of these shoes I was so pleased that I wanted to get another pair One day just browsing amazon I found these incredible fun shoes Now I have them all 
kidz banz Product was great Couldn t get them off his head never got lost Just grew out of them way too soon The strap should be a little bit longer lenses still fit 
wear jacket daily quick fast service Love the jacket and will purchase from them again 
Deer Stags Wingtip Bargain Wide size is wide color of raisin is really burgandy shoes cut a little high but with insert are quite comfortable for office wear not recommended for long walks 
Great shoe This is a great shoe so far Received the shoes on time and they feel great 
Immediate comfort I am impressed with the Deer Stags wingtip There was no break in required they were immediately comfortable I plan to order additional pairs for my closet 
Great Lock I have been using these for about a year now and just got some more I fly every week and have never had a problem with the TSA agents cutting them off But I do know for a fact I called up Prestolock and they will replace it free of charge They said they guarantee them not to be cut off by a TSA agent 
Locks cut by security Locks are solid dependable quality However security officers seemed to cut mine open straight away even though these are supposed to be of the kind they are able to open with a key I don t think they bother with the extra labour and just use the bolt cutters straight away Kinda disappointing 
Nice shoes I bought these for a very good price on Amazon They are very sturdy and keep my feet very warm in the rain It s not just for downpours even in situations where you re walking across a wet field it will keep your foot warm and toasty instead of cold and damp I generally use these as my cold weather shoes even if it is dry They have great support 
Excellent Shoe I bought these a couple of months ago and thus far they are my favorite shoe Good for running great for standing very stable They did at first seem kind of tight at the very front but that s probably for a more secure fit If you re somewhere between sizes I d say go with the larger one 
Good all year winter running shoe at closeout pricing I must admit I probably wouldn t buy a shoe this good if it wasn t 50 + off I ve put some miles in on a treadmill at the gym and outside on pavement Very comfortable to run in providing stable footing and extreme cushioning They seem to be saving me from some of the normal knee and back pain I get running in my 4 yr old NB s Would be great for cross country because the treads are somewhat knobby Not too knobby to use on the treadmill so I d have to say they are a great all around running shoe and are A+ for outdoors x country or winter running The goretex weather proofing didn t make my feet too hot Probably an overkill if you don t plan to use them for running the knobby tread can make you trip if you re just walking etc I haven t used them in bad weather but I would imagine they would be great for running in rain snow ice conditions I purchased the size I normally wear and the fit was perfect As tradition proves Adidas are like New Balance in that they are a better fit for a wider foot 
It is ok for outdoor sports In general it is comfortable One thing need to notice is that the actual size of the adidas shoes is a little smaller than marked So you d better try one in local store and then buy it online for cheap prices 
CUTE I GOT THESE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THESE WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER THAN DEALING WITH SNAPS PLUS YOU GOT 2 UNSTEAD OF 1 OUTFIT AND THEY ARE CUTE AS CAN B 
Great pair of boots Beautiful boots very sexy and even though the heel is high and toe is pointy they re still comfortable I ve worn them to work and walked all day in them I bought another pair in black I loved them so much 
Nice boot I got this in the Dk brown The pointy toe is slightly longer than it seems in the picture but it looks nice 
VERY HOT BOOT This boot looks fabulous with jeans or slacks Love the pointy toe look and the heel is very sexy Comfortable and easy to walk in I bought a pair in every color 
Classy This is a great boot comfortable classy and great for the office or going out I would recommend this boot if you are looking for something other then a pump to wear with slacks 
What I had been looking for I had been looking every where for a pair of high heel brown boots that could be worn with jeans or slacks These are what I was looking for The boots are true to size and very well made The only thing that is a slight brawback is there is not an elastic strip on the top near the zipper to make walking more comfortable 
Beautiful Boot Terrific Price This boot was so inexpensive that I have to admit I was skeptical about it However these boots are lovely well made and extremely comfortable Moreover they have rubber soles which is excellent for sloppy weather So if you plan to actually wear your boots outdoors in wet weather as opposed to using them for trips to the mall this pair makes a good choice 
Totally Pleased When I received these boots I was totally pleased with their appearance They are the exact boots I ve always wanted True to size and very sleek looking Would recommend to anyone 
Elegant true to size soft and comfortable I m not a fan of pointy toe shoes but I decided to go with the flow and buy these I was pleasantly surprised these boots are very comfortable and true to size Leather on the outside is very soft but the best part is that these boots are also lined with extremely soft leather The heel is 2 5 inches on the inside and 3 5 inches on the outside Despite being higher than what I m used to these boots are still surprisingly stable 
Warm Very warm The only inconvenience I see with these is that strong winds make them feel as if they are going to fly away Otherwise good product 
warm ears at last These are great little ear muffs They fit easily in pocket or purse and do a good job A tip on using them start at the ear lobe and turn the bag until you cover the top of your ear then click closed Large earrings may have to be removed 
Best Ear Warmers Ever Tried These are the best ear warmers I ve ever tried I ve had mine for over 2 years and they still look new They rarely fall off and fit over my earrings without any problems and easily fit in any pocket or purse I would definitely recommend these to anyone who suffers from ear problems like I do 
Earbags=Indespensible I was given Ear Bags for a gift a year ago and have never appreciated a gift more They are so easy to use and to carry They never slip or get in my way plus they are easily covered with a head band or stocking cap if more protection is desired My goal is to have a pair for each jacket pocket plus a pair to keep in the car as we live in a windy and cool cold climate 
Work Pants Well the pants are nice One ill point is that the pants seem to have been cut a little off When sewed together they had to have been forced on one pant leg This forced sewing cause the pant leg on one side between the legs to have a permanent twist When ironing you have to work around this so as not to cause a ironed wrinkle Otherwise Good color the twist does not seem to bother my son Other draw back is There are never enough of my sons size for order and companies do not provide a more varied color range Surely there can be more colors for the guys over 42 inch waist 
Dickies 23 214 Cargo Pants If you are short and fat they don t come inshort enough lengths Very high quality Leg pockets should be larger but overall very conveinent 
Very Pretty I gave this scarf to my MIL for Christmas It came in a very pretty pink bag with beads on the bottom It was just a fun little extra I didn t expect 
Order Rcd As Promised Nice Trunk roomy and a good length hubby said they were comfortable and did not pinch in places that it shouldnt Arrived in a timely manner 
Good for swim or leasure These shorts are great for all around use They look great and are comfortable for swimming or just wearing around I am in college and wear these to class as they are lightweight and still have enough pockets to carry everything I need they are alos stiffer than a lot of swim trunks so they don t flop around too bad if your pockets are ful 
Columbia Shorts that stay up Great Very nice light packable and quick drying shorts Add your own belt and unlike other Columbia shorts you can carry a knife a cell phone a PDA wallet and change and they still stay up Also pockets don t sag down below the leg if you keep you change or PDA in them another Columbia problem Nicely made very functional shorts 
best bra ever This bra was a joy to wear if such is possible in a bra I to am on the bustier side 36DD and it fit me perfectly It was completely supportive and comfortable for all day wear 
Great for large sizes I agree that this is a good bra even for larger sizes I am a 36DD and I wore my first one out from sheer overuse I kept washing it and wearing it the next day I loved it and I love the way it looked under my clothes The one drag is that I ripped the lacy part and from reviews on herrom com that seems to be pretty common Otherwise I would reccommend it to others like me large bust and a regular or small chest Plus the racer back gives women with a large bust a break from the strap marks from regular bras 
Very comfortable even for larger sizes I disagree totally with the other reviewer I wear a 38 D and the bra fits great and is supportive My guess is that it s a better fit for women with rounder flatter breasts and a winner for those who would prefer not to be encased in a totally structured old style bra My favorite bra and that of others I know 
Gorgeous looks hand crocheted I have 2 of these and just love them They are of quite good quality and the workmanship is very good It tends to run a bit small If you are tall you might want to order 1 size larger This arrived quickly with no problems 
Beautiful Tote This free gift was easy to add on to my order and it has come in handy for small trips to the Grocery Store It is a very sturdy and useful bag 
Best bra ever I love this bra It is the most comfortable and most supportive bra I ve ever owned I have large and extremely heavy fibrocystic breasts This bra provides plenty of support while still remaining comfortable I have LOTS of these some of them are many years old and still in great shape Highly recommend this bra 
Heaven for your feet Once while traveling I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn t rub my heel I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs very cushiony soft like walking on air Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don t get sweaty either I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home It s wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step They ve replaced my slippers mocassins surf shoes and sandals 
Excellent and light I herniated a disc in my back and was unable to put my own shoes and socks on myself My wife made me buy these and I am glad she did Now after the surgery I m still wearing them They are comfortable and light 
Great Shoe if you need to be on your feet Great Shoe if you need to be on your feet I compete in BBQ competitions and you are on your feet many many hours These shoes worked better than any others I ve tried I ususally change my shoes two or three times during a two day event I didn t need to change at all wearing these 
A Treat For Your Feet I love my Crocs Cayman Clogs They are extremely soft and comfortable and yet durable enough to be worn anywhere Between my Birks and Crocs I am set for every spring summer Just know to purchase one size down for comfort I wear size 12 but found that the Crocs size Large 10 11 fit me well The size Extra Large 12 13 were much too big I was not disappointed with the purchase A five star rating for comfort 
Larger than a mini umbrella The squalors in the spring summer of NYC hit quickly so I learned a long time ago to always carry an umbrella in my bag Well after destroying 2 kmart specials over and over again I decided to to get this one in it s place It comes with a nice canvas spandex case and in it s case it measures just under 8 5 x3 x2 That s a bit larger than I had hoped expected But it s a solidly made umbrella and doesn t saturate then leak nearly as easily as any other umbrella fabric umbrella that I ve used 
Holds a knot These are the best thing to happen to laces They actually hold a knot without making a double knot Now if only they came in more colors 
Awesome dress this is a great dress for curvy women It enhances all the good areas and hides the bad areas It does run a little large on the size so try ordering one size smaller i bought the xl I am a 40 bust 34 waist and 42 hips and i m 5 2 I just had the dresses hem and strap altered cuz i m too short but all the other areas filled in good it even makes your behind look perky i received many compliments when i wore it which is great cuz i just had twins i highly recommend this dress 
Cute and Comfy I love these shoes I get complements on them ALL THE TIME Now most of my friends own a pair after seeing mine They are wonderful for walking around the mall or spending the day at the Zoo or working long shifts standing up but they are not a replacment for regular tennis shoes when it comes to exercising I love them though 
Fabulous Babydoll The fabric is so silky both the babydoll and matching thong feel wonderful on The lace is nice and soft too not to mention feminine and sexy I ve had mine for a while so with propper care they should last a long time I just love this set 
Extremely comfortable This shoe looks as good as expected The real surprise was how light weight and comfortable the shoes are to wear Definitely the most comforable dress show I have ever worn 
good quality at a low price A good master piece having a lot of embroidery and at a reasonable pric 
greatest skirt ever comfy flattering heavy enough that it stays down and functioning pockets galore i m ordering one in every colour 
Okay but I m sure these pants would be really really comfy but they run too small like 2 sizes too small Otherwise the fabric is soft and the cut is great 
Simple good These are simple cotton pants The fit is good I got a M and usually wear 6 8 overall comfy and cute 
Just what was needed For a couple having a first baby this was the gift neede 
Hot Socks Amazon notes that these socks are only made from the finest yarns They mean it too These socks keep your feet warm and they are very well made and last forever These athletic crew socks can be worn for athletic activities but of course they could be worn for everyday routine use as well In addition they are made from 85 Gold Toe s Ultrabrite acrylic and 15 stretch nylon Amazon states that the acrylic gives these socks wickability but this word may be a typographical error I could not find an entry for the word wickability in the dictionary The price is right too These crew length socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12 therefore it is almost one size fits all The reinforced heel and toe makes them last longer and they still feel very comfortable on my feet The sock itself comes in white but the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers I would not dry these socks at high temperatures This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot Eventually they could bunch up when you wear them and that s very uncomfortable Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature Then they will remain just as comfortable as ever I know mine do Overall you can t go wrong buying these socks They keep your feet extra warm during colder weather They are manufactured so well that you definitely get more than your money s worth A good deal SMILE 
Gold Toe Athletic Socks These socks are the best I have ever worn and you can t find them in a local retail store I was glad to find them on line and the service was great Thanks Tracy 
Most comfortable sock After trying most of the golden toe white socks I ve found this type the most comfortable After looking in many retail stores was not able to find Did a search in Amazon and here they were Great sock would highly recommend 
good socks these socks are comfortable seem durable and breathe alright about all you can really ask for in a men s sock 
Perfect for the gym or the apartment These are the socks that I wear for workout as well as walking around at home They retain their shape after repeat washings fit snugly without binding and are supple on the feet The multi sock pack is a value in itself and comes highly recommended 
Great Christmas Presents I bought 4 pairs of these slippers for Xmas gifts and everyone loved them In fact even now that its summer the girls still wear them all the time The quality is great They fit well They seems on the small side at first but they break in wonderfully I even bought myself a pair I recommend them and plan on buying more this Christmas 
Cool but short lived Good looking shorts at a pretty good price Sized HUGE for what other clothes sizing is Zipper blew up in about 2 months Unfortunately I won t buy this again 
Love it The shoes are so comfortable and stylish Can go with dress pants jeans and skirts Great shoes 
Perfect Thanks for the quick shipment of my Steve Madden shoes They are brand new as described 
Great Low Heel I absolutley love this shoe I m tall and my hubby is the same height who wants to where flats all the time This shoe makes your foot look very dainty plus it gives the illusion of a high heel which makes the clothing look better I want it in every color The only drawback if any is that it s pretty narrow at the toe because it s a pointy toe if you have a skinny foot then no problem but I wish it were sold still with the pointy toe just a little wider still love the shoe 
versatile pump This is a super cute shoe low heel makes it comfortable all day style is timeless and look is sexy what more could you want from a shoe 
Order a half size larger These shoes are great looking very sexy They are snug in the toe especially if you have a wider foot 
simple yet stylish these felt a little looser than normal so order a half size smaller Even if you don t order them smaller they will still look great with a pair of jeans I love them lt 
Found it I love this bra I have so many different brands styles that I have tried but I always come back to this one It s great under all types of shirts and especially fitted tees The stock goes in and out of the store where I usually buy it so haven t seen it in a while Found it here at amazon Yay 
Love it I am very picky when it comes to bras I want something with support that is comfortable and flattering to me and this bra is just that I love it P S most bras that have some sort of padding or push up when washed ended with deformed cups and looking bumpy under shirts but this bra does not do that 
Finally Finally a pair on underwear that fits and is comfortable Hopefully they will last 
Nice Boots These are great boots it s like having two boots in one For the price they are more than nice they are great 
Slip I need a double sided slit slip that was short After going to several stores it was just easier to order exactly what I wanted The quality and such are great 
arch tex Cool thing just right your info with a ballpoint THe bright colors are easy to find at the airpor 
Good case Great service and a great price The case works very well but the clear stick on shield would not fit right After several attempts to position it right the sticky gave out and we gave up The case with clip was why I bought it though so that didn t matter for us 
Very pretty These definitely run big I have bought another pair for my daughter in light blue but one size smaller We will see how well they fit 
If I could give 10 stars I would These are fantastic shoes for a 2 year old They are easy on and off making the little one feel they have accomplished a big kid milestone They give lots of room for those chubby little toddler feet and are perfect for the beach playing in the mud anywhere really and even look great with cute little short sets They allow air circulation around the foot as well If for no other reason these are perfect shoes to let kids be kids in You won t have to worry what they are walking through or playing in these shoes wash up as easily as your kids do 
Cute Comfy I bought these crocs for my daughter during the summer and she absolutely loves them and I now can t get her to put her winter boots on when it snows The crocs are exceptionally comfortable and lightweight I am very happy with my purchase and free shipping also 
OK but Nice looking socks but they are so paper thin and light I don t imagine they will last long I figured these socks would be better quality with the Tommy Hilfiger name attached to them Guess not 
Nice Product I have ordered several scarves from Curious Designs I have rec d numerous complements on each of them Very good quality accessories for not a lot of money Their scarves provide easy ways to make simple outfits look classy 
Nice Little Wallet I bought this wallet to replace a very heavy solid wallet I d been carrying around for years I wanted to lighten the load in my purse This wallet is just the right size small It has easy access to money credit cards and ID a zippered pocket enough room for a fairly decent amount of change and it looks nice It s well made and attractive 
gold toe socks MY HUSBAND ALWAYS WEARS THESE SOCKS AND THEY NOT ONLY LAST A LONG TIME BUT THEY NEVER STRETCH OUT HE SAYS THEY ARE COMFORTABLE ALL DAY WHEN YOU SEE A GOOD SALE BUY THEM THIS LAST TIME FROM AMAZON THEY WERE NOT ONLY ON SALE BUT WITH FREE SHIPPING AND NO TAX IT WAS SURELY THE RIGHT PRICE 
A Sock by Anyother Name is a Sock This is just a Great Sock This is a Sock They give you two and call it a pair If you buy it as listed you get six socks or three pairs They make my feet HAPPY The price is a little high but I guess that happy feet are worth it Have not worn out either the toe or the heal yet a little color loss with numerous washings I would not wear anything else 
great you saved my life My husband will only wear these certain type of socks that are called over the calf gold toe socks We used to buy them at Penneys but now we couldn t find them I was looking for them thru google and Amazon poped up I always have good luck with Amazon so I ordered 3 sets Amazon saved the day 
GREAT SOCKS My husband loves these socks They are super soft and have a lot of stretch Hubby is a diabetic and has some trouble with circulation He says these socks are much more comfortable than the typical diabetic stocking yet they give him the support he needs 
These continue to be my husband s favorite My husband has prefered 100 nylon socks since he has been wearing suits to work Among the 100 nylon sock he prefers the Gold Toe brand I can t tell why because I haven t asked but I assume that they do everything he wants in an over the calf sock because he hasn t looked elsewhere He had been buying them at Joseph Banks but they stopped carrying the 100 nylon and he didn t like the mixed fibers He asked me to find them and I went straight to Amazon 
Gold Toe Men s Metropolitan Over the Calf Dress Sock The socks are very comfortable and offer some support They seem to be long wearing and wash well One sock size fits a number of shoe sizes For my shoe size I would rate them highly For a nylon sock they are reasonably priced 
Look Great Feel Great and They Last Some of the best socks I ve owned They wear well and look good I especially like never having to pull up my socks 
Gold Toe OTC Metropolitan Dress Sock This nylon dress sock is the most confortable of any that I have owned It stretches to a very desirable fit on the leg It is one of the great dress socks especially when new 
Best Experience I have this shoe for over a month now this is the most comfortable shoe i ve ever put my feet in It s stylish the craftsmanship is superb It is just a wonderful shoe When you put your feet inside the shoe it is as if the leather gently massages your foot It is great I dont regret buying this shoe 
Great Product Fast Shipping I was very satisfied with the sneakers that I ordered for my son He loved them They were shipped in a timely manner and it was much easier than going to the stores during the holidays 
Nice looking comfortable sneakers This sneakers are good looking nostalgic very comfortable to wear going out for the night and long lasting I would certainly recommend this sneakers 
Great Shoes The shoes hold up well in all conditions Great shoes for people who are on there feet alot and they have good arch support Also they are easy to get clean when they get dirty Foot locker has some good shoe cleaner 
Great Shoewear This pair of Adidas are not only great in looks but are very comfortable and only 60 thats a good price for great shoes a must buy if you are looking for a pair of styling sneaker 
Possibly the best pair of sneakers I ve ever owned I bought these in black with white stripes almost three years ago They have been my primary daily wear sneaker since then and they are still in wearable condition I used to be real careful with them and brush them off whenever they got soiled but I stopped doing that for the last year or so I trek through dirt mud sand gravel and miles upon miles of pavement and these little buggers show almost no treadwear The only restorative effort I ve made is to replace the laces I can see these things lasting at least another year or so but I m tempted to simply retire them now just because I like buying new sneakers If you can see yourself rockin these then go ahead and add these little beauts to your family Your feet will thank you for it 
classic Superstars a k a shelltoes have been around for a while and gained fame through Run DMC I mostly wear Adidas Superstars because they are relatively inexpensive and are pretty durable Because they are low tops they don t provide as much support when playing basketball but Superstars are still excellent shoes They re stylish and come in a wide variety of colours Pair these up with some nice fat laces and you re all set 
very comfortable I ve looked everywhere for a panty that fits like this one It s very comfortable smooth and feels good on my skin Something great to wear at home with nothing else I ll most likely get more of these Probably my favorite panty right now 
Excellent value and durability Runs true to size easy to layer Neck is easy to get over big toddler heads One of the few shirts my child will willingly put on by himself Doesn t shrink out of size My only minor frustration doesn t seem to come in many colors or styles wish they had stripes or contrasting neck cuffs 
cute but run very small These are adorable soft with a little bit of sheen But they run really small I ordered size 18 months and they are actually a bit smaller in the waist and leg width than the 12months size Ruffle Flare Jeans that my daughter currently wears My daughter is a petite 19 pound 14 month old girl and these fit her exactly right Probably will outgrow them by summer So just buy one size up 
cargo pants pink We bought these yesterday They are well made but kind of thin Great for spring time or summer The color was pink and it s really bright pink Very cute style It fits great and even has belt loops for my skinny daughter No elastic waste but has stretchy material in the back for thicker children Can wear belt though if needed Very cute in style 
great delivery and prompt if there would be an opportunity to order again definitely I wil 
Top Notch Just like pictured Great colormatch and very good quality I can recommend buying it to anyone 
Good buy material is outstanding and longlasting I am using these shirts as a autobody painter Durable material color never fades away atleast it takes long time to see the diverence in color new old 100 cotton just great for your skin I have the color royal blue and i love it It looks profesional I STARTED TO USE IT NOT ONLY FOR WORK BUT ALSO In my sport activity I am happy with these shirts Order more and you get better prices 
Great Value How to avoid backache and be sweet to your budget This footwear is reasonably priced nicely styled and provides the comfort of real Birkenstocks I will buy more 
Only one problem My feet turned black from the straps It washes of easily but I have been wearing them every day for about a week and the color is still transferring I assume it will stop once they are broken in but its definitly not a cute look Other than that they are very comfortable and seem fairly sturdy and well made Only time will tell 
Perfect Just as expected Comfortable Birks that will last a long time as always 
Value Got my sandals a couple of weeks ago The comfort of Birkenstock great value cost me less than half of what they cost here Thnak you Amazon 
Pleasure for the feet Birkenstock simply put designs the best sandals Good for the feet good for the knees legs and back Long lasting This model more graceful than some others for those who are vain is another 5 for Birkenstock 
MRS GERRI THATCHER I HAVE BOUGHT FOUR PAIR OF BETULA SANDALS AND THEY ARE ALL AWESOME THEY ARE COMFORTABLE AND THE SERVICE IS PROMPT AND COURTEOUS I RATE THEM 10+++++ GERRI THATCHE 
Love Them Can t believe that I got these beautiful and comfortable Birks for such a reasonable price Thank you thank you thank you 
Love those shoes I just LOVE my other Birkenstock sandles so when I saw these in colors I just knew I had to have a pair They are everything you d expect in Birkie s great comfort and they look great I would highly recommend these sandles 
Perfect baby laundry bag I was looking forever for a bag that was cute enough and small enough for a baby laundry bag Finally I came across this and I am so happy we have it It is totally cute hanging in by new baby girls room and it s not so big that her little clothes get lost in it Also real easy to wash I just stuck it in with the baby clothes the last time I did a wash and dried it on the highest setting Came out great Perfect for a baby room when you are looking for a laundry bag solution in a small space I want one for myself now 
Yummy Mummy Ireland Yet another fab item from Kept couture Exactly as described and perfect for storing your wet swimsuit or bikini and keeping it pretty instead of wrapped in a towel like I normally do this is a great size too and wuold fit more than one suit I bought this for mhy friend who has 2 little boys and herself and they all swim regularly and it s a perfect size for 3 costumes Gorgeous cotton gorgeous colour really well finished as usual Kept stuff is my addiction the staff and delivery are second to none Thanks Kept 
Stipes and Horses need I say more Of course stripes are a bit of an obsession of mine BTW why are this socks from PetSmart 
Great Value I was a little skeptical at first because of the price but when I received the Traval Tote I was amazed People still don t believe me when I tell them how much I paid for it I am going to purchase a few more to have on hand for gifts Service from the Tote Company was excellant I got the bag in about 5 days I strongly recommend this item 
Columbia Gloves Great gloves without the bulk You can actually use your hands with these on and their warm 
Great casual gloves Thin but great gloves You can use your car keys with these on 
Not what was expected These gloves are not warm Under the logo there is a strip of plastic that is really cold when the gloves are put on The size is not really small 
Value Quality so far Weighed these against more expensive pairs at REI and they came out on top whether for cycling or other activities Pros The velcro at the bottom of each leg makes for securing loose fabric PACKABLE Very light fabric still completely waterproof Comfortable for walking cycling other Cons Thinner fabric looks like it will wear quickly like similar items I ve owned For me the size was small I wear a size 32 30 bought the Large pants and putting them on can be a hassle They re tight believe me Very comortable once they re on though 
great for honeymooners as man lingerie I bought the white one to tease my husband on our honeymoon I told him if I had to wear lingerie so should he He actually wore it and it looked great on him however therefore I would never have him leave the house in it We did not test it in water but I would guess it would be quite see through If you are not in really great shape or would feel uncomfortable if others saw you naked I would not recommend it for use in public because it will show every detail of your physique and it is tiny very little coverage of stuff Please also never get it wet in public or wear it at all especially if children are present that would just be all kinds of icky However in the right private setting wearing it may just WOW the right lady 
Excellent Fit I was very pleased with this selection of men s swimsuits I bought a Black Red and also a White I am a very picky person but am very sartisfied with my selecting Speedo 
Absolutely better than other Speedos Be confident waring these The best Swim suit that I have ever seen in the US I strongly believe that this is the best Speedo suits that I have ever bought in this country The swim suites being made of very soft and elastic fabric it does not cause the itchiness on your waste hips and crotch which usually happens when you put on small Speedos like this The suits actually have only one inch cloth on the sides you may move your legs in the water very easily and it makes your swim performance far better than the other Speedos Another good feature of this suit is that there are many variation of color I own white black and dark blue one I personally do not recommend the one in white and very light color since it become absolutely see through when wet I know there is one big concern when men wearing this suite Here is my comment to someone who does not have confidence to wear them in swimming pool To be frank my friends told me that the suits are little revealing since those have high leg cut and made of thin fabric In fact even in the darker colors shape of your manhood will be somewhat revealed especially when wet in these suits But not see through However don t you think it always happens when you are in any Speedos as long you have the organ it is absolutely more strange if that part was completely flat In addition any swimming suits have more or less this feature If you are a person who thinks that is unfavorable you may want to stop swimming in pool and do the other work outs In other words people might see you package occasionally since it has high leg cut and adhere to your body However who cares stares and makes fun of it all the time when you are in swimming pool The suites cover only essential part because it was made to swim fast but absolutely not to reveal your manhood and pull attention from others Don t you agree I recommend you to try it at least once if you are swimmers who seriously want to swim fast The price being around 20 it is affordable as the second swim ware I realized that the actual size of the waist of this suite might be a little bigger than the jeans or pants Therefore you will feel more comfortable if you buy a one size smaller Like myself I usually ware jeans or pants in the size of 29 Therefore I chose 28 and perfectly fit me The fabric being elastic it stretches a bit However if you worry about the size just buy the exact size I love this suit and ware it all at least once a week As other people wrote previously the color fades relatively fast in pool water Therefore I would suggest you buy two pairs and wear it in turns 
great fit This suit fits perfectly It is brief flatteringly so and to allow freedom of movement without being tacky Very comfortable I ordered a second one 
Speedo Rocks I have been wearing the solar speedo for years It fits perfectly with the center and rear seam As a fitness trainer I have my corporate logo put on them as well Having a built body with a suit designed for a man who should be wearing a speedo only helps to boost my business I would recommend this Speedo to any man who wants comfort on the beach or competitive swimming in a pool The look is great the look is confidence START WEARING THEM 
MY FAVORITE PAIR OF SWIM TRUNKS I am a serious swimmer and I am a great believer in Less is Best I know that the Speedo Fastskin full body suit creates an artificial surface that may be faster than bare skin alone but when the chips are down for the Big Meet I ll shave down and really zip along with only minimal coverage Body hair is really a drag So this Speedo along with similar low rider briefs are my favorites Please guys if you don t have the proper build or are obese and or have a paunch DO NOT WEAR THIS or anything else resembling this Speedo Your goal should be to work on your physique so you can safely look great in this wonderful Speedo However if you are in decent condition then go for it and be proud to show off your body People will naturally look at you Women will admire your looks and men will be envious So there you have it 
Nice but do not wear it to the pool One of the things about this suit is that if you are an avid swimmer like I am do not wear it to the pool because the chlorine will eat it up the rear end of the suit right along the seam usually goes first Otherwise it is great for swimming and sunning it offers minimal coverage without being obscene If if wasn t for the fact that this suit wear out so easily if you don t take care of it it would be perfect 
Very pleased I didn t know if I would be happy ordering this item through amazon but it was ok Just like buying it from the store 
Sports Bra Review This is a great bra The price is very good There are a full range of sizes and the color options are good 
Quality My husband says he loves these jeans They were a second choice after I couldn t locate the ones he requested so I m happy that he s happy 
Zippered credit card wallet Finally found something that will hold all my credit cards checkbook and receipts It zips to keep items secure and does not have a magnetic snap that could mess up the magnetic strip on your cards and is great for those days when you don t want to hassle carrying a purse Thank 
Perfect It is just what I was looking for Slim but has lots of room for credit cards etc 
Zippered Long Credit Card Wallet Good quality wallet It has plenty of spaces for credit cards 19 + one window for id There are slots on each side under the credit cards for currency etc The zipper and the credit card slots are a bit stiff but should work well in time The only thing I wish it had was a little compartment for coins All in all a great wallet 
Best Wallet This is the best wallet I ve ever owned There is a place for everything yet it takes up no space Tuck cash and receipts behind the card holders and zip the whole thing up You should own one 
Great buy I love this wallet I searched all over the internet for just the right kind to hold my many cards Before I had it I was forever digging in a purse for my license credit cards etc Now everything fits in and is at easy view inside this wallet The only downside is getting the license out of it is sort of difficult because the slot is tight but I m sure it will loosen up over time Also because the wallet is sleek if I didn t have a zippered pocketbook I d be afraid it would slip out inadvertently so this may be a consideration for you 
Wallet I love this wallet There is plenty of space for all of my cards cash and all the other stuff I carry with me The only complaint would be that when I first got the wallet the zipper tab broke off within 3 weeks But I called belt outlet and they shipped another to me no questions asked I even got to keep the one that broke 
Love Bass Sandals I ve been wearing Bass Sharon Sandals for over 20 years and I m thrilled I can still get them I prefer the tan color over the white but I could only get white in my size 8M at the time of my purchase late summer These sandals last for years It takes me about three years to wear out the bottom of the sandals from constant summer use The leather straps have NEVER worn out or broken 
Comfortable sole Was looking for summer sandals and thought I d try a pair of these Ordered tan and it was true to the image on amazon The sole is fairly comfortable and the sandal itself is lightweight to walk around in It is true to size but the width is on the narrow side I usually get the medium widths if possible so this sandal is quite form fitting FYI if you have narrow feet the straps may be uncomfortable 
Excellent quality I ve just recently received this coat however it s already struck me as long lasting and effective and still looks good 
Perfect Tee Andrew Christian has some cool military tees bought several and love them all Nice loose fit 
My son loves these moccasins The moccasins are very well made and actually run a bit big My son wears a mens 14 and was concerned that they might be small They would be fine even wearing thick socks I recommend them highly 
slippers international mens deerskin These slippers are one of the better investments this year I say investment because they were a bit more than I would usually spend on slippers Right out of the box I was impressed with the quality The sole is of a non slip variety The overall construction is quality workmanship and materials They are almost more of a house shoe than a slipper yet VERY comfortable After having recent surgery I wear them most of the time They seem like they will have a very long life I would recommend these to any one Just remember you only get what you pay for 
Excellent These slippers are very nice my husband loves them They are very comfortable and appear to be very well made I expect them to last a long time 
Excellent quality I was concerned about getting the right size but these slippers fit perfectly Very good quality and very warm cushion It s really a slipper shoe which is what I wanted 
Hilarious This shirt is so funny I actually want to buy it which is rare since I normally silkscreen all my shirts For anyone who is sick of all the davinci hype like me thinks all those craking the davinci code authors who should write there own damn book like me or just want a shirt with a toad on mona lisa s face not like me but to each there own This shirt would be perfect I would buy it myself but there out of small s 
Excellent dress shirtr Ordered 2 Fast delivery excellent shirts Plan to order more Cal Clawso 
Great quality shirt This is a great quality shirt at a very reasonable price and received very soon after order Very happy 
Clark s Coreen I m very satisfied with the Clark s Coreen shoes They are made of genuine leather and fit well They are big compared to size I usually wear 9 and I ordered 7 5 and they are just perfect 
Grade B+ It was love at first sight when i saw these shoes and being a fan of Clarks Shoes I knew they would be just perfect Well they are cute but they re not quite as comfortable as my other Clarks Buy them if you want cute shoes but dont buy them just for the comfort 
My husband really likes these swim trunks My husband really likes these swimming trunks and you can t beat the price and free shipping 
Speedo Shorts are Great Everything from the initial order to receipt went great Thank you 
Very Good This was bought as a gift but the person that received liked it I liked that the product was available and it was shipped when I was promised it would 
sweeet hella cool chucks theyre not cheap good quality i was satisfied and so would you be one minor problem is that purple passion which is the one i ordered wasnt the exact color as the one shown but its still cool i love the 
not made in America anymore but HEY what is I have a closet full of Chucks I didn t have a pair in golden yellow Now I do I will save them for those formal occasions Comfortable zero arch support I ve worn them since I was kid Why change now For those of us who wear Chucks we know one another and can spot each other a block away It s always a good way to start a conversation with a total stranger In 2004 I wore my sky blue pair to Lithuania I don t think they had ever seen a pair up close I got some stares I love my Chucks and I plan to buy more when I see new colors that I don t have 
Purple Chucks I enjoy my purple chucks a lot I get lots of comments on them when I where them It is fun to see peoples reactions 
no big deal not as bulky but the large size is too large for a thin person 
crochet shoulder bag I bought this for a gift The girl who got it loved the size and wanted to use it when traveling It wouldn t take up much space in a suitcase The color would go with anything 
Great Robe Great Value Not the lowest price robe out there but very well priced for silk Soft silk wraps you in luxury It s sooo much better than a plain cotton terry robe Gotta go Hugh Hefner is calling 
Great T Shirt Made me feel like I was 16 again even though I m far from there 
only the BEST I got this shirt not long ago at first I thought i t was too small but I put it in the washer and i t fit just right all of my friends and even my teatcher recognized my shirt I advise you and your family to by this shirt 
Jester Tights Mime Tights We bought these in all colors and were a hit at our dance Thank you 
Not Used Delivery was quick and all packages arrived in good shape We have not yet used the merchandise to rate the product It appears to be of sufficient quality 
Great suitcase This bag is super light weight but still sturdy enough for normal use With the 50 lb limits on baggage you really need something like this if you want to carry more than a few items It doesn t have a lot of extra pockets or dividers but that is what helps keep it light I also appreciated the choice of colors so that I could have a case that didn t look like everyone else s It is much easier to find on the carousel 
awesome This is the great suitcase I have never owned one like it And the yellow definiatly stands out at the airport I can find my luggage fas 
The best If your looking for a great looking baggage a clasic that calls everybodys attention u got it here it is very strong great colour and you can carry easily 10 day clothes in there 
as advertised The shirt was as advertised authentic NFL with the holographic tag and obviously well made 
Every thing perfect I am a international customer and every thing works fine the quality of the product it s very good and the online purchase is cheaper than a local shop here in Venezul 
Excellent ordering I was so pleased with the Naturalizer sandals They were just as pictured and fit perfectly And they arrived a day earlier than stated Would definitely order from them again 
very satisfied I was very happy with the service and the shoes that I ordered 
Naturalizer Kennon Sandal I bought the tan and the black naturalizer Kennon Sandal I was very happy with the tan sandal After receiving the tan I then purchased the naturalizer black sandal at a later date The black sandal did not fit the same way that the tan fit I wore them for one day in the hopes that it would stretch them out It did not 
Light and comfortable My feet blister easily Because of this I try to choose my shoes carefully to make sure they fit well This is the first time I have ever bought shoes online I read nice reviews about Naturalizer and decided to order one for myself It was a good decision These sandals are light and comfortable I was able to wear them right away no need to break them in I actually don t break in my shoes I give them away if they hurt This one is definitely for keeps My feet are medium width by the way So I can t say if they will be as comfortable if your feet are narrow or wide 
3rd Strike Out for Madden shoes Cute sure they re cute all the Madden shoes are pretty cute I agree with the other reviewer that it runs small All the Madden shoes I ve tried have run small The reason I will never buy another Madden shoe is I am not into self inflicted pain Madden shoes are the most painful shoes I ve ever attempted to wear I bought the 3 styles I have reviewed here and I sent them all back after trying to stand walk in them for only 15 minutes I am convinced that one needs a local anesthetic to be able to wear Madden products 
Hot to Trot I was looking for the perfect spicy red shoe to brighten up a conservative black and white dress for an evening wedding and these are perfect The 9 was snug 9 5 too big so I advise stretching your normal size a little and wearing them a bit before you head out for the evening very hot hot hot And not too pricy Very Louboutin inspired 
Great I m very pleased with the fast delivery and also the Oversized Brown Josephine Hobo is great Good quality and everyone comments on how nice it is and how they love my Hobo 
Great Bag Excellent buy It was much roomier than I thought it would be and it just the coolest bag ever Well made and I Love it 
cute and functional checkbook wallet I had a beloved zippered checkbook wallet that I had been using for years and the zipper finally gave out I went searching for a new one that would replace it Wallets are one of those items that has to be just right When I read the description I thought this one would be a pretty good replacement and it has been for the most part The zipper and zipper pull seem nice and strong When you open it there is a card section with room for 9 credit cards but I doubled some up and it does work to have 2 per slot There is a place under the credit card slots to put receipts or other cards The other half of the wallet has one zippered pocket where I keep money and then slots on either side for receipts as well as a covered checkbook holder All in all this one was not as big as my old wallet and I did have to remove some items before it would close getting a new wallet is always a good time to clean out all the stuff you don t need anyway However the price was right and the colors offered I got the lime green are cute and fashion forward 
Bark Keisha bark Keisha is my dog and I bought the lovely blazer in bark Hence the title of this review I am quite pleased with this blazer It is soft and a gentle shade of brown a perfect fall color Very earthy tone and looks nicely aged Aged is not a criticism it is high praise Sometimes you don t want crispy I plan to buy this in other colors It s a great buy 
Monty Python T Shirts My grandson is now 13 and loves anything Monty Python I bought t shirts for him a couple of years ago and he has grown so fast I was delighted to find the same shirts in an XL for his 13th birthday He wears them daily 
Husband Loves Them I ve been married long enough now that socks are an acceptable gift for my husband He was not having success finding over the calf athletic socks in local sporting good stores I was happy to find these on Amazon as Gold Toe is a quality product made of durable elastic These stay up don t stretch and don t get nubby like nasty cheap cotton My only rule is dear husband must wear them under pants and not with shorts For shorts the Gold Toe ankle socks are a must 
Gold toe men s over the calf Nice medium weight sock true to fit over the calf After several washings and dryings they have shrunk some and have lost the color Overall they are great socks and would purchase agai 
Good in Boots Boot sock with durability and fit of gold toe They are also comfortable on the leg 
Real staying power These socks are warm comfortable durable and possibly most important of all they won t fall down 
Gold toe kneesocks These socks are long enough to go up to your knee Warm comfortable and wearing well I will buy more 
Knee socks These are great socks and an excellent value I get cold feet easily and these socks help a lot 
I love them Ive worn them on a daily basis for months they take a washing and stay black for a long time they get a pounding in skates and athletic shoes and keep my feet dry and feeling great 
shirt The blouse was too big and the exchange was easy The colors were not true to how they show in the computer but close I would use them again 
thermal top I was surprise by the narrowness of the sleeves but impressed with the materials thickness and the lace It does keep me warm 
MS I ll have to agree with the two previous reviews This is a GREAT strapless I ve never worn one that stayed in place so well or that was so comfortable I wore it for the first time dancing and no tugging whatsoever I m very pleased 
Amazing And I usually hate strapless bras This is the most amazing strapless bra that I have ever had It actually stays in place I am wearing it as a regular bra which I would never have even thought of doing in the past It also doesn t make me look flat which is also amazing It looks like a normal bra under clothes I can t say enough wonderful things about this bra And it fits true to size You have to try it 
Birkenstock Sandal Review I love these sandals These are the 3rd pair I ve owned and I have them on right now Originally I ordered the wrong size and called the distributor They exchanged them quickly with no hassle and promptly refunded the money for the returned sandals Great service 
Good sandals Received sandals very fast and fit perfectly Wish the straps would stay up so I can slip on faster but overall a good buy 
Birkenstocks I have ordered this product from this company one other time and it is exactly what I ordered They were delivered in wonderful condition and in a timely manner 
Bargain Birkenstocks These sandals are OK 4 star quality of material which makes it pretty good but the size system is completely off so that makes me want to put it as 3 stars I m an 8 but i ordered a 7 and i still have some room to spare I wish i could send it back and receive a 6 but too much work and i guess i ll just deal I feel that maybe a 6 would give me a firm size one where theres somewhat no squirming ability so thats why i decided to stick with a 7 I hope that this size review helps out a bit with your choice of size If youre ordering these sandals be prepared to take one size down or two or else you ll feel foolish with such big sandals Besides that the shape and form of the sandal is quite nice Its quite comfortable because after all it is a licensed birkenstock Plus the price is right compared to the other birkenstocks Thats why its moved up to 4 stars 
Excellent service The item was just what I ordered and the service and delivery were excellent 
clogs made for comfort These clogs almost did not get to me due to confusing tracking information I was so glad that they did arrive and they were truly very comfortable and well made However the leather was kind of stiff that s why I only put a 4 stars Overall I m happy with them and Clarks shoes always fit me very well 
There can be only one Clarks Clark s rule once you get a pair you can t imagine wearing anything else This shoe looks good and feels great 
Like walking in the clouds Clark s rule once you get a pair you can t imagine wearing anything else This shoe looks good and feels great 
worth the high price I had never paid nearly this much for a bra before but it is worth it I am a 34DD I am 55 years old and have never before had a bra that is so comfortable all day long or one that has lasted so long 
perfect work pant even the grease stains I get come off with minor effort The pants always look great right out of the dryer 
Hot I loved this I got it as a gift and I loved sliding it on It was a big short in the legs but being nylon I pulled the legs a little and it was an awesome fit Plus I wasn t the only one who liked it 
Nice present for hubby I bought a pair for my hubby s birthday upon his request Be careful not to buy too large a size because they are roomy Double E s will give plenty of room for your feet They arrived promptly via UPS and packed properly He put them on right away and loved them but stated that they were a bit large and may need to wear an extra pair of socks Otherwise a good pair of boots for wearing with slacks or jeans 
shoes it was a gift for my dad i love that it is upper leather this has been his style for years 
cutie patootie I got this for my daughter in time for opening day It is true to size not smaller than what it s tagged The booties don t stay on too well but the bib and creeper are too cute 
Perfect I recently ordered the lime green to wear with a new dress I purchased I received it long before I expected it and it was perfect The color was just as it showed online and the shawl is heavy enough without being overly heavy I will get a lot of use out of this shawl this summer and highly recommend this product 
Sent as a gift I live in the UK and I sent a Pashmina Shawl to my aunt in Cape Cod as a gift She was delighted 
Beautiful Pashmina This Pashmina is soft warm and reasonably priced The color is a true red which can be hard to find It was a great purchase 
Travelon Travel Accessories 75lb Luggage Scale Black I bought 2 of these scales and was very happy They are small and light perfect for home or to take on a trip They also came with a very nice feature I was not originally aware of The scale has a marker which shows the weight of the object you just weighed So weighing your luggage is no longer a two person job I believe this Stop and Lock feature is only available on newer models Great Product Very Happy 
Great item This thing is so easy to use and to store what a pleasure 
very good it surely beats weighing myself then reweighing myself with suitcase in hand don t forget to pack it in a hotel room it s just the thing 
Great shoe for everything This shoe is very comfortable and looks cute with everything I love wearing them for traveling easy to get on and off and covers your whole foot Even though the shoe has mesh air holes and is very breatheable my feet still feel a little sweaty I haven t noticed any problems with smelling yet hopefully I won t I couldn t decide what color to get I may purchase another pair soon 
Fantastic sport dress shoe for stylish women on the go I had previously owned the Skechers Active Bikers Sightsee and absolutely loved them Men and women commented on them at work or on my various travels I had nearly worn them out when I discovered that you could order them on Amazon com My replacements are the S A B Step Up with the only difference being the top materials They shipped to me in 2 DAYS which really shocked me and I wore them immediately It s like wearing a foot massage all day and they still look stylish Tomorrow I leave for Singapore and they will be on my feet the entire time 
I love these shoes They re incredibly comfortable and you feel like you could walk to China with no effort at all What I love about them is they not only look cool they ARE cool your feet can breathe in them which makes them great for a lot of walking in hot city streets But the thing I probably adore about them the most is how feminine they are You can wear them with anything from shorts to a skirt and they just coordinate flawlessly I bought the black ones I know it s almost winter but it s never too soon to start anticipating the torrid summer ahead or these are part excellent if you want to jump start summer and go on a cruise Highly recommend 
book bag grandaughter loved it We got 2 and I was charged for 2 but only ordered 1 Guess we will have one for next year Thank 
receive faster than i expected The product is nice and I got it faster than I expected Very nice purchase experience 
Very Pleased The product was just as described and it works wondefully I recommend this product 
School Backpacks friend or foe This was a beautiful back pack just as described and seems well made Are kid s school bags ever sturdy enough Sadly no This is the 3rd we have been through this year We can only hope it lasts the rest of the school year Can somebody come out with a super strong and lasting bag Mine from back in the old days lasted 2 years or more It s a thought 
crazy dots not just for kids I purchased this backpack to carry my oil paints in to give my arms a rest This light weight back pack is roomy tough takes a load of weight off this adult woman and the dots are excellent Lots of compliments My niece covets the dots she will have to get her own I highly recommend this product 
High fives to JanSport It s gotta be good if 4 months of school passed and there are no rips tears or broken zippers especially if it belongs to one of my kids 
Great for my daughter So far this has been a great backpack for my daughter It is very strong durable and she loves the pattern Unfortunately she brings a lot of heavy items home from school on a daily basis and her last backpack strap tore because it couldn t handle the weight However this new Jansport backpack seems like it will hold up for a long time Love it 
kidproof These bags I bought for my son and daughter are great Last year I bought a bookbag for my daughter and it broke close to the end of the year I was quite upset because I bought this from a reliable department store Well this time around the bookbag is holding up even with all the books that my fifth grader brings home 
excellent shoes these are the best shoes I bought during this shoe sale Very sturdy good enough for work our night out 
Very warm Warm comfortable cheap effective An excellent buy plus it doesn t make you look like you re gonna rob the place when walking into the store unlike some other clavas as it s comfortable enough to forget you re wearing it 
Arrived in time for Christmas Arrived as promised before Christmas even though it was ordered at the last minute 
Return to Vasque I had a pair of Sundowners about eight years ago and wore then every day for the next four and a half years After wearing through several insoles and a number of laces the stitching on the heel finally started to give out For the next several years I tried boots from a number of other manufacturers but none have lasted more than a single year and none were quite as comfortable for extended wear I switched back to the Sundowner Classic this fall While production of these boots has moved from Italy to China since my last pair the build quality seems equivalent The only minor difference is that the leather seems to scuff scratch a bit easier hopefully this will not impact their long term performance Highly recommended 
Great boot I ve had my sundowners for 2 years after a week they were broken in and have felt better than any tennis shoe i ve ever worn They are simply put the best shoe boot you can get 
Best boot I ever bought I have had this boot for 5 6 years wearing them almost everyday for the past 3 and I still have them and wear them daily without replacing anything not even a foot bed insert What a great boot they need to be worked in a little and at first I didnt like them that much but after I worked them in Wow I am getting ready to buy a new boot and I believe that I will buy a new pair of these ones I used them for everything from conservation work backpacking work and hunting 
New Balance MW926GR Mens Walking Shoe They are great shoes Except for I ordered 4E size and they are a bit snug across the toes for EEEE However they seem to be breaking in nicely Also are much more stylish than most other walking shoes 
Great shoe so comfortable my new shopping shoe I thought these shoes were for the young but decided i wasn t finding the comfort i wanted in the shoes i was buying so decided to purchase a pair of zig zag velcro sneaker I love them they are comfortable and easy to put on I am planning a cruise in June and will definitely take them for my walking shoe I am 61 
Love these shoes These shoes are so comfortable I dont like those big bulky kind of shoes They look funny because they are soo big I like shoes like this They are soo freakin comfortable lol I also like that you dont have to tie any shoe strings Buy these 
Very attractive French scenes umbrella Spent a little more for this umbrella than I usually would since I have a high rate of leaving my umbrella as soon as the last rain drop hits Took a chance that this would be as attractive as shown and it is a very handsome good sized and sturdy umbrella for the French hearted I recommend it 
Beautiful This umbrella is as pretty in person as in the advertisement It has a nice sturdy curved handle and is shaped to perfectly cover your head in the rain 
Slip on with Gel Insert I am delighted with these shoes I packed them prior to a trip to Florida I was able to walk on loose sand on the beach where they were entirely comfortable They fit so snugly around the top that no sand got into them to make me uncomfortable They also got me through the airports with no problems I am an eighty year old woman with minor foot problems and with these shoes they disappear 
It s like wearing slippers These boots are so comfortable it s like wearing slippers It almost feels wrong to be wearing them outdoors I wear them without socks when I have to get out the door quickly Love them 
Looked used and part of the logo was missing I bought this apron with a set of knives and when I opened the shipping box the apron was sealed in plastic but I could see that pieces of the logo were missing as if it had been washed 50 times Disappointing 
Complete These definately complete the transformation The fit is wonderful and the look and feel is totally natural A must for your wardrobe A lady shouldn t be without them 
Practically indestructible I love this bib It s roomy without being overwhelming It s waterproof yet the material is supple unlike those stiff vinyl bibs The pocket catches everything It s lightweight and takes up no room at all They ve been through the wash a zillion times All stains have come out and they still look like new I have the bibs from my first child and I m using them on my second try THAT with terrycloth bibs Oh and the prints are adorable 
Wonderful bibs These bibs are great The fabric is very light weight not stiff and heavy like the plastic coated bibs sold at BRU They are still water proof milk juice and water just run down the front and collect in the pocket Even though lots has gone down the bib my baby s clothes are still dry The velcro is extra long instead of a stingy little square so it can be adjusted to fit small babies mine is 6 months or big ones They wash up quickly in the sink rinsing out easily or can be thrown in the washer They air dry quickly wash after breakfast dry by lunch I love them and won t buy any others ever again 
The BEST bibs ever This is already my second set because I love them so much I ve been using them on my two year old daughter since she started solids They are lightweight easy to clean and catch everything They last forever and come in great patterns 
Perfect at all levels Perfect Christmas present for my 84 year old mother she loved it 
Solid bombproof righteous pantalones I work as a legal advisor in Afghanistan This means that I have to be reasonably well dressed which means at a minimum blazer and khakis Unfortunately I am an innately messy person a slob really and laundry service is not good to say the least It s a step up from pounding clothes on a rock The little swine have trashed several pairs of trousers that I did nothing more than drink coffee eat a tough steak and smoke a cigar in my good wool trousers looked like earthtone Picasso sketches But not these Lees I can get mud coffee blood whatever on them and then give them to a fellow who I know will wash and dry them on the highest heat imaginable Nevertheless they come out fine I will buy another couple pairs but not soon as I don t think these are going to wear out for a good long time My unstinting support wholehearted recommendation and so forth Buy these trousers Sure they may cost a smidge more than I duno Dockers But nobody ever looked at khakis that they had spilled red wine grease and blood on and finding no evidence of a stain said Damn I spent too much for these 
Nice Very good fit very wrinkle free Looks clean and sharp and could easily pass for dress slacks I am very pleased Go with the flat fronts anyday 
Good stuff I have 2 of these flat front Lee Performance Khakis and I like them a lot These trousers come with some kind nano technology coating which is really effective Water resistant wrinkle free I also have one of the pleated khakis but the flat fronts are much better I will definitely buy more and highly recommend these trousers to everyone 
Best Bra This is a perfect bra for a younger average body type It gives an uplift and no show through I will purchase this product again Made much better than other bras as well 
Poor Customer Service From This Store I purchased the pants and shirt from this store and they sent completely wrong sizes on both I have emailed them to request to exchange them for the correct sizes with no response from the store I ordered an XL shirt and received size 2X I ordered XLlong pants and received 3X pants So I am just out the money I have spent and received unusable mechandise The product itself would have been fine if they had sent the correct sizes I would never order from them again 
GREAT PAIR OF SANDALS I BOUGHT THESE CLARK SANDALS FOR MYSELF AND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE AND THE TIMELY DELIVERY I LIVE IN CA AND THEY CAME FROM FL IN ABOUT 3 DAYS BEALLS DEPT STORE GREAT

satisfactory This product is very soft it s not silk but I didn t pay for silk Worth the money for a lightweight summertime robe 
poly charmeuse red robe like the brightness of the color fits very well feels good to the skin thank 
Exactly what it says it is I ordered two one in black and one in ivory and I m pleased with them There are shoulder pads which are ridiculous given that the pads fall far past my actual shoulders and my shoulders are narrow but not that narrow but taking those out won t destroy the robes The belt loops are definitely high so that throws off the shape a little and if you re naturally very low waisted I wouldn t recommend them but the robes themselves are nicely made soft and pretty If you re looking for a good robe for a good price this is a very attractive option 
Gorgeous robe I ordered the violet and it is beautiful The only thing I didn t like is that the loops for the belt are too high on me 
Awesome These light in weight hikers are a slip on shoe that appears to be a lace up thus Chameleon I have put these things to the test in EXTENDED hiking chores and come in at day s end with sore back legs etc but feet feeling fine and ready for more Sounds like baloney but it s not I cannot overstate how pleased I have been with mine Great traction and they show essentially no wear thus far It scares me to think what it will take to wear these things out I didn t buy them for looks but I ve had several compliments on them Some additional observations There is essentially no break in period You can hit it hard with them right out of the box and they ll treat your feet well Although a slip on due to their substantial construction they do not pull on all that easily You have to use the handy heel tab provided and give a pretty good tug As they look kind of like a running shoe the chameleon effect again I gave them a go on a two mile jog BIG MISTAKE I might as well have been wearing steel toe engineer boots These things have a substantial heel element concealed in the shoe and they felt like they weighed a ton They are not cross trainers and are not suited as running shoe I fully recommend these for situations where one is on their feet all day and a casual sports appearing shoe is appropriate Worth the price 
arsaye The best operating room shoe I have ever worn Great for standing long periods Also really awesome looking shoes Really enjoy climbing rock faces with my Merrell s 
Most comfortable shoes I can find I bought a pair of these for light hiking and decided to wear them to work I am on my feet for 12 hours straight as an ER nurse I sometimes work 4 12 hour shifts in a row These are the only shoes I could find that keep my feet from being sore Merrell truely makes a quality product I love them so much I put some on my wish list so I can have another pair A must buy for anyone looking for a shoe that is comfortable and functional You will not regret getting these I would give them 6 stars on a 5 star scale 
My husband loves them I got these for my husband He says they are the best shoes he s ever had Already tested them out hiking around in the woods He didn t even have to break them in and they already feel great By the way they are really cool looking too No tying 
Very pleased The shirt arrived in a reasonable period of time fit very well was exactly what I wanted when I placed my order 
great I got the brown ones they are cute with jeans and quite comfy Order half a size smaller would fit better 
Great bra for small girls I am so tired of trying unsuccessfully to find bras for small women that aren t full of padding and wires This bra is fantastic and I ve worn several of them until they were completely worn out I should have taken better care in washing them by hand hanging them to dry but they still held up to my improper care for a long time This is a great no frills no thick padding bra and the selection of sizes is unbeatable 
Comfort and Shape No uncomfortable wires slight padding for shape microfiber feel This is one of the best bras ever Very comfortable and fits my small frame finally 
Sexy These shoes are very sexy very chic fit I love them It s a good buy 
Off to Basic This product worked very well for my grandson who needed an over sized bag to go to basic training and AIT training at Fort Knox It carried all he needed to take and had room for him to store the clothes he was wearing when he went so he was able to turn over everything for storage when he got there It will also carry a few extra incidentals for his return home 
demaciado buenos disculpen que tarde en escribir este review pero no me di cuenta que no lo habia hecho puedo decir con toda propiedad que estos pantalones son muyyyyyyy buenos no he tenido problemas de ningun tipo con ellos cuando lo pedi no tardaron nada en enviarmelos y me enviaron exactamente lo que pedi y tambien lo pantaones son de una calidad inigualable stoy pensando en comprar mas para venderlos entre mis amigos en mi pais jejejeje 
Successful Search I was able to get exactly what I needed because the Amazon site included all the dimensions of the camera case My camera is an odd shape and size and I didn t want anything too large This one fits exactly There were many cases that looked OK but without specific dimensions I couldn t take a chance The price was right too 
Perfect Fit Fits my Kodak EasyShare Z740 perfectly Enough room for my digital camera with large zoom and all accessories but not too big and cumbersome Nicely padded and protective 
longhorn journal I bought one of these journals It is made of thick quality leather I like the size and the leather cover extends around and snaps The reason I only give it four stars is because it doesnt lay flat easily I do like the lined pages because I get to writting crooked on paper with no lines This is a very high quality journal that when you fill it up you can order another filler and start again I highly reccomend this journal I would buy another just like it Bobby Standle 
Journal A great journal very nice leather this will last a long time Only question is Do you have refills 
Great quality item Very pleasant experiance the quality is excellent We are very happy with our purchase 
Lots of room The backpack is sturdy has enough room for all the high school textbooks which is hard to find 
Jansport Big Student Backpack I really am enjoying this product it is helping me stay organized and prepared for classes 
my favorite backpack FITS COMFORTABLY ON MY BACK AND I CAN CARRY EVERYTHING I NEED FOR THE DAY WITH ME FROM CHECKBOOKS TO SUNGLASSES CELL PHONE WATER GLOVES SUNBLOCK DRESS SHOES FOR THE OFFICE WRITING MATERIALS KEYS AND SMALL CHANGE 
Worth the Money These underwear hold up very well and don t rip along the waistband or in the seams Seven pairs bought in Jan 2004 lasted over 2 years w o ripping The price has not changed since then either Definitely worth the money 
Underwear that fits The underwear is the only style that I can wear with ease Unfortunately I can t find the style in stores I was happy to find vendors selling it on Amazon With alittle bit of a wait the package arrived and I was a happy camper Thank Yo 
Nice Nice checkbook cover mine smelled like leather not a strong or funky smell at all 
QUALITY THIS IS A NICE LEATHER CHECKBOOK COVER FOR THE PRICE I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT 
Excellent product I owned a leather checkbook cover for nearly 13 years that was made by another company It wore so well that I said I d never use vinyl again For the last five years I ve been searching for a similar cover but was unable to come up with one that felt so supple while maintaining a quality firmness I like the way the edges are hemmed under and are not exposed I chose the tan color which was perhaps a little oranger than expected but hey I can always see where I laid it down now Jef 
Nice Check Cover I ve always put up with the vinyl things that are issued with checks but never was happy This is a very nice soft leather check cover that is durable and so much better than the vinyl things Highly recommended 
Excellent quality for a basic checkbook cover I bought two of these over a month ago and I am very satisfied I didn t want anything fancy and was pleasantly surprized at the high quality of this product I definitely recommend it for anyone who s looking for something simple but durable 
Not a bad product if you could get past the FUNK The checkbook cover itself is functional and works fine However the odor from it could about knock you over I have yet to actually put it to use because it has been sitting on the shelf for three days in the hopes that it will air out some so far to no avail I am not kidding it smells awful Whatever products they used to cure the leather left it smelling so indescribably terrible It isn t just a leather smell Trust me I have leather shoes coats car seats furniture purses I know what leather smells like and this ain t it It is practically toxic The first day I opened it my office smelled so bad that it gave me a headache I would advise you to look elsewhere 
Excellent product High quality leather I was VERY impressed when I received my black checkbook cover The quality of the leather is exceptional really looks classy elegant Thank you for a high quality product that I am really going to look after 
Good Shoes for the Office They are a little oversized but very comfortable to wear around the office 
Excelent shoes I bought this shoes for my husband and he said that is like walked in a BMW shoes Very confortable and soft Excelent for every day work office 
ok shoes these shoes are by no means as good as my dockers but they ve stood the test of time and that says alot coming from me 
AWESOME I love this swim suit It is awesome Very comfortable and good for those who don t want to wear a 2 peice bikin 
Review of 4 Piece Outfit I purchased this 4 piece outfit for my grandson for Christmas I loved the Elmer Fudd hat that it came with I wasn t sure how it would be but when my daughter in law saw it she immediately called me to tell how adorable it was and that the quality was surprising good I recent received pictures of him in it and it looks so cute on him They live where the weather is cold so its a great outfit for him to wear anytime 
bt kids outfit This is really cute nice material my only unfavorable point is that the collar does not completely encircle the top of the jacket It leaves a gap about 3 4 on each side of the zipper where the child s neck should be covered Not heavy duty for outside colder weather but fine for traveling in the car Its a good deal for the money 
LOVELY EVENING P URSE I ordered this purse to go with a brown and gold outfit for a wedding I received at least a half dozen compliments on the bag since it was such an unusual color for an evening bag People were amazed at the quality for the price I look forward to further shopping with this seller You won t be disappointed M Lovejo 
Elegant Bag I bought this bag for special occaisions but I m noticing ladies carrying these types of glitzy bags out to restaurants and bars It s a great color chocoloate brown which is a hard color to find in a nice dressy bag My sisters are fighting over who gets to borrow it Good quality for the inexpensive price 
Bad Shoes My husaband had them for only a month before they came unsewn at the toes Not a small hole but it went all the way across And in both shoes Not put together right Very disappointed To much money to fall apart 
Buy a half size larger than usual I wish I had seen the 1 2 size larger recommendation Mine are 1 2 size too small Nice boots though 
Razor Ridge Shoe This shoe has been a real asset in the snow and ice The recommendation to buy 1 2 size larger was right on Fit great with no break in time 
Girls Underwear Lifesaver I couldn t find a better deal and quality underwear for my toddler I had such trouble finding her size until I came here 
Sexy Very sexy purse It is a little hard to get into because the opening at the top is so small I received the purse quickly 
Great tights I buy these tights for both of my daughters and have found them to be very durable 
Katchen Pump This shoe is absolutely beautiful Excellent craftsmanship Quite comfortable considering the heel height nearly 4 I am delighted with the selection of colors and patterns available for this shoe model I bought the cream colored and mahogany crocodile print ones and I love them they are very versatile in my wardrobe A shoe like this won t go out of style 
All I need This iPod case is not only cute but highly functional It is made of medium grade leather and is available in great colors with a clear shield to protect the precious screen a belt clip cut outs for your headphones and docking station attachments and a detachable kick stand so you can view movies and slideshows of your photos It is a bit more expensive than some of the others for sale but I am a firm believer that you GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR I have 2 in baby pink and black grab one 
JERZEES Z NuBlend Crewneck Sweatshirt I bought several sweatshirts of varying colors and so far they have washed nicely I was very pleased by the quick service I received when they were shipped 
Were very warm for Siberian Wwinter My wife went to Siberia Russia for Christmas and the weather there is on average 20 The boots kept her feet very warm The boots are of great quality and I highly recommend them for use in winter especially if you decide to visit Siberia during the coldest time of the year 
I love these boots I bought these for the up and coming snowy weather I tried these on and I am a true 8 5 I read somewhere that these were running small so I ordered a 1 2 size up I ordered a size 9 and they fit I wont be able to wear really thick socks but that is ok So if you order these order at least a 1 2 size bigger than your normal size If you want to wear thick socks I suggest a whole size up I love the look and sprayed them with weather and waterproofing protectant and now I am good to go I bought both colors They look pretty good and they dont make my feet look HUGE 
Great Little Shoe Shoes fit exactly as described and are cuter on than I expected plus the price can t be beat 
Happy Purchase Excellent for the price Have purchased expensive over the calf socks and been quickly disappointed These are comfortable well fitting and seem to have a long life 
socks that stay up socks stay up not too thin and not too thick comfortable if you like above the calf you will like these have not had long enough to see if they wear through easily or have loose stitching but so far so good 
Great socks These are exceptionally comfortable do not shrink and stay up on the leg You can wear them year round and stays in shape after multiple washings I have worn Gold Toe for many years and I find them to be of the best quality without paying high prices These are on the top of the line as far as satisfaction for me 
Gold Toes are the best I love Gold Toe brand socks Their are the only brands I buy especially the Canterbury model I highly recommend Gold Toes 
Gold Toe Over the Calf Excellent product Have worn the wool version for years Tried the Canterbury cotton version this time and find the same product quality 
When they say over the calf they mean it So I bought the regular length Canterbury socks and they were too short so ended up falling down all the time I figured that I d get these and they d be a regular dress sock length and go to just above the curve of the calf But um no The tops of the socks actually come right up to my knee stopping just shy of bunching up at the joint On the one hand no force on this earth could make these socks sag which is good on the other hand they re a minor pain to get on I actually had to get hosiery advice from my wife roll the top down put your foot into the bottom part and then unroll the sock up your leg which is disturbing More disturbing is feeling like I should be donning a tunic and heading off to a Ren Faire But if you can get past the oddness well you re sure as heck not going to have baggy socks 
Kick your wardrobe up a notch These socks are flawless Extremely comfortable you can wear them all day and the cotton allows your feet to breath while the nylon ensures that your socks never droop They wear like iron never had a hole after many years of use 
World s greatest sock It took me until age 47 until I really started to pay attention to my socks I ve always hated the drooping ankle sock showing skin with legs crossed look So I went on a mission to find a great affordable over the calf and this is it Fully stocked my sock drawer with 12 pairs in black that s all I really need for work or leisure The quality and comfort they go up over your calf and STAY there no bare ankles showing on me are exemplary Next I m going to try the athletic sock version of these Gold Toe makes great stuff 
Fast and easy Another winning online vendor Orders placed in the morning is shipped the same day and delivered the next day From NJ to MA I love service like that Items are well packed and are in perfect condition as expected I will order from them again and again Keep up the great work 
Columbia Sportswear Bonehead Short Sleeve Shirt South Beach The quality is great but the x large is too big It should have been marked an xx large 
Just What I ordered I had shopped at a local department store for these flexees but they had only the one in my size So when I came to work that Monday I decided to check out Amazon to see if they had them in their inventory on line They did have them so I order four more in my size and had them delivered to my home They arrived in approximately 4 days and were exactly the same flexees that I had purchased at the local department store So all in all it was a great experience 
I love this shirt I bought the mink color and wear it all the time It is a little snug but it has a good cut and feels tailored As soon as the price drops again I plan to buy it in the other colors too I only gave it 4 stars because the craftsmanship is a little lax lots of hanging threads etc and I am dubious it will hold up after multiples washes but for the 8 99 that I paid it is well worth it 
Sleek A really great pair of shoes they are good colour the pweter when you don t want black and navy won t work Because of the finish they can go from office to an evening out Will look great even with say a black cocktail dreses The only difficulty is with sizing I am a size 12 with this brand and ordered a 13 because I know that with shoe fronts like this I need more The 13 is a bit too much but the 12 would not have done All you need however are some simple inserts and you are good to go 
Comfortable Hip Picture does not make justice for this Jeans I am a size 26 but i got this Jeans in a size 25 and they fit perfect Jeans snuggle the 1rst time you wear them but they lose softly while you are wearing them giving you a look of a sexy relaxed Jeans that sits on the hips and very flattering on your back view without being snuggle They are FLARED not bootcut VERY long inseam but that makes the Jeans absolutely HIP but very classy Gorgeous for long legs skinny look Love It 
Love it only wish it was slightly longer It s attractive it s washable and it s warm 
comfortable shoe and very stylish Although this is pretty high heel over 3 inches this shoe is so comfortable that you really can walk very easily and for a long time in total comfort I highly recommend this cute and stylish shoe great with jeans capris etc 
i m love my shoes i m so happy whit my shoes they are confortable soft and look very sex 
fashion and comfort These shoes are very versatile great for wearing with jeans pants or dresses and skirts Despite the heel height they are very comfortable I purchased them in black Recently I wore them on a trip to Las Vegas where I did lots of walking They were as comfortable as my flats 
Aerosoles Women s Sleigh Thread These are the most stylish comfortable shoes I have owned in a long time I love these shoes I have received many compliments Love the 
Take a sleight ride with this shoe I tryed this shoe on and loved it I do not normally wear such a high heel or wedge but it was quite comfortable 
good I just got this shirt in a small in black and I like it I was a size small 2 4 before I got pregnant I am now 8 months pregnant and about 40 + pounds gained and the shirt fits snug and cozy to my standards If the shirt was a bit longer I am on the tall side 5 7 and maybe a bit thicker cotton I would have given it 5 stars 
TOO BIG FOR MY NEW BABY THESE ARE REALLY CUTE BUT THEY ARE WAY TO BIG FOR MY NEW BABY SHE IS NOW 5 WEEKS OLD AND THEY WONT STAY ON HOPEFULLY THEY WILL FIT SOO 
ultra thin leather gloves the gloves fit fine and were shipped in quick time in according to the time ordered 
Wacoal Bra Underwire with Feather Embroidery The first time I bought one of these bras it was professionally fitted at a major department store They are among the few bras that fit me comfortably and look nice under clothing I was very happy to find them on Amazon in all colors and sizes free of shipping charges 
Nice Quality Good Price Fast Delivery These are great little boyshorts in lace and very soft I had to get used to panties riding so high in the bottom area but that s the style and now that I m used to it they are great Besides my husband LOVES them 
Stretch Lace Boyshorts Nice Quality For the small price they charge we weren t expecting such durability and long lasting quality These are very sexy the colors are nice and they are soft too 
Flawless Purchase I recently purchased these shoes for a night out on Valentine s Day with my boyfriend I had a great experience with this product and service The shoes themselves were completely wrapped up in their box Because of the delicate beading on the shoes I was afraid that poor packaging may cause them to get damaged in shipment Not so Every part of the shoe was perfectly preserved and protected The beading has pink accents too I couldn t see the pink in the picture but it s there These shoes are high but comfortable Definetly wear them about the house before taking them out I m thinking of getting them in Red too The seller itself ShoeMall sent me emails letting me know that my order was received then another email letting me know that it was on it s way including the tracking number I highly recommend this shoe and seller based on my flawless purchasing experience 
hue flat knee high socks love them they are light material they stay up and are perfect for what i wanted in a knee high 
A great trouser sock These socks from Hue are great for wearing with loafers or dress boots They are a great value for a quality name brand 
Excellent Socks These are the best knee socks I ve ever owned Wish I had ordered 6 pairs instead of just 3 
Gorgonz 7700 CHA Ear Warmer Fleece I have waited for a set of ear warmers like these for a long time I have to hide them from my children These are essential to enjoy any winter outdoor activity 
Warm These ear warmers are wonderful The wrap around style is nice for not messing up your hair On really cold days I put these on and then a stocking hat My ears stay nice and toasty 
Love these jeans I absolutely LOVE these jeans For those of you who notice a difference in the stretch jeans these have the 2 spandex in them not 1 These are the ones that stretch a little more and are SUPER comfortable 
Cool Shirt Love Dickies Dickies always makes the best apparel not only useful and extremely durable it is stylish as well 
Spiffy belt The Italian Saddle Leather Belt is a real gem It is well made of heavy leather with a sewn in cloth insert of many different colors it will go with almost anything The quality is oustanding and at a price of 28 it could easily be compared to an 80 belt I wore it for the first time on a vacation trip to Arizona and actually received several compliments on it I never have received compliments on a belt before Bottom line good price good quality great looking I am pleased with my purchase 
Wonderful Product I love this sports bra I was finally able to start cross country running without pain 
Decent performance not the softest fabric I have been happy with the performance of this bra in terms of control but the fabric is not the softest Washing hasn t softened it but it s not intolerable 
The best sports bra I ve ever worn I m training for a marathon and these are the best sports bras for running that I ve found I have about 6 of them They keep you nice and snug and dry and don t chafe at all I highly recommend them 
Cute comfortable and functional This product does what it s supposed to do it s comfortable and it s cute for a sports bra 
Love it it s really great very comfy love it and ready to buy another one 
NICE My girlfriend love this shoes she said that are very confortable and so light weight The amortiguation it s good after 3 month use it Well thats what she told me 
good product nice price Well i bought those shoes for my sister when they go onsale roughtly 21 Price is very good for addidas shoes and the degisn is nice too But only thing my sister does not like is the the plastic base you feel it is prertty hard when you wear shoes she like the softer heel 
I LOVE them These shoes are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever had I am so happy with them It is so difficult for me to find a pair of shoes that feels like they re made for me but these are GREAT 
impressed the shoes fit they arrived in a timely fashion and best of all they were on sale I work in a laboratory and am on my feet 8 hours a day on concrete floors and these are very comfortable and kind to my feet and legs What a deal 
Silk Pajamas My friend was very happy with them They are very good quality and they fit him for the most part The only issue we had was the length of the arms They were a little too long Other than that we were pleased They got here in time for Christmas and they were just what he wanted 
Size reference Great PJ Really glad i got it It s pretty well built I was afraid it would be a bit fragile but so far so good As a reference I m 6 0 with roughly 200lb I got the Large and it s a bit tight for my taste I ll be trading it for the X 
Best Quality I Have Found These silk pajamas in my opinion have much higher quality stitching tailoring details as well as a heavier weight silk than the closely priced DreamSacks pajamas Sizing Help To help clarify sizing for people there have been conflicting reviews here I ordered a Medium but then returned it for a L I will probably get some minor alterations but I don t blame the company for that everyone is shaped differently I am 6 0 and weigh 175 My suit measurements are a 42 chest 34 sleeves and 32 pants inseam The Medium body fit but the sleeves and pants were too short The Large was the best fit overall although roomier around the chest than I would prefer But if you are my size the Large is your best option 
Good for women too These are great Well made did ok in the wash They also did not split at the seam after wearing them 2x They are still cool enough for summer but nice and warm in winter and SERIOUSLY SOFT By a pair for your wife yourself They are heaven 
Good quality silk Of all men s silk PJs that I purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best The fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well After reading other customers reviews I purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size M and occasionally L It turned out too small I would recommend going one size up 
Good quality This is a good quality pajama set and was worth the price I paid with an Amazon discount Be forewarned that the color is a really bright red though 
Comfy and sleek pajamas What a great pair of pajamas these are So soft non binding roomy and great for lounging I ve already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays Very good quality silk well sewn and tailored I m normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine 
great shorts These shorts are very comfortable and would reccommend them to everyone I will be odering another pair soon 
finally a pair of shorts with a short inseam These shorts are durable comfortable and fit well It took me a long time to find a pair of shorts with a short inseam These fit the bill The tag on the inside of the waistband is slightly itchy scratchy otherwise I would have given them 5 stars 
Best Bang for the Buck This item was awesome Could not find it in the store anywhere before Christmas in the needed size The quality was superb and received it in about 3 days 
Nice product I was looking for a keychain that would hang from my belt and NOT make me look like a janitor Not that there s anything wrong with that This fit the bill looks better than I thought it would 
Super Comfort When I wore the shoes the first time they were comfortable from the start I always buy Rockport and have always been satisfied with the comfort 
Rockport Walking Shoe Love em I wear these shoes a lot And just like most Rockport lace up walking shoes they are comfortable give me lots of traction and make walking a pleasure They are like extensions of my body they fit so well 
Quality item great price This is an excellent comfortable shoe Size is spot on I walk tons throughout the day with my job and these really are worth it 
Very Comfortable I bought these for my husband 8 5 W and he loves them He has problems with his feet so it s hard to find a pair that he would enjoy wearing These fit the bill perfectly I will be looking for more in this style I got these for 54 at a time when Amazon had a super special going Since my husband doesn t have to be in pain while wearing these shoes we cannot say enough good things about them 
Rockport shoes go to Europe in wine tour Super Shoes I walked very many miles in the Portugal Ribera del Duero Penedes and Cote de Siegre vineyards Confortable very confortable We walk over 5 hours in Lisbon and a week after 6 hours in Paris In Barcelona we did the same Super Shoes 
even better than expected My husband has worn the world tour rockports and found them very comfortable but the elite version has even better support and cushioning 
Elite Shoe is Great This shoe is good looking and great fitting It provides excellent support I also bought the Rockport Prowalker in a different color but I prefer this one for more comfort support and better looking although I like and wear the Prowalker shoes also 
Rockport World Tour Walking Shoe None Better I have been wearing the Rockport World Tour walking shoe for over ten years and have not found anything to match the light weight comfort The wide widths that are often hard in other shoes are another plus 
Dr Marten Hikers I have always worn classic Doc boots this time decided to get more stylish I was not dissappointed These have a wonderful thick sole and very soft leather They are very comfortable and no break in time was needed 
Great Footwear My wife wanted a pair of Doc M boots for her birthday She went to the Doc M website found the boots she wanted but they were out of stock So I took over went to Amazon and found exactly what she wanted Placed the order with standard delivery her boots arrived less than 72 hours later They were exactly what she wanted 
Please with porduct The quality is good size was perfect for my daugther good description of product 
Love them They fit great our daughter thinks they rock They are easily adjustable with the ties You might want to double knot them Great for the price 
Ballet Shoes The first pair that I got didn t fit and they were the wrong color I sent them back and had the correct one within days Perfect service and great product Thank you They made my 5 year old s day 
Wonderful Ballet Slipper But I love these shoes for my daughter They fit great and they are easy maintenance BUT DO NOT buy the street shoe size as the Capezio website size chart says for this shoe I had to buy 1 size bigger and they are very tight Now I have 1 1 2 size bigger than street shoe size on order She can wear the 1 size bigger but not with tights HAPPY DANCING 
Very nice back pack Its very light nice looks blue in color and spacious back pack I use it for my office and also when ever I go for some outing It can hold all the essential things that I need I like this bag a lot very much recommended 
it looks better and bigger than the pic I bought this for my husband to carry his laptop computer and other stuff when commuting It s surprisingly better than we expected with MP3 player pocket and it s not that big like other Jasport bags Besides the 15 4 in laptop is perfect in it Might buy one more for my son 
very nice this backpack is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute i bought this to use for a diaper bag on the simple fact it nicer looking than the old diaper bag the hospital gave me and is of better qualit 
definitely reccomended I just bought this yesterday for school and I love it The straps make it easy on your back for heavy loads which is definitely a good thing because I m in high school It s big enough for all my books but not too big to be awkward It d be nice if it had more pockets maybe one for a cell phone but that s not really a problem since all I really carry is books And the color s nice that s always a plus 
Great Loafers I was looking for a pink penny loafer that was wide enough I wear a wide shoe and comfortable for casual wear These are perfect Wide enough comfortable and a nice color pink I would definitely buy another pair 
SHORTchanged I feel totally ripped off We bought the five sweatshirts for my husband because it had the Best by Crew moniker and we assumed there would be very little shrinkage Boy were we wrong I am now using them as dustrags after just one wash not good not a good feeling at all 
Good deal especially for a 3 piece set Very cute Excellent price Comparible shipping prices and fast delivery Would buy from them again 
Super cute This outfit is the perfect fit for my tiny daughter and it looks super cute on her 
Wonderful These thigh highs are a must for your wardrobe They stay up without garters although for that sexy pleasing look I would recommend a garter belt too A wonderful fit They won t roll down and give your legs a magical feel I ve bought several pairs and love to wear them for a night out or a special occasion with my partner 
beautiful Super comfy pjs I know these are supposed to fit snugly but if you want them to fit a while maybe buy a size larger Also just a little bit more girly looking than I expected but still very nice 
Carhartt Fleece lined jeans These jeans are awesome I use them for riding in the winter and don t need long johns on underneath Very soft and comfortable 
Great Shoes First used these shoes on a jungle hike on Raiatea I have a high arch so I purchased replacement insoles that better fit my foot Overall the fit was good particularly with the higher insole Drainage was excellent Soles were a little hard however resulting in some slip on wet rocks Overall a very good all terrain wet environment shoe 
Great Outdoor Shoes I love this Shoes I bought them two months ago and i ve used them every day since I ve used them in a variety of activities trekking mountain hiking and to walk over wet rocks and river crossing and i never slipped I did all of these activities without socks and it never hurt my feet 
water shoes Great shoes and quick delivery but would not deliver to an APO addres 
Nice When ever I wear these boots people ask be to stick my leg out or turn around so they can see them I wish I would have gotten them a size larger but they are a really great looking pair of boot 
Bright and cheap I have used these luggage tags for several airplane trips I chose the yellow neon which makes my luggage easily recognizable Easy to apply to luggage and not easily removed such as for thief Frequently when I retrieve my luggage from the carrousal the tag is partially destroyed or completely missing No problem since I use these tags and if it does occur in the future I have not lost much in money PLUS they are really cute I highly recommend these bright cheap tags 
My Husband Loves Them I ordered these for my husband for Christmas and he loves them I overheard him telling one of his friends about them which is a rarety to hear men talking about shoes in this house He especially likes how the sole wrapes up along the side of the shoe It makes him more comfortable when he wears them outside to get the mail the paper etc because he doesn t have to worry about the side of the slipper getting wet by dew on the grass or the small puddles left by the sprinklers They appear to be very well made and durable he hasn t had them long enough to know if they really are but they seem to be We live in Florida so it is difficult to find slippers that can be worn year round and the flannel lining in these keeps your feet warm in cool weather and not too hot in warm weather One thing about these though is we had to return the first pair because they were a little snug on his feet According to him because of the rubber sole wrapping up along the side prevented them from giving so they were a little tight We had to go a size larger than he usually wears When he got the larger pair he was and continues to be a happy camper 
classy comfort got these for christmas and right out of the box instant comfort warm but not hot like some slippers i like the quality of this company very satisfied 
great product I ordered this in a black and am extremely happy with it It is well made and very silky It feel wonderful against the skin The stretch bodice was a little stiff but that was just the sizing and goes away after the first washing I love the way the generous skirt swirls around my legs Very sexy I am going to get another one in another color 
Long Ivory lace top gown This gown is well made with no defects While some ladies may find the gown to their liking the stretch lace material of the bodice was irritating to my skin and the ivory color was FAR more see thru than I desired 
Grandson loves it Purchased this for my grandson Made well nice embroidery Gave it to him for Christmas He hasn t been seen without it since 
Very satisfied The jersey is excellent We are very satisfied with this purchase and the company we purchased it from 
Brown Leather Driving Gloves I am very pleased with these gloves They are of top quality and very supple yet subtantial They fit smoothly and closely to your skin like driving gloves are meant to The leather thickness is perfect Not too thick and not too thin I have felt and tried on other golves offered in high end auto dealerships which were priced at well over 100 and they weren t any better at all These are the ticket 
SUPER SELLER FAST SHIPMENT EXCELLENT REALLY YOU ARE AWESOME THANKS FOR YOUR FAST SHIPMENT WAS A PLEASURE TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU REGARDS JOSE SANTAELL 
Very comfortable pants Just wanted some khaki pants for work These do the job and have a bit of give in the elastic band Great for me 
Great for the office I bought these to wear with pants only for work The color and style is great Pretty comfortable shoes but it doesn t really have good ventilation no air for your feet to breathe 
Nautica Genuine Leather Bi Fold Wallet w Free Wood Gift Box I like the wallet The quality was good but the wood gift box was a big disappointment I expected the box to be fully enclosed but it wasn t and the wallet fell out of it 
Satisfied Customer I was very much satisfied with this product The only thing that I think could have been better was the gift box I guess I was expecting something nicer than what it came in The wallet is great and my boyfriend loved it 
Good casual top Nice top Construction is ok at best Great for knocking about without looking too casual 
Very comfortable Great Price These overalls are perfect for working in the yard during the winter months 
Great winter fleece I use it for winter runs and it is very warm and comfortable I also have the matching pants The set is fantastic for skiing under your waterproof jacket and pants For the price you can t beat i 
Great Shipping Great Looking Bag Ordered on Sunday received on Wednesday and Looks great will see how durable but looks like a good product 
great bag I ordered this bag and received it VERY fast In fact that s probably why the shipping costs brings the total out to 25 I wouldn t even bother with expedited shipping of any sort because you re already going to receive your item with 1 2 days of ordering As for the quality of the bag considering the price before shipping it s very nice It s much blacker than the photo shows and it s not too big or too small I don t know what the reviewer that stated it wouldn t last does with his messenger bags but there s no reason for this bag to not withstand a college student s use 
A great bag for a great price I am taking classes during my lunch hour and didn t want to walk around my office or downtown with a kid s knap sack This is a stout bag that looks like an authentiic military piece The bag holds all my study materials and has the outside pockets for pens highlighters whatever This is a great alternative to the traditional briefcase and costs a lot less 
great bag this is just what i needed but i cant fit any thing but lunch in the front pocket 
Great Buy Very sturdy and roomy bag Incredible buy at under 20 Beats similar bags for 3 times the price The black bag is even nicer in person than in the picture 
Great bag dual purposes awesome price may want more support I love this bag and the price is perfect I bought it primarily for my 15 notebook computer I was wary about this bag because it doesn t have padding rigid structure to protect the computer but I rarely lug my computer around outside of going to the airport to and from the car to a friend s house etc This bag is perfect for short distances where I don t have to stand idle longer than 30 minutes the strap isn t comfortable with a heavy load But like I say I m not walking around with a heavy load for very long Now For the most awesome feature once I m in my hotel and my computer is on the desk where it will stay until time to go back to the airport I have a stylish and simple all purpose canvas bag to put my book scarf notebook or whatever Try carrying around a typical laptop bag without looking like the laptop guy Now that I have one the benefits of having a slim multi purpose bag far outweigh my desire for padding This bag fits the bill for dual purposes If you carry around your computer ALL the time you may want consider buying something with padding on the bottom and some rigidity I wouldn t ever want to drop the bag with my notebook in it or I might need a new PC But come on Sub 20 bucks Great Deal 
Great bag for the price I ve used a similar bag for years Thought it was time to change up Saw this one Liked the price and ordered one Delivery was quick I placed my order at 5 30P M on a Friday and received it in the mail the following Monday Lots of room I like the zippered main compartment Plenty of smaller compartments for smaller items It a good bag for students or outdoor enthusiasts Great for every day use This bag may last a week or it may service me for years Either way it was a great deal Besides Jack Bauer uses one just like it 
Don t be fooled This is an ok bag but the Heavyweight Canvas is a very loose weave that is to say it wont hold back anything stronger than a light fog and wont suffer much abuse The lining is 3rd rate thinner than paper nylon In short a good bag if you are buying for fashion a poor choice if you are actually going to use it Look out for inflated shipping costs 
Great bag you ll love it I just got this bag and love it It s not too big but enough to be able put a laptop and a couple notebooks or textbooks Should last a long time 
good quality great customer service the hat is very high quality fits my head perfectly the fabric is very comfortable and retains shape well will not stretch at all i had some qualms about shipping but the seller was very quick to reimburse me 101 satisfied with this order and will most definetly purchase from him again 
Love these pants These are very comfy soft and warm puma athletic pants The bright pinkish color may not be for everyone it is a hard color to match but I love them too much for that to matter 
Great value for your buck I bought it for my girlfriend on sale for 80 It lives up to promise Practical and beautiful One small discrepancy with the description The color is not red but very dark light brown 
just purchased i received my camo shirt recently i like the material and how it feels i normally wear a small but went with a large i would recommend a medium if you wear a small the shirt was a little longer than i like but i purchase another one 
cooler bag This was just like they said it would be and it came in faster then what they had told me it would I am very pleased with it 
XXL is no good These shirts are short and wide leaving more room then needed but too short These shirts are not like the ones i ordered last year Very disappointed seems like the maufactured location changed and decreased quality 
bad fit I bought these shirts black medium to wear on a daily basis and I am disappointed First off they don t fit like the old CK crew necks they are in fact shorter and the waist is wider The length isn t bad it s the waist width that is too large and makes the shirt ill fitting I have an average body type After just a few washings some of the stitching started coming undone and there were loose strands on the inner parts of the shirts I m continually trimming these loose ends Although that didn t affect the way these shirts fit I would expect better stitching from CK I do wear the shirts under sweaters or jackets but I feel awkward wearing them on their own as outerwear due to the fit I don t recommend these shirts I d rather pay more for American Apparel or Banana Republic 
Not much to say Pretty standard t shirts I like the feel they re very comfortable Seem well made too 
my uniform Best cut t shirt for me I like it many times more than American Apparel Hanes FOTL 
Great Shorts All my men love these shorts They love the pocket placement and the fit Great for any outdoor activity or casual wear For those who like a long inseam these may be too short 
Adidas Adissage Outstanding The product is excellent The shipping was excellent No problems with this purchase 
silk better than satin I bought this pair of silk sleep pants and another pair of satin sleep pants Although both were fine the silk is superior in comfort and worth the difference in price 
Nice material but that s about it I had got these for my husband for christmas Nice material however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height so we had to return it 
Great but tappered ankle These pants are nice quality and nice flowy through leg but they tapered at the ankle more than I wanted 
Nice Pants My husband really likes the Intimo Men s Classic Silk Pants They are very comfortable and the color is really nice He wears them almost every day The only complaint that we had is that the pants are a little bit short in length 
Luxury for a steal I must say I was very impressed with this item I recently wore these silk pants with a smoking jacket on a cruise ship They were very comfortable they look and feel wonderful and are worth far more than the price Another hit I don t know how these folks do it but Intimo s prices are amazing I would highly recommend these silk lounge pants 
Comfortable Durable I m very pleased with the comfort and design and appearant durability I just wish it would get colder and stay cold long enough in Arizona to wear them more often 
Great Silk Pants Except Great Silk Pants Except My Husband wears a Size Large Pants in everything and with these pants I wish i would of ordered an Extra Large they are a little short on him Looks like he s waiting for a flood I ordered the Burgandy and Blue and the colors are so Deep and Rich Very Nice They wash nice also 
mens silk pajama pants these pajama bottom pants are true to size and well constructed they fit comfortably and wear well being machine washable is a real benefit as well 
COW SOCKS ARE HARD TO FIND And this is perfect for my best friend she loves cows and she loved me when i gave it to her 
Quite Pleased The shawl I received showed good craftsmanship and was made of a soft and thin material suitable to wear as a shawl to a spring or summer outdoor event The pattern in the black section has delicate roses that are very elegant 
very pretty Well made quite lightweight but just the perfect thing for summer when you want to keep a breeze off you or are going somewhere air conditioned Would be good doubled over in the winter under a coat too k112 by the same maker is essentially the same piece in a very yellow green color with black trim it s very pretty too if you like that color I d get it again 
Great item This is a nice large pashmina it is lightweight but very warm The good thing about this one is the great price and quality 
A Chair is a Chair This stadium cushion is easy to carry it folds and snaps closed is very lightweight and looks great however if you are larger than about a 34 rear you are not going to be comfortable in it the cushion is smaller than most and the straps on the sides guarantee only smaller people will fit 
Holy Cow I am so pleased with the pair of white Fast Approaches that I bought I m back to buy the black pair I d agree to go up a half size from your usual sneaker if you want a comfortable fit I liked the cushion and have added a dr scholls massaging insole holy cow They re washable Don t worry about spilling red wine on these puppies they wipe clean with water and a napkin I recommend these shoes for their style and comfort Just yesterday I felt like a traveling shoe salesman which I am not 
very comfortable Well made and comfortable Rockports seem to run about half a size small though so I would recommend ordering a half size large than normal especially if you intend to wear the shoes with socks 
Great Driving Shoe but not a Great Slipper The heel is kind of narrow due to its design as a driving shoe Because of this the shoe is a bit unstable for my liking It s very comfortable while I m sitting at my desk working and also great when driving but if you re thinking about using this as an around the house slipper as I was you should look elsewhere 
comfort plus Wow these are the most comfortable pair of loafers I ve ever owned With a really flexible sole and decent stiffness in the arch they feel closer to slippers than shoes but have enough support for an evening out or a trip to the mall I really like the look too I m thinking about buying a brown pair now to replace my Rockport boat shoes because these are actually much more comfortable I take a size 12 in most brands and athletic shoes and size 12 fits perfectly here too 
A great shoe for my warped feet This is the fourth pair of shoes in this style I have purchased over the years Each pair has gone from good casual to everyday casual to gardening shoes before they started to fall apart or the tread got too slick to be safe It is the only sports shoe I have found that I can wear comfortably because I have really messed up feet I really like the speed lacing feature too I hope they never stop making this one because I just love it 
The most comfortable ever I am not a fan of my underwear holding up my bum or my hips I am a fan of not feeling my underwear at all These are perfect They do not show under evern the finest fabrics I bought some last year and am back for more I ve thrown out all of my other underwear 
Calvin Klein Genuine Leather Front Pocket Money Clip I received the money clip which was advertised to be in a really nice box The money clip was less than what was described AND the display box was damaged with a huge nick in the top I returned the money clip and the company assured me they would send a replacement that was not damaged The second replacement item was just as bad if not worse than the first The company simply packages their items in a padded envelope which obviously doesn t protect the items from damage Will never buy from them again and suggest Amazon customers not use the company either 
Paid for the name I bought this as a Christmas gift for my fianc� I looked all over for a money clip wallet that had an actual clip not just the magnetic clip So needless to say I was thrilled when I found this one online After my fianc� opened it up he put his money in the clip The clip is located in the middle of the wallet so you have to get creative and fold your money more than just in half After using it for a few weeks the pin in the clip fell out He was able to fix it but I would not be comfortable carrying money around in a faulty clip 
Great Card Holder I m really pleased with this card holder wallet It is just what I ve been looking for It is nice and thin so it fits easily in my bag It organizes 20+ cards and has room to store extra behind each side It is nice quality and a great price Very pleased with my purchase 
Leather Credit Card Wallet I loved this product from the day I received it It was everything everyone said it was Soft leather that will eventually stretch to hold all your credit cards comfortably At the beginning it s hard to get the cards out individually when needed however the leather will stretch to make it easier I love this wallet because I have a lot of cards and never found a wallet that could hold all my cards The leather is baby soft and fits my purse perfectly I would recommend to anyone looking for a wallet to hold many cards whether they are credit cards id cards insurance cards etc 
studied them all and this is the one It took an enormous amount of time to find a credit card holder that would be useful to me Most are very limiting I couldn t be more pleased with my purchase it s quality and it s price I really can t toot my horn over my purchase loud enough 
Excellent product This wallet is everything it is advertised to be There are card slots enough for my credit cards debit card library card insurance cards etc There is also room for cash and driver s license The quality is excellent I am very pleased with this wallet 
Fantastic Credit Card Holder This is a great compact credit card holder it s lightweight holds lots of cards and has extra pockets for cards that don t fit The cards fit snuggly so you don t have them slipping out in your purse Nice color too 
Just what my wife wanted We had been looking for weeks for a wallet card holder that would hold at least 20 cards This fit the bill to a tee 
Perfect wallet I purchased this wallet hoping to replace a very overstuffed small credit card holder I found this wallet to be slim and a perfect fit for my purse It is able to fit 20+ cards with ease and it still has a nice pocket behind the credit card slots for other papers that don t fit into the slots I plan on recommending this wallet to a friend who is holding her credit cards together with a rubber band 
good wallet to have the only thing missing is a coin purse 
Cute stylish boot This boot is a good casual boot for skirts dresses but runs a little big in the foot could size down from a 6 to 5 1 2 It also has a very narrow calf which was great for me but not for the average or larger sized calf woman The boot is cute but wish the toe was less rounded to give it a more fashionable appeal 
Suede Gloves Exactly if not more than what we expected Outstanding value Confident it will pass the test of time 
unique luggage tags make your luggage stand out these tags are so cute plus they are extra large and combined with the bright colors your luggage will really stand out I have black luggage and these tags work really well for me plus the price is hard to beat for getting an oversized tag with so many great colors to choose from I also recommend giving as a gift something people might need but wouldn t necessarily think to ask for and you will not find these in a store 
pb travel luggage tag I have purchased a few of these beautiful color luggage tags as gifts as well as for myself and have found them to be very a very welcomed gift they are practical as well as nice to look at 
No more need for a Bra This cami is absolutely wonderful It gives support and even my friends who have substantial breasts find that they no longer need to wear a bra I just wish that they made a summer version as it is not comfortable in high temperatures 
The best darn sweatpants I ever owned I really think sweat pants are only to be worn for the gym however I found these pants sooooo comfy that they have become my weekend lounge around the house pants That being said my wife is washing them quite frequently The previous review claims that there was significant shrinkage however running in a cold cycle wash with a perm press dry cycle has not caused any shrinkage for me I recommend these pants 100 
Looks good but I bought this specifically for the gym It really looked good and felt good at first but only to shrink about 4 inches after the first wash Now I am no longer able to wear it as it is just too short I was expecting a quality product but I guess I was wrong 
flattering I really like these pants They re comfortable and they minimize less than appealing body characteristics For a size reference I m a high 8 low 10 The medium size fits me very snugly and was a little tough to get over the hips but once on they are pretty comfortable So the medium is about a regular size 8 
pique polo shirt This is a well made shirt It fits kind of funny though You know one of those shirts that s wide but short The material is very durable and it doesn t shrink when washed Green and brown is so popular right now better get one before they go out of stock 
Comfy Crocs I have the pale pink ones and luv them I got butterfly Jibbitz for them Everyone wants a pair 
Comfort Even though it is now winter and quite cold I have been wearing the crocs to see how I liked them and believe me all they say about these shoes is true they are really comfortable and I am certain will be just the thing for summer wear I will probably buy more of them Signed Sally a very happy shopper 
I Love m I love my Cayman Crocs They were shipped quickly and in good shape The only problem is now I want more Crocs so I can have more colors I have to wear an orthotic insert in my other shoes so I can t usually wear sandles or clogs These are so comfortable I can wear them all day long without my inserts 
Great gift My husband got these for my mother She LOVES them She recently has needed PT and uses them where ever she goes now I have had 2 pairs now that I have lived Highly suggested 
Good customer service Item ordered was rcvd promptly I ordered the wrong size had to return the item and very quickly rcvd the correct size without being charged any additional shipping 
Awesome trunks These trunks are true to size and look great I wear them for swimming laps but imagine they would work just as well on the beach if you are looking for a shorter cut trunk 
so worth it the boots are so comfy and warm i live in canada and these boots kept my feet warm since i got it and as for the size i wear 7 5 usually and i debated so long which size i should get after reading others review and at the end i got 8 and it fit perfectly = 
Go Big After reading all of the reviews I decided to go up a size and a half and boy am I GLAD I usually wear a 7 5 or 8 and ordered a 9 and they are perfect Great traction in the snowy icy conditions I wear mine to and from skiing and they perform so much better than my old cheap shearling boots with zero traction They do get mighty warm but that s what they are for right 
Jacques Levine Women s 86971 Suede Shearling Boot Slipper The boots were very nice warm and extremely comfortable but not much on looks Also I followed the advice of reviewers before me and ordered a size bigger and they are too big So I would say they must be true to size 
LOVE THEM Got my boots this afternoon and I m in love with them I usually wear a 8 or 8 1 2 and ordered my boots in a size 9 and they fit snuggly So warm and comfy They come up just below my knee perfect size and fit 
Keeps my feet warm comfy Bought 8 pairs of Skechers just before Christmas when Amazon had a shoe sale and 20 off over 80 purchase Essesntially paid 11 each I like them all Gave a couple away as gifts Very comfortable and stylish Not a bulky look shoe sleak and slender on the feet 
SO CUTE SO CUTE MY BABY LOVE THIS JACKET WHEN I WOULD TAKE IT OF SHE WOULD GO AND PUT IT BAKE ON IT S TO CUTE I ALSO GOT THE JEANS THAT GOSE WITH IT THANKS TERR 
Clutch Handbag The clutch looked good in the picture but the quality was just ok 
Awesome for the price This acrylic scarf is so soft and so cute I bought it in black and wish that I had bought more colors I does say on the tag dry cleaned only but I washed it on cold and laid the scarf out to dry and its fine All I have to say is that its a great buy for the price 
They feel wonderfully soft and warm These are great for the price but I haven t tried to wash them yet so I don t know if I ll have the same problems as other reviewers I figure that if they don t wash well for the price I ll just throw them out and use another since I bought several just for this purpose after reading the reviews I ll have to put an addendum to this review once I ve used the scarf a little longer but so far I think they are lovely and definitely well worth the money 
Runway Women s Acrylic Ribbed Scarf Black Nice quality and price A really good value for the money 
Lovely This is a truly delightful scarf It s very soft and buttery lightweight and long The drape is incredible You can wear it just around your neck or drape it over your head first and it looks stunning Initially I got the winter lilac color which is actually magenta Very pretty color I loved it so much I bought the ivory black and cassis a dark burgundy This was a good thing because my six year old daughter cabbaged onto the first one Imagine that A scarf a child actually wants to wear I love this scarf so much I m going to buy the other colors I don t have yet We had a very cold windy winter this year and I wore one of these scarves every day They kept me warm without being oppressively heavy They also roll up into almost no space at all so they re ideal for travel or having in your bag just in case The scarf is 100 acrylic and the one drawback is that it s dry clean only I suspect handwashing would be okay though Even if you have to baby it a bit it s worth it for the exquisite texture I highly recommend this scarf 
Beautiful scarf This scarf is so soft and beautiful The picture does not give this scarf justice the colors are much more vibrant and the material is so ultra soft I gave this to my aunt for Christmas she loved it You cannot believe the quality for this price 
Great bag great customer service I got this bag from in Oct I gave it as a present in December The person I gave it to noticed a clasp was broken I emailed the company and the rep emailed me a return lable that day New product came on time no problem We re very happy with the bag It s modern and fits a 15 laptop easily 
Worse than what it looks like black red white Black is not black it has a dark brown reflex on it It does not look good on I have plenty of tees and this is the worst It looks bigger than what the label says For what you get this is pretty expensive I bought this from Foot locker I find shipping and handling prices ridiculously high when you buy only a t shirt Eastbay and some other sport apparel companies charge the same It is ridiculous Just do not buy 
Great slippers even if they are a little pricey These slippers are well worth it I bought my boyfriend a pair for X mas in black suede and then later just had to buy some for myself Mine have held up a little better than his I think mostly due to the fact that his are suede and mine are not But they are incredibly comfortable and warm 
Outstanding I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them They fit well and are comfortable 
Good quality Good quality but don t always stay under the back of my foot Also wear a bit quickly in the back 
Best in Class The most comfortable slippers I ve ever worn I m not kidding Perfect for staying at home or wearing at school Get them 
comfortable boot This boot looks good and is very comfortable to wear my only caveat is that it easily scuffs especially on the toe And you often have to apply shoe polish But other than that it s a terrific shoe 
Bandolino boots I am very pleased with my purchase of the Bandolino Women s Stela Ankle Boot The boots look and feel wonderful and though I paid very little for them the quality is apparent 
super cute and comfy I love these boots Just got them today and replaced my old boots on the spot doesn t require any break in fits like a glove from the start And the quality is very nice too considering the low price i paid definitely worth every single cent 
Very comfortable I stand on my feet all day I am very pleased with this purchase The comfort level is great 
I have happy feet I love these boots They are lightweight comfortable and look great I bought pairs for my daughters because I am so happy with mine had to get both brown and black As a teacher I am on my feet all day so comfort is even more important than style How nice to have both in these boots 
Bandolino a blessing for feet I am currently living in Vilnius Lithuania We have a Bandolino store next door to us Just by chance I ordered the boots on Amazon and had them sent to my U S address Now to the point They are great I wear size 8 1 2 but ordered size 9 since it is necessary to sock up The boots are beautiful and more importantly fit like a glove This is great since my feet have always hurt when I walked a block or two I intend to order more By the way the boots on sale next door cost 10 times the amount I paid Enjoy susa 
Jordan Belt Buckle This belt buckle was bought as a gift and he loves it It s a belt buckle and lighter it s pretty neat 
Nice comfortable socks These socks feel great and look great Not being a fan of men s socks that look opaque I was concerned that they would be too thin but I was presently proven wrong once I started wearing them I took off one star since I think they are priced at least 3 too much 
short brim this is a nice hat for women looking for short brims instead of the longer mens brims on most hats I own 2 of these and wear them everyday to keep my hair in control due to my Jeep window being down while I deliver mail Good fit 
dazzle tear away pant Very comfortable pants but a little long and I am 6ft Dark Indigo is VERY close to black 
Quality This robe is well constructed of substantial cotton fabric It is nice and comfortable to wear With moderate care gentle wash air dry I m sure it will last indefinitely 
Pleased This robe is everything that I was looking for perfect for the summer around the pool or hot tub My only reservation is I bought it for a man and I don t particularly like the satin ribbon sewn into the collar Other than that I especially like the color beige I do want one for myself 
Awesome product I bought one for my husband for Christmas He loves it It is light and airy Holds up great after washing I plan to get one for myself soon 
Fabulous Bathrobe The product description is accurate I bought it as a Christmas gift for my 80+ father for use in Tucson Arizona for his walk between his retirement unit and the pool He was delighted It s an excellent quality alternative to your heavy weight plush bath robe yet being cotton will absorb random drips I may need one myself 
Great as Always but LOSE THE DESIGNER SCENT I love jockey underwear I ve bought this brand for years because of the great fit the long wear and the fact that it s 100 cotton I love natural stuff I bought a pack recently and was dismayed to discover that Jockey has added a very overwhelming baby powder scent to the product what s the point of 100 cotton when you add chemicals to the fabric Repeated washings have not removed the smell I will have to dispose of the underwear I am extremely allergic to anything perfumed or scented MAYBE JOCKEY CAN LABEL THEIR PRODUCTS SCENTED OR UNSCENTED Regular bathing is a better alternative to scented underwear anyway 
Fantastic Clothing Under Armour is the greatest brand of workout gear I have seen in my day I work out for hours and hours at a time and these tee shirts i own four keep me cool and dry ready to keep on playing These shirts get my highest rating buy one today 
Great Customer Service The dress was gorgeous when I received it however there was a slight defect with the item I had planned to wear it on my birthday so there was no time to exchange PacificPlex was quick at issuing me a refund I will continue to refer people to them and buy items from their company 
Absolutely gorgeous This dress was purchased for a formal high school graduation It is absolutely stunning The dress fit true to size a medium fit a size 7 perfectly Beautiful layers of mesh create a fairy tale illusion I am VERY pleased with this dress 
BAD QUALITY IF YOU HAVE EVER WORN A REAL BOWLING SHIRT YOU WILL NOT RECOGNIZE THIS SHIRT IT IS THIN CHEAP MATERIAL AND WORKMANSHIP GRAPHICS ARE THE SAM 
Love Stride Rite Shoes Shoes are great My little guy can dress up or wear them to the beach 
Great sandals These sandals are terrific for our 18 month old Easy on and off and our son doesn t mess around with the side velcro closures The leather is very nice and soft but sturdy The soles are also rugged I ll be getting these again in the next size up 
great value These tights were twice the price at my local dance supply store Great quality at a great price 
newboy cap great cap stays in place on your head even with the top down on the car 
A nice mid range cap toe I just bought these for a song on Amazon Now I wear an 11 narrow so I only paid 59 bucks for these and this fact does affect my review I sold shoes for several years and learned what good shoes are and where they come from Generally Italian shoes are a safe bet but I tend to buy Swedish Spanish or Brazilian because of the uniform quality Let me tell you Brazilian leather is some of the finest and rivals Spanish leather These shoes arrived and I wore them to work the next day I chose the CHILI color which didn t disappoint right out of the box Mimimal soreness which is a good sign and also very light creasing on the uppers which made me happy A minor gripe which is not aimed solely at Bostonian but does anyone welt their shoes anymore Welting is usually the surest sign of quality and easy to discern Welting is simply sewing through the sole of the shoe It is faked often so beware of rubber welting The heel is stacked on this shoe and it seems a good laminate job Stacking adds stability and oomph to a heel so always go for it when you can The leathers on this shoe are very good for the price and display a nice patina and richness Not quite top notch shoe leather but above average for this range The stitching is very nice with no defects on either shoe The overall profile of this shoe is handsome and sleek just the way I like my oxfords The finish is rich and deep I received several compliments on them around the office which always helps All in all I have more expensive brown oxfords in my closet but these babies are just as comfortable and attractive not to mention cheaper A good solid work shoe 
Great size Great size easy to handle Will look for this product again when this one wears out Fast delivery 
Great lunch box Great size easy to handle Will look for this product again when this one wears out 
Great size for lunches Very pleased with this product it is not too big and not too small perfect for totting lunches 
Sexy and pretty comfy Would have given 5 but I normally wear a 36 C and the 36 dimension seems slightly smaller 
I Love This Bra This is the most comfortable bra I ever wore It fits perfectly provides excellent support for my breasts and still allows maximum exposure of my breasts 36C with just a hint of nipple exposure on the top The lace is soft and comfortable and allows more than a hint of my nipples to show through any top I wear I cannot recommend or say enough about it if you are not a prude and you like sexy underwear this is the bra for you 
Very sexy These are very nice I bought for the wife she likes the way I look in them 
Fantastic The name doesn t lie it feels like you re wearing next to nothing The fabric feels so good on the skin it is incredible Once you get moving you ll forget you even have them on This is how all boxer briefs should be It fits right to your body and the only fabric inbetween the front and back is what s needed to hold your stuff 
The most comfortable underwear I own Soft silky and stretchy I just love wearing these They are the most comfortable underwear I own and they fit perfectly I can t wait for more of my old underwear to wear out so I can replace them with these 
Silky Awesome These boxers really are better than wearing nothing at all The spandex stretch is enough to act as a waistband without the nuisance of elastic They are semi sheer but not enough to reveal much 
Wonderful Product I had been searching everywhere for the perfect pair of flip flops and I finally found them I recieved them in record time and they are awesome I would absolutely shop with them again Thank you guys 
So comfy I just got these the other day and they re so soft and comfy The material is velvety and feels so nice on your feet They re the perfect sandal And the perfect price 
Best baby towel out there This towel is one of the best I ve found It is thick and very soft and it is nice and large Some of the other baby towels are quite thin Washes well too A great buy 
I love it This sock is really comfortable to wear I bought a 3 pack and allways wear them when they re out of the washing machine I m going to buy more of these no doubt The sock is pretty thin for a normal sock wich makes it breathe yet a little thicker at the top wich is also good since it works as a cushion against some uncomfortable shoes 
Very Pleased The sash I bought was beautiful and just as described Fast shipping too 
Reversible Long Raincoat This item did everything we wanted It was waterproof covered the knees kept them dry and reached over the top of boots Complete with hood it kept my son dry while working in rainy weather It was better than anything we had expected to find 
Super soft and comfortable These cargos are by far my favorites out of about four styles I own They re pre washed super soft and not too long for me I m about 5 7 so many shorts styles are too long I like the cargos for the extra pockets but the best feature is they feel broken in and easy to wash dry and wear 
Soft cotton great fit And they have a nice appearance too The price is quite reasonable for such a quality product 
DKNY tank top cotton camisole Bare Necessities I have lymphedema and need to wear an undershirt type garment daily to keep a bit of pressure on my back and underarm area I had been purchasing a combination softbra tank top for that was very uncomfortable and the bra was unneccessary I ve searched high and low for a product that would work for me I was SO happy when my DKNY tank top arrived Even before I washed it the garment is SO incredibly soft Sizing is generous I would normally buy an XL but with this will buy a L This is the first day I have worn it and I am already online to purchase more The price of is almost unheard of for such a quality garment I can t express how HAPPY I am to have found this clothing Shipping was quick and I am one happy gal 
Great shirt This shirt is just great in hot weather It wicks away perspiration wonderfully It also washes just fine and doesn t wrinkle or shrink 
fantastic Light and breathy good for people like me who sweat a lot when play balls I hate cotton 
Feels as sexy as it looks One of my hubby s favorites the mesh fabric is great for hot weather feels nice to the touch too 
Dopp front Pocket Getaway Wallet Best Wallet I ve ever owned Keeps everything I need to carry organized I like the idea of front pocket wallets This one fits just right and is easy to get to when you need it 
Almost Perfect This wallet is almost perfect Great quality Thin carries 3 credit cards + storage for more A little bit of cash and a receipt or two Only thing that could be improved is the width Seems to me like its wider than it needs to be which makes sliding into and out of pocket harder than it could be Almost perfect but not quite 
Nice It s not the best I ve had but it s good I wouldn t call it a front pocket wallet It feels a bit bulky 
Keep your valuables safe A great travel wallet lots of room for cash cards and travel documents A great buy 
cool wallet I bought this wallet thinking it was smaller but anyhoo its a great carry all for everything very well put together and toug 
Very functional and a neat looking travel wallet This is the third travel wallet which I am buying and did not want to make any mistakes that too when I am spending 30 I do some international travel and a travel wallet becomes very much necessary to carry my passport air tickets itinerary Why would I reccomend this travel wallet Size Many of the travel wallets in the market do not completely fit in a air ticket this one does withouth folding the air tickets boarding pass Zippers The previous travels wallets that I owned did not have any zippers I have had incidence where my boarding pass had falled off and I did not even realize Zippers are a must when you are carrying documents Ofcourse it does make it painful to open them everytime But hey which one would you prefer losing your documents are a fews seconds to open the zippers PVC backing The wallet comes with a firm PVC backing so that it does not bend easily and wrinkle you documents Good looks and styling With a swiss army logo and good quality material people are sure to notice what you are carrying The wallet does not have to be made in leather still its looks are very decent Where the travel wallet loses a star I wish if there was another dividing compartment in the wallet 
Love Steve Madden Shoes I ve been waiting for this shoe to go on sale for a long time I couldn t decide which color to buy These are sexy and comfortable 
Great shoes I love these shoes They match anything and can be casual or dressy depending on what you wear with them My only concern is that the glue on the knot part is coming undone becuase I wear them so frequently I stopped in the store where I bought them and they do not think the straps will break and if they do it is easy to fix 
COMFY THONG SANDALS WHEN IS TRIED THESE SANDALS ON THEY FIT PERFECTLY TRUE TO SIZE THE STRAP BETWEEN THE TOES FELT KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE I DON T USUALLY WEAR THONGS OF ANY KIND AFTER WEARING THEM FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS THE LEATHER WAS STRETCHING AND I FELT VERY COMFORTABLE THEY LOOK GREAT CASUAL OR DRESSY 
CHIC and Elegant I got these shoes recently they are very stylish Leather adds an elegant look Shoes are well padded hence are very comfortabl 
pants the pants fit well I also purchased two size med for women One was too large and is being exchanged The other fit the woman great I like the quality and price The service from Code Four is great Thank 
Beautiful This shoe is beautiful sexy and confortable The sizing is very true i got my normal size and it fit perfectly though I do have slender feet so a person with wider feet might need a 1 2 size bigger I will be trying more from his brand 
Quality Warm Excellent The glove material is high quality well insulated and well assembled I m sure the gloves will last me a long time and I ll want to wear them a long time 
very good but picture misleading very good quality pants look awesome But they have frontal and back kinda permanent creases that dont appear in the picture so it s not exactly what I had in min 
Khaki Pant from Kenneth Cole Very happy with the purchase The pant is exactly what I was looking for Remarkable comfort 
Overall GOOD Nothing bad to say the item i orderd was the item i recieved and it arrived on time 
Great Bags I purchased the bags for myself and my bridesmaids as part of my gift to them I had done a lot of research to try and find a bag that was low in price but at the same time good in quality This bag is perfect You would think for a bag priced so low it would look or feel cheap well that s not the case My one and only complaint would be the shipping and handling I think that could be lowered but I guess it s worth it because I ended up saving some money in the end 
very pleased I bought 4 pink and white totes as bridesmaids gifts I love the price of the totes but hated the shipping cost since it was about the same I got the bags monogram and I am very happy with how they came out I can t wait to give the gifts to the girls 
Tote bags for wedding guests We purchased these bags to give to the wedding guests coming to our sons destination wedding I was extremely pleased at their quality size and design We hope the guests will use them as shopping or beach bags during their stay and then have a nice keepsake from the wedding The size was ideal for both uses The colors were vibrant and the workmanship great They came individually wrapped and in a very timely matter I purchased a few extra and have used one to carry my maps and book on a driving trip 
Great for the Price First I ordered one of these to make sure the quality and size was what I wanted I was quite surprised that it was good quality durable Prompt on shipping and communication which is always a plus I am getting married in Hawaii and ended up ordering a bunch of these totes to make gift tote baskets to give my guests that are attending I have also ordered some soft 6 pack beverage coolers very pleased as as well 
Poof knit jeans This is an awesome product so comfortable I am usually size medium so my complaint is they fit small for teenagers I am in my 40 s so that s not too bad the large fit me at 133lbs I have had lots of compliments already the only other complaint is they are not available to be shipped to Canada I had to get a friend across the border to receive them for me good thing we live close to the border 
nylon jogging pants they fit like I would expect a size medium to fit so I was satisfied I will definitely buy the Badger brand again I was only disappointed because it is not sold in retail outlets 
Great shoe I love these sandals and now own two pair of them With a larger foot for a woman these fit perfectly They are comfortable and wear great One pair endures the lake and one is for wearing EVERYwhere Would recommend to anyone 
Thermal underwear These long underwear are very warm They are two layers and yet aren t too bulky They can be worn under regular pants with no problems They didn t appear to shrink much after washing like most thermals do 
Great dress for great figures I absolutely love this dress If you don t mind showing off your figure a little this dress is for you Its classy yet casual and comfy I m definitely planning on getting it in multiple colors 
Two Thumbs UP As an African American with curves this dress is amazing and worth every penny Fits just right but not tight Definitely would purchase again in a different color 
Love it This little dress is SO cute Yes it is form fitting and the skirt hits just below mid thigh But I wanted form fitting and short so I got my normal size Fits NICE One thing I liked most about this dress is that the waist is tailored It isn t one of those straight line feed sack dresses If you want to hide something this isn t the dress If you want to show something off in a respectable sort of way This IS the dress I love it I got the charcoal first and was so tickled I went back and got the navy The colors are wonderful 
Cute I needed a casual summer dress this looked cute and it is but it is very form fitting if you d like a little room in the dress go a size larger The shipment with this company is very fast and very reliable 
confortable and very fashionable this brief has a very fashionable appeal without leaving the confort aside I m very pleased with it 
Great looks and wears just as well This brief is much like the 2 x ist Contrast No Show Brief 3120C in that it is the same colors price at review time and materials The main difference is the stitching on the pouch and the cut This coutour pouch brief is meant to like most 2 x ist underwear show off your male assets I think this one does that effectively by using the pouch and the dramatic contrast lines I ordered the black and white to make a real impact and trust me it does The fit is great there is enough room for everything and although it is cotton it stretches and shapes to my body just as well as the synthetic materials on the 2 x ist X Factor Countour Pouch Brief 7403 do see my review on that product page as well I would suggest that brief as well but you will lose out on the sexy contrast lines If you seem to like this brief may I suggest you shake things up a little a consider ordering the 2 x ist Contrast No Show Trunk 3133C The contour lines around the pouch have the effect of shining a spotlight on your assets while the lower rise means you can wear some of your more fashionable jeans with them I ordered the 3133C also and will review it as soon as it arrives 
Nightgown is fine accessories have problems We ordered the nightgown in a size 6 for my 4 1 2 year old daughter She s a bit on the tall side and we wanted the nightgown to last a while The nightgown itself has no problems the contstruction seems sturdy no visible flaws and good printing even if it is a little on the darker side And as she claims Ariel is my favorite princess so there was no way it wasn t going to be a hit with her The slippers that came with the nightgown were too small for a size 6 They didn t even fit my three year old who wears a size 8 I m guessing these slippers are around a size 6 I would have thought that they would have sized the slippers to the size of the nightgown but now I suspect they make them one size fits all aka one size too small Besides being too small there is nothing to pull up over the heel so they constantly slip off the foot They were discarded after 15 minutes when my two daughters realized they looked like more fun than they actually were The tiarra is obviously cheaply made We weren t expecting any more than that My 4 1 2 year old left it on the ground the first evening she got it and accidentally stepped on it breaking it cleanly in half Honestly I was relieved I could get rid of it that quickly I m giving the product 4 stars because what we were really buying was the nightgown The lack of 5 stars is due to the poor construction and sizing of the slippers they could have done a better job The tiarra is a non issue to us 
These were great These were great arrived in a timely fashion and were just like they were shown to be on the site 
Casual useful flattering My title should be pretty self explanatory It s simple casual you dont feel too overdressed or self conscious with gaudy designs Its useful Its good for chilly windy weather but also nice to throw on for just a slightly chilly but otherwise sunny day Its flattering Its a pretty good fit 
Very Satisfied The boots were a Christmas gift for my Sister and she loves them the color the style and they are comfortable too I was pleased with the entire transaction I think I need to get a pair of these boots 
Great shoes Lifestride makes such a smart and comfortable dress shoe The heel on this and similar styles is wider than on other brands so there s no balancing act required to walk in these Wear easy throughout the day and look sharp 
Gaiam Yoga Strap I can t think of a better tool in my yoga practice 
Carharrt Socks Review My husband loves them They keep his feet warm while also keeping them from sweating 
5 star hester jersey The jersey arrived very quickly and was perfect I was very satisfied with Amazon 
Nice Very nice and soft I think this is great if you do not know if you are having a boy or a girl 
ladies gloves Product is as described good quality Gloves are not lined therefore are not as warm as hoped for 
Lovely I gave this pajama as a gift The snow bears are cute Is good for the whole year 
You get what you pay for It is a very cute purse but it is a lot smaller than I expected still my teenage child liked it very much Just something to put a couple of bucks in an ID and go 
I love this bag I read other people s reviews before ordering this little bag I sniffed it when it arrived and it does have a certain odor to it After smelling it I believe it to smell alot like some of the clothes that arrive packaged from overseas etc I was told at the last clothing store I worked in that the smell is from a spray that is used to kill any insects that like to eat the material used for clothing purses and the like I do not find it offensive at all and the smell does disappear overnight The bag is adorable and very chic 
Just right Well until I read the review below I d have never have noticed but yes there is an odor to the bag Although in all honesty my wife and I aren t really big bag sniffers so we never got wind of this We aren t much in the habit of sniffing bags shoes etc Perhaps we are missing out I don t know So maybe for kids who are just sniffing bags and licking this and that this isn t the right bag But for the wife it was perfect It s a great price very nice looking and they got it shipped out to us lickety split I think if you spend 25 or more shipping is even free we love the free shipping I ve not been a big shopper of those in the Amazon shops This was a great experience however so we ll surely give it a go again 
Gorgeous I go this for my girl friend and she loved it It has a very nice design and looks very elegant It was a steal at this price 
Cool coin purse very sharp looking I got this last week and I am happy with the purchase I think it is a good value for the price and looks pretty good 
My FAVORITE Baby Item I bought these bodysuits in all colors and sizes for my baby She s lived in them from the day she came home from the hospital They re so soft they go with everything the colors are gorgeous My only complaint is that they only go up to 6 months If I could dress her in them till 12 months that would be perfect I m so in love with the bodysuit And there was nothing to pull over her head which is good for me and for her Adorable soft easy to wear You won t go wrong with these 
I love them For years I have only worn this type of Reebok sneaker When I switched to a different brand that were not high tops I started having back and knee problems Since finding them again my back is clearing up I love these shoes and have at least 2 pairs Black and White 
Total Comfort These shoes feel so great They are true to size Great for all around use 
My Reebok s These are my favorite kind of sneaker to wear They came to me un blemished and promptly The shoes are comfortable and long lasting 
The Search for Comfort I have rheumatoid arthritis and my feet give me a lot of trouble I have worn these shoes for 14 years for maximum comfort but when a pair wears out they are really hard to find in the stores not to mention being expensive I was delighted to find them on Amazon new my size at a reasonable price and not to have to leave the house to get them 
Great Product Extremely comfortable and great looking However the left side is more comfortable than the right Nonetheless it is a great shoe 
LifeStride Women s Jury Shoe The shoe is very comfortable and fits me well I have wide feet and got it in a wide size and I am very pleased with it It is a casual look and I got it in the Rich Brown The material is a sueded type and it is a dark brown or as the description said a rich brown 
At last These are by far the most comfortable underwear I ve found since Fruit of the Loom went out of business 
Very Cute I really like these shoes I have the Orange one and i have recieved so many compliments on them The rounded toe makes my feet look cute and there is no toe cleavage which is difficult to find in a shoe like this The back of my heels are a little raw from where the shoe cuts in but its worth it 
Very cute and comfortable I wore these today and already got compliments on these Very comfortable and chic FIVE stars 
Cute and comfy Just received these shoes and they are everything I hoped they d be Super cute fun very comfy and they go with just about everything They rub very slightly on the back of my ankle but then again I haven t been wearing footies but if I did I m sure that wouldn t happen I think they just need to be broken in a bit I ve gotten quite a few compliments on them already Highly recommended 
Finally long enough shorts These are great My 16 yr old son is 6 3 and it s impossible to find shorts that come to or below the knee Finally these actually come nicely below the knee They also have a small band on each side to cinch in or let out to get extra wear out of them as he grows Thank you Captain Dave 
great product great service I ordered a pair of shorts they fit exactly how I wanted them to and they were here in no time 
Nice Cover I like the case it is very protective I like the protective screen I do not like the belt clip or stand both are a little flimsy and come easil 
It serves its puropse Well what can I say This package serves its purpose but for 9 95 you can t really expect alot else The skin cover is great keeps the Zen Vision safe no question but everything else is low quality The screen protector is almost impossible to apply properly the arm band would be great if the view stand wasn t permanently attatched and therefore cutting into your arm every time you use it I haven t used the belt clip yet but it doesn t look out of the ordinary so I m sure its fine If you are looking primarily for a skin cover do yourself a favor and just buy that and pick up another brand of accessories 
Simple effective clever This is an excellent little case it won t save your Zen if you drop it down the stairs or from a height but it will cushion and protect it through normal use especially the screen The built in stand is clever if a little flimsy The armband well it s functional but I wouldn t suggest using it for running a marathon I d recommend buying a smaller cheaper MP3 player for running anyway All in all this case is an excellent buy I d recommend it to everyone who buys a Zen it s the case Creative should have included 
Love the protector could do without the rest The protective skin is perfect It fit over the device without any problem and it has already provided good protection to the screen and body of my zen As a comparison my cell phone which I ve carried in my pocket for the last two years looks like it s been run over by a car I think with this skin the zen will hold up better The screen protector is a nice touch The armband is not something I use with a device this hefty The belt clip is suspect it s too flimsy for me to use and feel confident with But the skin allows me to put the zen right in my pocket without digging out a protective bag or other cover The skin alone is worth the cost 
Best bundle by far Well after using my Creative Zen naked with no covering at all with the other popular leather cover and with this sillicon cover package I can honestly say that considering the price and what s included in this package this is by far the best route to go when picking a case for your own Zen The other main case the leather one looks nice but for around 30 I expect a little more functionality This cover is a few dollars cheaper and for that I would only expect a cover as is included with the leather one But when you take into account the screen protector that s included and which costs 15 by itself from other places the stand on the back which is granted mildly weak but look at what it s holding up if you watch your share of videos and movies on your Zen as I do the back stand comes in very handy and the other things I would expect it to be more So don t let the cheap price deter you from getting this one as it almost did me thinking that it s poor quality The sillicon tends to attract dust and lint but it wipes or blows away easily and is really the only thing that comes close to a downside Get this case You won t regret it 
Oh my gosh I had no idea you could wear shoes so comfortable I am almost 50 and had never had that happened to me The top part of my feet is too high and my arches are too big Even though I tried to choose my shoes carefully but most of the time there is a problem with them These shoes felt good from the get go and they are not a problem for my feet which is incredible I feel like I am walking on air I need to buy more I need to buy them all because I think this is what I am going to wear for the rest of my life I also want to be buried in crocs They are roomy and comfortable and yet not loose They are extremely light and I can wear them with the back strap or not If you have feet like mine you are probably going to love them 
Love these shoes I bought them as a replacement for my Birkenstock clogs and I rarely have worn anything else They not be very attractive but they make up for it with comfort I recently ordered a pair of Endeavors no holes for winter weather which seems to finally have arrived in my area and I know that I ll be wearing them as often My only recommendation for others is to buy them a size larger especially if you are going to wear them with socks 
Better Than I Imagined As soon as I slipped on my Crocs I could immediately tell these were special footwear I have wide feet but ordered a size smaller than my usual and the fit is fine The Crocs are featherweight and this is definitely a plus Also the holes in their design is beneficial to help my feet breathe The material is good that it does not mark my kitchen floor too The only downside is that even cleaning Crocs by submerging them in hot soapy water has not cleaned the insole I even tried an ammonia water solution and that did not rid the insole of wax Other than that I m very happy with my Crocs 
Kids review crocs are very comfy and are great for walking and for wareing to the beach I ware mine everyday they are very useful because u can just slide them on or u can put the strap on and run in them and they wont come off 
Perfect play sandal I bought these sandals so my 2 yr old daughter could wear them in water such as running through the spinkler or at the splash mat at the park and they re perfect for this and everyday wear They must be comfortable because my daughter asks to wear them all the time and they look so adorable on She gets lots of compliments on them It s easy to adjust all three straps for a perfext fit They dry fast and stay looking clean I thought I wouldn t like the the gray sole at first but it looks really good It looks more feminine than the black sole on Tevas and stays cleaner looking than a white sole You and your kid will love these sandals 
love these my son loves these wears them all the time looks so cute in the 
quality costume This costume is made of quality fabric and my kid is wearing it as a jacket this winter 
Buyer beware company is a total rip off minus 5 stars I ordered their leather fanny pack in the rainbow color combination What came bears no relationship to any rainbow I have ever seen It is red brown black and cream Also beware the return policy it is minus the orginal shipping Plus a 4 95 restocking charge Plus your own cost of return shipping Amazing This is the worst deal I have every experienced at Amazon Do not buy from this company 
Wow was I surprised at the size and quality of this bag This fanny pack was ordered out of curiosity The price was so low I just couldn t believe it To my great pleasure and surprise not only was the pack a proper size but the look of the leather both in color softness was excellent The stitching was done well also Unless you want a very large fanny pack I can t see how you could go wrong with this purchase 
Love The Shoes Shoes are very comfortable and classy I could not have been more pleased I purchased a pair in the dept store and loved them so much I ordered them in 4 more colors off of amazon com 
The baddest trunks out there These are great they re comfortable and great for showing off Definitely buying some more pairs 
Great briefs These briefs are very comfortable and flattering to your form It s about time designers started focusing on what makes men look good under their pants 
Michael s review Comfortable stylish elegant and very sexy Also washes well and keeps its good looks The fabric feels wonderful against the skin 
I agree with Will Scorchingly Hot These Trunks are amazing they fit well in every spot I thought they were a little small at first when I opened the box but they fit perfectly I don t know how they do it at 2xist Gotta get these You won t be sorry 
Scortchingly Hot Even though this item is currently backordered do yourself or your man a favor and order them now Do not miss this great price Like the photo implies and like most 2 x ist men s products this underwear is sexy comfortable flattering and made of quality materials What drew me to this particular pair was the bold graphic statement it makes with the contrast specifically around the pouch area Believe me it is truly a pouch A big one Its actually just the right size for me and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it filling it The contrast lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas so its really nice Of course the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this no show I had no problem with this being no show wearing my lowest rising jeans with it Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants For me this trunk was not uncomfortable given its diminished size and intent to be no show Granted in those moments of excitement things do get a little more eh crowded But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief boxerbrief trunk This pair is made of 100 cotton so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X Factor line may enjoy this feature My only complaint is that the leg openings also contrast do not cling to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon etc But that is just minor The waistband is as always a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height in keeping with the no show design I cannot reccommend this trunk enough and within hours it became my favorite 2 x ist product in my collection 
ordering heelys online Although I would never wear these my old bones could not take the fall my grandaughter is crazy about them I searched every mall in Pa N J Delaware going crazy for the size color she wanted I ended up finding them on line Amazon I could have saved alot of aggravation gas looking there first The quality of these versatile sneakers skates is top notch and I am very happy with my purchase 
6 year old loves them these were the only thing our 6 y o asked santa to bring her and although she didnt quite get how to heely at first she now gets better on them every day she loves the 
not as good as what I expected but it is still a good choice Positive pretty light not heavy feel comfortable and smooth Negative still might be foggy at some point but not often 
Perfect fit Everyone has different eyes but these fit me when no other goggles did Love em 
Perfect Wallet for checkbook credit cards This is a perfect wallet for the woman who just wants to cut down in the confusion in her purse when she is reaching for her credit cards and checkbook The wallet has 15 credit card slots and you can carry more if you double up and a window for your driver s license conveniently located on the checkbook flap The zippered compartment is wide and has two big open pockets for your bills and papers a credit card holder that s part of the 15 counted and a center zippered compartment I am on my second Big Fat Wallet It is the only wallet that fits all my stuff I can go to the ATM and immediately put my cash in this wallet and zipper it up I don t have to fumble trying to stuff it into slim pockets like other wallets I have owned The new edition which is the one pictured here has an extra fastener so it can accomodate your wallet s growth and stay closed It also has a pocket under the front flap The only complaint is that the ID window that you could pull out out from the back pocket and then have it pop back doesn t do that anymore Instead of a elastic band that attached the window to the wallet Mundi substituted a plastic fastner like the kind that stores use to hang price tags on clothes All in all for a leather wallet at this low price you can t go wrong Yes the leather isn t glove soft or for that matter a high quality leather but I d rather not have a flashy expensive wallet Let s save those bucks for shopping 
Bustier was a success The product was received in a timely manner and was as expected 
Leather backpack at a bargain price Nicely designed and assembled this backpack is a great buy Everything works The leather is good quality looks like calf It is comfortable to wear on the back but also has a top strap to carry in one hand That strap and the part of the armband that adjusts are an ordinary sort of nylon strap I would have preferred all leather but for this price under 30 it is a quibbling point Inside are places for your wallet cell PDA lipstick etc On a brief shopping sortie it may carry home all your purchases of small things and make you look good while doing it After all most people use those cheap nylon backpacks with the garish colors or black Yuk so you will stand out as having some class Note that it is best to think of this as the equivalent of a large handbag rather than a backpack large enough for an extended camping trip Look closely at the description of the dimentions You don t want to be like another reviewer who thought it would be bigger I feel I really got my money s worth on this It ships from the West Coast so expect a week or ten days to the East 
Cute and comfy This was cuter than the picture and VERY comfy I was extremely pleased 
hello kitty cami I really like hellokitty and I was delighted to find this set It s wicked cute 
She Loved It Garment was of nice quality shipped super fast Will order more from webundies 
Great shoes Great price I gor these for Christmas Love them Great quality and great fit 
Outdoor Shoe Shoes are exactly as advertised Good value for the money Easy as Amazon typically is 
Cool Sneaks Great athletic shoes Very Good support Cool color combo Great price too Plus Fast Shipping 
Christmas sandals The Sandals are very nice but the size runs small Compared to another pair of Slaps of the same size these were at least one size smaller 
Ugg classic mini I love these boots They are comfortable warm and the color goes with everything I got Mink It s a peachy rose I would highly recomend these boots 
great bra no bounce I love this bra I have had several of these in different sizes pre kids post baby etc and they have always held up well I hate to bounce and I am usually a 34c and refuse to be that girl jogging down the street getting black eyes from her chest flopping all over yeah you know what I mean Plus gravity will do enough damage I don t need to help it out This bra keeps everything in place and secure The straps have velcro but it is not irritating and hold tight plus I like the adjustable back It gives full coverage and is deceptively attractive The straps don t dig in It does use a bit of compression to hold the girls in place but it is not uncomfortable in any way In fact it slims your side so if you are a golfer or just like have a bigger range in movement this works great It also lasts forever and unlike bras that use spandex this bra does not loose shape 
Great value but sizes are not right I bought the 12 18mo for my 12mo old The shirts are big compared to other brands Carters Old Navy Gap where my daughters size usually coincides with the age size she s been running 90 ile height 50 ile weight I probably could have gotten a size or two smaller but the larger size seems to be fine Roll up the sleeves and the shirt is as long as a dress but it still seems comfy on her not baggy and in the way I wish this brand had pants that went to larger sizes and I wish I had found these earlier I love dressing my daughter in soft comfy clothing for every day and these are a great price 
Great value for the money they run big Make sure you use the weight height in the merchant s size chart I bought a much smaller size than I normally would based on the height guideline and the height weight guidelines match the clothing size The bodysuits and tee shirts are good quality not super thin but not too thick either For the price they are fantastic 
Love them Very soft and comfy my son wears them all the time will buy more soon very happy they come in larger sizes wish they came even LARGER 
Good T s T s are good quality cotton and workmanship They re not super soft but stretchy neckline makes them easy to get on off 
I like these shirts The shirts are nice they are soft and fit my baby perfectly 
best shirts my favorite best fitting shirts my 5 mos has the sizing is actually accurate to his age verses most clothing he has fits months earlier than the tag would indicte quality cotton thick and washes well 
Good quality for a great price These shirts fit my baby great he is nine months old and a little tall for his age but average weight The sleeves go all the way to his wrists and he has room to grow The cotton is very soft and thick and I love the colors I bought the green set They are also long on his body so they don t ruck up everytime I pick him up 
Great t shirts I love these t shirts They are soft cotton and fit my 8 lb baby great Plus cute colors and designs Such a deal 
Finally a dressy shoe that s comfortable I ve bought many pairs of dressy black shoes over the years worn them once took them off halfway through the evening then donated them to the Goodwill Not only are these very flattering making my size 9 feet look smaller than they are but feel more comfortable than any dressy strappy little shoe I ve tried Haven t worn them for a full night out on the town will report back if they turn out not to be as comfortable as they are around the house I ve already packed up the rest of my dressy sandals to be donated 
Great Clothing Great Value I bought 3 of these for my wife They fit her very well and the colors are vibrant They re a great value for the money Good work by the company in shipping them quickly and without problems Ladies pick some up You won t be sorry 
Falling In Love AGAIN I received my shipment yesterday I ABSOLUTLEY Love the product I don t understand how I haven t found such an item for all these years The fabric is soft the fit athletic roomy enough for working out nice cropped length I LOVE it Just wanted to share my joy with you thanks agai 
Love It Ordered a couple and want them all now Great colors comfortable and exavtly what I was looking for Great as under layer in winter with flannel shirts and warmer weather alone with jeans or shorts 
Wonderful color This cropped tee is just the thing for everyday wear with jeans and such or working out An excellent buy for the money The colors are rich and the 100 cotton material is cool The cut is not too tight or too loose with a feminine neckline and sleeve length The cropped hem falls at the navel 
I love a good skirt This is one cute sexy mini and is great for showing off your legs Like the picture it s really sexy when worn with a see through top or even no top I have tried both when wearing this skirt and can vouch for the admiring looks Get one you know you want it 
Comfortable Garment Received the jacket and was very pleased with it Very comfortable to wear Lots of pockets for photo shoots 
american apparel = the best brand ever basically nothing else needs to be said fits perfectly comfortbale not THAT expensive poor helpless children did NOT craft your shirt and above all it looks good every company needs to print their things on american apparel 
california fleece zip hoody I recently bought 3 zip up hoodies from andrew christian and would highly recommend them The material is great it fits perfectly and i got it only 5 days after i ordered I will definately be buying from AC in the future 
Coat Coat runs pretty small I am a size 9 10 average body type and ordered a medium Sleeves were a good 2 inches too short and the sleeves were tight around my arms Not comfortable but I love how it looks Quality seems great I just wish I could wear it 
Size runs larger than PJs by same maker I bought this robe and the silk pajamas for my boyfriend for Valentine s Day both in a size large The pajamas fit nicely but the robe was WAY too big I printed out the return label listing the reason for return as the product did not fit the description online Amazon said that this was not their fault and deducted the cost of shipping from my refund and did not offer the opportunity for an exchange So now I have to re order the robe in a smaller size and the price has gone up 7 since Valentine s Day This would have been a good deal if it had run true to size but because of misrepresentations made I will end up paying close to the full price listed MORAL Order one size smaller than you think you need 
Perfect Gift I bought this gift for my husband for our first Christmas He absolutely loved it the color the texture everything After searching around on the internet it was one of the best deals as well The gift arrived quickly and without any problems I highly recommend 
Love this product The robe arrive in great condition and in a timely manner My boyfriend absolutely loved his Christmas gift Thanks again 
I Wish I Had Not Bought It At Amazon The robe does not fit me I wanted to return it got a return item number got busy and did not get it in the mail soon enough They have a strict 30 day return ploicy Nordstroms does not do this I could exchange it there Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules I will go elsewhere next time 
great robe I thought that wearing a silk robe was more an affectation than anything else Happily I was wrong This robe is well made comfortable and it really looks nice 
Review of silk robe The robe was made of a very high quality fabric and held up very well The color and tecture of the silk was truly beautiful 
The best flip flop out there I love this shoe It is very comfortable I can wear them anywhere 
most comfortable flip flops these are not only the most comfortable flip flops i have ever tried but they are also the most elegant you will not go wrong with these shoes they re the best 
Worth every penny These are great sandals Very comfortable and well designed I m sure they will last a long time My only complaint is that Croc s sizing is a little off For every other kind of shoe I take a 9 But my size 9 Crocs are a little big This is not that big of an issue with sandals but be careful when ordering their other shoes 
Poncho Review Not the finest quality out there but well worth the price Not fancy but functional and inexpensive 
So Pretty I bought these shoes in pink and they are lovely house shoes to lounge around it The marabou is very fluffy and the overall look is old fashioned glamour Fun and pretty 
Affordable Prada I was so thrilled to find this fun bag at a price I can afford It s classy looking and comes with a certificate of authenticity and a bag to protect it I m completely happy with this purchase 
Above Board Performance Item was received in a more than timely manner and the product was well received from my husband who is an avid fan Many thanks to all involved

Turfer Spots Rainwear Awesome Product Great for wind and rain You don t need to pay a huge price to get a quality procuct I bike commute and wear this over a suit and tie Works great Got it right on time Highly recommend 
Most Comfortable Bra The tag says most comfortable bra and I was skeptical it s hard to find a comfortable 40DD But it is true This is now the only bra I wear Colors are limited in the larger sizes but I can live with that I would highly recommend it 
Most comfortable bra I ve ever worn This is truly the most comfortable bra I ve ever worn I especially like the seamless patternless cups which don t show under knits Best of all the price through Amazon was better than any sale price anywhere 
BEST BRA EVER I am a 40D and it is very difficult to find a bra that lifts is comfortable and the straps will stay on all day My search is over This bra stayed on my shoulders all day This has never happened to me before Wonderful product seamless and comfortable Please don t hesitate to buy 
Awesome bra This bra is great This is the first time in a long time that I have been able to find a bra that actually fits good and is comfortable The only thing I wish it had was a little bit more of a lining 
Fabulous comfort and perfectly described This is the best bra I purchased in my life and incredible that I was able to do so over the internet with the description I would highly recommend this product for highly active full figure women Thanks for exceeding my expectations 
Great Bra This is my favorite bra I bought one and I loved it so much I got another one It is very supportive yet comfortable and looks great even under fitted sweaters 
fabulous This is an incredibly comfortable and perfect bra for the fuller figure or anyone who wants support and comfort I have always worn Bali even wacoal isn t this good well for me anyway I have also tried many different styles and well made brands this is incredible I just ordered more so I would havee nough Hopefully this style will never be discontinued THANK YOU OLGA I highly recomend this bra for anyone who wants comfort support and also it tends to be almost like a minimizer without the discomfort I am a 36 DD small around the back but fuller on the sides 
Very Comfortable Very comfortable good support looks smooth and neat under clothing Appreciate the side supports I m a size 40C and finding a cup to fit properly and underwire that doesn t jab under the arms is tough This feels custom made 
My favorite bra ever I m a 38 DDD and generally have a hard time finding a good bra They either poke or spread my breasts and it looks horrible The only bra I ve found after a long search that works well is comfortable and gives me enough confidence is this one I recommend it to everybody 
Comfortable and Flattering I love this bra It looks like I lost 10lbs just putting it on and it s so comfortable I realize people have different body shapes but for me it s perfect 
Nice polo but sizes tend to run big I suggest getting a size smaller than usual as the sizing on this polo runs big Also the new red looks rather pink ish 
Flimsy Material I bought this thinking for the price and name of item Hardside that I would receive something solid What arrived was a disappointment The outside is anything but solid Made out of something a little harder than common plastics Sent back item and looked for something truly worthwhile from Samsonite 
Good product so so company Love the suitcase It swivels and swirls just like the suitcases I ve been buying for years from Japan and the Australia While the people at the company answered my emails as well as the phone when I called I don t think I will ever order from them again The item arrived one month after the initial delivery date Free shipping was promoted but I still had to pay for shipping It was still cheaper than anything I can find here at home but I was annoyed by the misrepresentation Still they were courteous if not apologetic If you live on the mainland I expect you ll have better luck 
Sweater Time The QuikSilver Caldera Point is a handsome midweight sweater I like both the green color and the detail on the sleeves A nice sweater that can be worn for either laid back casual or for casual dress You can t go wrong on this The Boss 
Lever back earrings I had searched everywhere for lever back earrings After reviewing about 200 pairs on the internet I found just what I was looking for This is my second pair as I had lost one Very pleased with the workmanship and the gold coloring 
Roomy My boyfriend says that these are his favorite shorts Nice and roomy with some breathing room 
Good price No pockets I was thinking it of using it for my tennis Unfortunately there was no clue saying it dint have pockets Anyways its a good shorts for great price 
Pretty good for the sale I like the shorts The price is excellent The shorts were a little thinner than I imagined But I am very satisfied with the purchase 
good durable cheap If you go to the gym or play ball a lot and need a couple pair of shorts so you don t need to do laundry every other day these athletic shorts are perfect They re thin but durable I got them on sale for like 10 so they do the trick Don t get me wrong its not like you ll look like a dork at the gym but if you re looking for something super flashy then these aren t them 
These boots are the best I live on a farm and need good waterproof rubber boots but I also wanted them to look cute These are just such boots They are comfortable good grip on the bottom so I don t slip in the mud or the rain and they keep my feet dry I ve had other rubber boots that don t compare Wellies are the best and Celtic Hands has super fast shipping The boots are cute yet functional and I highly recommend Celtic Hands to all 
Superb Customer Service After noticing that the boots I had ordered were out of stock the customer service rep emailed me to let me know of other options When the item became available the rep contacted me immediately and I reordered The boots were shipped quickly and I am very satisfied with the product I will use this site again 
Happy Feet These boots are great The seller is equally as wonderful as the merchandise These were a gift for my daughter and I got the wrong size Communication exchange process as quick and smooth as if I went to the store myself The correct size arrived and my daughter was DANCING AROUND THE HOUSE in her new boots She LOVES them I would definately recommend this sellers store to anyone and I have 
adidas Men s Originals 3 Stripes Trefoil Tee sz XXL Dark Marine Legacy Excellent condition Fast delivery A+ 
Hot Socks Gold Toe makes an excellent sock and their Men s Canterbury Dress Sock is no exception The socks are remarkably comfortable They are not thick and although they are a bit thinner than other Gold Toe socks they will still withstand lots of wear They almost never bunch up inside my shoes as I walk around and they are very much worth the price They last longer so the long life of these socks justifies the slightly higher price I also like the design of the toe section actually being gold colored fabric Amazon points out that these socks come in your choice of four different colors black navy blue grey marl and brown The safest most conservative choice for the corporate office is the black color but the other colors come in handy too depending on your work play dress code These socks can easily be washed in any washer or dryer but I would heed the manufacturer s warning about not drying them at a high temperature High temperatures in the clothes dryer cause the sock to wear out faster The stretch nylon will stretch even more and then these socks will become just too loose on your feet Please note that these are crew length socks They will not come up your leg to the degree that some other socks will You may consider them to be too short On the other hand the socks also fit shoe sizes 7 through 12 so it s almost one size fits all Overall Gold Toe is the brand to buy if you want good quality long lasting socks The Canterbury Dress Socks for men match any attire and they can even be worn in bed on those really cold nights to keep your feet warm Highly recommended May you wear them in good health SMILE 
Excellent socks These socks are comfortable wear well and are reasonably priced In short they are exactly what I have been looking for and I am pleased to finally locate them 
Basic Black Socks These socks fit fine and are comfortable I usually wear out my socks first in the heal It is too soon to know how well these ones will hold up 
Hooked on Dockers It s been 4 years since I have purchased my first pair of Dockers Stain Defenders and with all honesty I can say that these were the pants that have had me hooked on the brand since With teflon in the fabric this all cotton pant is stain resistant fade resistant wrinkle free with permanent crease It really has it all You can certaintly treat these pants like jeans since you don t have to wash them constantly yet the high technology in the fabric makes you look well put together all the time I highly recommend the Go Khaki Stain Defender 
good stuff i just bought this camelbak for extended mountain bike rides i also use it when i go backpacking and pretty much anything outdoors it is huge 100 oz is a lot of water it has TONS of space to keep all your stuff the only thing i dont care for is the way you have to fill it up you have to take the bladder out everytime time but no flaws with the product it is totally solid 
Great way to bring water and gear I ve had this pack for about a month 5 6 single track rides from 1 2 5 hours Pros Water deliver system works well Ample storage for short to medium day trips Lightweight Harness system works well to keep pack properly positioned on my back Water resistant pouch was nice feature when it began to rain Cons None so far 
Great Product I bought this for my daughter and sons for hiking camp bike riding etc This is one of the greatest buys It brings things beyond water 
Great product I m very happy with this purchase Great for hiking and many extra pockets for carrying stuff beyond water 
Christmas Present A great sweatshirt for the tall man Fits true to size and very soft and comfortable with out a lot of weight 
nice nice solid sweatshirt soft comfy nicer than a 7 Wal Mart special i apprecated the tall sizes tall guys this is a great pick 
Very Well Made Durable and Extremely Warm We purchased a couple of these during the 10 off 40 purchase and were pleasantly surprised with the quality Frequently it is hard to judge whether a particular brand of clothing will run small or larger but know up front these do run on the larger end The shirts are very thick and are some of the warmest sweatshirts we have ever come across you won t keep these on long in a warm house The only minor complaint we could express is they are a bit stiffer than others but that is likely due to the weave and why they are so warming The cuffs are not quite as snug as we would like but it s better than being tight Overall for the price and quality these can t be beat 
Love them Very comfortable and the look good I ve gotten compliments on these shoes 
So troublesome I like the style of shoes but It really troublesome for me It get dirty so quick and hard to clean it If I knew about it I wouldn t buy it the color of black trim will come out so easyly when it touch with water After that it makes the leather dirty and so hard to clean it Just dont wear it when it is raining Any way I hate to clean it everytime 
Great for playing sports I was never one for thongs g strings or jocks because they never felt comfortable and gave me the coverage I like These CK hip briefs are great to wear under my shorts while I m running or playing volleyball They don t ride up and I like the fact that they support both my package upfront and my bubble butt as well They re good for when I m playing sports or just wearing under my jeans when I m going out they re one of the only sport briefs that not only look good but give perfect support and comfort and I m told they look really sexy so I m going to buy more 
Calvin Klein Hip Briefs are the best EVER I have big thighs so I can t wear boxer briefs or regular full cut briefs because they always ride up And your jewels always seem to get smashed between your legs if you don t walk just right and you have to keep adjusting yourself all day right These hip briefs however are cut up much higher so they can t ride up your thighs or hips not as high as bikini briefs though so you can relax and the waistband sits at or just below your hips And to make things even better they re cut with a perfectly shaped pouch in the front that keeps your goods out of harm s way I have a couple other brands of pouch briefs but this one s shape got it just right I have a couple different styles of Calvin Klein hip briefs and they re all basically the same cut which is the important part The only thing that really differs between his various underwear lines are the fabrics involved Body is cotton with some stretch XT is breathable spandexy stuff that will stay dry while exercising or dancing Pro Mesh really is mesh and made me feel awkwardly like a stripper and Pro Stretch is sort of like the Body fabric but with more lycra 
Best pair of underwear i ve ever owned This brief is very comfortable and very sexy so i m told Fits great and offers plenty of support I wish it came in more colors 
best ever i just bought this brief a few days ago and wow it has to be the best i ve ever bought i fits perfectly everywhere and the material is very comfortable i would highly recomend it to anyone who hasn t found that one brief that fits just right 
Best Boots Ever I got them a 1 2 size bigger and they fit perfect These boots are the sexiest thing ever and they are really comfortable The quality is also superb You don t run across a find like these very often The Honey color is more beautiful in person What more can I say Apepazza has the cutest and most comfortable boots ever I can t wait to get a different style 
Amazing shoes AAAA++++++++++++++++LOVE EM I have been looking for a pair of boots forever now and could not find any either the color wasnt right or didnt have my size or had an extra pointless buckle When I finally saw these boots fell in love at first sight But wouldnt dare to buy because of the price I have been monitoring them for about 2 5 months and finally decided to get them Let me tell you guys THEY R AWESOME worth every single penny So glad I finally got them The size expresso color width calve width everything fit just perfect A+++++ A must have Very cool and hip 
jockey pants The product fit my precise expectations and needs I would not hesitate to transact business with this company in the future 
This is a great panty I love this panty It s so comfortable The material is very silky and feels great on the skin but it also have a lot of stretch which makes if fit very well This was the first No Panty Line Promise panty I got but after getting this I also went and got one of the thongs which is also wonderful I think this is one of the most comfortable panties I ve ever worn I want a lot more 
Great for fancy or casual attire great shoe 3 heel comfortable enough for short term wear fabric and color is lovely style is nice and the decorative buckle is adorable dresses up shoe just enough to make it appropriate for fancy wear i wore them with my wedding dress I found them to be a little uncomfortable wearing them a long time because the angle from heel to toe is a little steep and the inside area above the toes is man made pleather and that gave me a blister I didn t like that Otherwise they were great 
great sandal these sandals are as comfortable as they are beautiful the color is a soft gold that can be worn with many different outfits and the material is soft against the foot 
Miracle of sock engineering These socks are amazing They go way up to your knee are fitted all over stay up without squeezing too much I ve been looking for socks like this for a long time 
The best socks ever I have never owned better socks than these They are comfy knee highs that actually stay up Awesome awesome awesom 
Graet Value Great fit great feel these truly are Premium quality I m looking forward to putting some serious mileage on these chaps 
So great I got a 2nd pair Sizing review is spot on I wear a size 6 street shoe and my treadmill track shoes Adidas Supernova Classics are 7 5 The Kumasis I wear are a 6 5 The first pair I won in a Mudddy Buddy race and I loved them so much I got a second pair one for the REALLY muddy wet days and the other for dusty drier ones Recommended them to my mom and cousin too and they love them All 3 of us have high arches and narrow heels My mom is a AAA width I m a B with a narrow heel All happy Big props to Adidas 
good sportswear I purchased this tank from amazon and after wearing for almost a month my overall rating for it is 4 stars I ordered a small and found that the cut is not really tight compared to other stretch rib tanks and tops I have The tank did not shrink after it was washed which indicates that the fabric is of good quality However I found that the length is a little on the short side With yoga pants it looks ok in length but when i wore it once with my low rise jeans it looked a little short Overall for sportswear it is a nice product at an affordable price 
Thin and cheap These tshirts are as thin as you can imagine After one wash the neck and arms stretched out unacceptably I cannot recommend this product 
Wonderful Wow this product was wonderful thanks so much I wasnt quite sure what to expect since this is the first time I order lingerie over the internet but its perfect and looks great Thanks again I ll keep you in mind for the next time I need something 
Creative Zen V Leather Case I LOVE this case Keeps Zen clean protects the screen case has a clear cover over screen area Well made and very classy Much better then neoprene skin 
favorite Keds sneakers I was delighted to find out that Keds still makes the sneakers I bought as a kid I just wore out the last pair I had I purchased extras at least twenty years ago so haven t had to look for new till now Well almost the same sneaker These don t seem to be made to the same last as the old models they aren t quite as good a fit but are still pretty comfortable and the sole is still flexible and light weight The inside is lined with a terry like material an improvement I think if it holds up to wear The colored stripe around the outside of the bottom is gone I m sorry about that as it gave them a more streamlined appearance But unless these new Champions don t wear well I will definitely look for more when I wear out these two pairs a decade from now 
Great White Sneakers The shoes arrived in a jiffy and were all that I d hoped they would be a little wider than those of my youth because that s the way I d ordered them still lightweight and comfortable and with solid arch support They re good walkers without being bulky They re trim summer oxfords that don t overpower the look of an outfit I got a stony beach scuff on one toe so I washed it It washed and dried nicely but the toe isn t pristine anymore so I guess I ll polish these sneaks just as I did in the 60s 
rust sportcoat This is a nice sportcoat that I purchased from amazon but it is made by S K Menswear It fits well but is slightly tight The color is different and really is a rust color and not a plain brown color I do like it and would reccomend it as an inexpensive casual sportcoat Thank you Amazon 
Great This case is very cute the price was great and it protects my iPod 
Excellent product This case is great for a great price Its exactly what my husband was looking for needed 
Perfect for 30 60GB iPod I am very satisfied with the safety protection this iPod case provides for my iPod It is very convenient 
Great Case I love this case the kickstand works really well the clip is very strong and will hold your iPod as you go running the colors are cute and it has a built in thin plastic screen Only negative is the plastic screen does get dusty easil 
Great down vest I love this vest and especially amazon s price I bought Boysenberry which is more of a merlot or purple than shown on the webpage color swatch The inside is a light lavender I usually wear a M and I am pleased with the fit I think that anyone with a large bust would need to order up a size or two Also the length is not very long so if you are in doubt perhaps order a size larger It is very warm and plush and I have not had trouble with the down coming through the seems yet I have washed it 2 times and it looks the same as when I bought it 
cozy pockets I love this vest and the pockets are lined with this super warm fabric I love that it is double sided but only one of the sides has the quilting v like look the other is flat Overall though it is perfect 
unless you like the taste of V cholerae or E coli this is a good product It effectively cleans water of microbiological contaminants including viruses through a layered filtration system and iodine releasing resin and among the only EPA certified bottles to do it It is not heavy and leaves the water with a slight iodine taste much more subtle than using iodine tablets Each filtration system which screws into the inside of the water bottle lasts about 26 gallons about 100 liters after which you have to replace it costing about US 22 I have been using the bottle in rural peru and have had no problems I would recommend this product for anyone venturing into areas with unknown water sanitation all you need is the bottle and a puddle stream river etc I don t know its results against pesticides arsenic lead etc but for short term use this is a great product 
the best boot out there These are the best boots out there they feel like shoes and you can walk and run in these all day for military i have been told that i can not wear them back in Garrision so i am taking advantage on wearing them in Ira 
so much comfort my husband is in iraq and i got these for him he loves them and says it makes life easier on him for his feet to be comfortable since he is on them 90 of the time 
most comfortable training duty service ops boot Wow is about all I can say about these boots And it s about time sneaker companys have gotten involved in military law enforcement footwear Tall for good ankle support lightweight strong and very very comfortable I feel like I m wearing a pair of New Balance 470 cross training sneakers I had to buy two pairs since I can t imagine ever owning any other type or brand of tactical footwear ever again after these Strange that sizing is available in only regular or wide on several web sites but the ones I have are clearly labeled medium width on the box You will not be disappointed find at a retailer to try on and see for yourself you ll pay at least 10 20 more anywhere else 
Leather Cell Phone Fanny Pack Burgundy This cell phone fanny pack is so roomy you can put anything in the bag such as mp3 player or a large sized wallet I like this bag and I will buy this again 
Fanny Pack w cell phone holder I am very pleased with my new fanny pack with the cell phone holder on the front Now that I don t have to carry the cell phone in my fanny pack I have more room for other items My cell phone is at my fingertips also The material seems to be of good quality and I highly recommend it 
Looks very durable I have not taken this on vacation yet but compared to other fanny packs this one seems very durable I wish it had a little more room but I think will do nicely The only drawback was that I had to alter the waist strap because it was too big I am a size 8 even when I had it as small as it would go I do like all of the different sections and pockets to keep items separate 
Excellent product and makes a great gift I ordered the pack as a christmas present for my wife She has been using it for the last few weeks and loves it She has mentioned how roomy and stylish it is She is very happy with it Also wanted to mentioned that I ordered it about a week before christmas and it arrived just in time for me to wrap it and place under the tree 
Leather Fanny Pack It is very functional and durable Just as I imagined It s great I use it every day Love the cell phone pocket 
Very good not quite perfect This is my fourth fanny pack It seems better made than most In particular the belt buckle seems of a higher quality than most and that s been the point of failure of two of my previous packs I wish I could find one with a metal buckle There are two changes I would make to this design First the side pockets are too small because they join the main part of the pack in a single seam The front panel of the side pocket needs to join the main front panel of the pack in a second seam maybe 3 8 farther forward This would make the side pockets much larger and more useful Besides that I note that there is only a single seam joining the belt to the pack Time will tell but I suspect this may become a failure point A second or even third row of stitching here would make me feel more confident All that said it seems like a very good pack the zippers and pulls are of high quality the pockets are all lined there are plenty of pockets including two security pockets for money and other small valuables and I would give it 4 1 2 stars if I could just not 5 
Great quality size and very functional I was hesitant to purchase a fanny pack sight unseen but since I was unable to locate a suitable one in our local stores and I use a fanny pack daily I took my chances This has been the best fanny pack I have ever owned I bought one in black It has held up well to daily use and I have owned it for one year now As a mother of four small children I need to have my hands free and not forget my wallet or keys so I depend on a fanny pack to help with that challenge In my fanny pack I keep a good size wallet two sets of keys a small tape measure a couple pens a couple tubes of lipstick chapstick and a few other personal items with still a little room to spare I also LOVE the cell phone pouch since we got a cell phone a few months before I bought this fanny pack I definitely recommend this product 
Warm Comfort The easy spirit bootie is just what I was looking for Comfortable and yet stylish I can wear with pants or skirts dress up or down The zipper on both sides of bootie make it very easy to slip on Your feet stay dry in rain or snow I love my booties 
Versatile boot s This versatile boot s works for the casual office and best on the weekends Great deal price wise 29 79 too There is a smooth leather upper that stays put with a stretch zipper fabric around the zipper but the rest is smooth soft leather Although fits true to the size and it reads 8 � M at first it felt a bit narrow especially around the ankle but it became loose after I wear it Advanced cushioning padded insole for comfort and flexible sole Over all very comfortable and classy 
Rolfs Nostalgia Checkbook Cover This checkbook cover is exactly what I was looking for It is spaceous and is a beautiful color I am very glad that I bought this item 
Easy to use This case protects better than anything out there and the color is awsome My Gear Store also got the case to me super fast 
COOL EXCELLENT QUALITY SWEET COLOR She loved it and it makes the NANO look even cooler Protects the Nano very well fits perfect 
Perfect case This is the perfect case for a Nano my husband loves it 
funny slippers I love them they were too big for me at medium I am a size 7 shoe and should have ordered the small 
Shorter is Better In addition to the expect high quality materials workmanship of Calvin Klein clothing this trunk is shorter in length than standard boxer briefs I find this shorter design to be more comfortable 
Sexy and comfortable At first I was surprised when I opened the box and saw what appeared to be way too small trunks After slipping them on I was pleased to discover that it had perfectly contoured to me Nice design and streches for an exact fit Since it is part cotton it is cool and breathes well 
Clothes They were not the same color as in the picture by far the shirt is almost a Neon green and the pants have neon polka dots Still cute though 
very cute and trendy I love the quality of the leather and stitching Very cute and really holds my ipod 30g in place I recommend it to anyone 
great product Absoulutly wondeful My I Pod is very greatful for its new home 
GREAT VALUE Bought this for my husband and he loves it His Apple 30gb ipod fits perfectly in it and he loves the convenience of being able to keep his ipod in the case while plugging it in to charge or transmit music It is a wonderful value for the money 
good price and good product This is just what I was looking for in a case just enough style to whisper my name a price that was perfectly reasonable and functionality along with the protective aspect The belt clasp also rotates which is very nice So this was my pick very functional with a gentle sigh of style I think I should be paid for such advertising 
Good quality for the price This item has a screen protector but doesn t have a protector for the click wheel This is the only reason that I didn t give the item five stars The leather is of good quality and there is some padding to help protect you ipod if you were to drop it It has a rotating belt clip which is nice I also like that you can access the hold button headphone jack and USB port without having to remove the case There is also a little pocket inside where you can hold a couple credit cards perfect if you like to travel light 
Oh what quality for the price I bought this brief organizer for my son He tells me that his co workers compliments him all of the time on how professional the brief look It looks good and it is functional I loved it so much that I bought one for myself It was delivered fast and was packed very well This is the best brief case ever bar none If I could rate this item a hundred 100 I would instead of 5 
Good Quality After shopping local venues and not finding quite what I wanted for my boyfriends birthday I turned to the internet and I m glad I did This was just what I wanted a good quality messenger style bag that was neither too young nor too old for an almost 30 male He loves it and carries his laptop in to daily My only concern is that the shoulder strap is thinner than I would have prefered but so far it is holding up to the job just fine There are several pockets inside so it can hold quite a bit and the phone pocket on the side he chooses to use for his IPod 
David King Leather Porthole Brief The Porthole Brief is a desk away from the office It has space for everything needed and is beautifully crafted 
Great Value This leather briefcase was exactly what I was looking for The leather is smooth and supple and holds up well It s big enough to accommodate my 13 MacBook along with an assortment of other papers iPod and so forth I highly recommend it 
Nice Bag Purchased this bag for my fiancee and he loves it Very professional looking and of good quality Arrived quickly 
David King Porthole Brief I m very happy and impressed My last briefcase was stolen along with everything in it so I decided to make the best of it and treat myself to a bag I actually liked Looked at some very pricey options at local stores and couldn t find anything with the style I was looking for Took the risk and bought this over the internet for significantly less than the others I was considering and I am extremely happy with it The case even when full is not bulky but stores a surprising amount There are open slots that hold both my notebook and my organizer a zippered section for my files two flat zippered sections for miscelanious papers two 1 2 size pockets for holding my camera and a newspaper perfectly slots for business cards and a pen organizer Quality is great thick leather nice stitching My only minor complaint is the latches are magnetic I prefer the physical catch type as they are a little easier to latch without looking I actually took some brown shoe polish to it right away to give it more of an aged patina and love it I also cut off the stupid cell phone holder because I thought it was ugly bulky and I would never use it even if my phone fit Overall I m extremely happy with both the David King bag and Luggagepoint s service I would gladly buy from them again 
My husband loves them My husband really loves them Says they re very comfortable and he s quite picky 
Comfortable These are very comfortable and best of all after wearing them all day they don t get all stretched out like other boxers When you put them on they are nice and snug but not at all contstricting And at the end of the day they are stiill the same Worth the

GREAT SLIPPERS I LOVE THE SLIPPERS THAT I ORDERED AND AM THINKING ABOUT ORDERING THEM AGAIN 
I will definitely use Bealls Florida again without hesitation Amazon makes things go smoothly but you always hold your breath dealing with a company that you haven t dealt with before But I must say Bealls Florida is not one to hold your breath for Got acknowledgements right away as well as all communications delivery was on time I rest my case 
Comfy Slippers I purchased these slippers as a gift and also bought a pair for myself They are very soft like a baby s blanket on your feet It really feels like you re walking on clouds 
Great Slipper Great Price I have 2 pairs of these slippers and I am so happy with then that I also bought a pair for my sister They are made of good quality material that can be put in the washer and dryer They have a hard sole which makes them better for the feet legs and back than cheaper priced slippers They are somewhat stain resistant and durable Highly recommended for those wanting comfortable quality slippers at a reasonable price 
Not too thuggish I was a little skeptical about purchasing this type of hat because I needed it to wear with my pea coat which I typically wear for work and didn t want to appear too casual if you will Nevermind that This hat is perfect with my pea coat and with my Northface that I wear on the weekends You will not be disappointed with this hat and if you purchase it from JTFtrading you ll get a great quality hat in a very timely manner 
Love It Long Time I bought this hat because I thought it would make look like Uma Thurman in that movie prime She wears one just like it when she goes to the blockparty with her boytoy I was wrong this hat makes me look hotter than Uma So pick a finger you miserable bitch oh and my boytoy is hotter 
Carters onesies Love them they are very stretchy and soft These are my favorite type of onesies out of all that i own 
didn t work for me either I agree to the term out of ear ear buds headphones None of the 3 sizes ear buds worked for me Whether I moved or not didn t matter Just after 5 seconds I start to play music the ear buds get out of my ears and bass sound has totally gone Indeed this item is for a few chosen ones For instance my girlfriend did like it and that s why I purchased this I realized I am not a chosen one 
slippers Wonderful I feel like I m walking on a cloud Plus they keep my feet warm 
Missing the memory foam I was really looking forward to recieving these MEMORY FOAM slippers When they arrived I was EXTREMELY disappointed to discover that they only had a RUBBER sole with terry cloth The terry cloth and color were beautiful and the size 11 narrow was great on the fit I hope the factory just forgot to put the memory foam in this particular pair of slippers because if that is not the case then this company is guilty of false and misleading claims in their online product discription as well as the discription on the attached tag I returned these slippers the day after they arrived and am still in search of a pair of slippers WITH real memory foam that the wearer can actually feel 
AWESOME BOOTS I ordered these boots for my husband a couple months ago and he absolutely loves them He wears them every day they are very nice looking and very comfortable Definitely recommended 
Great shoe This is the most comfortable shoe I ve ever bought As soon as the shoes arrived I put them on and went and stood on my patio and it felt like I was standing bare foot on my carpet Eventhough it looks like a work shoe the leather is very flexable so it breaks in a lot eaiser then any other shoe or boot I ve ever bought The shoe is also not as tight as other shoes I buy It is roomy enough the first time that even with a heavy shoe my feet don t sweat as much because they can breathe Overall I love the shoe and it feels great I think Dr Marten has a life long customer 
Very well made I love this dress It is very simple and classic It is flattering from every angle The material and construction are of high quality and it shows The material does not readily become saggy and misshapen after sitting or wearing and I would recommend this dress to anyone who likes its style Just a warning though I ordered a small which usually fits me well but I had to return and reorder a medium because the small was too tight I am 5 1 at 105 lbs so one would think a small would fit me 
Cute Cute boots Love them but definitely need to break them in before wearing them right away for long periods of time 
nice boots I really like these boots and receive many compliments when I wear them They are of good quality I m pleased with this purchase 
Very Comfy These are quite comfortable I wear them mostly around the house or when I want something casual with jeans They almost look like a slipper but they are firm and tight fitting Not as easy to slip on or off as you would think These shoes were sized correctly Overall I m happy with these shoes 
Husband looking good Bought these for my husband for CHRISTmas He wears them every chase he gets I think I will sneek out the out old ugly ones now 
Comfort looks Love the bra ordering another The straps do not put pressure on the neck area like some bra straps do The black edging adds a little style for shirts that are cut lower 
Great alternative to bare feet in your yoga class I attend yoga twice a week at the Y The classes are held in a room with hardwood floors like you find on a basketball court Since I use their mats and so do many other bare footed people whose hygiene may be questionable I choose to wear socks Also the room is kept very air conditioned making bear feet uncomfortable for that reason I was wearing regular cotton ankle socks at first but some of our poses result in our standing directly on the floor rather than on the mat I found I was nervous about slipping on the slick floor so I started looking for slipper socks with tread on the bottoms Oddly I couldn t find any except very expensive ones designed for geriatric customers Then I found these I did think they were on the expensive side which is why only 4 stars I do love them though They re cozy and they help me keep from slipping in class Two thumbs up 
Cool shoes with lights My five year old son loves it He even likes the box it came in that he is saving it and putting his other toys legos etc into that box 
Lightning McQueen shoes These are great My son loves them They appear to be of good quality and should last a long time I m wondering how long they ll flash for but so far so good 
Light ups for little kids with big feet This nifty pair of sneakers Is a bargain at the price I thought they would look cheesy But they re really very nice They light up in three places And are made by Buster Brown Velcro straps hold them in place Each with its padded tongue It s hard to find the light up type For kids who have large feet Available up to size 2 They really are a treat Tough and sturdy waterproof We put them to the test Big kids who love the movie Cars Will like these shoes the best Amanda Richards March 2 2007 
Excellent quality sneaker with a fun character that lights up This shoe is a nice combo of fun and function My son is a huge Disney Pixar Car fan so of course he loves the sneaker I love it because they fit my son perfectly I ordered 1 2 size up and the velcro straps are so easy to use that he fastens them himself They were worth every penny and should fit as long as you know the child s proper size 
attractive but ouch I have to agree with a previous reviewer buy one size larger Very good looking shoes but not designed with comfort in mind 
Good design for a reasonable price Very confortable shoes even though it takes a few days to adapt the shoes to your feet The fact that it has a rubber soil makes it useful in wet surfaces and in the snow For this price is a very good product and I highly recommend it if you want some good shoes by a low price 
Amazing deal This is a great deal On other sites they re selling these same shoes for 75 They look stylish They re great quality and they feel comfortable A fantastic deal in my opinion 
Great bathing suit Had to re order in a smaller size for my wife but the color is so beautiful vibrant and really flattering Nice quality Looks much more expensive that the price you are paying Would highly recommend My wife is very pleased with this swim sui 
Nice Bathing Suit I love this bathing suit After searching everywhere for a suit that would cover my stomach and my thighs I found this one and at a reasonable price no less Comfortable material doesnt itch Recommend removing the bra pads when washing 
Fairy Dress is a Fairy tale dream I knew my daughter found her dress when I heard the squeals of delight Living in a small town our choices are limited so I turned to Amazon com for my daughters graduation dress The picture shows a very pretty dress but when I got it this turned out to be a truly stunning dress The fit was perfect PacificPlex s sizes are right on and their sizing chart really helped so check that out before you buy The dress in very well made and included straps that could be sewn on should one choose too My daughter felt like a princess and my friend ordered the burgundy version for her daughters graduation This dress is beautiful in both colors We are very pleased 
a well fitted approval Amazingly beautiful The picture does not give the full affect Im very tall so it came to about mid calf on me It came with the tags on The only thing about it is that you have to sew on the included straps if you want them on The dress fits the exact measurements given No room for leway either buy the exact size of choose a diferant dress Overall very pleased with the product 
nice quality perfect size but only got black These shawls are very nice quality and perfect size the only problem was that they only had black as they stated in the product description I received them very quickly via USPS Priority Mail Black is a very popular color so I can use them for gifts I d like to ask the merchant to get some more colors I was happy with the shawls though and would buy them again 
Pashmina Value I ordered the 10 multi color set and got a total of 14 scarves 12 viscose 6 black 6 colors and 2 chiffon scarves great value and they made great Christmas gifts 
62jankay The quality of the scarfs are very good The shipping very fast My only issue is that the color selection was lacking I received 5 black scarves 2 pinks 1 orange 1 red and 1 deep pink Not a big range of colors sent that was very disappointing and having 5 of one color was even more disappointing But for what I paid for them it was still a very good deal 
Great price for a great product I wish I didn t purchase any other pashminas This was a great price and the fabric was so soft I was able to give 10 people a present for the price of one 
Viscose scarves shawls I received 10 shawls of various colors which were selected by the dealer This resulted in several duplicate colors The shawls are good quality for the price 
Perfect Gifts for Co Workers I work in a nursing facility I needed low cost Christmas gifts for my co workers I was afraid of the quality of this product given the price I ordered two sets and received 5 blacks per set Each set had identical colors The quality was wonderful And most people preferred black for its versatility Everyone LOVED them I would definitely order again Thank you 
Slip On Greatness Aye NO LACES I have a couple pairs of these and I love em They are perfect for walking the dog going to the store or just goofing around the house I like that they are slip on makes it easy to get in and out of them quickly BTW they are not supposed to have laces 
Converse Slip ons The shipping was a bit slow but they atill arrived in a decent amount of time and the shoes are perfect Thanks 
Bali bra best This is my favorite brassiere because the shoulder straps stay up and because it gives natural looking support without appearing pointy or misshapen I wore my last one until it was in threads and am happy to have found a way to continue to order it 
Olga Bra is GREAT I love this Bra It s the only bra I plan to buy from now on 
My best bra I own four of these I m very glad of it because they no longer sell them in my size Again I have to begin a search for that most elusive thing a comfortable bra that does what it s supposed to do As to this bra though even if you don t care about the minimizing effect it s comfortable supportive and doesn t wear like body armor 
Good but not perfect Ah the search for a perfect bra It can be as challenging the quest as the quest for the Holy Grail if not more so I mean with the Grail you don t have to worry about sizing I hesitated to order this bra for a long time as it appears to be pretty ugly in the photo displayed here but I am pleased to say that in person it s actually rather pretty However be aware that there are 4 hooks in the back so forget about your amour quickly unclasping it in during a moment of passion These hooks and the stretchy sheer fabric provide substantial support though and the wide straps are comfortable and won t leave whiplash marks upon the shoulders Unfortunately the bra is cut rather narrow at the upper sides heading towards the underarms Depending on your build this can mean that the sides of your breasts will squish out which is unattractive and indicative of a poor fit so ordering a larger cup size than normal might be necessary 
Most effective minimizer I ve ever worn This extremely comfortable good looking and effective minimizer has enabled me to wear one size smaller Also the straps never slip off the shoulder I wish I had found this bra years ag 
nice looking but disappointed ordered size XXL for my brother for christmas he said it fit great overall but it was too short he s 6 5 and ussually an XXL sweatshirt fits just fine all over including length He loved the sweatshirt so was disappointed that he had to return it 
Glove review These gloves are great for cool areas in the home or at work I use them while I am sitting reading a book or working on the computer when I am in the basement My hands stay warm and I can still do activities without having my fingers covered up I even gave a pair to a friend who always had cold hands but had to work with paperwork 
Excellent price but not the greatest quality The price delivery was excellent but the quality of the product is not the best I shouldn t expect much for a 2 glove right It s great nonetheless It snags on almost everything but it definitely keeps me warm at work while I m typing 
Useful They aren t warm enough to be worn outside when it s cold but are perfect for warming my hands when I m at the computer 
great price These gloves were not very well made so I do not know how long they will last BUT they were very well priced My son loves them I can t complain Great packaging and fast shipping 
Nice Great little black gloves they really make a difference in this polar ice cap of an office in which I work My hands are a little warmer and I can still type without a hitch 
cute skirt I bought this skirt in khaki I like the length It is perfect for when you need to cover up a bit more like if you are visiting older relatives With the khaki the fabric is thick enough to let you get by with out wearing a slip Also the sizes run slightly large 
Good jeans I got them at Amazon com few days ago It is a great looking jeans and they look great with both black and brown boots and sneakers as well The size and lenth are right and the item arrived as promised in 2 days Highly recommend 
the seller sucks I received the wrong size contacted seller and no reply I now have two pair of 46 48 when I ordered 42 44 
Smooth as silk but much more durable Wasn t sure about the material these were made of but they seem to hold up very well Less fraying or seam tearing than silk but the same texture maybe just a bit thicker Less of a static problem than silk Fit is average typical or possibly a little on the larger than sized size 
Quick Delivery no problems I was able to find this item through Amazon after I had not had any luck finding it in my local department stores The delivery was quick and the shoes were great 
A Jock that feels like nothing at all This Jock is awesome It s obviously a swim style jock with a narrow 1 1 4 inch waistband and standard leg straps The woven Jock pouch is soft comfortable and holds everything great The best thing about this jock is that it feels like you re not wearing anything at all it s very lightweight I ordered the Medium size and it didn t bind twist pinch or squeeze I like it so much I ordered two 
Extra long socks These socks are very soft wash well but a bit too long They would be perfect for someone tall or someone wanting a longer sock that goes above the knee Very good quality socks good buy for the price 
Bad customer service I liked the pants however I needed another size and it took WEEKS for them to get back to me When I sent them back I requested another size but they never sent them So I just got a refund which I had to call several times to get 
unusual and sexy These sandles are so different than what is being worn by most There elegant sexy and comfortable 
Great look comfortable An elegant shoe with some lovely metallic details Don t usually wear heels these high but overall they re super comfortable Size runs a little big but nothing an insert won t fix 
Gorgeous design not for wide feet Don t get me wrong this shoe could almost stand at 5 stars on the style factor alone What a seriously beautiful shoe it should come with a warning label for sizzle With a classic pointed toe pump design AK has provided the best of menswear wing tip tailoring in smooth leather against a suede base The heel is on the high side for me but it s perfectly proportioned with the rest of the shoe and complements the pointed toe and wingtip accents My only complaint is with my own wide feet story of my life I can get away with the medium width by moving up a 1 2 size but these would be absolutely perfect if they came in wide withs Wide ladies you may need to put up with a snug fit around the midsole and toe box but if you can live with it as so many of us do what a way to go 
Gorgeous I bought these shoes in black and wore them for the first time today with a simple black skirt and blouse for the office For the first wearing they were very comfortable and really good to look at I am definitely pleased with the quality and value 
Wouldn t buy any other sock Champion socks have been my favorite socks for about 10 years now I refuse to use any other socks As for the previous review regarding cutting off circulation and leaving marks on your legs this shouldn t be a problem so long as you don t have massively obese legs I would suggest the reviewer try losing some weight before knocking on these socks 
Fairy Princess Dress I received this dress in a very timely manner There was one problem in that the zipper was broken but overall the dress was beautiful and really priced great My daughter was the belle of her ball 
gray sweatpants I had no problem with the purchase xcept it didn t have elastic so I had to use seam tape and iron them so they be shorte 
Comfortable and good fit I m usually anxious about sizing and comfort when I buy sweatpants but I m very pleased with this purchase I ordered a large and it fits just right and is comfortable during workouts I ve had large sweatpants in the past that looked like they were made for a size 52 waist and eventually had to wear them only around the house for fear of tripping myself if I worked out in them I ve used the sweats for several months and have no complaint 
Great looking top Wife s comments Meant for low impact exercise Very nice looking Wear it to look good not so much to work out in 
Carole Anton Briefs 3 Pack Thrilled with the product exactly what I ordered and wanted except for wrong color However seller immediately refunded my card and I didn t have to return the product 
Just what I wanted I ordered this when I was on vaction because I couldn t find one of these where I was a LEATHER one It s just what I wanted The pocket covers aren t actual buckles there s a snap underneath it which makes it very quick to get in and out There s an alternative entrace to the main area like that Smells like leather like that Just a good overall product I ve never owned or wanted a purse all my life and this is the closest I ve come 
Great gift The delivery was quick and it s a well made quality product with comfort and functionality built into the design My wife has not used her other purses since I gave her this and she loves the convenient access and size Soft black padded leather and over all style looks nice with many outfits too Over all we were both happy with the deal 
great robe only one disappointment I would have given this five stars had the lining been burgundy or any dark red color But alas it is MAUVE And a fairly light mauve at that Otherwise I love the robe and I can t wait to put my whole costume together this Halloween I received the robe in a very timely manner too 
A Great Review I dressed up as Harry Potter for Halloween and my son dressed as him too Ohhhh he looked so cute 
Awesome boots I love these boots Very comfortable and durable seem to work well with any outfit I wear these almost every day now 
I love these boots I fell in love with this boot when I first saw it It was on another store s website for 159 95 I found them on amazon for 99 95 and just waited it out About 2 months later the price dropped to 44 95 and the total purchase was less than 50 00 including shipping The boots were exactly what I expected and I always get complimented on them Thanks Amazon 
Great Vest Vest arrived quickly and looked great It is very nice quality good weight fleece nicely finished and true to size Really good bargain for the price I would definitely order another item of this brand again 
Porth Authority Fleece Vests Excellent on time service excellent product These vests are nicely form fitting and pill less than most fleece 
Best ever This was a gift for our daughter in NYC who was visiting us during the holidays She wore it every day And said many times that it was the best gift she d received 
These tights are the best Capezio tights are necessities in my dance bag I started off using them and when I tried other brands I wasn t satisfied with anything but Capezio They are the most forgiving for different body types not just suited for the stereotypically waif like ballerina Anybody can wear them I wear them on stage and off I recommend them wholeheartedly 
Light blue denim Huuricane wash is a light blue quite soft and slubby and lightweight for denim But nice and comfortable and well broken in While much negative commentary concerning Levi Strauss s move away from domestic manufacturing has focused on the button fly 501s the bigger problem I have seen is with the old 1970 s standby the 505 which has a zipper as opposed to button fly The variability on sizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order The 501 are easier to buy online or by mail order because the sizing is much less critical on the waist which is the so called anti fit waist meaning there is no curve to the rise the distance between the crotch and the top of the waist because the original 501s were merely cut down bib overalls which were made to hang rather than be fitted to the waist The biggest problem I have noted on the 505 s is the variability in size in the thigh area meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight even though they are theoretically the same size of a label The 501s are pretty safe as far as sizing 
I had to return the item They were nice jeans but not right for the person I bought them for I returned them to Macy s over two weeks ago and they said they still haven t recieved them and that it could take 25 days So I m really not happy about that but as long as they give me a credit on my credit card for 29 99 I ll be happy I will let you know how and when this transaction occurrs Christa Hartma 
These things are cool I ve tried other neoprene shorts but I really like these They fit nice and snug and look just like regular biker shorts other neoprene shorts make me feel like I m trying to workout in a potato sack while wrapped in Saran Wrap Not too sure if they are making a significant impact on my cellulite I just got them but they DEFINITELY help suck out excess water and therefore make me look thinner in my problem areas I only wish they were a little longer but I still give them an A 
Very cute These are very cute shoes I love them The ties don t stayed tied up around the leg that well once you start walking around But they are still great 
What a deal I purchased mine for 14 99 and then saw the exact shoes on a clearance rack ha ha at Dillards two weeks after my purchase for 39 99 
nice but Very nice bracelet but it s a little heavy it s heavy more than my stainless steel with ruber bracelet and than my quirugic steel and gold bracelet too but it s very nice color and structure 
Excellent product We bought these long sleeved colored shirts for a child to wear under a rock band tee shirt They looked so good that we ordered several more which he wears on their own as well as under a shirt for the layered look Fast shipping top notch seller and product 
KIDS Baby Rib Long Sleeve T Shirt Lemon 6 The L Shirt was great in color and thickness 
cute style for boy or girl This cotton t shirt is so cute to wear under a sweatshirt or alone The style makes it a cute choice for either a boy or a girl so if you are buying clothes for a first baby knowing you will keep them for the next baby this style is a great choice for either gender 
Green Ties The green ties were ordered for a four piece combo to play a couple of St Patrick s Day gigs They appeared to be a little darker green when viewed on the website but they served to purpose well 
jessica simpson tan boots I love these boots they are so cute and stylish and they look great with my jeans tucked in They will be a great asset this winter for sure with my brown leather coat I recommend these boots but they run a size small 
Cute Boot These boots are very cute but not all that comfortable They feel true to size they look great with dark denim jeans tucked in I have a hard time finding boots b c I have large calfs but these have great spacing 
Great winter boots I just received my boots and I am happy with them They look good with skinny jeans tucked in The color is a bit darker than what you see in the picture more of a deep tan The suede part looks beautiful however I expected for the leather part to look better I would not buy them at full price but they re a good purchase for 54 00 The boot has a good sized heel so if you want height this is a good boot to get 
Very comfortable sandals I am very glad to be able to get this pair of sandals in my size at end of season sale Even though I am flat feet and the sandals have bump on the inside for non flatfeet people I did not feel them while walking and can walk as much as I want Thanks Amazon 
Clark s Mallo Sandal Clarks sandals are super comfortable so comfortable I purchased two pairs and came back and purchased a pair of their clogs Clarks shoes fit well and they carry larger sizes which I really appreciate Good price for great shoes 
LOVED THIS ITEM VERY CUTE VERY WARM AND AND SHE LOOKED CUTE IN THEM TOO I WILL BE ORDERING FROM YOU AGAIN REAL SOON THANK 
Soooooo Soft This is a well made comfortable and yummy outfit for a baby Love i 
bad bad Extremely poor quality cloth Very bad color It looks used Never ever buy any items from this vendo 
GREAT SLEEP AND PLAY ITEM WAS NEW IN PACKAGE WITH TAGS ATTACHED VERY HAPPY WITH ITEM IT WAS JUST WHAT I EXPECTE 
Great Gift Bought 2 of these blue and pink for twins recently born in our family They were of good quality and SO cute The parents loved the gift And I loved that didn t have to go shopping thru stores and got a GREAT bargain from the comfort of my chair Amazon rocks 
cozy and comfy These boots are great for cold weather Don t wear them with socks and you are still warm and cozy It s like walking around in slippers all day but with a rugged sole that can stand icy walkways and snow drifts Only complaint is they do not come in half sizes so could feel a little big if you have to order the next size up 
Nice boot for the money I ordered these and a similar pair of Warmbat boots that were 50 off and I kept the Warmbat s These boots are nice really cute style The reason I didn t keep them was that the sheepskin lining just wasn t nearly as soft thick and fluffy as the Warmbats BUT the Warmbats at full price are DOUBLE the cost These boots were true to size I wear an 8 or 8 5 and the 8 boot was a perfect fit 
Good turtlenecks good price Amazon delivers once again with a really nice full turtleneck at a very decent price Top this off with inexpensive and fast shipping and you ve got a winner 
The best running shoe I ever owned I have flat arches which means I tend to get shin splints and planter fascitis not once with these shoes I am getting my third pair now and have worn these shoes for over a year now love them And I wear them all day most days and to run 5Ks They last me about 6 months each pair but that will all depend on how much you wear them 
First Pair of Asics Will Never Go Back I tried on a bunch of different brands of shoes trying to find the most comfortable I usually wear New Balance but thought I would see if there is anything more comfy out there I fell in love with a pair of Asics Before buying I decided to go to a shoe store and tried on several different pairs of Asics GT 2120 GT 1120 GT 2110 and some others Even thought the GT 2110 s are not the newest on the market they were by far the most comfortable for me I love the cushioning There was no breaking them in either They have been comfortable since the first time I used them I don t run alot but I take a lot of exercise classes and these are perfect I don t think I will ever buy another brand of shoes I highly recommend them 
Asics GT 2110 These shoes are great I had the Asics Gel Flash and loved them but they have been hard to find in my size so I got these Not as breathable or as light as the Gel Flash which is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars but still a great shoe with good stability 
Loyal Asics customer I have worn Asics sneakers for many years and would never buy anything else I recently bought a walking sneaker then I saw this running one and decided to try it since I want to try and start running The first time I jogged on the treadmill in it I noticed how I didn t feel any pressure on my knee as I sometimes do Very sturdy very comfortable and well fitting shoes I would have loved them in black though but who s looking at colour Excellent 
Best running shoe value The entire ASICS GT line from the GT 1000 to the most recent GT 2120 are by far the best value for runners I used to wear Nike until I read in Runner s World Magazine that the ASICS GT 1100 was the Editor s Choice for best overall running shoe so I thought why not In the past I ve dealt with shin splints knee pain and plantar fasciitis a k a really sore feet but my ASICS 1100s kept me healthy and comfortable and relatively stylish I ve been a committed Asics devotee since I own ASICS Kayano running shoes which cost 135 considerably more than the GT series and truthfully I find no difference between the two except for the price Also there is not much difference within the GT series I ve owned GT 1100 GT 1120 GT 2110 and GT 2120 all are superior So find the style and color to suit your budget and enjoy comfortable running to your heart s content or until you rack up 300 miles after which you should replace your Asics as all running shoes start to lose their support and stability after around 300 miles FYI many local track clubs have programs in which they collect retired running shoes and donate them to impoverished children and adults Spread the Asics comfort Because though the shoes are no longer optimal for running after 300 miles they still make great kick around shoes and are cute and fun for casual wear Sorry about the digression If you run short or medium distances lt 30 miles per week this is the shoe for you 
Great running shoe I have bought this style for the past 3 years It is a great workout shoe It is light and comfortable Great arch support 
Unbelievable I started running again after many years I bought average shoes due to not knowing if I would stick with it After a few weeks of my feet hurting and feeling like they were numb I went and got fitted for shoes These shoes had the ah factor right away I didn t truly believe the shoe factor that states the shoes are everything Boy was I wrong They made an unbelievable difference and now 9 months later I am still running and have even entered several races I wouldn t do it without these shoes My running partner agrees Her knees are not in good shape but she is now doing great with these shoes We re believers 
Comfey These are certainly comfortable to wear For some reason I thought they would provide some measure of support but they are not designed for that I believe they would not be ideal for large chested women I personaly would not wear one in public without something over top 
Nice and comfortable I liked the fast delivery and I loved the fit it was nice and comfortable Not too long or short and I am petite Thank you again I ll look forward to purchasing from you again in the future 
Durable enough for my son and his playful attitude I have a thirteen year old and he is still in that boyish hard playing mode at school and these pants hold up well I don t have to put patches on these as I had to do other pants 
Great Belt This is a very heavy good quality single layer not two layers sewed together leather belt Branded Marc Wolf LTD Made In America and Top Grain Cowhide on the inside The finish on the leather and the buckle was good with no defects nicks or burrs A couple of notes to help you buy Size The size of the belt seems to be to the center of five belt holes The five holes span 3 1 2 inches total so you should be able to go about 1 3 4 inches larger or smaller than the size you ordered Extra holes To make extra holes a hand held leather punch will work fine If you are comfortable with power tools you can also drill new holes as needed Place the belt finished side down on a chunk of scrap wood drill from the back unfinished inside side of the belt for best results Have a friend help you as the leather will try to lift when the drill bit goes through I had to do this as I ordered 2 inches bigger than I measured just to be safe I am very happy with this product 
STRONG AND BEAUTIFUL BELT It s the belt most strong and comfortable that I ever used it I recomend it a lot 
Long Lasting and Durable I bought this belt for my husband about 10+ years ago He is a police officer so he needed a belt that would last After 10+ years I finally had to buy him a new belt This belt is thick and very durable well worth the mone 
reach the heights of fashion with these I ordered these a few days ago and I must say that I love these I wanted the teal color but they were not available in my size 7 1 2 med Although the heels are about 4 inches high they are comfy You can t expect to walk miles in these shoes but if you take regular breaks then yes It will add pizzazz to any dress and will make your legs look longer I looked so much taller than my 5 4 that I love to look at myself I received many complments too The only thing I didn t like is that Amazon displays some shoes that are not in stock at all Why not wait for the stock and then display Atleast we get to know that they are available 
Cute shoes I really like these shoes They have a short heel and are really comfortable 
Computer Tote I really like this laptop case because it looks more like a purse It s very stylish The only problem I ve had is the straps aren t very padded so if you re walking a long way it gets a little bit uncomfortable But it s very roomy and has some extra compartments so overall I m very pleased with it 
Great Thermal Tops I purchased these crew neck tops after being unhappy with various brands of waffle thermal shirts I was pleasantly surprised to find the Duofold Insulayer tops to be almost silky smooth lightweight and very warm I wore them recently under by suit while back in New York and Chicago during their NorEaster of 2007 and found them to be the perfect undergarment for business wear in harsh cold I give them a big Thumbs Up 
Thermal underwear top This thermal top is thin but warm It fits comfortably under any type of shirt It has 2 layers without the bulk of other thermals Not much shrinkage after washing in hot water 
Good quality This fullfills its purpose very warm and comfortable yet doesn t show underneath other clothes I am very pleased 
A very nice thermal top I wear this top under my dress shirt every day during the winter to keep warm in the office The fabric is nice and soft like a very well made undershirt It is not a waffle thermal The weight is between a lightweight and midweight The natural color is very close to white Both layers are a cotton polyester blend I have worn Duofold thermal tops for almost two decades They are well made they do not pile and they last for several years 
big mama wow what an excelent product took awhile to get it but was in excellent condition and works fine with no problems highty recommended 
Stretch belts Good product The colors are all very similar when held up next to each other so you don t need to order one of each 
Not Happy When I first saw the dress it was 18 then the next day it was 22 They would not sell it to me for 18 lady on the phone said it might even go up higher I bought the red the blue Then a week later they went BACK DOWN to 18 before I received the dresses The dresses do NOT look like the picture on the site The dress is longer than on the site The site shows it above the knee s the two I received are below the knee almost mid calf I m 5 9 It is a halter top On the site I think they just rested the straps over her shoulders did not tie behind her next ALSO I knew the dress was cotton NOT T SHIRT cotton sundress Now I have two dresses that I m not really happy w I haven t had time to return them I bought them looking for a sundress to wear out about this I would probably only wear as a beach cover up or to the pool Haven t decided Once I get around to getting to a post office I plan on returning them I keep trying them on thinking Ok it s only 20 I should keep them But I most probably would NOT have bought them if I tried them on in the store They would look cute if they were shorter but that is more money that I would have to spend to shorten the dress So is it really worth it Haven t decided yet The fact I can t decided what to do w them makes me believe I need to return them If I loved them I would have already worn them but I haven t The ONLY nice thing I can say is the pattern colors both the red the blue are really pretty I would be happy if the dresses were above the knee NOT T Shirt Cotton Very Disappointed 
Last minute Christmas gift Arrived promptly in excellent condition and for 45 00 less than in stores 
A Real Turn On That s What These Panties Are I brought a couple pair of these to our little lingerie party because I knew the girls would like them I ve been wearing them for over a year and I like them a lot My husband does too They look good turn him on turn me on too You can t ask for more than that in a panty now can you 
Cute and Pretty Darned Enticing I really like the look of these panties all lacy and feminine They feel good on look great and best of all they re low cut so you can were them with your jeans riding low on your hips And if a bit of panty does peek out all the better cuz these are so cute Pretty darned enticing too if you know what I mean 
Stylish and Nice Hot Looking too These are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff Levi s My cutoffs are so faded so frayed so well you know So when I peal them off to reveal this Butterfly Lace up Panty in Black with the pick laces on the back it s like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl We only had two colors at our lingerie party white and the black and pink models but I can imagine all the colors would be nice too 
I love these panties They are sexy an I love I can have different colors for different days 
Awesome clogs I just got my birkenstocks from shoes com on amazon and THEY ARE GREAT they are 100 authentic delivery was fast and nicely packaged If you want these clogs then buy from because they are the best 
Looooove this shoe The Kate is more padded around the heel than the original canvas sneaker It makes all the difference Instantly your foot is snuggled by the shoe Comfortable I have 6 pairs Not a darn thing negative to say about this shoe You won t regret buying this shoe

Keds shoes The service was great on Amazon and the shoes were perfect They were exactly what I order and the color was great and the choices were hard to choose from since there were many to choose from thanks 
Great for Hiking Went for a 3 day hike in October Ended up with wet feet But these socks were great they soaked up the water out of my boots as I was wearing them Thick and comfortable 
warm and cozy I recently was hired as a school crossing guard and found that it was time to order some warm socks These are a very good buy They are big I thought I was ordering a woman s size As it turned out the larger size is fine and I can put them in my dryer and not worry that they will shrink They feel great and are very warm 
Great quality and very affordable I bought 3 packs of these socks last year and came back to buy more I ve worn them alot and have yet to have a single one start to wear out They are warm enough for winter use but wick well enough to wear them in the spring and fall I didnt try them in the summer though the black grey calf length socks would not look too hot with shorts on I suggest buying double what you think you ll need somehow the family figures out how great they are and they start disapearing So buy 2 packs for you and 2 packs for them 
Great Product and Seller I got my shipment very quickly and my husband absolutely loves the socks In fact this is my second Christmas buying them for him I will probably do the same next year 
no surprises nice quality black cap large enough to fit my big head just the right amount of bendability in the bill if you like this kind of hat buy this one 
GI jeep cap ilike the hat it does tend to fit a little big on a younger teen s head i suppose i ll grow into it itdefinately is good quality and andrew christianis a good company do allow 2 weeks for it to get to you though 
Original stuff I really like this pair of jeans The perfect 527 boot cut but with the ragged style makes it an original piece 
Warm and Attractive I bought this jacket for my mother who is always cold The vendor was National Products not amazon com and it was quickly shipped and received I have to say that it shed a good bit when I tried it on to determine if it was the right size but I think that s normal for chenille My mother tells me that she wears it all the time and it s extremely warm The jacket itself was very pretty and comfortably sized but not ridiculously so So while I can t attest to it first hand it seems to have been a nicely made attractive and effective product 
Great lightweight wrap I bought two of these shawls for weddings coming up this summer They are very light but not sheer and will be perfect for covering shoulders even in the summer heat The colors on the swatches are pretty accurate compared to the actual shawls I plan to order a couple more to top off other dresses and dressy tops 
Great Wraps I bought Silver Black to wear at weddings These wraps are great and very elegant They re light and soft just as described They also make great scarves 
Not a Wrap I purchased this item thinking that it would be nice light wrap It was at best a sheer scarf Not worth the price paid 
Way Cheaper Than Department Stores I bought this as a gift for my mom She was looking at one exactly like this in a well known department store but she didnt buy it cause it was 75 00 I looked for one to get her and found this one It was such a great price and she loves it She acctually likes this one better then the one in the department store Great Product Even Better Pric 
outstanding product outstanding customer service I purchased this purse and requested it to be mailed immediately I received the purse a couple of days later The purse was better than in the photo The customer service was outstanding I was emailed updates on shipping and the purse arrived in a timely manner I will definitely frequent this merchant again Thank you 
Great Sparkle Bag I LOVE MY BAG It s well made and sturdy large enough for a small makeup case and wallet and keys without over stuffing it I m going to order another in a diffrent color my daughter s trying to steal mine Thanks again 
Shimmer Evening Handbag Got Lots of OOHs and AHHs I saw almost the identical bag on another site for 80 and was floored when I found it on Amazon com for 25 I was just as floored when I received the bag I ordered the gold one and it blended so well with the bronze metallic shoes I paired it with My friends thought the bag was Oh so cute as it set off my outfit with just the right touch of BLING I would describe it as SUBTLE BLING The bag held my cell phone small bill fold lipstick lipgloss and 2 sets of keys I couldn t squeeze in my asthma pump but I didn t need it I highly recommend this product It s worth the money I even ordered another one as a birthday gift for a friend 
My niece loves it I ordered this handbag for my 19 year old niece as a birthday gift When she opened the package she said VERY cool with a huge smile We went over the details and agreed that the size is just large enough to hold the essentials cell phone keys lipstick compact pen credit card and that the style is versatile it goes with an elegant evening gown as well as with blue jeans Also the silver tone is a great match for all her favorite colors Pinks purple blues black white So she loves it and I am happy 
Classy and glamorous This is a beautiful purse for an evening out I had earlier bought one of those hobos but this one is so much better It goes well with either an evening gown or just plain jeans and tees a must have accessory 
Gorgeous purse I think the picture does not do justice to this item I am a big fan of sequin work and I haven t seen a purse as nice as this It is very glamorous The rounded steel handle adds a classy touch to it I ve already ordered the black one to go with my holiday evening gown 
Great Product I bought the leotard because I needed one for class but I also needed a cheap one I wasn t sure of the quality that was about to come to me since it was one of the more affordable ones It ended up being perfect I m glad I bought it instead of splurging on something else 
It is wonderful If you are small busted or flat chested like I am this is a wonderful product They look and feel real NO ONE can tell that I wear them When I tell people that I have them in they can t believe how natural they look They can wear out though so be prepared to replace them in 18 to 24 months 
Color changing wonders So I got them out I said Wow these are light weight I liked them I really did Well I took them for a walk It was sunny winter day birds heading south cool winds whirling around my head a great scene for a brisk walk down to the local university and back A take a few steps and think these are quite comfy I smile another great purchase I look down I blink I look down again to my amazement The white leather uppers have started to change colors A darker red at the seams and a lighter pink on the surface of the leather I continue my walk A pink storm begins to overwhelm my white beauties Now I m not worried about it you know I can handle pink but deep down inside I really wanted them to be white I finish my walk my macho ness slightly tainted re enter my home take of my pink three striped wonders and set them down to think They changed back They are white again Twas the sun that made them pink The end Anyway has this happened to anyone else Just wondering Nice shoes just kind of a strange surprise Color changing leather what will they come up with next 
Decent shoe Good shoe similar to Metrum but more light weight and narrower The white color does show skuff marks after you use them for a while But overall an adequate replacement for my Metrum shoes which seem ever increasingly hard to find these days 
Perfect in every way Love this shoe It s perfect for comfort wearing looking good or sports THE PERFECT SHOE YO 
Roomy This bag is bigger then what you think it is I was very pleased with the quality of this bag at the price you pay for it I use it to carry books lunch and important things for work I am very satisfied with this product 
Easy to pack We took the Bio Suds on a two week trip to Hawaii and San Francisco We really enjoyed being able to pack this with out any space or weight problems Since that we have two children washing clothes is a must when we go on vacation Prior to the trip we had no luck trying to find laundry detergent tablets at any store Apparently the tablets were taken off the market so having the Bio Suds was a great option We used about half of one tube for two loads of laundry I believe it says it is used for 21 washes but I m wondering if it is for washing things in the sink this is not clear There isn t much of a scent but we used dryer sheets for a scent Nevertheless we thought the product was great and was just what we were looking for 
Bearpaw mini boots Bought for my wife who loves these boots She wanted something that was cut lower than the usual shear boot that UGG sells at 3X the price Good quality and she is waiting for a pair of GRAY ones to be offered from this company in the mini style 
Great socks Trying to find great socks for a men s size 15EEEE foot is never easy These socks are absolutely great They feel good and come out of the wash nice They are a recommended buy for a big guy 
Soft windshirt Soft and comfortable Great to wear on the golf course or golf range Microfiber is the best 
Great quality I have been looking for a windshirt for my husband for quite some time now This is very soft warm but not too warm jacket that has the word PING on the sleeve two crossed golf clubs on the front and a cute PING cartoon guy on the back of the neck It fits great although I have to say the Large may fit some people that usually buy Mediums especially if you re going to put anything underneath it Great service from stitch with us as well 
Great bargain Too bad it s not leather BUT for the price I couldn t have found a better boot I ve paid a lot more on others that have killed my feet after wearing for just an hour or so I d buy another pair if it came in another color 
Very cute I got these at a really good price so I don t care that they are not really leather They are cute and just what I needed They are also comfortable I bought them in mahogany too 
NOT REAL LEATHER I was very dissapointed when I received these boots The description clearly states that the boots are leather but they are NOT 
Cute and comfortable I received so many compliments when I wore these boots Not to mention they were unexpectedly comfortable I can wear them all night and dance in them and not be in pain I definitely recommend them 
great boots Very comfortable I bought them at a higher price so I m mad that they are so cheap now They were worth the price I paid so they are definitely worth this price 
Great back pack arrived promptly Good looking all black fanny pack Solid strap buckle and zippers Plenty of room in main compartment for wallet treo cell phone lots of keys and more 2 smaller pockets as well 
waist pack benefits i love the bag it is sturdy and strong without too many compartments thus not to much zipper and small in size my husband wears it everyday even on special occasions 
waist pack review I collect sort sell golf balls for charity and this morning attended a sale and we used the waist packs for the first time There was ample space for marking pens check book a mobile phone other personal things PLUS a nice spot to stash the dollar bills in it suited my needs better than anything else I looked at I am very happy with my purchases and the waist pack seems sturdy enough to see me through many many sales 
Cute dressy and comfy I love this jacket Very cute and matches oodles of things in my closet Comfortable too 
I wear them as nursing shoes I have been an R N for over 30 years and these are the best exceptional service shoes arrived right on time 
Reebok Princess Outstanding service from a great seller Will not hesitate to purchase from them again Good communications well packaged timely delivery 
Comfortable Shoe great comfortable shoe i always buy them i bought this last pair for my daughter and now she loves them too thank you Reebok now don t do something stupid and stop making them 
Wow Very pleased with purchase My Mother in law has a hard time finding these shoes in her size She was very glad we were able to find them and they arrived sooner than we expected The shoes made it in time for Christmas 
Good black shoes I like Reebox Princess shoes very much I will wear nothing else on my feet whether it s to supermarket or to the symphony dj 
Pampered Feet I love my new Reebok Princess tennie runners They are comfortable beyond a shadow of a doubt fit perfectly with heavy socks why I bought 1 2 size larger than my normal shoe size and I will keep coming back to Reeboks for the remainder of my years I have always worn Reeboks because I have a very high arch and they are the only shoe manufacturer which takes people s feet and the shapes of same into consideration Happy New Year for 2007 may we see a better year throughout the world 
Great walking shoe without the bulk I buy these walking shoes for my 91 year old mother She does not like the look of most walking shoes because they are too bulky These are more like shoes At any age appearance as well as comfort play a part in our choices 
Shoe size I could find no Reebok shoes with wide widths so Amazon found them for me Thank 
military style commando Wallet My husband had a wallet like this and used it for years until it fell apart He wanted another one like it because it is thin He really likes it 
Commando Wallet excellent purchase This wallent is an excellent purchase for the military man It has velcro closures not only on the outside of the wallet but also on the inside pocket I recommend this product highly 
Sorely Disappointed I have not been able to find a replacement for my 2 fold nylon wallet by Rolf s Based on the good review this wallet has got I went ahead with my oder It turns out that the wallet I just received lacks a secured compartment for storing dollar bills This is because one end of this comparment is entirely open and the compartment for the dollar bills is secured only when the entire wallet is folded I fail to appreciate how this product can even be called a wallet when there is no secured compartment for bills Granted commados may never need to carry dollar bills or they are trained with special skills to secure them in this product In all fairness it would be good for the seller to fully disclose this particular feature and let the fully informed buyers decide if this product fits their needs 
I m not a commando but this wallet fits my needs My last 3 nylon wallets have been nylon and I just got use to having one in my back pocket When my last one was getting a little old I started looking for a replacement but was unable to find one locally I did a google search and found Amazon again and low and behold a wallet that looked just like what I use to have I was a little hesitant at first but for the price I decided to order 2 I hate returning things and if it s right I take 2 When they came I was happy they were exactly what I wanted with an extra velcroed pocket inside If you never tried a nylon wallet but have wanted to you ought to give this one a try If you are the type of guy who likes to show off 10 pictures of his children car wife or girlfriends this isn t for you it doesn t come with a multi plastic picture folder If you want a secure rugged container for all your wallet valuables here s one for you There s even a velco strip to keep your wallet closed shut a nice added feature that will allow you to take your wallet out in total darkness without being afraid you might loose something from inside even if you drop your wallet I could see where this would be a good wallet for our men and women in our armed services Also for any outdoor enthusiast or worker or anyone who might just want a secure wallet Heck the black might even go with a tux 
Great jacket could be better This is a nice jacket in a lot of ways especially for traveling with the ability to pack it into itself However I find all the double zippers and doo hickey s sticking out to be rather bothersome Also there doesn t seem to be a good way of pulling the waist in you can do it but there seems to be no good way to tie it up so that it stays pulled together The result is that it hangs out wide which can be cold on a chilly day 
A great jacket I absolutely love this jacket I love that I can stuff it into it s own pocket use it as a pillow or throw it into my pack and carry it then pull it out and have it ustuffed and on in less than a minute Design and construction are great and it keeps out wind and water while letting sweat dissipate I also love the value as it is an excellent product at its price 
Super Little Bag This is an awesome mini bag Allows you to organize and have basic contents right at your fingertips Highly recommend 
Good starter wallet I bought this wallet for my son as his first real wallet to carry with him on a daily basis It holds folding money and the few cards he needs school ID lunch card hall pass etc It wouldn t be able to hold much more than that though It is slim lighweight and looks very nice 
Striped Thigh High Stockings Really nice stockings great colors Comfortable and well priced compared to most 
tommy jacket My son just loves this jacket and he s hard to please The lining is so soft and comfortable 
Good comfortable sexy but a little pricy As the title I relaly like it but I can not won as many as I want because its price I hope CK will have some online sale or lower its price someday 
Comfortable I love these shoes Mind you I am VERY picky about my shoes Extremely comfortable almost like wearing slippers They look very nice with jeans The strap is velcro and I ve found myself occasionally having to re fasten them closed Other than that they re awesome 
Love Em I find that if I fasten the straps with a little leeway i e flex my foot while fastening then they re much less likely to come loose VERY comfortable shoes and cuter than a lot of tennis shoes They do have more shine than you can really see in the online photos I got the bronze but I think it s cute 
Fabulous Shoes I just received my shoes yesterday in time for a long trip I tried them on yesterday and think they are just perfect They are soooo comfortable feels like I m walking around in house slippers And they look cute and have real tread on the bottom so I know I can do some real walking in them I do have to admit there is a bit more sparkle in mine than I expected I ordered the pewter but I really don t mind Highly recommend these shoes I m considering getting another pair in a different color 
SMOOTHE AND PRETTY I bought one and loved it so much I ordered 3 more Great for those who hate the bra lines on the back and don t require a lot of lift It also looks good 
Love it Comfortable cute and great colors wish they had more I may never wear a bra again These are so smooth under clinging tops It is a nice added layer under sweaters too 
It is very sexy comfortable Would like to have in every color in the rainbow 
nice cami This cami fits well does not ride up gives enough support I m a 36C It s pretty low though I do wish the neck line was a little higher Over all it is pretty very comfty 
It s Wonderful The moment I tryed it on the fit was great I ve never come a cross a cami that fits so well and comfortable 
no more bras i am overjoyed with this cami because it means never having to wear a bra again the cami supports without binding riding up hooks bones shoulder digging straps all those things we hate about bras i m ordering more of these the sizes run a little small 2X Extra Large fits dress size 12 or 14 
Flexees One Fabulous Body II Lace Cami Very comfortable to wear and doesn t ride up like many camisoles I ve tried Also is longer than most I ve tried Would definitely recommend 
cute I bought the bag in the whisky color It looks cute and fashionable Itself is quite spacious and perfect for mall shopping Have got some compliments from strangers 
Prompt shipment Prompt Shipment on this item but had issue with the 2nd item ordered 
I like them just make sure to size up These are very nice boots at a fraction of the price of Uggs I am normally a 7 or 7 1 2 in regular shoes I bought these in a 9 and the length of the foot is perfect The only reason I m giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because they don t fit as snug as I would like around the ankle so they bulge a little under pants jeans unless I wear large flares and also slide around a little when I walk I guess they d probably be okay to tuck skinny jeans into but I haven t tried this yet Still they are a great purchase for the price I got the lavendar color which is pretty 
nice boots sizes run a little small had to exchange for bigger love them 
Love it I absolutely love these boots They are perfect for the snow or just to wear around the house and look fantastic Definetly worth the mone 
Nice Loafer Nice loafer sizing is accurate My only issue is the leather is a little stiffer than I am used to for Clarks 
Great shoes These shoes are SWEET Much more than I expected They fit well extremely comfortable and I ve gotten many compliments on them along with asking where I purchased I m getting another pair different colour but of course 
loafer Love the Magery Loafer The shoes are very comfortable I get complements on them almost every time I wear them 
shoes Love these shoes I did however have to send the initial pair back and order 1 2 size larger than I normally wear They are very comfy 
Nice Soft Undershirt These shirts are nice soft and a bit sheer They are perfect for wearing under your clothes for an extra layer of warmth when it s cold They are long enough to tuck in I m a size 8 10 and the medium fits me snuggly The V neck is a great shape It sits low enough so that it doesn t show but is high enough to give good coverage The pink is a nice color for undergarments a soft pale peachy pink My order was shipped from Bare Essentials The box arrived the next day and it was just after a snow and ice storm The items were packed femininely with logo tissue I appreciated that the vendor also included a form for convenient return of the items and included an 800 number for questions I ve ordered items on Amazon through Boscov s and have had a difficult time contacting Boscov s 
Fun Creative Perfect Necessary I carry this wherever I go and have found it incredibly helpful on numerous occasions Most of the time I use the flashlight on it to look through my bottomless purse I love the hidden compartment with the mirror and perfume So convenient Plus there s something about having a pocket knife that makes me feel useful and safe It s also fun that there are so many colors to choose from now just in case you aren t up for the girly pink This is a perfect gift to give to any woman 
Nice Fit The fabric of these briefs is not as smooth and sexy as CKs pro stretch brief but the design is still clever with a low fit and narrow fit between the legs making your bulge stand out nicely in the pouch Very comfortable and sexy I prefer briefs like these and preferably CKs pro stretch briefs to boxer briefs any day because boxer briefs tend to ride up and get uncomfortable 
One of the best These are the only pair of underwear that I ve bought that don t actually show while wearing low rise pants Even other briefs that are advertised as quot low rise quot can be seen but not these They re soft comfortable and a pretty good deal 
Excellent These Briefs are super comfortable and they are great below low rise jeans 
Glad I found this for my Creative Lab I m really very pleased with my Creative Lab MP3 player arm band I had a tough time finding one in the stores and so I turned to Amazon to find it and so I did I have been using it ever since and it has held up very nicely I am glad you had Creative Lab products on your site 
Cute as a button I just got these shoes today I got the pink on pink They are adorable I was a little worried because I hadn t tried them on but they look really good They are not too wide nor too narrow They offer a decent amount of arch support for a fashion sneaker not as much as a running shoe but more than those tiny pumas Love em Only wish we weren t ankle deep in snow ice slush so I could wear them right now 
Wish I knew about this before my trip Searched the TSA web site before my trip no mention of special locks Guess what this is a mandatory item just buy it 
Durable and useful I m glad I purchased these locks 3+ years ago I have used them on 5 trips and they have remained intact I have a strong feeling that at some point TSA did unlock my luggage and then locked it back up because a few of the locks have scratches near the keyhole Additionally since I have red locks I can identify my luggage quickly at baggage claim 
TSA Locks My tour guide informed me at the last minute that we needed these locks The company was kind enough to call me that they were out of orange so I bought lime green If they had just back ordered them I would not have gotten them in time for my trip Also I needed a band Lock for a hard sided suitcase so I ordered one of those while on the phone for the color change My suitcase was opened by customs at some point and because of the lock I was alerted to check it before I left the airport Otherwise I would not have known it had been opened until I reached home 
TSA LOCKS LOCKS WERE DELIVERED ON TIME AND ARE NOW BEING USED BY PEOPLE TRAVELING OUTSIDE THE US THEY ARE HAPPY WITH THE LOCK 
Protective case This is the best case that I have found for the new shuffle It protects well and I got it for a great price 
Great Jersey This Jersey is high quality It looks just like the pro s wear 
Perfect these Panties are just Perfect Mostly I don t wear panties unless I m wearing a dress or a skirt and sometimes even then I don t I just like the freedom But these these are cute as can be and it s like you don t have anything on at all At least that s s the way it feels And they are darn beautiful Darn beautiful 
For those Very Daring Nights These panties I have to admit are a whole bunch more comfortable then I thought they d be I was the one who brought them to the lingerie sleepover along with another pair also by Love Fifi I got them as kind of a joke but you know I think I like them Maybe the joke is on me 
Sexy My husband bought this for me and I love it It is very sexy and made very well He loves it on me and I love how it feels on me The collar is an added touch 
great shoes for toddlers Bought these for my 2yr last year and will be buying her a bigger pair this year Much better quality sandals than others on the market Lots of copy cats out there but not as good 
Wonderful I actually had these sandals for my 2 year old daughter last year and they are GREAT They go on easily are very adjustable and she ran around in them like crazy I am considering buying the same pair this year but bigger obviously 
In the bag Excellent construction worth the price Can easily be a lunch tote for two 2 Zippers stick occasionally but opens smoothly with patience and care 
This is a great wallet I ve looked and looked for a wallet to hold all my credit cards store discount cards medical cards business cards etc and one that didn t end up four inches thick after I got everything in it which made it hard to sit down I bought one of these wallets and used it for a year and it works great I went back and bought two more for when the original wears out so that I would have to hunt for another one But so far the original is holding up great 
Great shoes great price The shoes are great and easy to put on My son loves them They were sold out everywhere else so I looked online and found them through Amazon for much less Shipping was fast and we re happy 
Disney Cars Toddler Boys Lightning VS Skate Sneaker Bought a pair for each of my two year old grandsons Both are fans of the Cars and they both loved them They are easy to put on because of the velcro closure Light weight and comfortable for little feet Because of the color easy to wear match with any outfit Very satisfied with this purchase 
Great Shoes Bought these for my son and was very happy with the quality of the shoes Bought them on a sale Well worth the money spent They appear that they will withstand my very energetic and tough on shoes 4 yr old 
Disney Cars Toddler shoes I was very pleased with these shoes They are so cute and look well made I ordered a 1 2 size larger and they fit fine My two year old grandson was as pleased with these shoes as a two year old can be He is a big Cars fan The only disappointment was that they didn t light up and I thought they might 
Wonderful sneaks my lil guy LOVES them Great price great style easy on off for parents Fast shipper too Just great sneaks tough too 
Standout Foot Show I am a shoe fanatic and I applaude the style comfort and show of this outstanding shoe It is indeed a nice fit for casual up dress and party going I have had many compliments on the look and the comfort is cozy I have it in an alternate shade just because I like it so It is quick to slide into and goes from day to night with no problem I have not taken it into the rain and I will not with out covers I have no fear it would stand the test but dare not take the chance 
THESE ARE THE BEST COMFORT STYLE PRICE These slip ons deserve 5 stars in every aspect I Love them 
I LOVE THEM COMFORT STYLE PRICE These slip ons deserve 5 stars in every aspect I Love them 
Great service The company was very prompt at getting the jersey shipped immediately and it arrived within a couple of days after I ordered it The jersey looks exactly as it was described I am very happy with my order 
Love these Sandles Love these sandles I tried to buy another pair in a different color but they were sold out Great bargin 
A Beauty to Behold but a Beast to the Feet The shoes are made from very good leather material wich is pretty light in weight considering the style However they are not the most comfortable shoes They pinch the toes and I spent a lot of time with them unbuckled so that I could ease my foot out of them I wear a nine and these were a nine medium At one point during the day I wondered if I had on a six and took them off to check I wondered if I had bought a nine a half if I would have gotten a better fit What I found odd is that when I fitted them on their arrival they were fine it is the continuous wearing that revealed the discomfiture 
NO MORE HUNCH BACK DAUGHTER This bra is amazing and would be cheap at twice the price No longer does my daughter hunch her shoulders Gone is the constant nagging at her to stand up straight My daughter wears an F cup and so was having all kinds of trouble She heard about this bra from Oprah on Television She went straight to Dillards and paid for one herself It was so amazing that as soon as she returned from her shopping trip I got online and ordered a ballerina pink one I hope they come in strapless cause PROM is just around the corner Thanks again for making such a wonderful Bra it saved many days around here 
difficult to find a proper fit I really wanted to love this bra Finding bras that are supportive when your full figured is difficult not to mention expensive I was fitted for this bra before I bought it but the store didn t have my size so I started looking for the bra online I ordered exactly the size that I was fitted for received my two bras and the fit was terrible The bra is too tight and the cups don t fit I m not spilling out over the sides of the bra usually the first indicator that the bra doesn t fit there s all this extra material in the center of the cup Aside from my fitting problems there are two other problems with this bra I d like to point out Being full figured there are two things necessary to support bigger chests First a bra band that is wide and has four hooks on it this bra does not have that Second you need wide supportive straps again this bra does not have wide enough straps There are better bras out there 
Good service and product It is a great bra and Nordstrom did not currently have my size I ordered and got it in the mail within days 
how come it took me so long to find this bra WOW I can t believe after so many years of pulling and tugging and cursing my bras I ve finally found something that I don t have to touch again once I put it on This is not a pretty bra I did not buy it to be pretty I bought it to hold up my 42 c luggage I can t say enough positive about this bra I haven t had the problems with it that others have had broken underwires etc I even put mine in a lingerie bag and wash it in the washing machine I only bought one six months ago and bought FOUR more today The bra I bought six months ago is as supportive today as it was the day I got it this spring And I LOVE the way my chest looks in any shirt I ve put on over this bra 
Tough to please Then try this bra Given the fact that I have not been able to EVER find a comfortable bra that also supported my D size chest and my picky posture and displeasure for underwire this bra has won the battle There s just a couple of quirks but that could just be me When I tighten the straps they eventually give way and losen up a bit I find myself adjusting them every 3 4 wears I m considering sewing the straps permanently at that adjustment I hand wash it in cold water with mild soap and hang to dry Sometimes tumble on low heat or air tumble and the shape and size stay consistent I lost just a hair of weight in my breats and the bra fitted a little loser Because of this vertical waves in the cup material appeared but that was because there wasn t enough to fill the bra Once I gained that size back unfortunately and filled the cup fully the ridges disappeared I ve had this one for 10 months and wear it every day and it s still in great shape When this one finally gives in I m definitely spending the money to buy another one 
Cautiously Optimistic I entitled the review Cautiously Optimistic because of the relatively short period of time I have worn this garment and I am still reserving a bit of judgement regarding its durability Having stated that I have been very impressed with the support of this bra Having a larger than average chest size the bra I purchased was an f cup I have become accustomed to purchasing bras which offer support initially only to if you ll pardon the pun let me down within a week or so of wearing them Tisha has offered solid support This bra has hiked my bosom up and kept it up all day I have not experienced any sagging or shifting of the garment As I mentioned the support is excellent it has even passed the jiggle test If I have to hurry somewhere or heaven forbid break into a jog the girls stay where they ought offering no threat of injury to me or any innocent passer by The side supports are no doubt part of the reason for the bra s effectiveness but they can pinch a bit In short it feels GOOD to take the bra off at the end of the day I do not however fantasize about slipping out of it at lunchtime to ease aching shoulders or alleviate pain as I have with some others A bra is quite naturally a very personal garment and therefore difficult to recommend but I do recommend this bra for large busted women I would happily trade the scores of 30 40 dollar mistakes for this style 
Derek Jeter New York Yankees Home Pinstripe MLB Replica Jersey very nice It s great to find availability when time is short Thank 
silk better than satin I bought this pair of silk sleep pants and another pair of satin sleep pants Although both were fine the silk is superior in comfort and worth the difference in price 
Great but tappered ankle These pants are nice quality and nice flowy through leg but they tapered at the ankle more than I wanted 
I want My Money Back These pants were washed one time following the washing instructions they were not put in the dryer and they shrunk not only around but lengthwise I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn t have any problems I look forward to your reply 
Luxury for a steal I must say I was very impressed with this item I recently wore these silk pants with a smoking jacket on a cruise ship They were very comfortable they look and feel wonderful and are worth far more than the price Another hit I don t know how these folks do it but Intimo s prices are amazing I would highly recommend these silk lounge pants 
Comfortable Durable I m very pleased with the comfort and design and appearant durability I just wish it would get colder and stay cold long enough in Arizona to wear them more often 
Great Silk Pants Except Great Silk Pants Except My Husband wears a Size Large Pants in everything and with these pants I wish i would of ordered an Extra Large they are a little short on him Looks like he s waiting for a flood I ordered the Burgandy and Blue and the colors are so Deep and Rich Very Nice They wash nice also 
mens silk pajama pants these pajama bottom pants are true to size and well constructed they fit comfortably and wear well being machine washable is a real benefit as well 
Great quality for the price I was very surprised at the quality of the hat Great hat I got it just in time for fathers day My husband was very happy he thought I paid a fortune for the hat 
Marie in Midvale This is my second set of these bras My first set has worn well although the fabric does tend to pill after time This has not affected the wear I have gotten from them One of the most important reasons I like these is that they don t fall off my shoulders That has been a problem all my life and when I found these bras problem solved I have found that if you wash them in a lingerie bag and hang them to dry they last for several years I had four before and bought three this time and for the price you can t beat them 
Great for narrow shoulders I only wear Olga bras because of the way they are designed in the back they are the only bras that do not slip off my narrow shoulders This one is the one I buy most of the time as it does have a minimizing effect The sizes are slightly different from other bras it s best to try one on in the store to get your size then buy from Amazon because of the price The only reason I didn t give it 5 stars is because it is a little too see through I would prefer a thicker lining 
Olga is Great I love this bra and I wear one daily If you like comfort combined with beauty then this one is for you 
Great Little Bra This bra is much more comfortable than I had expected I found the sizing perfect in the cups but the it does run a little small in the band I usually wear a 38 DD but because Amazon didn t offer this bra in a DD in a 38 I sized up Good thing too because there is no way the 38 would have fit However since I did order a size up it does fit just fine I wore it all day shopping and didn t have to tug at my straps even once I forgot I was even wearing it I definitely recommend this item 
The one and only This is the best bra I ve ever owned I ve been wearing it since about 1998 I always go back to it even when I try to broaden my bra horizon I am a 38DD and I love how this bra minimizes I ve only ever had a problem with the size when I bought them from Kohl s once They were defective or something I ended up returning them And recently in my area Filene s turned to Macy s and they don t carry them anymore And so now I have to buy this bra strictly online but they have it for a cheaper price 
It s called a MINIMIZER for a reason guys Yes the bra runs small in the cup area However that s what the bra is supposed to do I m a D cup and this bra makes it possible to wear tighter fitted button down shirts without the buttons bulging making my chest feel like it s being crushed Recommended for the larger chested folks 
my favorite this is the only bra I buy I m glad it s available from Amazon Looks nice lots of support 
Classic styling but rich looking Excellent quality briefs and my husband really liked them They are a simple style but look very classy as far as briefs go I would highly recommend these 
Great Gown This nightgown turned out to be just what I was looking for but hadn t been able to find in the department stores I purchased it for my elderly aunt who wanted a gown just like the one she had worn for many years It is good quality which is what I was expecting from Vanity Fair 
Wish I could give it more than 5 stars It really fit the bill I was very specific looking for this gown I bought it in the navy color because I wanted to be sure it wasn t see through I live in Singapore where it s very hot and humid year round It s common for me to have to take 2 showers a day So in the evenings it s nice to put this lightweight sleeveless gown on to help stay cool I love the length and because of the way it s gathered around the bustline it s loose fitting and not obvious you don t have a bra on I ll definitely be getting another one or two of these down the road 
GOOD QUALITY vanity fair has always been reliable when you order from vanity fair you know exactly what to expect and are never disappointed in their quality 
Mother in law gift I ordered this for a birthday gift for my mother in law She absolutely loved it Vanity Fair is always good quality and their gowns last forever I have one that is over 15 years old 
Nice casual jacket The style is a little more urban than I am used to It seems to be well made and easy care 
i really like it for 20 I would buy it again its a good buy for the price material is nice and soft and the fit is gr8 
interesting material the material of this jacket is nice the outside is soft yet feels water repellent and it s not glossy which i like The inside is a sort of fleece that feels very static it was hard for my t shirt to slide in smoothly without bunching up near the shoulders but I do have really broad shoulders and big biceps i think my arms and shoulders are more xxl rather than the xl i usually buy for my body size But despite my big shoulders the shoulder of this jacket wasn t all that great they were too square cut for my liking even with my shoulders the corner of the jacket where the shoulder seams are still stuck out But if you like that square shoulder look then you re fine Oh and the color sticks up which i like The jacket was also very warm I had it zipped up for less than a minute in my room and already i got warm for 20 i would buy it again also there s a side pocket on the outside of the left chest which is a nice plus 
Hanky Panky Hype Worthy of all the Publicity After all the hanky panky hype I decided to try one out It really is comfortable which I didn t think was possible for a thong I wear a size XS S so I was sceptical whether it was possible for one size fits most item to fit but it s very stretchy and I imagine would fit most sizes I haven t actually forgotten that I am wearing it because I am so in awe that it is comfortable and I m happy to have splurged on this item It s a little expensive but worth the price 
Amazingly comfortable If you are one of those people who think the phrase comfortable thong is an oxymoron think again this Hanky Panky thong is amazing It is more comfortable than any brief or other thong I ve ever worn I can wear it to exercise do yoga to work or around the house You can t even feel that it is on This thong makes you feel sexy and comfortable at the same time I bought one on the advice of a lingerie salesperson and went back and bought 5 more pairs a few weeks later I was very happy to find that I could buy them online as my local lingerie store is out of stock due to demand 
Nice Tags I bought 10 of these tags because I travel almost every week I got the leather tags with the cover up flap I was tired of having mismatched tags that I had scraped up from anywhere and everywhere I was also looking for a tag that kept my personal information covered up from strangers standing nearby Another thing I was looking for was a tag that was strong It was not uncommon for me to pick up my luggage in the airport to discover my tag had been ripped off Sometimes part of it was left Sometimes all of it was gone Luggage and their tags take a lot of abuse OK about this product They are real leather They are nice looking There are two reasons why I am giving this product a 4 instead of a 5 rating First the leather is a little on the thin side It would be a nice thickness to make a ladies purse or a fine wallet for a businessman in a suit but a luggage tag Like I said these tags need to be virtually indestructable to survive I am a little dubious that the thin leather strap will really hold up I may be wrong this is only my speculation at this point The second thing is the price It seems to me that this product should be in the 3 to 4 dollar each price range instead of the 5 to 6 dollar range There are different colors available which is good I bought green because nowadays 95 of all the bags coming down the conveyor are BLACK Everyone needs something on the outside of their bag to help make it easily identifiable These colored tags do that 
Clarks England Shoes in Black I received my new shoes in a timely matter and they are stylish well sewn and very comfortable I highly recommend Clarks 
Wonderful shoes These shoes are beautiful very stylish I love them The color is a lovely light burgundy 
looks cute Great looks the front is slightly narrower than regular shoes I wear 7 most of the time and bought 7 for this style So you might want to go 0 5 size bigger if you don t like the snuggling feeling There is some cusion on the bottom very comfy 
Order size up All previous reviewers are right these run small Good quality boxers but they run small Order a size up You ll be glad you did 
totally delighted My husband who is difficult when purchasing running shoes tried these on and it was love at once felt they were light but supportive felt very comfortable on the foot and when walkin 
hagger cool 18 flat front shorts AWESOME SHORTS THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHORTS WITH A LITTLE EXTRA ROOM WITH THE EXPANDLE WAISTLINE ALWAYS WORE RALPH LAUREN UNTIL I TRIED HAGGER 
Classic cool They re Chucks what more needs to be said There is a reason they are still around after all these years 
Great Price Great Fit My daughter loves it and they came very quick Excellent condition New No scuffs Thanks 
Great shoes I buy these shoes for my son all the time and he loves them My only complaint is that you can t throw them into the washing machine and end up with like new shoes like you could back in the early 70 s It bothers me as well that they are not made in the US But nothing is anymore or so it seems 
Classic and corny An old school shoe with style How did our feet survive these things Oh that s right they didn t 
great chucks The ordering process was easy The wait was not long The product was perfect 
Chuck Taylor s Hi Top Shoe is our shoe of choice After searching the malls for authentic Chuck Taylor Kelly Green Hi tops with no luck I wised up and went to the web site where I not only found Kelly Green Hi tops for my son I also used their unique design your own shoes feature to design a pair of custom high tops just for me We are both thrilled with our finds Chuck Taylor s are the shoe of choice in our household I even got my conservative old school hubby into a pair of Chuck Taylor leather Hi tops 
Ok Fit no support nice for loafing around Originally went for 15s as I usually wear a 14 1 2 or 15 but this was way way too big Got the 14 s instead and they are actually a little long in the toe Absolutely no support in these shoes at all not that I was really expecting any Just wanted to try them out They are great as far as outfitting goes they go with anything But do not plan on doing any major hiking in them They are casual shoes and are for just that being casual Overall not a bad shoe though 
Teen Pleaser We bought the Chuck Taylor high tops for our 14 year old daughter for Christmas The mall had the same produce for 85 00 We cut our cost almost in half and she was THRILLED with the gift Great service Great product Great results Her response Now I need to go get them dirty 
good sneakers No complaints for this gift They get worn a lot and so need to be replaced occasionally 
Great Slippers I have owned quite a few slippers in my time but these are one of the best pair I have owned 
Very Good Product I purchased my moc s about a month ago They fit very well and are confortable I would recommend them especially if they are on sale which was the case when I purchased them 
Love em love em love em I bought these for my hubby s birthday not sure if he would surrender the pair he had been wearing for about 5 years He agreed to try them and after the first day he was glad to toss the old ones We highly recommend Staheekum Men s Moc Sheepskin Slippers I m sure they will always be a favorite in our home 
Great moccasins I ve had these same moccasins purchased online from another supplier Problem was that supplier wouldn t have them available until July 07 For warmth they re the best The natural fleece lining makes your feet feel warm and toasty The outsole wears like iron I d buy them again in a New York minute Tom Tyrrel 
5 Stars These are the best pants I own Great price too I just ordered another pair in a different color 
Very Nice Long Sleeve Tee After buying many of the Short Sleeve ones I finally went back for 3 of the Long Sleeves These are the same material and a very good fit Wash great and very happy with them Would definitely buy more 
Great fabric classic style fit a little awkward Overall I recommend this product The fabric is very soft and comfortable and the rouching around the wait hides if you have a little bit of a tummy The twist around the shoulders really is what makes this shirt stand out However my only complain is the cut of the V neck I am a B cub and usually wear a size Medium very comfortably which is what I ordered but the shirt is pretty revealing at the bust you could see my bra if I leaned certain ways especially if you re bending forward or twising different directions But if you re ok with that then I recommend it 
Well Worth It I bought this coat for my husband not only as an addition to a Halloween costume last year but as a keeper If I m going to spend that much on a coat it better be worth it We have no regrets in our purchase Everyone comments on its quality While trick o treating with the kids we had someone walk up to us just to ask about the coat It is a nice quality full length coat I ll definitely keep International Male in my shopping circle 
Quite the Apparel I had first heard of International Male through my father He is a businessman who like others like him have to elevate appearances to a more important level than some He had just gotten back from a trip to Europe and picked up one of these coats at a finer shop in Stockholm Three months later I off on foreign exchange to Osaka Japan and purchased the same design for myself for the winter It really is an example of how Lucifer is in the details of things It worked really well not only as a warm piece of beautiful clothing but also as a statement of sophistication If you must make appearances not too much better of a way than this 
They Clean Nicely I purchased these pants for work We are required to wear white at my job and I have found it very difficult to find white pants that fit well and are not so thin that they begin to fall apart after many washings I have accidentally spilled things on these pants where I think these are probably ruined now the stain will never come out but they have cleaned up wonderfully I have put them in the dryer many times and have had minimal shrinkage Our weather in Illinois has been 25 below 0 and they have kept me SO warm I would definately recommend this product 
Comfy Crocs I got the celery ones with daisy Jibbitz Everyone luvs them and wants a pair 
Only place to find all croc colors Best price quickest shipping and the availability of my fav color in my size 
Sizing not clear I ordered a men s size instead of women s twice and finally gave up It is not clear what size the crocs are although on the crocs it states mens womens sizes If that had been included with the color choice I wouldn t have ordered the wrong size and would ve kept the purchase 
Comfy Crocs This is my fifth pair of Crocs but the first in the Cayman style Really good fit since it comes in specific sizes as opposed to Medium Large etc I highly recommend this lightweight shoe sandal to anyone who has foot problems is on their feet all day or likes the convenience of just hosing the dirt off The khaki color blends well with almost anything and I received the shoes shortly after ordering Everyone young and old male or female needs to slip on a pair of these featherweight sandals 
made husband happy I finally got my husband something for his birthday that he actually wanted He wears his crocs all the time He said they are light and comfortable and feel good on his feet Thank you 
Reiview of proucts and SHoebuy THe Crocs were as expected this is not our first pairs and we really like them Shoebuy was one of the best companies to deal with we accidently ordered the Men s instead of Women s size and they shipped us a prepaid return label and then immediately upon their receipt of our Crocs sent out the new ones I would order from them again 
Cool shoes to rest Crocs Cayman are awesome You don t even feel that you re wearing them It s the best kind of shoe for the beach s activities 
Love my Crocs They are comfortable light and well ventilated I live in the southern US so I can wear them most of the year I wear them anywhere I would wear sports shoes as well as river tubing rafting and at the pool I have not had the opportunity to wear them at the beach yet I did not rate them a 5 because they are not at all good looking but for knocking around I looking for comfort and durability over style 
Great Value Warner makes a great product but very pricey in the department stores Nice to find it on Amazon for a lot less 
great product this is my favorite bra i hate that they keep running out and am scared they will discontinue it 
More Carhartt quality I wear these to work a lot they are tough and comfortable I don t know what else to say about them they are just shirts after all 
The Suit This was my first summer of buying the Miraclesuit I used to buy the same type of suit by Carol Wior Both do the same trick The difference is there are many more options to choose from in the Miraclesuit line The price is ridiculous but I wouldn t be seen by the pool without my Miraclesuit I have tried on generic brands of the Miraclesuit and trust me it is NOT the same 
PERFECT I ve been looking for this specific color and style and went to every athletic shoe store in Phoenix and Las Vegas but could not find it until i happened to look on Amazon They of course had it and i ordered it immediately It took a little longer than expected to get the shoes but once they were here i slipped them on and they fit like a glove 
Great Shoes I like these shoes very much i have bought over 12 pairs of shoes from amazon and these rank in my top 3 pairs Very white very easy to keep clean I have wide feet and these are not tight at all 
These Pumas are wonderful The Puma Men s Roma Shoe is simple but classy yet good for everyday use A great selection of colors assures that you ll find a pair just right to fit your personality and wardrobe Not only do these shoes look good but they feel good also I assure you will be satisfied with these shoes that will make you and your feet smile 
Great shoe The most comfortable sandal I ve every worn The price was well below the other online shoe sellers A great bargain 
The most versitile shirt you will ever own This shirt is great by itself under an cotton shirt under sholder pads and even under a coldgear shirt The coldgear feels almost like crushed velvet and i like it usually but everyonce in a while It gets to me and I have to put on my turf gear underneath it This a must have for your under armour wardrobe 
Under Armor The versability of the underarmour products is incredible It is comfortable and protecting at the same time When its cold it keeps me warm and when it is hot it keeps me cool It is firm fitting and shapes to your body I wouldn t wear anything else while i play sports 
So Small These shoes are cute but they run so small I couldn t even get them on I gave them to my sister who s foot is a little smaller than mine and they didn t fit her either I never got to wear them it wasn t worth the shipping cost to exchange them but they looked cute 
Just ok This sweater runs large the arms go over my knuckles it s long in the waist I bought this sweater in a large which is what the size chart indicated for me I m 5 6 wear a 10 or 12 It shedded alot I was leaving fuzzies everywhere plus I wore this with a tan skirt I had quite a bit of color transfer Even though it was inexpensive I do not feel it s worth the price 
Cute sweater Got this for my mom s Christmas present She loved it and it looks great on her This is a great deal 
Dream Bra 7169 The bra was delivered in excellent condition Although I am always the same size 38B I found this 38B a bit snug I kept the bra but find it a bit smaller than I would have liked 
Made to Last I recently bought 4 pairs of these bras they fit exceptionally well They were worth the wait I d recommend this product for all females 
This is the Best bra I have ever worn I have 2 of these dream bras and just ordered 3 more they simply are the best fitting bras that I have ever worn And they eliminate back fat 
DREAM COME TRUE This bra rocks No bulging over holds them in a lovely natural position I SO reccomend this to anyone frustrated by overpriced bras 
Great Buy This is really nice feeling wool for a low price The colors are true The wool isn t thick but it is warm Very versatile 
Good Look They look nice and are decently comfortable They work for me I would buy them again 
My dad s a convert Bought these for my dad to wear to a costume party he needed all black clothes and they were cheap so it worked out He said he never would have bought something like this but now he wears them all the time He says they re really comfortable 
The BEST Wrinkle resistant shirt Have you ever worried that when you unpacked your suitcase after an overseas flight that you would have to press your shirts Worry no more These shirts really are ready to wear out of the suitcase EVERY time and also after machine washing and drying just hang em and forget em Wrinkle free crisp creases down the sleeves I really like the large selection of colors available The most comfortable I have ever worn A great value too 
How to win your grandson s heart My three year old grandson has almost every item made from the movie CARS When I saw these sneakers I just had to get them for him He lives in Rhode Island and I live in Delaware It was so cold that his southern mommy would not leave the house to go to the mailstation to pick up the package Finally his dad picked them up on the way home from class He called and said Ganny thank you for Lightening McQueen shoes I love them I know all the characters since he has most of the toys He wanted to wear them with his CARS pajamas to bed They appeared to be of good quality for a rough and tumble three year old Thank you for helping make Jack s Valentine sDay even more special 
Sneakers A big hit with my son Velco is great for those that don t know how to tie yet and the style and fit are perfect 
Love them This is a really great sneaker my son loves them He has been wearing these for well over 3 months and no problems These are the only pair he ever wants to wear 
501 easier to buy online While much of the negative commentary concerned Levi Strauss s move away from domestic manufacturing has focused on the button fly 501s the bigger problem I have seen is with the old 1970 s standby the 505 which has a zipper as opposed to button fly The variability on sizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order You really have to try them on to see how they fit The 501 are much easier to buy online or by mail order because the sizing is much less critical on the waist which is the so called anti fit waist meaning there is no curve to the rise the distance between the crotch and the top of the waist because the original 501s were merely cut down bib overalls which were made to hang rather than be fitted to the waist The biggest problem I have noted on the 505 s is the variability in size in the thigh area meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight even though they are theoretically the same size of a label Since the 501s are more forgiving as far as sizing if you are buying online you might consider them instead of 505s unless you don t want the button fly 
Excellent product Well worth the price I was skeptical about needing biking shorts specially since I bike a mere ten miles a day But on the advice of some biker dudes I gave in Thank goodness for that These shorts are extremely comfortable breathable and do not bunch up to cause discomfort I was surprised The gel stuff is OK but I would not buy the product specifically for the gel padding After a while your butt gets used to the saddle anyway However for the fit breathability and comfort alone these shorts are worth every penny Excellent product 
Great Bag My leather bag arried this morning and I am so please with it It is well made of good quality leather with several pockets and sections to keep me organized I love the embossed floral design in the leather Shipping was very fast as well Thank you for a great product Chery 
Volatile Jewel Wedge Thong Pewter I love the shoes Very comfortable Only thing that I didn t like was the fact that the sequins get bent and kind of messed up Other than that I loved them I would definitely suggest them to others and I plan on getting another pair in a different color myself Two thumbs up from me 
comfort and looks good too I love this boot not only is it comfortable but it is very stylish as well 
Uncomfortable This is a very uncomfortable boot It puts a lot of stress and strain on the ankle I wear some type of boot almost everyday but could not wear these for even a few minuets My daughters could not wear them either They do look cute though We returned these boots 
Great bag I really like this bag The colors are bright it is super light weight and I really like that it has a snap and a pocket You don t see many tote bags that have either of those It s also very reasonably priced if not down right inexpensive for what you get My only beef is that the shipping cost seemed a bit pricey Maybe it was because I got 3 at once 
very satisfied When I ordered this tote I was a little aprehensive I dont like to buy things without seeing them but when It arrived on the first possible day that it could I was very pleased The bag is good quality soft and very cute I might even buy more in different colors 
I first ordered the stripped tote bag but when I recieved it I realized the white stripes might become stained quickly So I returned it for the soild blue bag I love it The blank fabric is great for adding pretty plastic decos bows buttons Great for school 
silk better than satin I bought this pair of silk sleep pants and another pair of satin sleep pants Although both were fine the silk is superior in comfort and worth the difference in price 
Great but tappered ankle These pants are nice quality and nice flowy through leg but they tapered at the ankle more than I wanted 
Nice Pants My husband really likes the Intimo Men s Classic Silk Pants They are very comfortable and the color is really nice He wears them almost every day The only complaint that we had is that the pants are a little bit short in length 
Luxury for a steal I must say I was very impressed with this item I recently wore these silk pants with a smoking jacket on a cruise ship They were very comfortable they look and feel wonderful and are worth far more than the price Another hit I don t know how these folks do it but Intimo s prices are amazing I would highly recommend these silk lounge pants 
Great Silk Pants Except Great Silk Pants Except My Husband wears a Size Large Pants in everything and with these pants I wish i would of ordered an Extra Large they are a little short on him Looks like he s waiting for a flood I ordered the Burgandy and Blue and the colors are so Deep and Rich Very Nice They wash nice also 
mens silk pajama pants these pajama bottom pants are true to size and well constructed they fit comfortably and wear well being machine washable is a real benefit as well 
Most comfortable walking shoe I just received these shoes today and I am very happy They feel like walking in a cloud They also look nice for an atlectic shoe and will make a great walking shoe for those long walks in the summer Most comfortable shoes 
Quick Fun These are awesome There are so many colors and designs to choose from and the delivery is very fast A great little item 
Exactly what I needed and for a great price I was so thrilled to find these bandanas on Amazon for my daughters 2nd birthday They were a wonderful addition to our backyard bbq theme And they arrived in plenty of time 
Well Pleased The bandannas were purchased to make a quilt My Grandmother was very happy that the item could even be found and the speed of delievry 
Toddlers Black Dress Suit Great quality worn for wedding shipped quickly would buy from this seller again in a heartbeat 
Nice Toddler Suit I ordered this for my daughter to use for a Halloween costume Our family went as A President with Secret Service Agents I needed an inexpensive black toddler suit I had a hard time finding a toddler black suit that was inexpensive No stores carried a complete suit with jacket that was less than 75 This was perfect It arrived quickly and was neatly packaged The tie was one of those zipper ties so it was easy to take on and off and to adjust It fit my daughter perfectly and I plan on handing it down to nephews and cousins to use for special occasions Well worth the price 
Nice I m a girl but i really liked this shirt so i got it in the heather gray with black sleeves in a small I like it a lot very light weight but not too thin Very cool If you re a girl ordering this order it in a size smaller than your normal because they run larger because there men sizes 
Upscale Quality at discount price Georgeous sweater Raffi sweaters do not disappoint Finest Merino wool sell for up to 100 in Men s boutique stores I bought this in beige which was a beautiful taupy oatmeal color My Dad loved it 
Great product no worries about demagnetizing cards This magnetic clip wallet is great I ve had mine for about a year now and it s worked out wonderfully Do not worry about it messing with the magnetic strips on your credit bank cards I know this was a concern for me before I bought it but it turned out to be a false impression As far as the gentleman who had problems with it demagnetizing his room key that s typical In fact since those are meant to be reprogrammed often they are not nearly as strong as credit and bank cards I ve had loose change in my pocket demagnetize room keys before Keep in mind the positives Not only is it very compact but can hold six credit cards bank cards a driver s license and more The leather wears very well Moreover it is small enough to fomfortably fit into the front pocket of my jeans Negatives Cannot hold fat wads of money which isn t a problem for me but could be for others 
Good Quality Fast service I received this product in three days and was happy with the quality of the product Wallet did not come in a box so I had to find one as this was a gift 
Great front pocket wallet It was just as I expected and I am 100 satisfied with quality and cost of product 
Simply the Best The right size fine leather and room for just the right amount of cards I looked at and tried many but this is the very best 
Great money clip This is a great money clip I like the magnetic clip and it has ample room for credit cards drivers license etc Good value at a resonable price 
Great buy My boots are beautifull extremly comfortable and great for long walks and trips Besides everybody likes them Great buy to me 
Great deal on this coat I like the coat It fits well and keeps the cold out as well as the wind Well worth the price I paid 
great jacket This is a very nice jacket for the price It is roomy enough to wear a sweater or a sport jacket underneath and looks quite nice I am a medium and it fits exactly the way that I would expect a winter jacket to fit 
great item I love the jacket looks very nice and fits well Plenty of pockets great inner lining I had the sleeves lengthened because i have long arms One of the loops that holds the inner inning broke but not a big deal I got a great price and a great product 
cold wash only Some weeks ago I bought two Prana Yoga Tank one 100 cotton and a Dry Tech one and an yoga Momentum Short I am very satisfied about the great comfort in wearing and the beautiful style of these products But what I don t understand is the fact I can wash them only cold How is that possible normaly you can wash cotton cloths at least in 40 degrees Celcius Also my 100 synthetic running gear I can wash in 40 degrees Since I practice a rather active form of yoga I also sweat a lot It think would be more fresh hygienic if I could wash my Prana clothing at least on 40 degrees Why does Prana design beautiful sports wear you can t wash in a proper way 
Great Product The bodysuit was great and our family loved the saying I will definitely buy more of these bodysuits 
Cute but sizing wrong I bought a couple of these bodysuits because I thought that they were quite amusing The quality seems ok I have not washed them yet so I can t comment on the color fastness the dark blue seems a like it may fade The first thing I noticed was that the bodysuits are very long They are not the stardard length you get with Gerber and Carter s etc The 0 3 mths has the length of a normal 6 9mth bodysuit The chest area is ok but the armholes are a bit small In the bigger sizes the armholes seem normal I have to wait until my son gets here to decide if I will convert the smaller ones into tees This would have gotten 5 stars if the sizing was right Hope this helps future buyers 
it s beautiful I LOVE THIS SCARF It is light enough for comfort and large enough for warmth The colors are magnificent 
Supremely comfortable While it s hard to rave about underwear these deserve it They are by far the most comfortable I own 
Inconsistent Cut and Fit I bought a sheer jersey t shirt in Apricot and another in Light Blue both size Medium I really like the light weight stretchy and soft fabric of both tees but the cuts are inconsistent The Apricot is very baggy and the blue is form fitting which I prefer Incidentally neither shirt is even close to sheer they are just light weight fabric and cooler and more comfortable than standard heavy duty t shirts 
Looks pretty good for a novelty tie I brought this cheap as a novelty tie but I was surprised at the quality of the product The contrast of the colors is clear and the material doesn t feel cheap I would definitely recommend the product 
Carhartt jacket My son needed a new jacket for shop class We immedialtely decided that a Carharrt or similar jacket would be best We ordered one through Amazon because they carried my son s size men s small which is very difficult to find They also carried a color that he wanted grey All I can say is that since it arrived he has worn it everyday It now appropriately and proudly bears oil and vaious other stains It is made very well and should last for quite a long time We may need to purchase a different one made for warmer weather in a month or two 
Carhart Detroit Jacket This is a very comfortable jacket for temperatures down to about 25 
Fantastic I love this dress Arrived very quickly and fit perfectly Bought it for my birthday party and everyone said I looked amazing in it 
great shoes I am a teacher and I love these shoes They are comfortable to wear all day and they look great with pants or skirts I bought a pair of black and brown this past summer I loved them so much that I bought two more pair so that I ll have them when the first two pairs wear out 
Great Find No store in my area had my size and I was happy to find them on line Great service 
Awesome Awesome item and it looks and feels great lots of room and very durable Ok shipping it probably could have been faster if we would have ordered straight from them 
Excellent An excellent fit the right amount of support without being uncomfortable A lightweight sleek design I can wear under any top 
Fabulous Wrap Unbelievable Price for the Quality I love this wrap Beautiful organza fabric which I love because it isn t limp and droopy Holds a GREAT shape and looks like a million bucks Just the right length too doesn t hang too low like I ve seen with some lesser quality wraps Shipped protected well in lightweight packaging that saves on shipping charges yet protects from damage in shipping or outside elements An unbelievable price too I ve seen them double even triple the price in many retail stores Very pleased 
Great item great price and fast service Unlike other stores that charge huge premiums for shipping this store keeps costs down by shipping in an envelope which I appreciated Fabric felt lovely and luxurious a quick steam and I was ready to party Highly recommend one of these wraps for any formal event 
gift for daughter My Daughter loved getting this for Valentines She is in college and wears it every night She said all the girls have bought them now 
It s a Good Sweatshirt How to review a sweatshirt I like Adidas fleece sweatshirts like this They ve got good colors don t fade much if you wash them properly and they re stylish Of this type I picked up a vibrant orange one which lets people see me from about 30 miles away and a grey one The logo isn t overbearing it s just enough to say it s a good brand But mroe than anything this is so soft With the fall and winter coming up I m glad I have my fleece sweatshirts Although technically there are others that are great too But these are great cause I also matched them perfectly with several Adidas headbands And that is my review on this sweatshirt It s soft and warm perfect if you went to the gym for a work out showered and want something soft for the way home 
great schoolbag umbrella This umbrella is very well made It collapses so small and flat and weighs next to nothing which is perfect because I bought it to go in my son s school backpack 
Great Item + Great Service I am very happy with the product and on top of that it was shipped without any delay 
A+ These sunglasses are an amazing deal They arrived today and I was surprised at how heavy they were They fit my face after a little tweaking If you loose sunglasses often and or don t want to spend an arm and a leg on a pair of sunglasses this is the way to go 
This sunglasses are very very good for the price I ve been using this sunglasses for about three weeks and I am very impressed You see everything clear I have the ones silver ice and when the sun is totally out these are the ones For less than 10 bucks is good deal Quality on material is very good If you are like me who don t like to spend money on fashioned designers sunglasses take a chance on this one or other from this supplier Shadow Source 
Chicago Bears T Shirt I loved the shirt It arrived sooner than expected and in perfect condition At this site I was able to find a wide variety of Chicago Bears shirts which was impossible at the stores in my town The price was consistent with other places too so I didn t need to pay more for exactly what I wanted 
Great Basic Little Black Dress Although rather cheaply made you won t get years of life out of this material this dress is still worth adding to your wardrobe Classic cut never goes out of style and you can easily formalize it up or down with the appropriate accessories 
Disney Cars shoes Our 2 1 2 year old grandson LOVES all sorts of cars He is thrilled to have Car Shoes Easy on and off Love the flashing lights The shoes are well made Would buy again and again 
Disney Cars light up shoes My grandson LOVED these because they were Cars shoes and it didn t hurt that they light up when he walks and stomps around 
ADORABLE These shoes are fantastic Not only are they super cute but they stay nice and clean My son wears them ALL the time and dirt just doesn t stick so they always look very nice The velcro shield on the front makes it easy for my toddler to take off and put on his own shoes 
A very happy 4 year old My boy could not have been happier and Santa sure got a 5 star rating this past Christmas for having thought of these sneakers he hadn t even asked for Only place he doesn t wear them is to bed which doesn t mean he hasn t tried 
Perfect Boy Toddler Sneakers This is a really nice little toddler sneaker It slips on and off easily thanks to the big velcro flap on the top of the sneaker The sides have little make believe tires and the sneakers flash every time the child takes a step They are of excellent quality and sturdy enough to last till they are outgrown My grandson absolutly loves them 
great deal I was able to get a great pair of pants for really cheap enough said 
very nice trousers Lovely trousers but on the third order that I made through Amazon the price was quoted as 47 70 pair which I thought was a pre Father s Day sale price but Jos A Bank added an extra charge for the trousers to reflect the price of 59 90 pair which I had paid previous to what I assumed was a reduction That seems a bit misleading to me either on the part of Amazon or Jos A Bank Would be nice if one or the other would be completely accurate in their price quotation Otherwise I have no complaint about the products looks or quality 
So cute I love this brush set Sonia Kashuk s brushes are reasonably priced and high in quality This set is super cute and it stays shut by a magnet at the end of the roll It s a pretty powerful one also I feared that i would stuff the zip compartment too full and wouldn t be able to keep it rolled but the magnet holds It s definitly worth the 20 bucks 
Easy to Stitch on I bought these to stitch the Fire Station Name on for a Christmas present Caps were just what I wanted I liked that you had the color range of colors that is so hard to find 
Calvin Klein These are my husband s favorite brand type of underwear Wash and wear are great very high quality of cotton Comfortable fit and would highly recommend 
They do the job well They are soft made of quality fabric snug but not too snug 
Boxer Briefs From Heaven What more do I ned to say they fit great wash well and they are very comfortable 
Luggage Tags These are great in that they only provide your name when looking at the tag The address is hidden which is good for confidentially I bought the neon green ones and they helped in identifying your luggage when you went to the turn stall to pick up your luggage 
Adidas Men s Santiossage Sandals These are good sandals They feel good on your feet after you ve been in shoes all day I got these when amazon was selling them for 9 99 A recommended purchase and I would buy them again 
Good sandals after you get used to it This sandal is nice It takes a bit of getting used to since you dont typically have things poking into the bottom of your feet Wear a sock and after you are used to the sandal it will actually feel pretty comfortable Excellent sandals to bring to the swimming pool Quality is good I gave it 4 since it is not the best design to adapt to but the quality is superb 
Great Sandals These are great sandals They may hurt your feet a little if you are not used to them but I think they are still one of the best you can buy 
Nice shoes Year Round I have owned these slip ons over the year having bought them locally for about 25 00 a pair They are great in the summer I also use them as slippers at home I m a Bug Guy and ordinary slippers do not give my feet the support I need So I end up getting aching feet With these the aching feet are gone Plus the sole area against your feet make you feet feel like their getting a massage while you walk Lastly the velcro closure provides a snug fit I highly recommend them 
comfort and classy too I was delighted with the shoes when I pulled them from the box Shiny leather that has a classic look can wear to work or running errands and look uptown Comfortable enough to wear on long walk 
Prompt delivery The delivery and the product was good I got what i was expecting 
Perfect light rain jacket I drove all over town looking for a light summer rain jacket and couldn t find any I liked for under 80 I found this one on Amazon and decided to give it a try It arrived a month ago and I love it Its the perfect weight for those summer rain storms has a great vent in the back to keep you cool and the fit is excellent Columbia really did their research on the fit The hood fits nicely into the collar without being too heavy around your neck when you have it stored The price is amazing too It shocked me when I opened the box and saw a 49 price tag hanging from it when I payed 20 less than that Great great jacket 
Great service Fast and product was as expected Thank you so much for your fast service and wonderful product I love the shoes 
These shoes are wonderful I LOVE THESE SHOES Let me say it again I LOVE THESE SHOES They are so super cute and easy to walk in considering the size of the heel They are quite tall but not bad Anyway who cares they look awesome on I have never gotten so many compliments on any pair of shoes I own 
Great Quality Bought this for my son he had been looking for a jogging suit like they had in the 80 s and this was the 07 version 
Beautiful shoes Comfortable too I m loving these I bought them in brown because they looked great and the price was so cheap on sale when i got them i was pleasantly suprised how nice they also looked in real life And they feel really comfortable even with the high heel I get compliments on them all the time love em 
Waiting to go back on sale I am waiting for these boots to go back on sale I got them for under 60 3 weeks ago and been waiting for them to go down again For those who got them in April did you get them on sale price or regular My girlfriend and my sister in laws want to get these as well They are very comfy 
MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOT by NINE WEST I could kick myself with another pair of boots for not grabbing up the other two colors This boot is AWESOME The L K the fit and the comfort BEYOND WORDS 
greate boots these boots are not only super cute they are the most comfie boots I ever bought money well spen 
What a deal I am so pleased with these boots Not only are they adorable on but they are also comfortable The leather is rich in color and very high quality What a great deal 
FABULOUS These boots are absolutely one of the most beautiful pair I have purchased in a long time Great workmanship quality in material and comfortable too Not to mention that they re very eye catching I bought all 3 colors and have received tons of compliments Would highly recommend 
One of the best Nine West boots They re comfortable stylish and if you get them below 100 you ve gotten a great deal 
Very Comfortable I bought this boot since it was on sale and I needed a new boot for next season Well I had to wear them to a wedding this past month and I really like them The heel is low enough that I was dancing all nite I really like the back zip it is actually kind of sexy and I was getting compliments all nite on them The reason I have 4 stars instead of 5 is that I am not a larger woman at all 5ft 10 and 140 pounds and these boots were tight on my calves Once I got into the and strecthed them out a bit they were fine 
These Boots are Made for Walking These boots are some of the most comfortable shoes I ve ever worn I m a teacher and stand on my feet all day Usually at the end of the day my feet are aching but in the Despina I was not only stylish but comfortable The Despina can add glamour to any everday outfit and are a definite head turner of both men and women They are so fierce I own all three colors 
handy its really handy when i m going to parks where i know i m going to be buying lots but dont want to carry it its tiny and convinient the only problem is it is a bit flimsy so you cant carry heavy things with it often but to carry free toys and flyers and coupons that you pick up while walking a festival its ideal 
great wrap bras This bra is very comfortable for both day or night Many wrap bras bind when you push the fabric down or to the side but this bra has enough stretch to be comfortable This is probably a bra best for those with smaller chests 
Cute and comfortable This pair of shorts are really cute and comfortable They are really short and the material is really soft The waist fits quite well and the leg holes are comfortable I purchased a size medium and I am a size 6 and they were perfect If you have thick legs i would not recommend But if you have toned legs they are great for revealing them 
Nice shirts French cuffs aren t for everyone but if you want a little formal style this is a very nice shirt 
wrinkly but nice The shirt came very timely and the packaging was in good condition I gave this to my husband for a gift and so when he actually openedthe package it was VERY wrinkled We had to first steam the item and then iron it but it came out good and is all I had hoped it would be 
Wonderful shoes Les Birkenstock sont r�put�es mais ch�res Betula r�alise une copie sous licence tout � fait remarquable Those american shoes are now living in France and they re happy to be there Bravo pour la qualit� du produit et la rapidit� d exp�dition 
Betula Birkenstock clogs These shoes are great My daughter wears them to school almost every day I like the way they look and they are easy to slide on and off This is a good value for the money 
Poor product that had to be repaired The shoes I ordered came 2 days after promised Then to make matters worse the rivets holding straps on both shoes came off in transit I had to pay shoe shop 13 00 to repair in order to make Christmas obligations I would not recommend purchasing shoes through Amazon My book order shipping to my nephew in VA went very well I should add Kudos for books thumbs down for Birks 
The Bomb My daughter loves them they were her Christmas gift this year She wears them every day A great alternative the the full price Boston Birkenstock Clog 
betula clogs Likes the clogs a lot very comfy Wish they were real Birkenstocks They were purchased for a 13 yr ol 
Happy Feet I have always bought the knock off birkenstocks and getting a few months of occasional wearing and the first few times wearing them having blistered feet and toes With the birkenstocks from birkenstock I have never been happier with any pair of shoes they are like slippers they keep my feet toasty warm and slid on and off with ease I have been wearing them every day scince christmas and not one blister and my arches feel great They are so comfortable and totally worth the price I am a name brand buyer for birkenstocks atleast now I know you will be happy too 
Sexy Thigh High Stockings Best priced for this item online Great merchant with fast delivery and caring customer service Will be buying lots of these 
Does it get any better The shipping was fast price was spectacular and the shoes are fabulous My local retailer large chain store is currently selling this shoe at 3 times what I paid for them at Amazon 
Exquisite I ve received many complements when wearing this shoe It s simple sexy inexpensive elegant AND comfortable An unbeatable combination 
Classic slingback This is a beautiful shoe with an elegant profile It is velvet though not described this way They are comfortable and not too high but still very ladylike and sexy They have a more pointed toe than they appear in the picture 
gorgeous Possibly the most flattering shoes I ve ever worn and a steal at the price The quality is excellent and the sizing seems to be true Keeping in mind that these are high heels and not meant to be walking shoes they re also quite comfortable the slingback is both more flattering and more practical than a standard pump you can actually buy a size that fits and have it stay on your foot no cramming your foot into a shoe that s too small just so it ll stay on Very classy high quality shoe I ll have these for years 
AK Klein Women s Makaya Sling Black 8 M I love the shoe would like another pair in Navy Can you find for me 
Super value These boat shoes are nearly identical to the ones in Bass catalog And at a fraction of the cost I would say they are a super deal My husband is very pleased and they have a great look and style If you are in the market for boat shoes I don t think you can go wrong 
Passport Holder This passport holder is everything I hoped for and it was delivered in a quick and timely manner It is 5 stars plus 
Boarding Pass Holder This item is great for traveling especially when in line at the airport Your ID and boarding pass are secure in the see thru pockets thus leaving your hands free Would highly recomend this for all travelers 
Not Under Armour I gave this as a gift to somebody and it is excellent quality but its just not as cool as the same product by Under Armour 
Flimsy but fun Although I did have a tough time with the more flimsy constitution of this top the front lace up was a plus and my boyfriend s reaction was even better What is it with guys and stuff that laces up Other than that I would say that if you need major support from a bra this might not be for you Also if you are on the larger side width wise this might actually be a good purchase since it is lace up and therefore adjustable in a wider range 
Nice Ballet shoes The sizing is off but the shoes are great Wonderful quality and great price 
Good Customer Service The rack is great and my husband loved it The product is of high quality Since I misunderstood the size of the rack I called customer service and was amazed at the professionalism and help I received when I was a little upset Great experience all around 
Comfortable every day pants These pants are well constructed I order the petite and it does not need hemming They wear well wash well I have worn the same pants during the day to a yoga class walking the dog and dress it up in the evening to go the Kennedy Center I have 7 pair and wear them every day They are a great value 
The best for sleeping This is by far the best nursing bra I tried for sleeping I am full figured 34F and a sleeping bra was a must while I nursed I found this bra to be both comfortable and easy to use while half asleep I didn t feel that it had the best support for daytime use but I imagine that if you were smaller busted it would work just fine during the day as well I had a difficult time translating my bra size to S M L type sizing but I sent an email to a Medela rep on their website with my conventional bra size and she replied that I would need a large I would definitely recommend this bra to others 
Love this bra I wasn t sure I would like this bra After trying it I purchased a second It is so comfortable to wear and easy to operate the clasp for nursing The only downfall is that it isn s flattering under shirts because of its sportsbra fit But it is so comfprtable that I wear it anyway I highly recommend this to anyone 
A great sleep bra I wear a size 40DD nursing bra and I purchased this bra in size XL It really is very comfortable it doesn t bind the fabric breathes and the shoulder straps don t cut into my shoulders However the stretchiness of the fabric makes this a rather loose fitting bra I probably could have gone with the large size instead of extra large I would certainly never wear this bra while exercising I ve found it s best as a sleeper bra It holds nursing pads in very well even when lying down and rolling over repeatedly and it s the most comfortable bra I own to sleep in Buy something with more support for during the day but use this one at night 
Light Support Maximum Comfort Though I really liked Bravado bras for my nursing my first baby I decided to try these with my second The fabric is very soft stretchy and comfortable and washes well The packaging for this one says you can put it in the dryer and so far 4 months it s faired well It s great for sleeping in during the early weeks when you really need something to hold yourself and the breastpads in But if you re over a B or C cup it s probably not your best choice for daywear except around the house Try Medelas other bras for that If your at the top end of the range for your size go ahead and get the next size up as they do run a little small 
Great shoes These shoes are great because they are so comfortable I work a job where i am walking for 8 to 9 hours a day I can t say my feet are not tired but these shoes make it bearable 
Love these shoes I love these shoes especially at 30 dollars The leather feels very comfy the sole provides great support for my flat foot and the side zippers are of very good quality I would wear these shoes everyday except that I should have ordered it half a size larger its just a little to snug around my ankles but nothing I cannot tolerate 
breezies are pure comfort I never had a bra feel so comfortable And the price was so much less than on the tv shopping show 
ehhhhh thought it waz going to be better i would of rather boughtin one that cost 25 or more not wat i expectd 
Nice Colors Loved the top but it was a little clingy It is very versatile and will go with a wide range of colors 
Love it very comfortable Very comfortable shirt with lots of stretch but still looks good 
Great top This is a very nice looking top Fits well I love it 
Really Cute This is a really nice bag if you re looking for something small and easy to carry It s a nice drab olive and the pen holder is very convienent The only problem I have is the velcro on the phone pocket doesn t stick very well and opens a little too easliy 
Not too shabby I was looking for a small bag that would hopefully only carry the essentials plus a book a regular sized paperback not a Little Webster Ideally I want one that would carry the essentials ID plastic cash cell sunglasses pen and notepad as well as a book and a water bottle but I was just shooting for most of my desires This little bag holds my essentials just dandy but it s just shy of carrying a paperback for me So for the most part I hardly use that second large zippered pocket The Velcroed cell phone pocket is roomy for my flip phone but not too roomy Next to the pen holder is a small zippered pocket which runs deep behind the pen and cell phone pockets ample space for a notepad The front main zippered compartment holds a small zippered pocket inside that is great for cash and cards The shoulder strap is removable and there are straps on the back for looping through a belt or whatnot I never found it necessary but you may find it useful While it wasn t quite what I was hoping for it is a good bag all in all Oh and fair warning the bag absolutely stank when it arrived Blame it on the chemicals that fabrics are treated with but you will want to toss it in the wash when you get it And it survives it just fine 
Classy Jean Jacket This is a great looking Demin Jacket The fit is very flattering Highly Recommend 
Not as described The 3 T Shirts we ordered were not as pictured and were smaller than the size guide We did however receive a refund less shipping costs after many phone calls to the seller and amazon The seller does not promtly return phone calls 
Relago para mi hermano Compre este par de zapatos como regalo de Navidad para mi hermano El mismo los escogio Por lo que he escuchado de El dice que son muy rigidos y fuertes cuando estan recien en uso pero ya se moldearon y son mas suaves Le gusta la calidad de material del mismo el color y comodidad Es recomendad 
these are great socks I love Children s Place socks My kids are very wierd about the way their socks feel and these seem to be just right Not too thick not too thin don t bunch up anywhere fit perfectly and no bulky seams They also come in lots of colors and last a really long time I passed them through three kids before seeing holes 
basic socks These socks are really thick and well made The color never fades and they don t ball up when washed like cheaper socks do They last as long as your child fits in them even longer These are wonderful for wearing pants or dresses Very well made and worth the price 
My favorite pants I would have liked to give these pants 4 5 stars The half of star I am subtracting is because they can be expensive if they are not on sale They are nice looking enough to wear to work I work at a high school where the dress code is casual business attire or to wear on the weekends I like the detailing on the sides of the legs and the front pockets The rise is almost 9 so they are a low waisted pant resting just under the belly button which is a major reason why they appeal to me so much The texture on the outside is a very low pile velvety fabric that runs on the diagonal The insides are soft enough to sleep in These pants are so comfortable I wish I could wear them everyday They have stretch I refuse to wear stretch jeans but the stretch is great in these pants Stretchy jeans will stretch out of shape but these pants look and feel as new as the day I bought them which is going on a year now 
Ultra Comfort These are the most comfortable socks I ve ever worn Whether they re worth such a premium price won t be known until I see how long they last Other Wigwam socks I ve owned have lasted practically forever 
Works for me I use them for work socks I have sweaty feet I wear steel toed boots They work better then cotten socks for keeping my feet dry 
Good quality but way large size My husband has always been wearing 32 so I ordered 32 for him It turned out to be 34 or 36 I don t want to go through the hassel to return it and get refund probably only partial of that because it breaks the free shipping policy The fabric and stitches are good though 
great shirt This shirt wicks well It s good for spring and fall and has a good selection of colors Very happy with this produc 
Just like my father s I highly recomend Fruit of the Loom mens briefs Not only did grow up wearing their brand but my father and his father before him all wore these briefs If somethings not broke why fix it 
the best this is the best fitting bra I ve ever bought Very comfortable and great quality 
1 5 Inch Deluxe Military Fabric Belt by CTM Olive The product was as advertised and delivered on time 
Wink Wink I brought this item for a friend of mine yes you guest it we are better friends now 
Awesome This item came in a timely manner and was packaged well too I highly recommend this seller and will continue to do business Thank 
comfortable supportive Wow I was pretty impressed with this it was comfortable and supportive 
The Jersey is good The jersey of Real Madrid 2007 is pretty and high quality 
Amazing This is the alternative shirt of Real Madrid FC the desing is great the color the fabric so I recomend it 100 HALA MADRID 
Love em I love these shoes After putting 250 miles on the first pair I bought I bought two more in different colors to stockpile away just in case they discontinue this model 
A perfect fit I bought this mainly based on the the other users exp with International Jock And they proved why they are popular I bought a set of 3 different ones and they all fit snugly and this one can also be used as a regular HOT underwear Over all a 5 sta 
My favorite sandal I have 6 pair of the Scout and have had more that I have worn out They are the most comfortable sandal I have ever worn and I am about to purchase another pair I am 76 years old and have problems with balance and my back and have had foot surgery and the Scout keeps me moving 
After wearing the scout I have always liked Naturalizer shoes and had some similar to the Scout in the past I like the fact that I can adjust their tightness by moving the tab at the closing My only difficulty is that as yet they are a bit stiff However I expect them to become more supple after wearing them for some time Nancy Hol 
Oh so comfy This is the third time I have purchased this shoe it is so comfortable my other shoes are jealous as they sit silently in the closet collecting dust If you want a comfortable shoe a good looking shoe I recomment this one And the price was right 
Beautiful By far the prettiest shoes I found for my wedding I had to exchange them for a size 7 and I always wear a size 6 I am not sure why the others said to order a half size smaller They are very lovely though and fairly comfy 
Order your true size I received these shoes in the color latte satin in the size that I normally wear I m sure glad that I didn t go down a half a size or even a whole size like the other reviews had said about this shoe Very pretty shoe though 
Perfect Wedding Shoes I ordered these any a few other pairs for my wedding I finally went with these because they were so comfortable but really cute too I was on my feet all day and did not even THINK about my feet once I can t even GO to someone else s wedding and say that I love shoes and usually fall for shoes that hurt my feet But these did not and I got a few compliments on them from those who actually saw my feet that day highly recommended 
WONDERFUL These shoes are great I got them on sale for under 40 plus free shipping A great bargain They arrived quickly and are just beautiful Very sexy shoe I can not wait to wear them for my wedding I would certainly order a size down from your usual size 
Great for Men With Long Torsos This T Shirt is ideal for men with long torsos In my experience these shirts are soft and well fitted out of the bag and remain so through at least 10 washings After that they tend to stop holding their shape and should be replaced 
fitted t shirt These tees are made with a smooth jersey that is lighter in weight than most standard t shirts They re quite fitted with a tapered waist and hit slightly above the hip If you prefer a t shirt with more drape and a longer length you may want to op for the men s version of this t shirt one size smaller 
Perfection This skirt fits beautifully is just the right length and coordinates perfectly with both business and casual outfits alike Rally Tennis were so quick with the order in shipping that to my surprise it had arrived before things I d ordered rush delivery The skirt was in pristine condition when it arrived I would most definitely do business with this merchant again 
DARK BROWN SANDALS GREAT COMPANY TO PURCHASE FROM GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND FAST SHIPPING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MAKING SHOPPING A PLEASURE ON THE INTERNET 
Good Wallet The slots for the cards could be just a bit deeper they stick out a little more than I d like Other than that I ve nothing but satisfaction Shipped promptly and well packaged 
Very happy to say the least I thought this was just going to be another wallet and it is but it s not Once I received it I took off the tags and put it to use Now I am in the military and stationed in Italy so in my wallet I have Dollars and Euro Normal American dollars fit just fine into my new wallet however the Euro sticks out just a bit but not enough to be a problem Also I have uniform standards that I must adhere to so I like not having a wallet bulging out in my back pocket and it does not leave a wallet mark on my uniforms So I must say that all in all I was very happy with my purchase and have no plans to go back to a normal back pocket wallet or any other brand any times soon 
Very Pretty good price good quality shimmy s great coins on secure nice material GREAT for practice 
Love it I love the skirt I have used it in my classes and gotten many compliments on it It holds up So far no coins have fallen off unlike other coin hip skirts I have 
Wiggles are a BIG hit This shirt is colorful and seems to be a thick t shirt too My daughter loves it and I m sure it will get worn alot 
Great Quality My toddlers love them I ordered two of these shirts for my 17 month old twins They absolutely love the shirts as they love the Wiggles The shirts are excellent quality a heavier quality cotton 
Berkshire Extra Wear Lycra Pantyhose Queen Size 4489 The extra panel makes these the greatest for those of us amply endowed It is so nice to not have the seams in the back and crotch rip out before the rest of the nylon is hardly worn I only gave it a 4 star review because little pulls do come fairly soon I think I will try the full support ones and maybe this won t be an issue Thanks for a great and much needed product 
Too Good to be True Boots I have looked for these boots since I saw them in Macy s In Macy s department store they priced for double the amount I purchased the boots for on Amazon Brand NEW I could not have been more pleased If you are looking for a stylish sophisticated and sleek look for the rest of the cold season definitely purchase these boots I receive numerous compliments on the boots and the quality is wonderful I hope you find this review helpful Oh one more thing the delivery was very quick and efficient I had absolutely no problem The only thing is you must know your size I bought a 7 5 even though I should have bought a size 7 but they did not have 7s in stock And they feel great 
Nine West Women s Jaydon Boot Dk Natural Leather These boots are beautiful chic and comfortable I am terrifically pleased with the color and quality of the leather and fur trim and with the fine design and workmanship as well I have purchased Nine West shoes in the past and will continue to do so in the future Sincerely Elenore 
SO SEXY I LOVE THEM THEY ARE SO SEXY I HAVE THE TAN AND THE BLACK AND IF THEY GET MORE COLORS I WILL BUY THEM TOO THANKS TERR 
LOVE THEM SO MUCH These are definitely comfortable and true to size I bought the black ones since the they didn t have the tan in my size I absolutely love them and think they are so stylish fun and cute I m glad I got the black ones because they go well with so many outfits Definitely a keeper 
Super Cool The fit is amazing and the look is just spectacular Yet another steal Thanks 
Better strap This is pretty much the same Sensi zore type sandal I purchased a few years ago Same footbed and sole however the strap is now one piece and conforms to the top of the foot much better 
Clark Nellie Shoes I ordered a half size larger than I wear and these fit perfectly Nice and warm Very comfy shoes right out of the box I love Born shoes and these Clarks fit much the same as the Borns 
My husbands absolute favorite shirts My brother bought a couple of these T s for my husbands birthday and he wants more They are great as an undershirt or to wear by itself They are a great quality A little on the thicker side compared to Hanes or similar We have since bought him a few more They are a little pricey but well worth it Plus they are made in the US 
Hugs and Kisses for XOXO This little bag is adorable AND affordable take it from someone who is sick of seeing Coach around every corner It is lined with a beautiful pastel blue satin The bag is pretty durable and I have gotten SO many compliments on it It is not for the gal who likes to carry everything in her bag but has room for a phone small wallet and a few other essentials Love it 
Stride Rite My 2 5 y o son refused to wear sandals saying they all hurt his feet As a last resort I decided to try these He loves them He is able to run in these as if he were wearing sneakers 
The Coolest Pumas Man This Shoes are so confortable The only bad thing is that there just are in black and white 
Cute Shoe I have these in tan and am waiting for spring so I can use them Cute comfy and low priced What more could you want I think they run true to size 
great pump Nice detail on a basic shoe Good in comfort for a long day on my feet 
Love them Hope they ll last Hold my feet and protect my ankles I m no T Mac but with these shoes I can start dreaming 
Great looking shoes I ordered the Brown The shoes do look better in the flesh and the buckle on the brown is a light bronze colour They felt like slippers from the start My only complaint is that the metal buckle is a little beaten up on the surface it s not smooth Looking close it s noticable but looking down once wearing them it s not Classy shoes for work and play 
Question on size I usually wear size 13 but I m not sure about which size I should buy 13N 13W or13 
Look Sharp Feel Sharp These are same shoes Men s Warehouse sells for 100 They fit very well and are very comfortable I definitely would buy again 
Great shoes I purchased these shoes for a wedding and received many compliments on them I was leary about dancing in them as they lacked a back strap but they stayed on nicely and were true to size I ll get plenty of use out of them 
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT I reviewed many hats before purchasing this one and boy did I get the right one it has a wide brim with stitching which blocks the sun all around and the stitching provides some thickness to the brim so it does not flop around in the wind like a floppy hat brim will Last year I had a floppy hat and had lots of problems with the wind either blowing the brim up and it would expose her whole face to the bright sun or blowing the brim down into her face and she couldn t see we live near the beach so it s windy most the time gorgeous color easy to reverse so you have two color options good drawstring a must have for my 2 y o fits good my 2 y o s head circumfrence is 18 5 inches she s got a big grape and I bought the medium which is perfect Great hat very happy with it I even went back and bought a second one and don t forget it has 50 upf 
Reebok Red Sox Slippers I bought these as a present for Christmas they came super fast and my boyfriend LOVES them 
Reebok slipper I purchased the slippers as a gift for someone and the person loved them They arrived earlier then expected so that was great The slippers are being worn all the time and are comfortable It was nice to see such a large selection of slippers and to find these 
Soo Cute I absolutely love these jeans They are so cute and they make you look super skinny I got a size 3 and they fit pretty good The only thing that is bad is that they don t have spandex in them so they were tight for a while and then they got loose so either I lost weight or they got less tight But yep the way they flare is super cool making them look good with any pair of shoes Get them because they are frikkin awesome 
Great bag for the buck Plenty of room for all your gym supplies Easy to throw over your shoulder or grab the hand straps Very nice 
Very good bag I recently received this duffel I love the color and it is plenty big enough for me I go to the gym a lot even during my lunch hour sometimes and it s big enough for change of clothes towel flip flops and any reading material I m bringing The two side pockets are large enough for me I keep my shampoo conditioner body wash razor a can of mousse and deodorant in one side and I put my little gym towel for sweating and a water bottle in the other side One thing that you really can t tell from the photos is that one of the side pockets has a couple inches of open mesh on the bottom of the pocket so your stuff can at least dry out a little It s perfect for what I need it for and it fits in the gym lockers way better than my old gigantic Adidas bag 
High marks for seller Purchased this for my wife at Christmas Received it in perfect condition and on time Thank 
DISPLEASED i own this bag in a blue color it seemed nice but after 4 months the strapp is starting to tear off the bag now im shopping for a replacment 
great I received it fast in the exact size and very nice packaging and condition with return slip for sure im not gonna return it 
Great Boot Very nice quality very good looking surprisingly comfortable and fit perfectly I took a chance and ordered online probably wouldn t have if the sale price hadn t been good as I ve never ordered shoes online before so I m especially pleased 
as expected I was very pleased with this item it was exactly as expected I was worried about this bra being true to size and was delighted that it fit properly This bra is also comfortable I wanted to avoid an underwire and was pleased that this bra has great support without the underwire and is much cheaper than bras sold in the maternity stores 
Armani Dress This dress is timeless The cut is body concious yet conservative The quality is superb Definately a must have in your designer wardrobe 
Good for a slim fit I m usually a boxer brief guy but if I go boxer this is the choice Slim fit but it doesn t yank or take on its own life to move things around in ways you don t want them to I guess that interprets as the bottom seam is not made too high or too low Material isn t super rigid but doesn t see to take on lint or fuzz balls I wouldn t call them necessarily warm or cool material just typical but the weight of them feels light 
great deal shirt and sweatshirt are great sweatshirt is a bit thin but soft and comfy love i 
Bundle is the way to go The bundle can be worn on warm and chilly days to support my favorite college team and alma mater Material is good for both the t shirt and hoodie For the quality and price can t beat it anywhere 
Great Sweatshirt I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter It looks wonderful on her It is not heavy duty but also not skimpy It s a medium weight sweatshirt 
Great boots I just love these boots They are very comfortable I hike often and volunteer at a zoo so I spend quite a bit of time on my feet and walking usually with my 10 month old daughter in a backpack on my back on uneven terrain I love the comfort and stability of these boots They were also shipped in a timely manner which I really appreciate 
I love it I ve bought this product twice and I absolutely love it It s very beautiful 
cool I loved my boots they are so cool and people always wanna know where I bought the 
Great t shirt I bought this shirt for my husband and he loves it The fit and the colors are great 
Good Look They look nice and are decently comfortable They work for me I would buy them again 
not happy i order those shoes because they matched the dress perfectly then the shoes arrived they were brown nothing like the picture on the site 
can you ever go wrong with black mesh This was a gift for my husband not to wear but to look at me wearing and he was very pleased with it as was I It is not a whole lot of anything which in this case is perfect and does its job nicely 
BOATER SHOE WALKS DRY LAND I purchased these because they looked low profile to fit on my feet inside my playboat and they do great but they also rock just kickin around the yard town playing in puddles w my kids great Keen shoe Super comfortable and so lightweight you can barely feel them I want some more colors 
can your prada bag charge my cell phone I have had this bag for a little over a year and I love it Ok some stuff you need to know this bag will charge your cellphone ipod pda camera and AA and AAA batteries ipod and batteries require purchase of seperate adaptors you can find them at I think it takes about 6 8 hours to charge from nothing using the sun but you can confirm that on the above website It also has an adaptor to charge the battery at home or in the car This backpack will NOT charge your laptop The space provided for the solar collection isn t big enough There are seperate solar arrays that you can purchase that fold up and go in a backpack i ve seen them for about 200 The upside to the backpack is that you don t have to be stationary for it to be collecting power unlike the folding arrays I wear mine while walking around chicago or cycling to and from work and school The bag isn t much heavier than a non solar bag Infact once i put all my school books in it i couldn t tell the difference between the weight of this one and my old bag Even in the cold chicago winter i can get a charge on a relatively clear day i e it doesn t have to be hot outside just sunny Also be aware that this bag has a battery that stores the power you collect until you re ready to use it some other manufactures have no battery which means that you have to be in the sun when you want to charge something I didn t purchase my bag through amazon though i must say i m thrilled that they are carrying it now I dealt directly with voltaic systems and their customer service is on point i hope this review was helpful to you 
Lovely bra great price fit and minimizer I dread bra shopping Trying them on one after another only to end going home without And the concept of the minimizer had intrigued me Most I d come across though were either out of my price range or looked too utilitarian So I was both excited and cautiously hopeful when I came across this Bali bra online When it arrived and I tried it on it was perfect The fit was true to size and it was very comfortable I got out my tape measure to see if it reduced my bust measurement by the amount stated in the product information It did I was 1 and 1 2 inches smaller and able to wear some clothes I had always loved but that had buttons in the front causing the fabric to pull No more And I usually find underwire bras uncomfortable and this wasn t the case The bra is also very pretty not looking at all like a more standard fuller figure bra I ordered another one in black the same day 
Beautiful I own this in black it looks wonderful on me very sexy I am usually between a small and a medium and the regular size was good for me 
Perfect Shoe but Order a Half Size Up I bought these shoes yesterday and did some research online unfortunately afterwards to see what people had to say about the fit I originally bought my true size 7 5 I tried them on at the store with the throw away nylons my foot slid right in no problem When I got home and tried them on again without the nylon sock as I would normally be wearing them it was a way tighter fit especially across the toes My pinky toe was killing me I even waited until my feet were cold and tried them on again walked around a bit in the house still felt tight and started to hurt didn t hurt in the heel though I didn t bother trying on the 8 at the store because 8s are usually way too big on me especially in high heels I m pretty much always a true 7 5 unless I m wearing a narrow cut ballet flat I wouldn t say my feet are wide but they are not narrow either maybe if you have narrow feet you could wear these easily in your true size everyone else go up half a size especially because patent leather is stiffer than regular leather I noticed a huge difference in the feeling of the width across the toes in the size 8 my pinky toe was no longer being strangled I went back to the store this morning tried the 8 without the nylons and they fit perfectly So much so that I would say that they are really comfortable shoes and I wear a lot of heels because I m only 5 tall 
The perfect classy pump It goes with almost everything works with day and night wear and is beautiful as well as sexy And I m usually PICKY PICKY although obsessed with shoes Oh and I m French so I should know LO 
Proud Mother I have purchased these tights at a store for like bucks I like them they are thick but not not to hot or itchy The great part is they do not roll down at the top and you cant see like my little girl underwear comming out the side of the leotard with the tights My little girl is 3 years old she s not really tall but she is about an inch taller than all the other children So I got the Small the worker in the store told me it would fit the sizes run like this Toddler 2T 4T 34 40 Small 4 6 40 46 Intermediate 6x 7 46 51 Medium 8 10 51 55 Large 12 14 55 60 over all it is good the only reason why I did not vote it as an 5 star is because I only used them once but next week we will be using them again So if you are looking for ballet tights buy online because the price is good Unless you got a different source 
no sizes I very much want to purchase this product but without a size chart I have no idea how big a small is or how small a large is 
4 5 stars Excelent socks Feel like a foot massage Only thing after two washes there was a small hole by my big toe I sewed it up and expect it will stay 
Stephanie Sane s Perfect Body is the Star of the Show Red what a daring color Ruffles they give off a look of innocence belied by the red The high back is gorgeous and once again Stephanie with her perfect body is the star of the show We all look good in these don t get me wrong but Stephanie just simple looks beautiful in these delectiable good enough to Well let me leave it there 
Very very beautiful Great if you love frilly Of the items my husband recently gave me as presents from Love Fifi this was the fourth and last panty that I tried The frilly lacework which decorates the waist band as well as the two lengths which dive between your thighs make this Flutter Butt crotchless panty extremely pretty As an added touch there s another small piece of the lacey stuff as well as a handsome ribbon like bow featured down front Although they might be hard to see in the accompanying photo both serve to give the overall garment a much more finished appearance while also offering an attractive focal point for the eye The fluffy waistband on this Flutter Butt crotchless undie also helps to accentuate your hips by providing a little skirt like appearance If you have other frilly lingerie this crotchless knicker by heightening the tease might make this a very fun and memorable addition to your collection For me my most baby like babydoll nightie which had a short bodice and a billowy skirt with almost no waist ended up coordinating quite nicely It also helped that my hubby had ordered this Flutter Butt undie in white rather than red When I sprang this outfit on my better half I also made certain to peek up at him with my most shyly innocent and dopey expression while using my index finger to seductively play with my lower lip Hey it works And no I didn t round out my ensemble by putting bows in my hair and by clutching a giant lollipop by the stick in my other hand If you love frilly lingerie this Flutter Butt crotchless undie from Love Fifi may be perfect for adding a little SPICINESS to your INNOCENCE Enjoy 
Just what I wanted The picture and description of the bag showed very well It is a little larger than I thought but it is just fine I am very satisfied with it and hope to take it on many trips It also could be a spare diaper bag especially for a Dad 
Great Bag For ANYTHING This Kavu bag is fabulous It s great for a diaper bag on the go bag for a purse going on a hike or picnic For any mother or woman on the go I would recommend having this bag 
suuuuper sexy this is a very sexy costume though it looks more like a blue french maid than Alice in Wonderland Also the darn thing is sooooo short shorter than the other sexy costume i bought your booty will certainly be hanging out my boyfriend is very excited about this one but i m not sure it will ever make it out in public The stockings are included and are pretty nice the costume quality is rather nice for 27 note that the pettycoat thing is NOT included regarding sizing I wear an 8 and bought the large fits well 
Harry Potter items This was a perfect gift and not sure what the other person who rated this was talking about in color as the mustard is truly mustard and pretty much looks like the picture It was really authentic and the person I gave it to really liked it First Fantasies ships really fast too 
Harry Potter Teenage daughter wore to HP opening and had LOTS AND LOTS of compliments and attention Would definitely recommend as this is one of the truly licensed HP versions not a copy 
Pretty nice shoes Overall these shoes fit fairly well are stylish in appearance and the price is right The only concern I have is that they seem to run a little short in length odd for NB I have been buying NB shoes for as long as I can remember and this is the first time my toes were obviously at the very end of the toe box They look good though and provide the great arch support New Balance is famous for It s always a good idea to try on shoes before you buy them but the online price is so seductive it s difficult to pass up the deal If possible try to find some at your local shoe store before you purchase these as the pictures don t show you all angles of this shoe and parts of the trim are in my opinion goofy looking Overall I d recommend these shoes for walking jogging going to the gym If you want some serious running shoes spring for the higher end Asics NB s Saucony s etc 
Izod windowpane shirt It was brand new packaged well arrived quickly husband very pleased with it Christmas present 
excellent excellent these socks were very comfortable and as my daughter was playing soccer in the fall when it started getting cold these socks kept her feet warm and toasty 
Great tie for the Gryffindor costume I bought the Harry Potter Gryffindor V neck sweater off of Whimsic Alley and hoped that the colors on this tie wouldn t be too red for it Fortunately the burgundy color is a bit darker than on the picture on this site and it went PERFECTLY with the sweater It s slightly large but if you manage the knot on the tie it still makes a good size for someone as small as I am I m only 5 1 Very high quality I think as ties go Very satisfied ^ 
The Silky Tie This tie comes from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban the movie and lets just that it looks really good on me The stripes are Gold and Red It feels soooo smooth I recommend this to any Potter Fan 
great for the toddler boys You know how it is the toddler boys seem to grow faster than the toddler girls and stay in diapers longer nappies to those of you in europe How nice that this company makes these all cotton body suits with snaps into the 4T sizes They work very well for the 2 year old in a 3T size as both a t shirt and a way to hold the diaper in place 
Quite possibly the best boot ever made I am a deployed Navy Reservist I am currently assigned to a tactical expeditionary unit deployed to the middle east where I serve in a TACCOMM Tactical Crypto Support role in land and maritime operations Before deploying I spent a great deal of time and effort in selecting the right boot in which I knew I would be spending a great deal of time I tried Oakley Converse 5 11 and of course the Bates M 9 I felt that there was no contest The Bates was by far the most comfortable and seemed to have the most functional sole design and least potentially irritating upper and so on Let me re wind a little bit In my civilian life outside of the Reserve which at this point seems a distant memory I am an avid runner to the tune of about 70 miles per week While I ve run many hundred of miles on roads my focus over the past couple of years has shifted to off road trail runs and ultra marathon courses I know my feet I know what works in a shoe that is going to be demanded to perform in horrible conditions I have had great success over time with literally one pair of shoes from one manufacturer and as such I bought many pairs of that shoe In June of 2006 I bought my first pair of M 9 Desert Assault boots to take on my July deployment I decided that in order to break them in I d take them on the trail I figured that they d tear my feet up a bit but it wouldn t be the first time a new shoe had done so The day I first wore them I set off with an 85lb pack into a tick infested trail in a local state park It was about 100 degrees outside with humidity nearly to match After 12 miles on the trail I returned home to find that my feet were all but un fouled I was amazed I would repeat this process a few times and very soon after ordered two additional pairs of M 9s Fast forward just a bit While in pre deployment training in Coronado CA I took to wearing my boots for all of our PT I also logged about 30 to 50 miles per week of independent running again in my M 9s Most of these runs included a pack with about 50 70lbs in it though now I was running almost entirely on pavement My M 9 s performed without flaw I left Coronado for the middle east without any doubt that I had the best boots I could have possibly chosen and they were well broken in to boot Fast forward some more Recently I was able to take a two day MWR trip in order to run the Dubai UAE Marathon in my M 9s While we there were five of us from my unit that ran the marathon have had almost no opportunity to do any training runs while in theater I knew that if I were to tackle 26 2 miles on pavement man I hate running on pavement there was no way I was going to do so without wearing my old faithfuls They did not disappoint While I took a very conservative pace my M 9s carried me with ease to the finish line My Chief also the proud owner of a well beaten pair of M 9 s ran the marathon with me his first ever He too wore his M 9s as his running shoes were simply shot He was nothing short of elated to have finished his first marathon attempt and others were nothing short of amazed that he did it in combat boots If they only knew I must say I ve never had so many people come up to me during a marathon to chat and in every case the topic was my choice of footwear In every instance I would simply tell them with a smile You don t understand these are really great boots In short Bates created a nearly perfect boot Are there things I would change Certainly But even if Bates never changes a thing about them I will keep buying them until I am not longer able to run which I assure you will not be for a very long time I have already scheduled additional marathons and ultra marathons off road of course for after I return home and I ll let you guess what my choice of footwear will be I have found my new running shoe 
AWESOME ADIDAS THESE ARE FANTASTIC White and silver great ADIDAS quality Bought these for my 6YR old niece she was a little put off by the HOT WHEELS logo on the velcro flap and the silver HOT WHEELS BUCKLE at the base of the shoe laces which I hadn t noticed and was the ONLY REASON for 4 stars instead of 5 BUT These are great shoes and I highly recommend them just notice the HOT WHEELS details and don t get them for the GIRLY GIRLS in your life 
Dress For Success Classic Buttondown It is amazingly difficult to find classic buttondown shirts in exact sizes that have all the classic details and look as good in the board room as in the boiler room The 60 40 oxford cloth breathes well resists wrinkles and a spare shirt can be washed and dried in an airport bathroom with reasonable results in a pinch For those whose job description looks like the Timex Torture Test this is the must have shirt as it keeps on ticking long after other shirts have fallen apart 
Quality Shirt for a Bargain Price I recently purchased one 100 cotton oxford in blue and one of the 60 40 blend in white The shirts arrived in three days and were of excellent quality The fabric is not soft and not scratchy and is dressy enough to wear with a sport coat or simply a tie and casual enough to wear as simply a shirt The price is excellent for the value The only negative is for those of us with larger necks and longer arms the choice of colors is limited to white and blue 
Good convenient bag I carry it everywhere I go it has enough capacity to contain pretty much everything I need faceplate to my car stereo my camera personal grooming supplies even some clothes Just throw it all in there and you re ready to spend a night at a friend s house Having two compartments really helps keeping things organized The back of the bag is well padded and the bag is comfortable to carry for long periods of time 
backordered then wrong size The duofold name is good product however the ordering via Amazon was not a good experience I realize Amazon is working through a distributor of this product however it doesn t do well for Amazon think on this one as you are my favorite from the first day on The item was backordered and then received weeks later in the wrong size Not good Pick your friends wisely or don t have any Saying one is not responsible doesn t take away the bad experience it only attaches it to a great company 
Purchased as a gift My brother absolutely loved these He loved the design and I knew he liked this type of sneaker They fit very well also which is a bonus in ordering on line 
Great Shoes This is the second pair of Chameleons that I have owned The first pair lasted 3 years They are comfortable yet sturdy The slip right on and still offer great support I use them for everyday wear however I m sure they would make great running crosstraining shoes as well 
fantastic shoes I have tried so many different shoes of all brands and I wear out shoes like nobodys business These attracted me because of the look and so I tried them out 8 months later I still have the same shoe they are still the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn and the longest lasting shoes too I will buy these shoes as long as theyre available maybe a couple pairs no laces to mess with perfect for any use and not heavy and theres plenty of colors to choose from Awesome 
Best shoes I have ever found It took years for me to find multi purpose shoes that are this good and above all very comfortable I own 3 pairs of these in different colors The reason I own 3 pairs is that I use them almost every day and nothing else can compare 
Really Great Shoes only one little problem I love these shoes I have recently started walking regularly for exercise and needed some good shoes I occasionally hike as well and am not very sure footed so I needed a pair of shoes that served both purposes I had tried a pair of Merrell s on in a store but they didn t have the color I wanted so I ordered them on Amazon It took less than a week to receive the shoes which is really good considering they were coming from another seller and not Amazon directly I got the shoes and immediately fell in love with them They are so comfortable and I expect to get many years of use of them One small problem the inside sole is orange and I found that it turns my socks yellow from the dye I called customer service for Merrell and they are sending me a complimentary insole in a neutral color so they fixed the problem I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a good shoe I m not apt to buy shoes this expensive but they were well worth the money in my opinion 
Service I received the jazz shoes quickly They are the quality and the price I am accustomed to I like that 
Wiggles Big Red Car Toddler Shoes Great shoes This is the second pair that I have purchased My grandson wore out the first pair 
Stylish for any age and confotable but Not recomended for a petite person like me This boots may fit perfect for people who is taller than 5 4 and may be weight more than 115lb Although the item itself is very stylish and can go from casual to night club and maybe office work clothes Very confortable with insole and can make you run normal 
The most classic and simple pack EVER This pack is simple confortable and classic 
What exactly is the point of this skin This product does not come with a screen cover Sure it doesn t say it has one in the description but what s the point of having an iPod case if it doesn t protect the screen 
10 x s better than the iskin duo I bought the iskin duo about a month a half ago as soon as I got it I knew there would be a problem The screen protector the click wheel cover are separate pieces don t stay in place very well I ended up taking the click wheel cover off still covered by a layer of silicone and that seemed to work much better The surface was quick to collect lint right away and for the price you pay for it makes you wonder why it s made so cheaply I just got this skin a few days ago It comes with a clear cover to put over the face before you put the skin on The lanyard they include with it looks a little chintzy but other than that I have no complaints I like it so much I m going to order another one 
Fantastic I love the way this product smoothes the trouble spots and makes clothing lay better It also does a great job of giving breasts a little lift 
My 3rd one I have been enjoying this product for years I had weight loss surgery 5 years ago and used it when I first had surgery It helped with protecting the incision and my self confidence from the sagging skin Now 5 years later I find myself using it again because I ve opted out of plastic surgery at least for now and I do enjoy how shapely it makes me look Only complaints are it tends to roll up at the bottom if you tend to be more pear shaped and sometimes the fasteners show through your blouse if you wear clingy material But besides that I love it 
Buy it from Amazon NOT LaurenSilva com I m sure this product is GREAT because I ve heard from several others and read on other sites that it works well and actually helps reduce the waistline but I don t know first hand yet I normally purchase only through Amazon but I came across this company called Lauren Silva Group and saw what I thought was a good price jumping without looking at Amazon com Anyways I bought it shipping charges and all on the 18th Later on I go to Amazon because when I m bored I go to Amazon lol Imagine how annoyed I was when I saw it was the same price but as you know Amazon has FREE SHIPPING on products over a certain amount ALWAYS I figured what s done is done but I revisit laurensilva com and see in bold print FREE SHIPPING Dec 15th 31st on orders over 50 I m happy cuz I m thinking Great I didn t overpay I call customer service and she tells me Oh I m sorry about that that was a mistake on our part that should ve said 19th not 15th then goes on to say My supervisor will call you to let you know about the refund tomorrow Received no call I call the next day around two to hear from the supervisor that even though THEY put the 15th it was an error and shouldn t have been there and he wouldn t refund me the 5 bucks How am I responsible for an error from YOU GUYS Isn t that FALSE ADVERTISING I m so pissed Now I have to call my credit card company and might have to deal with them lying about it I m so angry Aside from being deceived I was treated so poorly How do people act like this When I initially called I had no idea it would turn into this otherwise I would ve had gathered evidence as my friends tell me I hate to make a stink over 5 measly bucks but you should ve heard his condescending attitude when he said We won t be refunding you the shipping but thank you for informing us of the error Right now it s simply the principal 
Great looking but they stink These are great looking shoes but when I opened them up brand new there was a distinct odor that the leather has I don t know if this is from packaging or if there is a chemical that was put on them to serve as a protectant for the leather I ve had them for about 3 months now and it s starting to go away I don t think people smell them when I m wearing them it s only when you get up close to them 
love it I found this bra in white at ROSS about 6 months ago for 4 99 and have been wearing it almost daily because it looks and feels so good with everything tanks tees sweaters etc while adding a little oomph When I needed to buy a black bra I looked up the info from the rapidly fading tag and couldn t resist getting one in every available color I cannot stand the look of bumpy padding weird seams and unnatural silhouettes that I usually find with bras so it was totally worth the splurge once I found a style that worked so well 
best boots husband ever had for his bad knees They couldnt be better they fit immediately and took the weight off his knees perfit fit and looks awesome amazons priceing was excellent too fast shipping came in perfect 
i really like these boots they fit good and are comfortable and the company that sent it all did a good job derscretlly pacaged smile i have 4 pair now differnt colours smil 
Took me 2 years to find these Well I should say I m a cosplayer costume player I love dressing up as anime characters and I needed a set of purple knee high boots for one costume I m making but I hated the ones I found I found these and was like Eureka They are the perfect color and just right for my Suigintou costume My only beef with them is that I have muscular calves and they re kind of hard to zip up 
Very Pleased I looked for boots like this everywhere these are the cheapest one I found They are good boots also They were exactly what I was looking for And I love all the colors they come in I will be buying more in the future 
Sperry Top Sider Gold Cup I have purchased Sperry Top Sider Deck Shoes for over 40 years and these are the best deck shoes I have owned They are extremely confortable and the first time I wore them my foot molded to the shoe It was not necessary for a break in period like most shoes 
Most comfortable underwear I ever wore I put a pair of these puppies on and they just felt smooth and comfortable on the skin No chafing no rubbing nothing like that They fit nicely below clothes and never rode up on me at all They are by far my favorite pair of underwear You can t beat the price either 
So comfortable and very sexy The Contour Thong is one of the most comfortable thongs I ve ever worn It s well made looks sexy and feels great Every man should have a thong in his collection make the Contour one of yours 
Good all around cut This is Undergear s standard thong offering It s basic cotton which isn t as comfortable as Undergear s Extreme Thong but it s a good fit The price is not prohibative so stock up if you want to build a basic collection of thong underwear The only thing I ve noticed is that because cotton is not as durable as other fabrics the edges fray after some time 
best feel ever this thong has the best feel ever in a thong when I where it I feel as if I can do anything and I feel very sexy in it 
Don t buy bras online It doesn t fit I got my size I don t know why it doesn t fit but I m not taking all the time to send it back Both bras I got didn t fit Sigh 
Very cute but runs small These shoes are super cute but I had to return my 7 s because they were too small I can wear a dress show from a 6 5 7 5 depending on the brand but these were too small because of the elastic The leather is very thin that was the other reason I returned them It s really really soft and the gold is really pretty but there is no way these shoes would take any kind of slight abuse and survive 
Nine West Women s Luvmyflats These shoes was good only for an indoor activity I returned them to the seller because I bought them as a summer shoes 
Great for travel or to keep at work I agree with other reviews The flats are made of really good quality leather therefore thin I have never seen such a beautiful insole They scruff easily no holes in mine yet and the biggest design flow is the elastic though it gets less painful with longer wear If you are willing to tolerate pain for a very compact cute and flexible pair of shoes these are great to take along on trips or keep at work to change into they look great and go with everything I generally never go for suffering but these particular shoes compensate 
I luv luv my flats These are really cute comfy shoes Great price You might want to buy two pairs because if you wear them alot the front seems 2 rip a little This is my second pair Also the elastic on the back of the shoe is a little uncomfortable at first but once they were worn in they are great If you want black ones I suggest get the black lace because the leather will get messed up easily 
Comfortable after stretching When I first got these shoes I thought I had made a mistake The elastic was so tight that I felt like my heals were bruised I went to the store and bought some shoe stretch devices to hold the shoes in a elongated position Now I leave them in the shoes when I m not wearing them and they feel fine 
very cute wedge I really enjoy this shoe I got them in purple and they are very cute I normally wear a size 8 but I ordered a 7 and a half instead because the eights were out The shoe runs very narrow for women with wider feet 
Very Clever Here is a pair of funny boxer shorts for anyone who wants to show off their status as a ladies man Pictured is Alfalfa of the popular comedy series The Little Rascals who wooed women with his awful singing voice and extreme cowlick Anyone who wears these boxers has an obvious sense of humor and is a fan of the series Don t miss this great piece of memorabilia 
Great Looking Shoe I haven t had a chance to wear yet but this is a great wedge for women who cant wear super high heels Great support and your feet look super sexy 
Naughty Monkey Women s Wink Wedge I would like to return this pair shoe It s not fit me Please send me a return form Thanks 
So cute This is the cutest little set the underwear has colors you don t usually see and the t shirt is one that I ve never seen in stores before My son loves them both The best part is that the fabric is so incredibly soft it s a pleasure to wear 
Frye boots This is my 3rd pair of Frye boots They look and fit well They do need some time to break in This brand has held up well in the past and I expect the same of this pair 
HORSESHOES CATCH LUCK FOR BABIES TOO Hurrah for baby socks of a decent weight and durability For Bare Feet took over a deserted high school building west of BEAN BLOSSOM Indiana in the mid eighties It has built a great reputation for pleasing its customers from infants to men who muscle their way around a football field Not only do the Indianapolis Colts team members welcome any luck that comes their way while wearing adult socks embroidered with the well known Horseshoe on Blue emblem but they aren t surprised if the insignia also catches some luck for babies Other sports accessories are available ONLINE via amazon com or at the company s two outlet shops in the county seat often called the OTHER Nashville Miniatures always make appealing baby gifts these socks make a big hit with Colts fans everywhere Pun intended 
Comfy stretch pants My husband loves these pants and wears them around the house on his days off They are really comfortable and look pretty decent too 
AWESOME PIECE Awesome in every way The only thing guys at Andrew Christian i would give a little more detail to the finishing inside between the elastic band and the actual underwear it could be better but other than that YOU VE GOT GREAT PIECES THERE I WISH I COULD BUY THEM ALL 
awesome product is terrific and shipping time was super quick these are my third pair of glasses and probably won t be my last 
great sunglasses My sunglasses were received very quickly after ordering them I was surprised No surprises when it came to the way my sunglasses looked They were just what I wanted and I was looking for a pair that didn t cost a lot I found some similar ones on designer web sites running for 200 but then I came across Amazon s pair and they looked just as a good with an affordable price = 
Excellent I was happy to recieve my order before I anticipated and very satisfied with my purchase 
bad news 991 was replaced w 992 992 is not good for a high arched foot and the heel raises throwing off gait I loved the 991 and did marathons with them I searched everywhere and you can not find anymore except with the same last in 990 s I am ordering 990 s but don t buy the 992 if you are expecting an improvement 
Outstanding running shoes After running with Nike Asics and Saucony I have to say that New Balance 991 kicks all of them out of the ballpark After 7 8 miles you still feel like you re running on a cloud I have a very high arch and these shoes are simply unmatched in support and comfort Plus they re made in USA 
New Balance 991 I bought a pair of new balance 991 in the summer of 2004 I still have this pair of shoes and am getting another pair because I love them so much I am a nurse wworking in the critical care recovery room and I am on my feet all day I have found that these shoes are awesome if you are on your feet a lot on an average day I am on my feet 10 14 hours and I never go home with sore feet I would recommend this shoe to anyone 
the only running shoe I will ever buy Don t take a chance when you buy running shoes I ve been wearing NB 991s for years and they re the best For a heavier runnier who needs support you can t do any better 
Shoes that fit and last Once you own a New Balance shoe you will never wear anything else Imagine shoes that come in WIDTHS I have worn out two pair of these and am ordering a third Fouth I am very hard on shoes and after the first time I bought New Balance shoes have never purchased any others Also they last and last They are expensive but you really get 2 3 shoes worth of wear out of a single pair 
MIZUNO rider shoes Very well constructed with lots of support near the arch ankles insole and outer heals Very comfortable in general 
Great Jersey I bought this jersey for a true soccer fan and he loved it The colors and quality of the jersey are great Anyone who routes for the french soccer team will truly appreciate it 
Own the jersey of the best team of World Cup 2006 This is a good looking jersey and you can wear it with pride since Les Bleus clearly played the best football in the tournament 
Stylish raincoat economical price This men s raincoat is an outstanding bargain It features classic styling is very well made and is being offered at a reasonable price Without doubt I consider this a terrific purchase 
Erik s Coat Our son loved the coat we ordered It came in a timely manner and the price was great 
TWINKLE TOES My daughter absolutely loved these shoes Very comfortable and pretty it s like walking on air 
Great Tee This items is stretchy comfortable and attractively fitted It shrinks a bit after washing so if you do not like a fitted style you will likely not be happy with this It has a scoop neck that is not too low and the cap sleeves are flattering 
great Came as I expected and on time Now I just have to see if the person I got them for likes them 
Very warm nice and looks great This is a very warm and nice jacket That looks cool too If you want anything to keep you warm for winters this is it Value for money and I loved it the only thing I found discerning was that it is a bit heavier than expected Keep it in mind while buying Also an all metal zipper would have been nicer than a plastic one But I found it perfect for me 
Very comfortable These slippers are great They are so soft and comfortable on the inside I wear them as shoes not slippers because they are so cool looking These are much less expensive than those other brands that are so popular now and they look better too The first pair I bought was too big the second pair fits better but is still a little big I would suggest going down if you are a half size not up but that s just my opinion Overall great shoe 
Comfy Slippers I wear these slippers a lot They are warm comfortable and reasonably priced for the great quality My husband I both have a pair we love them 
braza flash body clothing double sided tape held me top in place all night did not even know i was wearing it after a while 
I m pleased I bought this product to tape up the puckering in my button up shirts The tape doesn t stay closed all day but it does re stick when I press it again The roll provides a lot of tape so it will last a long time 
Flash Tape is Great This product works wonders I can rely on it to hold my shirt together between the buttons and hold unbuttoned shirts in place 
Excelent aid It s a great product and works marvelously to help your clothing stay together This is the 2nd roll I buy I use it to keep the space between the buttons closed 
Best tape 101 uses myself family friends have found this tape so versatile no more gaping shirts handy in emergency situations hem suddenly coming down Bra strap breaking Braza to the rescue Love it cannot have enough of it Great for also holding annoying slipping bra straps especially spaghetti straps Value for sure 
Not only for clothing I use this stuff all the time It s by far the best double sided tape on the market It s extremely thin AND extremely sticky I use it to put fabric on the back of unfinished furniture when I don t want holes from tacks I ve also used it to make bamboo and fabric flags Forget traditional office double sided tape Flash Tape is the way to go for ALL crafts 
Fix gaping on front of blouse Great idea and it really works Fixes that gap between 3rd and 4th button No safety pin any more 
Like my Gerber 5 Pack Short Sleeve Onesies Good quality and practical for my 16 month old girl 
Gerber has the best onesies I ve tried different brands of onesies that are in the Gerber price range and I always keep coming back to them They wash well and they are loose around the arms and bottom 
great coat This coat my daughter chose It is so stylish She loves to wear it The inside fur is so soft nice quality 
Great tote I am so impressed because the price was so low compared to what most totes in the catalogs run The quality is excellent love that it zips closed and it s nicer looking than a boat tote AND it has the vinyl liner in case you have to put anything damp inside 
Positive recommendation I recently ordered 3 of these bags to use for grocery shopping in order to cut down eliminate the number of paper and plastic bags I need to dispose of or recycle I also find brim full paper and plastic bags not easy to lug in from the car These bags are very well constructed sturdy and roomy I remember years ago when grocery stores were giving canvas bags to customers to decrease the strain on the environment It was a good idea then a great idea now and these bags are perfect 
Wonderful Product This was a fun and inexpensive bra The quality is good and seller is great For the review prior to this of course it looks silly anyone with a D cup knows they don t fit the standard sizes We are very happy with this product and the seller 
A HOT Thong What a great thong I ordered these on a whim as I don t normally wear thong style underwear but I put them on this morning and they feel GREAT I was afraid that I d be annoyed by the thong but I can barely feel it The Y shaped back frames your butt great The pouch cups and supports your stuff perfectly One hot Thong 
This is one terrific shoe I m a power walker and wasn t sure if these shoes would fit the bill However they are very comfortable and supportive I really like them I ll probably purchase another pair asap I recommend them 
Great shoe I have been using the Saucony Omni for years now and just love the shoe I started when the Omni 4 was out now the Omni 5 The Omni 6 will soon follow with slight changes Plenty of room in the toe box lightweight and durable I recently tried to switch to another well known brand of show but immediate discomfort and pain made me turn them back in for my trusted Saucony s I run 40+ miles per week so I have a couple pair to rotate 
Love the shoe This is my second pair They re light weight breathe well plenty of stability plenty of room in th toe box I like them better than the 4 pair of NB 765 s I owned before them 
A good running shoe for the money Comfortable That s a good place to start I ve had back problems and I want to get back into running again I started about a month ago with some shoes that were not the best choice I decided to buy the Saucony Shoes because they were the best value Now that I ve had them a while I can report that they are doing a fine job My back and feet are feeling great These have plenty of arch and heel support They are lightweight pretty well built and I feel like I got a good deal I don t believe in buying the most expensive gear to start out with When I m ready to up grade I ll check out Saucony shoes first before I spend money on other more recognizable brands I recommend you do the same 
Comfort With Style The Keds Grace shoe is very comfortable The microstreatch material makes the shoe perfect for some foot problems I can say this shoe provides me with the ability to wear all day and not have my feet feel tired or suffer from soreness This shoe gives because of the material It s style and variety of colors make it good for all year wear Good for work or play 
Mr Anderson These glasses are great to have At a good price too I gave it a four because I found the lenses to be just slightly dirty but I cleaned it up 1 gThey are great to walk around with Especially for style Recieved within a matter of days If it was still 50 dollars I would ve never took the chance But at the price shown I did and was satisfied If you like cool looking not too expensive glasses like these just check out the Fashion Metal Sunglass with Spring Hinge 5715 they d be cool to buy along with these glasses because of their great appeal They are really cool 
Excelent I am a Matrix fan When I saw this sunglasses I knew that I find something special And now I can say I was righ It is a special stuff 
Neo Sunglasses I actually got these for my wife for when we go biking hiking They seem a lot lighter in weight than I had expected but they fit perfect The price was unbeatable I almost wish I had gotten myself a pair 
Cool shades good 3rd party service These lenses are really nice So light you can t believe they ve metal frame Optics are good also with wide eye side coverage so no annoying glares get into your eyes Seller delivered promptly Cool 
Fast service awesome sunglasses highly recommended I was reluctant at first to order from this seller because of the negative reviews here But I noticed that the first reviewer is from Russia which might explain the slow shipping speed So I ordered the item got an almost instant reply and the sunglasses arrived a few days later They were a birthday present for my husband and he loves them So I highly recommend this seller 
Best on this Category Hello I bought one and really satisfied on the looks fit and materials on this sunglasses Highly recommended Leonides Litiatco of the Philippines 
Great for a little one I ordered the 12 month size for my little girl she s about 18 lbs and is 12 months So she is on the small side so this item was excellent for her and fit great no problems she is comfy and looks adorable Pretty good quality too for the price 
12 month size 10 month child and only wore once We purchased three of the stretchie footed pajama s from Children s Place This one was very slim and we were only able to get it on my daughter once I know these are supposed to fit snugly but you have to be able to get the zipper up We have been able to wear the other two we purchased but not this one We wore it once and then it went straight into the storage pile I washed all three in the same settings so not sure why this one was so different 
Oh my gosh Oh my gosh what a fabulous bra My friend insisted that I try a Wacoal bra but their price is so high that I felt I couldn t afford one You can t afford not to I am rather large and have lots of problems when it comes to fitting bras but these fit like a dream I truly wear it all day and feel as if I don t have a bra on I bought mine on sale but I am so sold that I would buy them at regular price 
these are nice true to size usual Clarks comfort stylish look great price incredibly fast shipping ordered my second pair before i wrote this review 
Superior quality clothing The product was recommended by a friend with a similar medical condition and after trying the briefs I was sold Thanks for a superior product 
Munsingwear has em covered Have worn this product for years and it is as good as always 
A counter to Ron s opinion I can only say that Ron must have some exceptionally located plumbing I have worn only Munsingwear for 14 15 years now And when it came to the ever important preludes to lovemaking my girlfriends all preferred the easy access horizontal fly also Vertical flys are quite inferior to the horizontal style in my well qualified opinion I cannot understand why horizontal is not the standard rather than vertical Come to think of it my first pair of the easy access horizontals were given to me by a girlfriend 
Good value I purchased the Munsingwear kangaroo briefs because I could not find them at any of my local stores I have worn these breifs for years and was pleased to find them on Amazon They were delivered to me promptly and I am pleased with the whole process 
Purchase Review The whole process for ordering was easy I was kept informed about the delievery The package arrived and everything was fine 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED The underwear arrived within a week and was exactly what we wanted The price was great also 
Don t know how I got along without these products I am so glad to finally be rid of the electrical cords I ve had gas powered trimmers in the past but the hassle of mixing the oil and gas and the smell wasn t worth it So I became tied to the extension cords for years now with these cordless devices it s so much quicker and easier I ve read some of the Reviews prior to purchasing these products and I don t agrtee with the limited power supply with the Ni Cad batteries These products are tops in my book and I would recommend them to any and all my friends L P K 
Comfort reigns These are wonderfully comfortable They may seem a little odd at first but once you get used to them I don t think you ll ever want to switch back to the old style I certainly don t 
Great Seller The shoe was perfect It s just how it looks in the picture The seller was very quick in shipment and professional Thanks 
A Little Inflexible I really like the shoes but they aren t quite as comfy as I d hoped There s pressing across the top of the foot over the big toe which get uncomfortable after a while but that may just be my big feet They re fine otherwise 
Kenneth Cole Reaction Men s Simply Western Harness Boot I love these boots I had a hard time looking for the right color and size and managed to find it here I bought these boots in brown and liked the distressed look on them The decorative riding straps with hardware ring and grommet ornamentation add a nice touch These boots look great with jeans and are very fashionable 
KC Reaction Simply Western = Simply Wonderful Just received my KCR men s Simply Western Harness boots today This is my second pair of boots for this particular brand The KCR men s Team Circle boots were one size larger than stated This Simply Western on the other hand fits perfectly I wear size 7 and ordered a pair of size 7 Very stylish very light very well made 5 days ago Dec 6 I went to the M y s department store and saw the exact same model and brand selling for 145 plus tax I purchased this pair at Amazon for 69 90 tax and shipping free The pair in the department store have blacken or darkened toe and heel for the brown color model in which I don t like This brown pair from Amazon have even brown finish throughout Looks fantastic very comfortable made in Romania I give it 5 stars and 2 thumbs way up 
Very Handy Both chargers and the A V cable work well and are great to have on hand for charging my video ipod because watching video on it drains the power quicker than just audio 
Awesome Great kit Less than half the price if purchased at a store or by Ipod Thank you 
Fabulous I went searching for an iPod wall charger b c my 60 GB video ipod didn t come with one grrrrr apple and it was 30 Sigh But okay I thought I ll get it Then I went searching for an A V cord at the store 15 25 and neither of them worked I couldn t figure out why It works for my miniDV camera but not my iPod Do you I really have to purchase the 99 ipod A V accessory kit Then gold struck And I stumbled across this on amazon It all works and it works beautifully and it looks beautiful and to boot I got a charger for my car something i won t use much seeing how I don t currently drive much now but hey i will someday and I got it all for less than 30 I don t know how they do it but this is a great deal A must if you own a video iPod and don t want to spend another 150 dollars on accessories for it Plus fast shipping too Great product 
Applie iPod Bundled Kit This deal was a dream I have been around from Walmart to Radio Shack and more No matter where it was I looked for a wall charger or the AV cables they was over priced in my opinion at least I saw the AV cables for 15 or more and the Home Wall Charger was 20 to 30 so when I found this deal I wen t nuts To get a Wall Charger a Car Charger and AV Cables All for 30 dollars Now thats a deal I have tryed each one of these out and they work wonderful I recommend this to everyone who has an iPod 
Awesome boots These boots are beautiful super warm and comfortable They re lined with real sheepskin fur and the price is a true bargain for you get Also Bargain Outfitters customer service is great I had to exchange them for a bigger size and they did it quickly and efficiently These do run true to size unlike UGGs which run large so get them in your regular size It s also hard to tuck skinny pants in so I just fold my pant legs up instead Love them 
This worked out well I have been buying Stride Rite shoes for my son for a while Buying them online was easy and I saved money 
Wonderful These shoes are wonderful for toddlers They are made very well and the color is really great We LOVE them 
Great basic toddler shoe This is a great basic tennis shoe with velcro straps You get what you would expect from Stride Rite and the picture on Amazon 
Shoes that hold up to a toddler I think these are great shoes They ve held up well and my toddler is constantly on the move Also they are easy to wipe off which is a plus 
Great Sneakers for Toddlers My son has these sneakers in a smaller size and are wonderful I saw the great price and could not pass up a bargain You will not be sorry 
white tiger w dragons Very nice shirt Order the adult small for my 12yr old son Fits very well 
shoes This is the 3rd pair of merrell shoes if have purchased I do a lot of walking and traveling They are light and very comfortable The winter lined merrells are great also I spend many hours in hockey arenas they are the only shoes if have found to keep my feet warm and my feet have never gotten wet 
Good results with a bit of practice When properly used the Hairagami makes a tight attractive hairdo that lasts all day much easier than with bobby pins or other devices I ve tried It takes some practice and a sense of humor to learn how to work with the Hairagami but I ve been very pleased with the results It s also relatively easy to untangle at the end of the day and leaves my hair with a pleasing curly effect 
Great for little girls with long hair My 10 year old daughter has been wearing a hairagami almost daily for 2 years It doesn t cause breakage like rubber bands I can put the hairagami in her hair in the morning and it stays in all day keeping her hair out of her face at school and tangle free I m purchasing my third one They do wear out over time by snapping on their own They are a low cost item and I don t expect them to last forever We try to store them in the flat position which seems to increase it s lifespan 
A must have for dancers Perfect for children that dance My daugther dances on a traveling team We had to put her hair in a bun for several class and or competitions a week The Hairagami was worth it s weight in gold We had perfect buns for ballet and performances no hassle no pain I could never be without one again If you can make a ponytail you can have a perfect bun It s really that simple 
Not that bad Maybe it snaps when you re folding your hair but you ll get to manage it with some practice The results are worth it I used to have one and I loved it The hair do s look neat and fancy 
Vote For Pedro When I first saw Napolean Dynamite I thought it was hilirous The Pedro shirt was awesome and I thought it would be a best seller I saw it at Hot Topic and it was cool I finally came around buying it and looks awesome It does look cheaply made but when you have a button to match it who cares So if you are a fan go out and buy it will make you popular And remember VOTE FOR PEDRO 
Pure Pleasure These are a must for any wardrobe The sheer comfort and overall fit are wonderful Whether at work or out on the dance floor they are comfortable but very sexy I really feel feminine and my partner loves the feel too 
sexy body sute i got sex rigt away at gus house i went to because i wore only this product 
Good quality pajamas Pajamas seem to be one of those products that is getting harder to find as if people aren t using them any more Like bedspreads Then I finally found a pair at Target and they fell apart after two washings It was a relief to find these Izod pajamas on Amazon They are comfortable and solidly made just like the old days At last 
Quality trunks When I ordered the trunks I ordered a size larger than I usually wear My waist so 32 so I deciced to go with L Reading the previous review I figured they will be exactly my size Big mistake When I got them even bofore I tried them on I measured the waist They were true to the L size I had few M size swimwear around and I compared the waist it was an inch larger then anything size M So whoever sugested to get one size biger was wrong Or maybe he had wishfull thinking about his waist size Now the good news they stretch So the L size still looked ok on me because they didn t stretch at all I have some wrinkels showing but it s nothing major The product itself is a high quality product They look sexy but you have to have the right body for them too Don t expect to look good if you are fat They will make you look even fatter They are not that low rise either my butt crack isn t showing The picture is actually very accurate and you can see how high they sit As far as you can see everything as another reviewer mentioned maybe he was comparing them to his boardshorts I don t see any big difference between these trunks and any other smimwear in the same style They are definetly not see through I d love to exchange them for the size M but the return policy allows absolutely no exchanges or returns and that sucks I wonder how different it is if I would go to their store and try them on in a fitting room Also it took one week for shipping 
I like these trunks but there are a few things you should know 1st of all these are really nice trunks They remind me of the Grigio Perla trunks La perla s men s division that Daniel Craig James Bond wore in Casino Royale Anyways you should know that these trunks leave LITTLE to the imagination You can ummm see everything from the front I mean literally everything They are low in the back and dip in the front I wish they were a little higher rise in that back but if you like showing booty crack these are the trunks for you The fabric is really nice and smooth and they are without doubt some sexy trunks BUT MAKE SURE YOU ORDER THEM IN A SIZE LARGER THAN YOU NORMALLY WEAR I am 6 2 with a 34 waist and I SHOULD have ordered an XL and not an L I can deal with the size I have but I prefer to have a little more room Also note YOU CANT RETURN THESE ITS IS AGAINST THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CODE 
Best swim trunk ever but I was very happy to purchase this item from Andrew Christian It fits perfectly though the only thing I didn t like about the trunk is the type of thread used in the fabrication of this item was not strong enough After a few times of wearing the trunk it started to fall apart I had to take it to my local dry cleaners and have the seamstress reinforce the sides and the back The piece is fine now and I hope it lasts me for awhile But I am still planning to purchase other items from AC Keep up the good work 
Perfect Fit I was very happy to find a bra with a great fit all around 
Comfortable well fitted bra I love this bra It stretches inall the right places and supports where you need it It is soft and comfortable The only thing I would recommend for improvement is a slightly wider band at the bottom Otherwise great 
Great Purchase Great pair of shoes I bought them to go rafting and they did their job 
Comfy Pants Arrived in an evelope on time The Darh Vadar character looks a little bit off in its representation The medium is big for a medium 
Great for wearing with Crocs and sleeping in These are a few dollars more than the socks I can get locally that say they are the same fabric When I got these ones I was shocked This fabric is 100x nicers that the ones I have This is just a wonderful sock I like fleece ones but they have heavy seams These ones do not have that I love these socks You will not be disapointed this is sheer luxury I got some other colors also but will be ordering more black ones I am sick and these things are a great comfort for my daily wear Match them to the color of the croc so the cros are more subtle and the color that shows throught the holes is the same color of the crocs These socks are loose but not too loose Just perfect 
warm and soft for feet I love these socks They are warm and soft and they fit loose enough so my feet don t feel trapped yet they don t slip down either Great 
warm inexpensive winter boot cute cute cozy boot it is lined throughout the whole boot toes all the leather is not of the highest quality but considering how inexpensive they are it is worth the price bought a pair last season too the heel wore out compartively speaking i own uggs too they are equally warm however these boots are less clunky i get compliments on the boot all the time 
Boots don t meet expectations The boots are not how they seem in the picture Yes they have real rabbit fur trim and yes it has real sheep wool lining However the quality of the leather is very poor and not how it would appear in the photo The leather is very dry and thin I applied a leather oil which seemed to help a bit but I feel for nearly 100 I would have gotten a better quality product 
Too Small This is a fine quality Speedo but I have found that the sizing is small I would have needed to order 1 or 2 sizes bigger 
A Good Basic Speedo This is the basic Speedo bathing suit it s good quality and great for sunning swimming and training They come in even waist sizes and are very snug fitting so you need to order it one size bigger I have a bubble butt and even though I have a 32 waist I needed to order a size 34 for it to fit properly They are durable and hold up well so it s a good buy overall and I recommend it 
excellent training brief This is a standard Speedo brief lots of lycra no sags and a very good cotton drawstring that stays tight during laps I swim 1K daily so my suits get a good workout To make it last remember to rinse in non chlorinated water after each use and wring dry don t use the centrifuge 
Very clear decrease in quality I am a regular swimmer and I have been buying that same reference from Speedo for several year 70800 Usually they are lasting 6 to 7 months 3 swims a week clear water rinsing and air dried Last July I bought several suits of that reference here and I immediatly noticed a change in the construction of the suit I started to use one in September and after only 2 months the suit is falling apart The impression at reception was confirmed Some savings are made by Speedo in their manufacturing process but they did not warn the customer or change the item reference 
Training tank suit This suit is great All tank suits fit the same but many have problems with the drawstring It can fray break stretch or slip This suit has none of those problems it fits well and the drawstring stays put but is easy to untie even when wet Great for training 
Long Lasting Product I ve been using Speedo products over 20 years never had to change to any other brand for swimming gear Speedo makes it for last and it s always durable this one I got it for almost 9 months after every use rinse with cold water becomes like new 
This is the only running bra for me I have used this bra for the last four years for running My bra size ranges depending upon pregnancy and nursing from a 36DD to 38G This is the only bra I can run with There is no bounce 
great sports bra for large breasted women The bounce isn t quite gone but it is the best sports bra I have ever owned I am a 36D and run quite a bit also long distance runs I have bought two of them over Christmas and now will buy two more It is the best I have ever tried I don t even wear my other new sports bras any more They are extremely comfortable you wouldn t think so It is the bra I will wear for my marathon come July 
Lovely shoes We bought these shoes for my daughters and nieces ages 10 16 to use as Junior Bridesmaids shoes and they worked out great All 5 girls loved them and said they were very comfortable They also are excited to continue to use them post wedding as are us moms 
These shoes are fabulous The Keds Hipster ballet flat is a great shoe for spring These shoes are extremely comfortable there is even a suede patch in the ankle area of the shoe to prevent rubbing and blisters I could wear these flats all day with no problem One thing to take note of they seem to run about a half size big Other than that no complaints 
Heaven for my feet True to the Ugg reputation these slippers are great Warm toasty I live in them at home fit is right on 
Here are the dimensions Here are the dimensions they re listed on the Eddie Bauer website Nice bag if space in your bag is at a minimum Product Details 330 denier nylon Adjustable and removable shoulder strap 7� Wx10 Hx3� D Imported Care Instructions Spot clean 
What size is it It would help to know the dimensions of this bag It is very sharp looking but can it hold one or two 16 fl oz bottles of water upright It would be helpful to be able to click on it and have a picture of the inside pop up as well along with the dimensions Thanks 
If this is Perfect I d hate to see their second best I expected that this would be a nice t shirt considering the price and that it is mid weight Unfortunately it shrunk just as badly as the 4 pack Fruit of the Loom t shirts that I ve bought at Wal Mart It does seem to be a bit heavier than the FotL shirts but ultimately that doesn t matter much when it is unwearable I washed dried it one time and the waist hem is nearly above my beltline These shirts are 100 cotton apparently not pre shrunk and tagless Definitely not worth the price If you buy this item you may want to get a size or two bigger than your normal size Even then I wouldn t recommend them 
Very sexy undies for my guy I love these They look so good and are made well Boot 
Looks Good and Wears Great This coutour pouch brief is meant to like most 2 x ist underwear show off your male assets I think this one does that effectively by using the pouch The fit is great there is enough room for everything and although it is cotton it stretches and shapes to my body just as well as the synthetic materials on the 2 x ist X Factor Countour Pouch Brief 7403 do see my review on that product page as well In fact you might like that one better so give it a look 
What I expected The mechandise was what I expected It was good quality and the service was goo 
fun baby bodysuits I didnt go to the baby shower that I had bought these for but was told everyone thought they were funny and the mother to be couldnt wait until she could use them They looked like they were good quality and the price was great 
Columbia Zip Off pants The pants are great for fishing They dry fast and the legs can be zipped off when it gets warm I ordered size med I am 32 33 waist and 30 inseam The waist fit perfect but the length was a little long The length was altered w no problem 
Samsonite rules Samsonite backpacks are the only brand I ve found that are able to stand up to all the books my daughter has to carry Most brands fall apart after just a few months Her Samsonite bag has held up for 2 years and is only being retired because it is time for a different color Great bags 
great Holds up well in rain very roomy Padded straps keep shoulders comfortable when bag is heavy Very happy with product 
not roomy but good for laptop and general It s very compact doesn t have space for large textbooks but otherwise sufficient separate laptop compartment has adequate padding the shoulder straps are broad and padded 
Keeping my fingers crossed bought this bag a month ago Carried a laptop everyday i dont remember stuffing it with more load already few stitches are coming out and just hoping that this bag will last for atleast 6 8months i liked the bag though 
Superb backpack Water resistant in general Great for laptop as the place where you put it is extra soft Great produc 
I would like to order more I like the Vanity Fair Classic Ravissant Brief so well I want to order 3 more Thank 
Good Buy These boots are comfortable and made of solid material that are fine and well crafted I am please with this purchase and the price was a bargain 
You better get you one Charger Hand Grip for Sony Playstation PSP is the shizznit Keeps your hands from cramping during a long time of having fun with my PSP plus it charges It feels like a ps2 controller A good buy 
Works really well Such a simple product but works So well All my boots and I are very happy 
Wife loves them I got tired of tripping over three pair of my wife s boots in the closet and ordered this set of three boot shapers My hope was that they would stand up and be out of the way I hadn t seen the boots for a while so I asked if she was using the boot shapers Apparently as an added bonus they have hooks to hang them like hangers A useful item for a great price 
Boot shapers are the best I looked all over for these shapers These are great fit all my boots perfectly and were delivered within three days Amazing 
Too stiff to work easily I desperately need boot shapers but these are very difficult to use The problem is in the design I have to squeeze them together very hard to get them to go into the boot at all and they always spring apart at the bottom once they are in the boot so I can t get them in all the way They are better than nothing but only just barely I have other boot shapers all of which are designed better than these 
Travel Alarm Clock The problem with most travel alarm clocks is that one must push the snooze bar to see the time during the night This travel clock solves that problem beautifully by having its face illuminated constantly whenever the alarm is set which for most of us is during the night night A fringe benefit is a small but cleverly designed flash light which is operated by a slider bar on the back of the clock This is separate from the time and alarm set controls on the slide of the clock Altogether this is a very ingeniously designed and apparently durable device Battery life is said to be about a year when the digits are illuminated for 8 hours per night 
for my son s eczema and good price cotton came in small size inexpensive and good to cover severe exposed wounds from eczema He tolerates them well he has autism and can go about his day while the wounds get a chance to heal don t get exposed to everything out there Was hard to find 
Silver Sands II Very comfortable and great looking too I love my new flip flops I ordered 1 size smaller than I normally wear because they run on the large side Only negative is that the strap fabric seems to show soil easily Great price and I would definitely buy a another pair in the future 
Great Shoe These are really cute shoes I have another pair of columbia flops and they are so comfortable I ve only worn this pair once so far and I must say that the straps across the top REALLY hurt my feet by the end of the day I was a little concerned and then I remembered that my other pair did the same the first time but after that they were fine I assume these will do the same The soles have a real airy bouncy feel I did receive several compliments on the color and style 
Incredibly comfortable These are the most comfortable underwear I have ever worn They are so soft and flexible it almost feels like you aren t even wearing underwear I plan on purchasing more of this item 
Great and simple I wanted a simple plain handsome tie clip It s easy to place and grips just well enough to hold your tie in place in face of errant tugs and pulls as well as in high winds but it doesn t clamp so tight to mark or ruin one s more delicate ties made of materials like silk etc The silver and gold clips are both basic and normal tones that you would want to go with everything of the like Look them up Great for the price and people can t tell what you paid for the clip as they retain their shine Worth the price ten fold 
Its a tie clip Very silver and shiny clips your tie to your shirt What can I say 
Rockport Walking Shoes Rockports are superb shoes The Rockport World Tour Classic is an excellent walking shoe They are light weight durable and most important comfortable From the first wearing of a properly fitting pair of Rockports one can step out in confidence that the shoes will conform to the foot and will not rub or chafe 
works for me When you are a 38D and horse back ride it s hard to find a bra that will fit hold not give uniboob look and not have the straps stretch to no end So far so good 
Best sports bra ever This is the best sports bra I ve ever had I wear it to Jazzercise class which is pretty high impact and I don t have any bouncing at all It s comfy the straps are wide so they don t cut your shoulders and the side bands are pretty wide too I d buy one for every day of the week if they were a little less expensive 
indy500guy These are extremely comfortable and great looking They don t leave much to the imagination though especially when wet I wouldn t recommend them if you re more of the shy type But if you re the type who likes the attention these are for you 
Wow these are nice And it makes me look great in them I love these shorts and I love the fact it hides NOTHING Considering I have quite a bit to show off anyway When I m exercising I love the fact that both men AND women love to stare there if you know what I mean It s definitely an ego booster 
Great Bikini bathing suits for men are great No more tan lines tight fits and comfort make these a great buy 
Amazing Like the photo implies and like most 2 x ist men s products this underwear is sexy comfortable flattering and made of quality materials Believe me this trunk truly has a pouch A big one Its actually just the right size for me and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it filling it The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas so its really nice Of course the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this no show I had no problem with this being no show wearing my lowest rising jeans with it Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants For me this trunk was not uncomfortable given its diminished size and intent to be no show Granted in those moments of excitement things do get a little more eh crowded But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief boxerbrief trunk This pair is made of 100 cotton so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X Factor line may enjoy this feature My only complaint is that the leg openings do not cling to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon etc But that is just minor The waistband is as always a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height in keeping with the no show design May I suggest you go for the extra bold 2 x ist No Show Trunk 3133C which comes in contrasting colors same product same price just sexier I cannot reccommend this trunk enough and within hours it became my favorite 2 x ist product in my collection 
Super Boots I ordered these boots on a whim I was afraid that the color would be a little too much for my conservative taste I opened the box and was totally pleased with the boots The heel is a nice height and the color is wonderful I have worn these boots with jeans to a club khakis to work and few skirts They are very versatile more so than I imagined Definately worth the money I paid 
Bandolino Calista Boot in Bronze Leather I have been looking for bronze boots for several years now and I have to say that I am very happy with these boots They are very very comfortable and of course very stylish The most important feature for me is that they are not too high of a heel and that they provide some support as far a boot is concerned These boots meet my requirements I may just have to purchase them in black If you are looking for style fit and an excellent price I would grab these boots right away 
Excellent by boy loves it You can always count on Andrew Christian to have super cute clothing at great prices 
This bag DOES NOT CLOSE I bought this bag to use as a overnight bag and to take on weekend trips The body of the bag easily fits the amount of clothes etc required for a few days away BUT the bag does NOT CLOSE AT ALL Apparently ther is some sort of built in hidden magnetic closure that is supposed to secure the top flap to the front of the bag This does not work at least on my bag WORSE STILL even if this magnet thing worked the sides of the flap are still totally open and anything small that you have in your bag can fall out if thebag is in anything but a perfectly upright position So much for using this as a carryon bag or putting it in the trunk of a car It is totally unreliable I am definitely returning this bag 
Sleep is overrated this thing is great for mounting on the wall The alarm never fails to wake me up either The temperature and moonphase information is not really necessary but its good for a grin or two 
Looks Great works even better This thing is amazing i put batteries in it let it sit and an hour later it had the right time and everything I use this in my work shop cause i always seem to get involved into a project then realize thats its 3AM But this always lets me know the time and when its time to go to bed it has an alarm clock too The only thing i wish it had mainly because I work in my wood shop would be a hydrometer so i could know what to expect wood drying and splitting rates to be But since that dosent apply to most people this is an outstanding buy 
La Crosse Technology Hurricane Atomic Digital Wall Clock with Moon IN Temp Look great easy to setu 
Great This costume was very complete Hat whistle hand cuffs night stick etc The quality was worth the money My son had so much fun dressing up There was a small problem with shipping and the box was opened somewhere along the line We were not sure if we had all the pieces When we contacted the company they sent us all the replacement parts without any question and we had them the next day Great customer service 
A Happy kid for halloween I was so pleased with this costume and the quality was exceptional and my grandson was proud of the fit He really thought he had the coolest costume 
Great costume The cost was great with lots of detail Our 8 year old grandson loved it and has worn it to play in besides for Halloween 
Complete costume for a great price I can see why this is an award winning costume The price was cheap compared to stores and taking into account what you get It came with everything necessary for our son to dress up like a cop for Halloween except a toy gun It s a great value and I d highly recommend it Our 8 year old son wore it almost every day for several weeks including about 5 different Halloween events and it held up well with no signs of wear 
Great Costume My 4 year old new he wanted to be a policeman since August so we went looking in September and ended up buying this one It is great The quality is amazing The details are great Compared to a friend of his with one of those store bought costumes there was no comparison The only issue was the hat which we fashioned a strap to keep it on My son has worn it at least 10 times with a full day of pre school included and it is still in great shape 
Not what I ordered Like some of the other reviewers I ordered the Illuminator but was sent the Dynamo instead I ordered the Illuminator because I had seen it in a store and know the quality I am not at all satisfied with the substitution that I received With the Illuminator you have the option of turning on one light or all three When you push the button on the Dynamo it clicks like it should be turning on the light but it takes 3 clicks to get the light to turn on I have never had a problem like this when ordering through Amazon but would recommend looking elsewhere if you are specifically looking for the Illuminator because that s not what you are going to receive 
Strong Oxford Soft Striping I was fortunate to be able to pick up the Chocolate Lab striped Oxford when it was offered in the winter There s nothing plain about this Oxford I would say classic because of the clean lines and gentle shaping provided by the darts in the back An additional benefit generally about all of Bealls long sleeve Oxfords is that they are shorter in length than most traditional Oxfords Most Oxford shirts are about 27 28 in length in a Misses size 0 20 but Bealls tend to run about 25 26 depending on your size for proportion The advantage is that you do not feel the need to tuck but you can still tuck if you would like Personally I have never been a fan of tucking shirts into pants or skirts especially if you want to highlight either Whoever sews these garments takes great care The back darts are aligned perfectly and the button thread is done criss cross style with a double looping underneath for extra strength The actual striping of the shirt is straight I ve seen with some more expensive shirts where someone either didn t follow the pattern correctly or tried to correct an improper pattern badly To me that makes a tremendous difference whether I will come back for more I am looking forward to more colors again The Chocolate Lab stripe is the only one I own and I ve had many ask me where I purchased I would love to see all of the colors which are offered in the 3 4 sleeve version with the addition of a Kelly green Gatsby Yellow short sleeve version color and perhaps even a beautiful Violet Definitely try this shirt because I know you will be pleased 
Avaitor Sunglasses Received the glasses very quickly Had a small problem but it was rectified immediately I am enjoying my sunglasses Would order again from you Thanks 
Excellent deal These glasses are both attractive and effective Well worth the money At the price you can afford to sit on them and so forth which invariably happens anyway They re also quite practical and very dark which I didn t expect from such an inexpensive item I ll definitly buy these again the next time I need to recreate some Sisters of Mercy music videos 
Excellent glasses Good Value The glasses were promptly shipped arrived in good condition and were of excellent quality for the price Amazing value and highly recommended 
Sweet Aviators I haven t ever owned a pair of these before and I became interested after a friend of mine got some I started looking around online and found some pretty outrageous prices for single pairs and when I came upon this deal I couldn t pass it up I love them I drive a school bus and I m by far the coolest driver in the lot with these Thanks for a great deal 
I love my Aviators I recieved my Aviator sunglasses today and i can t take them off they fit great and they fit comfortable 
Aviators Rule When i was looking for sunglasses i knew exactly what i wanted i just didnt know where to find them I looked at every store i could think of but no store seemed to have exactly what i wanted which were Aviator s specifically mirror tinted ones My brother suggested Amazon and the search was on It didn t take long before i found what i was looking for and to my delight i could get three pairs of high quality Aviators for less than 20 00 I jumped at the chance and i am pleased with the result only problem is my third pair of Aviators came missing the left nose pad but the other two pairs are great 
G C Chrome Metal Mirrored Aviator Sunglasses These glasses fit great and with the spring hinges on the side it makes you feel better to know they won t snap like some other glasses not to mention they look great 
Nice Aviators These shades are a great buy Fast shipping great price and good quality 
Great Shades I bought these shades and shared them with my friends as gifts and we absolutely love them I would recomment them to everyone 
A new trend here I m very please with my shirt i already order 10 more i highly recomend this shir 
UNBELIEVABLE BUY JUST GOT THE TWO COTTON RAGLAN SLEEVE BASEBALL SHIRTS THE QUALITY IS UNBELIEVABLE FOR THE PRICE MY HUSBAND LOVED THEM AND I WILL ORDER MORE FOR THE GRANDKIDS FAST SHIPPING TOO 
Outer Banks polo A quality shirt Now you need to start placing your logo on the left so that it can stand out against other polos 
Great boots I loved these boots once you wear them in for a day or two they are sooo comfortable They are a little loose from the back when you walk but very minimal that s why I didn t give them 5 stars I would totally recommend these 
Nine West Women s Hamza Boot is great I was looking for a quality boot for my wife Once again Amazon came to the rescue Nine West quality and an incredible discount plus free shipping My wife was thrilled The boot is beautiful and she tells me it is incredibly comfortable highly recommended 
Beautiful Boot Boots arrived promptly and were better than expected There is little to no arch support hence the 4 star rating and the shaft is wider than expected The boots arrived very promptly 
Nine West Women s Hamza Boot in Lt Brown Suede Very pleased with the quality and look of the boot They were even nicer looking than the picture Only suggestion order 1 2 size smaller than your normal size I also usually wear a narrow width and in this boot the medium width fit well across the forefoot but the heel was a little loose A thicker sock solved the problem 
Rockin Boots These boots look good and are so amazingly comfortable Love the full zipper in back and the pirate styling 
Nine West women s Hazma Boot These boots are great and comfortable and they are exactly as shown in the pictures provided The craftsmanship is great The boots were packaged very well and they arrived well in advance of their promissed date Thanks 
So comfortable Most of my shoes and boots are from Nine West I love they re styles every season they have the most up to the minute fashions and they re prices are nt too scary either I got these boots for the coming winter I live in New England so I needed warm and comfortable boots but I did nt want to compromise on style I love these boots I got the dark brown ones and so far I have worn them with jeans under and over and opaque tights and a short skirt and they look amazing with both They are really warm and the sole is perfect for wearing in icy conditions I ordered the normal width but I would recommend to anyone with even slightly wide feet to go for the wide fitting as I found them a little snug accross the middle of my foot Other than that no complantins 
They smell horrible They smell like mothballs I m still airing them out after wearing them once and realizing how bad they smell Would recommend against them solely based on the smell even though they look great the reasoning for the 2 stars vs 1 star 
Wide and comfortable Wear them daily on the job and on commutes Saves time using Velcro instead of laces I did some running in them but they are really better for walking instead After two months of wear the sole is still in one piece and the stitches are still in place The interior sole lining smells bad after 2 days wear due to the material they NB makes it with I had to changed them out and put better ones in This was the only minor problem I had with them On top of that the availablity of extra wide sizes means no blisters or corns 
Excellent Service The service was exceptional My item arrived quicker than anticipated I highly recommend this company 
quality My son needed these for wrestling and is very happy with them He says they are comfortable and also look good I would recommend them to anyone 
Shoes are great Thank you Quick service and just as described Perfect fit 
great shoe for less price I use it everyday and it didn t cost me a lot what a great shoe to buy with less price from the store mal 
Classy These are great for times where your girlfriend needs to impress on the topless runway but also can benefit from the slenderizing effect of pinstripes In addition since pinstripes are standard issue for the bidness world she will be as equally welcome at the office executive retreat as she would be at the strip club 
They Made Me Feel Ready for Bed all Day Long I m a pretty sexy girl and these so called panties are just about too sexy for me Ooooweee do I feel hot when I have em on Levi s shorts dress or trucker s overhauls it makes no difference The whole rest of the world might not know what you have on under there but you ll know and that s enough to add a certain blush to your face let me tell you They made me feel ready for bed all day long 
These Almost Nothing At All Panties Really Set off a Girl s Body I shot the heck out of my sister and her friends at our lingerie party as they tried on these panties At first the girls wore different tops with them sexy bras skimpy tees but after a bit I got them to shed those and I clicked away Then it was my turn and the camera was clicking at me Kind of thrilling These almost nothing at all panties really set off a girl s body in a photo 
Way Sexier than Naked If you ve ever posed nude felt the flash splasing over your body when you ve got nothing on then you ll know what I mean when I say these panties are way sexier than naked When you re naked and you spread your legs a bit it s no big deal not if you re used to the camera but with these on that certain part of your body is emphasized for the camera seems to stand out in the photos You wear these outside under a dress or skirt then you ve got more courage than me and I m a pretty brave girl Still I really feel sexy with them on 
Sexier than Naked I dare say these are just about the sexiest things I ve ever worn Oh I ve had and have G strings have some pretty skimpy ones too But a crotchless G String masqurading as a crotchless pantie what a concept Try going outside in a short skirt with nothing under it but these Might as well be walking around naked under that skirt But then again I ve done that However wearing these panties slash G string just seems sexier than naked 
simple elegance After reading all the reviews I contemplated about purchasing the dress for more than 1 month before actually ordering it The price is really hard to beat and the style is simple but elegant and unique I particularly like the small train that fans out with the bead works I am a petite 5 2 weighing lt 115 I was not sure if I should order the small or medium so I wrote and asked the sales people and they suggested me a small which turned out to fit me quite well except for the length The dress is a few inches too long for me even with my 2inch high heel 
Great great great dress I ordered this dress for my beach side wedding in Tortola BVI and it fit me perfectly No alterations needed at all If you are hippy though you may need to buy a bigger size fortunately I am not When I walked down the coconut groved aisle to stand next to my new husband he was just smiling and staring at me and whispering about how pretty I looked till they had to call his attention back to saying his vows Get this dress If you like simple elegance this is it And for the price excellent 
LOVE my dress When I saw the price of this dress I was very skeptical But after reading the reviews thank you everyone I decided to order it since the company had a great return policy I am more than pleased I am 5 4 and usually wear a size 8 so I ordered the large All that needs to be altered is about 1 off the length and under the arms I am a 34D I also am having my seamstress bustle the train This is a second wedding for both of us and the dress is just perfect for it elegant but not overly bridal 
Simply Beautiful I found the dress to be very true to size I wear 12 to 14 in regular clothing and I ordered the XL 12 14 as suggested by the product features section I am 5 5 The dress fits perfectly I am amazed by the dress itself well made fully lined Ladies this dress is a real bargain You couldnt touch it in the store for this price This dress is excatly what we were looking for something simple for our outside wedding yet elegant This dress is simply stunning I cant wait to wear it for our September wedding and look forward to handing it down to my Daughter for her Wedding Day 
Good bargain be careful about sizing Based on the several good reviews below I decided to purchase this dress to wear for my own wedding There is a review that said the dress comes in larger than expected so I ordered a size small The shipping is very fast I ordered on a Thursday evening and received the dress on Monday I do live in the same state where the company is in However the dress is too tight I m 5 ft 4 inches weigh 120 lbs and I usually wear a women s size 2 i e Banana Republic Express I will be exchanging the item for a medium For the price the dress is a good bargain It is sheer on the bottom so you will need a slip underneath The beading is nice extra beads are included and the way the dress flares out at the bottom is very unique The dress was long on me and would probably need to be taken in at least 3 inches The clasp are loosely sewn on two broke after I took off the dress so I would have a seamstress sew it on more tightly The dress also arrives folded so you will need to take care of the wrinkles Overall I m happy with the dress for its price and design and I can t wait to receive the correct size 
Be careful picking your size This dress is really very beautiful and I would have been perfectly happy with it if only it had fit me The sizing chart on the website is not right I am a size 5 5 ft 6 in so I ordered a medium as the sizing chart suggested but it was HUGE Unfortunately I was told by PacificPlex that they were sold out of smalls in the white color although they are selling them now I had to get my dress altered in the bust and waist the length was perfect The material is not satin as stated but a satin like polyester which is a bit see through so definitely need a slip or something For the price it is still great I ve been looking for my dress for months and couldn t find any that were slim fitting with a halter top so when I saw this dress at only 119 I was pretty excited I ve never bought clothes online and I m not sure I will in the future but I am glad I bought this dress I just wish PacificPlex would have told me they had more dresses on order as I was still well within the 30 day refund guarantee It would have been cheaper to exchange than to get the alterations Although my seamstress did say that based on how big the medium was on me the small probably would have needed to be taken in as well Oh well it fits and I m happy now 
Amazing I am floored by how beautiful this gown is I m getting married later this year in Vegas and wanted something kinda retro glam and figured if I didn t like it I had plenty of time to return it I have to say it is absolutely positively PERFECT Everything I could want in a wedding gown No frills no lace no bows Just elegance The irridescent bugle beads and swarovski crystals span the length of the train Every day I pull the gown from the closet and OOOoooo Aaaaahhh Can t wait to wear it November s a long way off My fiance even agrees on how gorgeous it is honest Even the close ups don t do the gown justice Oh yeah and the price the best 119 I ve ever spent Shipping was speedy Bottom line BUY THIS GOWN 
Beautiful The dress is beautiful My Fiance loves it and says it fits great I can t wait to see her in it 
Pleasantly Surprised I was skeptical ordering a wedding dress on line but the return policy was very fair It is very nice The quality for the price is exceptional I am having an intimate wedding ceremony and dinner and this dress will be perfect It was delivered within 3 business days of the original order I ll be able to wear it again if a formal occasion arises 
Love It I love this dress The price was what made me order it but when I received it it was even prettier than what it looked like online It fit great everywhere but the back I will have to get that taken in but for the price I won t complain It looked really pretty on I was a little thrown off by the size of the box when I received it but the dress more than made up for it I wanted something simple and pretty for an island wedding and this is perfect A definite worthy buy 
waterproof sandals Love the comfort but I am accustomed to Birkenstock sandals Got these to use as I am walking our two Labs My only comment has to do with the ankle strap It s comfortable yet I wish it were not there I do think these sandals are worthy of a favorable recommendation W

Very convenient and compact an essential hair tool I have short hair not ultra short but short and I find that a few hot curlers can make a big difference in volume on bad hair days While I have a full sized Conair curler set I discovered that my travel set was really best suited to my hair length So travel or not this little set has become a real favorite What you get The Remington Travel Hair curlers come in a nylon bag with the heating unit build in The top is clear and fastened by velcro You pull it open and plug it in to start heating the rollers On the side of the nylon bag is a smaller oblong bag holding the roller clips There are five medium rollers about an inch in diameter and five small rollers about 5 8 inch diameter There are two sets of clips pink for the large roller white for the smaller roller The clip fits around the roller and has a tab to aid grabbing it for removal The rollers turn from pink to greyish white when they are heated They fit into the base over a socket with two prongs They heat up in about 2 minutes How they work The rollers claim to have Ionic Technology to reduce static and the frizzies I find that my hair is indeed smooth when I take it out of the rollers After I let the curls cool I can style with no frizz The ends of the rollers stay cool to avoid burning your head They are a bit heavy I leave the rollers in for five to fifteen minutes by which time my hair is well curled Upsides downsides To keep this set compact there are only 10 rollers I could use a few more even with my short hair The built in travel bag is very well designed and compact for a suitcase or small bathroom If you LOSE THE CLIPS you can find a general replacement style of clip for about 10 at http www ballbeauty com remington_hair_setters htm CLIPS I dropped two of my white clips and the cats apparently made off with them as trophies of their hunting prowess So this is helpful to know where to buy more clips The curls last long though they aren t as stiff as with some of the more expensive foam covered type of curlers 
Only socks my child will wear I have a child with a sensory integration disorder and until I found these socks it was a battle every day all day to get and keep socks on his feet It was as if it was a painful experience for him He could not stand uneven or rough textures lint balls or seams These socks changed our lives Now we don t start every day on the wrong foot excuse the pun I was crushed when my local shoe store that carried these socks went out of business but was thrilled to find them on Amazon These socks are worth every penny and then some 
VERY COMFY SOCKS My son is a squirmer when it comes to something not fitting right with his clothes He will complain FOREVER We used to buy several other brands of boys socks that had the seam across the toes No matter how many times I adjusted the socks he still complained Now the ONLY socks I will put on him are Tic Tac Toe Seamless Socks He honestly has never complained once about how these socks feel on his toes Very good quality socks 
Great product These socks are wonderful for children with sensitive feet My son loves them and he won t wear anything else now 
No more complaining from my 7 year old son My son has always had issues with socks being too scratchy or bumpy one of his sensory integration issues and every morning before school was a struggle to have them put on Seamless socks were recommended and I saw these Tic Tac Toe long socks on Amazon and gave them a try Wow what a difference The complaining has completely stopped he loves wearing these Enough said 
very nice very nice pair of slip on very comfortable there s padding around the ankle so you won t bleed i always have this problem with dress shoes another reason why i gave this a five star is for the reason that i got it on sale for 60 dollars i also have both brown and black so i hope this help good luck i know how hard it is to go buy dress shoes that really fit your style 
Acorn Women s Spa Thong Slipper The Acorn Thong Slippers are very comfortable true to size and wash beautifully

good looking maternity bra This maternity bra is very elegant and feminine looking bring the glamour to nursing Most comfortable and practical this is my main nursing bra so good I m ordering another in a different colour 
I actually got complimented on this bra by my pediatrician who said all of her nursing bras look much more utilitarian I need a 36C while nursing and it supports really well despite its frilly appearance FYI Motherhood Maternity makes a bra that looks EXACTLY like this bra for 1 2 the price However I don t know how supportive it is 
Love this bra I actually love this bra It has become my favorite bra It offers a lot of support and looks great 
Reebok G6 I like these shoes very much I would like them even more if yall had some in stock or at least had a picture of them 
Beautiful in Bonsai I bought these in Bonsai and LOVE them They are very comfortable and stylish I am in a green period in my fashion life and these go with several great outfits The shoes are definitely worth the price check Zappos and you ll see what a bargain these are at Amazon 
Luv this little tote Great item and it shipped fast thank you It looks exactly as it does online I bought it for a Christmas present and I m sure my recipient will adore it It is fully lined and has a little zipper pocket on the inside It is well made and I love the straps It s the perfect size for teens or young girls or someone who needs a smaller sized tote It measures approximately 14 W by 8 3 4 L and hangs about 10 1 2 from the shoulder I highly recommend this item 
EXCEPTIONAL A must have I already own a lot of handbags so I bought this one thinking I d use it for warm weather vacations when I really need a bag to carry my water bottle and wallet in Turns out I ve started using it all the time like as a shopping tote or for running errands it fits everything I ever need on me Totally recommend this for anyone who is a shopaholic and bagaholic like me And don t forget to buy one for your girlfriends they will love you for it 
Wonderful These were perfect Arrived quickly looked exactly like the picture and in perfect condition and fit perfectly We could not find the narrow size our son needed in a shoe he liked in the stores so I looked online out of desperation I didn t think that ordering shoes online could possibly have worked out so well I was quite hesistant Ended up that this was one of the best online purchases we ve probably ever made 
A value your feet will be comfortable with The most significant feature of these shoes is that they are accurately sized unlike so many imported products almost all shoes fall into that category I need a triple E and these are a triple E If a shoe is not comfortable immediately out of the box then it is best not to wear it never mind the they stretch or you ll break them in nonsense and torment your feet These easily meet that condition precedent They are also flexible light weight and reasonably good looking And at the Amazon price they were truly a bargain This is my second pair having worn a black pair for half a year which should provide some indicia of my satisfaction Short of the formerly made in Maine Dexter s now unfortunately outsourced these are the most comfortable shoes I have worn in years 
Most comfortable shoe ever My husband stated that these were the most comfortable shoes he s ever worn The soft leather is so flexible that he feels like he s wearing slippers and for the moderate price it s absolutely worth purchasing 
Excelent shoe for work This is piece of heaven in your feet to walk on eart 
Great price fast shipping perfect accessory Great add on purchase for any costume or special evening without having to pay dept store pricing Will buy more 
Basic Black Boots This a very basic black boot I choose these because I was 5 months pregnant at the time and wanted something a bit stylish yet low to the ground to help me avoid trips or falls If you are into a very basic minimalist look these boots are for you If not stick with stalletos always my first choice 
Great sexy shorts and fine product Be forewarned that these run small and are not for the faint of heart But if you have the assets to show off and enjoy that these shorts will be right up your alley Comfortable with a good build quality so they make a good value 
Fantastic My daughter says They are fun to wear They make a clomp clomp noise They are very wonderful to look at I say They are very cute My daughter enjoys the heel 
Complete Comfort This shoe fits like a glove and feels like air on my feet It has great support and looks good I would definately recommend this shoe to anyone who wants comfort support and good looks 
Great belt a bit small for the large size Great quality belt arrived just as in the photo however I think it would be a juniors size Large as I had to order another style and ordered that XL which fit very well 
PAUL FRANK GIRLS BEDDING JULIUS SHAM Great Service The Sham was mailed out that day and when we received it it looked just like the picture It was perfect and my daughter was thrilled I will definitely be ordering again Lauri 
This bra really is frankly fabulous I discovered this style of bra a few years back when I had a frozen shoulder and needed a front closure bra My shoulder has healed but I have stuck with this bra It is one of the most comfortable I ve ever worn It is difficult to find front closure bras that have only one clasp and do not have a racer back or some kind of padding in the cups This bra suits my needs perfectly and I hope it is never discontinued It is available in black white or nude 
Durability One of the sleeves on this XL T shirt separated at the seam after only a couple of washings Other than that it was fine If it came in XXL maybe this wouldn t have happened I could try losing weight I suppose 
Great Buy It is really hard to find a sports bra in the size I needed I reccomend this bra for those of you who are big chested but still want to exercise without having your chest flop around 
Tweed Castros The tweed castros are very cool Fidel would be proud The box was pretty happenin too designed to look like a cigar box Sizing on these shoes i find to be very accurate Well made comfortable seem to be durable 
THE BEST cargo pants I ve tried I m female but only buy the men s versions of pants This is only partly because of how comfortable they are loose fit means loose with men s stuff which is what I prefer I bought this chromium gray pair from M A C Y S directly but they weren t any cheaper I have 2 other pairs of the same pants in khaki and black also not from A m a z o n These pants are true cargo with the side leg pockets the flaps on the rear pockets carpenter pants don t have the closeable flap on back but still have at least one side pocket The material is soft cotton I feel like I m wearing a pair of pajamas when I wear these and I love that The pants wrinkle easily but that s the price you pay for sheer comfort And the Levi s brand should mean they last forever 
LOVE IT This is my second pair of these one pair black one pair tan I absolutely love them and they are a great deal 
jazz bootie Purchased for my little dancer Good quality shoe for a growing child 
Jazz shoe These fit my daughter just fine she is 18 and a size 11 She has been happy with them 
Thanks Thanks for the shoes they came very quickly and I like them a lot I got my street shoe size and they fit fine 
Exactly wht I wanted Very reasonable cost less than half that in the stores Delivered on time and good quality 
Beautiful sandals I m pleased with the look and fit of these sandals My only complaint is that the sole is very slick so walking is tricky Once I put something rough on the bottom these sandals will be perfect At least the heel is not slick thank goodness These sandals are very comfortable 
Terribly cute These are terribly cute shoes I have it in candy and I am extremely happy with it They will look absolutely pretty with short skirts Great buy 
Awesome Thong Boosting and fitting around and each of your naughty bits An incredible brief for the confident man Extremely sexy fitting around your package in an incredible way almost as if a seperate pouch for each of the male genitals making an extremely natural fit and feel except that the extreme curvature will lift and extend your package to create a very impressive enlarging effect Semi discreet see through very see through when not worn but can t be seen through almost at all when worn unless strong light directly from size even when wet Will boost your package noticebly under most clothing and definitely if worn to beach 
Nike Air Jordan IV Retro White Review I was really impressed when I could even find this shoe available almost one year after its release date as I understand that every spring a new line of Air Jordan s is released These shoes were easy to find and purchase on this website It is a secure and reliable site that keeps your personal information private and the shoes were delivered only one or two days past the expected delivery date which was less than 6 or 8 business days I m impressed 
Pop that collar Very nice set different sizes and in one place where they are readily accessible Just don t forget to take them out before you have your shirts laundered 
One of the most confortable shoes ever Weightless The only problem was when delivered Amazon placed the shoebox into a huge box with plastice air packs and the price of the delivery skyrocketed 
Great Case The case arrived fast from My Gear Store and fits my Sansa perfectly The colors are great too 
Great Case I love the Color Options It comes with all the accessory additions that I need Protects it from scratches very nicely Silicone protects it well Not much will protect an MP3 player from a fall unless you want a big bulky case I would recommend an aluminum one if that is waht is desired This case is great because it is sleek slim and protects it well from everyday use 
Live Wire When I first wore this bra I thought it was the most comfortable bra I ve ever worn It s silky supportive only has two hooks and it makes you look good in form fitting shirts no double bubble effect Only one problem after the third wear my underwire worked it s way through the lining and was sticking straight out of my V neck shirt at dinner On closer examination I saw that the tips of the underwire were not flat enough to prevent this from happening They re like points I have yet to receive a response from the vendor concerning this matter so be careful 
The most comfortable bra I ve ever worn and at my size I ve tried them all This bra doesn t pinch bind or leave red marks on me yet holds up my 40DDD s right where I want em Thank goodness for Goddess 
Puma Power I got mine with a elegant blue swoosh on the side I love it I always feel good in white shoes 
great sneakers Oldschool style modern comfort These shoes are some of the most comfortable sneakers I have ever worn Buy a pair today 
Love them I love Gerber Onesies They do tend to run small but they were the only ones that fit my 7lb newborn He is now 6 weeks and about 10lbs and still wearing the newborn size They are thin and light weight and my pick of all the newborn size onesies I currently own 
Can t review the product I can t review this product because I never got it I emailed Amazon for a refund since I was supposed to receive my order by Dec 22 and today Jan 17th I haven t receive it 
Great product It is a very fresh top Even if outside temperature is very high you won t feel any hot at all 
Comfortable Shoes My son s favorite color is green He absolutely loves these shoes The fit is perfect And they have lasted a couple of months now My son is very active in sports so he needed some quality shoes 
Waste of my money This product was a great disappointment to me After the first hand washing the cups became lumpy where the water portion of the cup met the padded portion Now there is a ridge right through the middle of the cup The only way I could now wear this bra would be under a bulky sweatshirt or sweater I would recommend instead the gel Wonderbras or After Eden Lightweight gel bra Neither have as much liquid as the Atlantis but experience has shown me that they hold up better and are a much better investment 
Injustice It is advertised as a pant set but it came as a capri set It has a lacy thing around the neck that is extremely uncomfortable 
Grey Shoes A friend wanted a pair of grey shoes to match a handbag Her and I had visited several department stores and shoe stores most stores didn t have grey or ones shone were for evening wear I stumble on these by accident and I immediately ordered them Enzo women s shoes are in the stores but they didn t have any grey My friend love them and thank me for finding her the pair grey shoes I must say the internet have a larger selection of color on all items and in all sizes 
Need to return I bought this for my son for Christmas He likes it but we got the wrong size How can I return this and get another size 
Toddler Boys Stride Rite shoe I am very pleased with the Stride Rite white navy sneaker and I could get it in wide which was much easier than going shopping with an 18 month old It shipped quickly and arrived in a few days in perfect condition at an unmatched price The shoe is exactly what is described on line and was in perfect condition I will definitely order shoes on line again for him 
great socks always buy comfortable socks just make sure the size is right am replacing older socks these wear and wear but no dyer if you want long life hang to dry 
I absolutely love this sweater It s so nice and comfortable Very warm too I think that I might order another in a different color 
Seattle T Shirt I am happy to wear the T shirt I wore it on the Super Bowl and it didn t help Seattle win But I still like the T shir 
Super Hot Absolute show stoppers I ordered this shoe in both colors and they are both fabulous They look awesome with a skirt show off those legs girls or with pants Plus I think they are multi seasonal so you can wear them year round 
The best socks ever I love these socks Great for a group setting for hygenic reasons and they really keep you from not slipping Very sticky bottoms 
Most Comfortable They aren t pretty but they re more comfortable than tennis shoes Go figure I love em 
A good beginner s shoe This jazz shoe was good for me because I m just a beginner and I probably won t continue this for long It has been durable The only thing I don t like is the fact that thye get pretty dirty due to the fabric lots of lint and such gets stuck to them If you are an in between size I would suggest going to the smaller size because I chose larger and they are really too big Other than that the shoe is comfortable and functions great for my usage 
great kids shoes Our 5 y o daughter has used her crocs now for over over six months since beg of June If you should have any doubt about the crocs as children shoes just don t They are great and perfect in all situations Feet do not sweat and the shoes are truly comfortable on all terrains If dirt gets in the shoe the child can get it off and clean it very easily Definitely a perfect buy and kids love them 
Unsure about that above pic The stocking were very lovely The pic shows an elastic on the thigh area which is false I bought these for my wedding and did not even open the package until the day of I was very upset to learn that I needed the elastic straps to hold the stockings up 
Nice product This was shipped as promised It arrived quickly and in gift boxes I would buy from this seller again 
A Classic Little Black Swim Suit What an absolute winner THIS IS A CLASSIC AND I MEAN CLASSIC It accentuates all the good and covers all the bad Very retro styling with leg and bottom coverage that leaves you feeling modestly but elegantly comfortable Made out of substantial fabric in a updated modern black with gold design The bodice support is remarkable too it has stays at the sides to give bra like support However it s the hip and bottom support that makes this suit unique It s basically a 40 s style suit with a modern twist The price is awesome too A swim suit of this quality would usually be around 100 00 or more I am a happy old lady customer I swim a lot I buy a lot of suits and there are only three brands that are any good Maxine Lands End and Carol Wior 
Great for baking This is one of the best quality aprons I have found It is made out of a heavy canvas which doesn t wear out very quickly Although the canvas is thick it doesn t feel very heavy when wearing it The apron is easily adjustable and has a lot of coverage It is machine washable for easy cleanup I wouldn t do any baking without this apron 
DRESS MY DAUGHTER WAS MARRIED IN THE CAYMANS AND THIS WAS THE PERFECT DRESS FOR THE REHEARSAL DINNER ON THE BEACH THE NIGHT BEFORE 
too wide too narrow I have always wanted a pair of Birkenstocks I have tried in vain to find that proper fit I have narrow slim fit Birkenstocks are great shoes but not for narrow or slim footed women 
Sandals from Birkenstock Although the sandal is approved by Birkenstock the upper material is not as sturdy as the original birkenstock The other parts of the sandal look and feel like the original I was a little surprised recently when my therapist asked me to stop wearing them and recommended a tennis shoe as a replacement I have a minor foot problem and feel fine with the sandal which I have worm for at least three years She said they were not sturdy 
Great sandal great price This is a great sandal i bought i pair to replace a pair of simmilar sandals i had for 4 years and i think they are just great the footbed is VERY comfortable and the leather strap is nice and soft its just too bad i bought them at the end of summer cause i dont wanna take them off my feet 
Great for all occasions These sandals have got to be the best I have every worn They go with any outfit They look great with khaki jean or shorts They can be worn during hiking trips without the fear of the soles being punctured by brush It s rare to see but the Betula spinoff of Birkenstock comes and goes every couple years or so The pair Im replacing are Betulas and I bought them 3yrs ago As it turns out you can have Birkenstock sandals repaired over time as long as the cork isnt too badly damaged All one has to do is take them to a liscensed dealer and 25 00 later you have a repaired pair of sandals Other brands can come up with knockoffs but nothing matches a true anatomically correct Birkenstock I suggest going to a store that sells Birkenstocks and seeing what size your largest foot is before buying online so as to avoid the hassle of having to mail back the sandals and trying to get the correct size Once you have all the necessary info you are set to buy them to your feet s content You wont regret buying these sandals The comfort is unmatched It doesnt matter if you are using them around the house or taking them on a tour of a big city They wont let your feet become weary 
Best shoes if you pronate and for flat feet I love my Asics GT 2120 What a difference it makes to have the right shoes to run no more knee pain I actually went to a local store and had a running test done and tried on different shoes and this were the best Great arch support 
Light as air and cushions your foot Great shoes for training They are so comfortable and light that I bought another pair in a different color 
The best running shoe on the market just keeps getting better The entire ASICS GT line from the GT 1000 to the most recent GT 2120 are by far the best value for runners The ASICS GTs are consistently ranked the best overall running shoe by the editors of Runner s World Magazine year after year and I agree 100 My last four pairs of running shoes have been ASICS and every pair has impressed me and kept my knees and feet pain free even through my weekly long runs which are up to 13 miles each Asics make great running socks too which make all the difference if you run longer distances This particular shoe ASICS GT 2120 is my favorite so far I prefer this shoe to the more pricey ASICS Kayano which provides less cushion and costs 135 per pair Just when I thought it impossible to love my GTs any more ASICS outdid itself with the GT 2120 
Comfy and cute I wear these shoes EVERY chance I get They were worth every penny 
Great Shirts These are great shirts they fit well and are comfortable I ve worn and washed the shirts about twice a week for nearly 9 months now and the durability is pretty good not much deformation and the fabric doesn t pill up Nice product for a good price 
Didn t arrive I ordered an assortment of purses from the same company but this one didn t arrive 
Carlos Santana I LOVE SHOES These shoes are magnificent The glittery sparkles allow you to either dress up or dress down depending on the occasion I highly reccomend these shoes and their twin pair in black Very Sexy Carlos Santana s shoes ARE my favorite brand They are stylish sleek and ultra chic I have about 8 pr of his shoes and i m always looking to expand my collection 
I love Shoes These are so lovely and comfortable iam going to buy me another pair of these 
tie front sweater I really like this I bought it for a bed jacket and it is working out very well It is light and soft 
good solid shoe good solid shoe looks great the tongue moves quite a bit but good comfortable shoe hanging tuff with my GBX shoes of similar looks 
very cute and comfy The fit is a little larger than true to size I would have almost gone a size smaller had I known I would say that they are designed for bottom heavy body types wider hips and fuller bottom and I am not that type so a medium would have probably been a bit more flattering in the backside but they are just for lounging around and working out so I am not that worried about it and just for the record they are not hideously unflattering I would have returned them if they were this is for sizing information only the look is great and they are really comfy 
T Shirt The shirt was everything I was hoping for Great product and service Fast delivery Thank you 
Great Quality but small I couldn t believe how nice this t shirt was The material is very nice and the dragon is great Jumps off the shirt I m glad it was pre shrunk though cause it ran a bit small and there was not room at all for shrinkage 
Love these shoes I tried these Skechers on locally and then ordered them from Amazon for a better price I love these shoes They are stylish and look great with capris or khaki shorts They re a fun change from an open toe sandal Solid construction nice color I m pleased 
skechers excursion they re great i love them i was afraid they might be a little big b c my foot is so narrow but they fit great extremely comfortable i could wear them all day the first day i had them i usually can t do that my feet tend to hurt with all leather i highly recommend them 
Just like the pros My son was excited to get this beautiful jersey that looks like just like the pros The colors were bright and beautiful I received this item quickly just in time for Christmas 
Excellent This stuff works It has saved me from having to buy new skate shoes every few months 
Really Nice I ordered this item and just received it today I love it In the picture the train appears to be of a more solid material I thought a silky type Its however sheer Not exactly what I expected but still very nice 
Luxurious This gown is incredibly luxurious and sexy The gown is very well made revealing just enough to spark your partner s interest I love wearing it with a lacey garter belt nylons and spiked heels The train feels so silky on my legs A must for those candlelit sexy nights It gets my partner s attention if you know what I mean 
Great Cleats No Break in required The shoes worked great right out of the box I use them for Ultimate and the first weekend I wore them they performed nearly flawlessly I had only worn them for one short hour long practice session before using them for an entire tournament weekend 7 games over two days So they had not been broken in and still I only got one hint of a hot spot blister on the back of my heel The tread pattern worked great in the long grass field The ground was definately soft and the firm ground cleats dug in consistantly providing traction in all the various movements required of Ultimate Great Shoes great tread pattern no break in required Buy em 
Not as expected These socks were purchased for my husband who has MS and experiences coldness in his feet The socks barely warm and the shank of the sock is so tight that they are uncomfortable to put on and take off and my husband is thin The manufacturer also said that they are not returnable This is something I did not know until too late 
Thermal Pants The thermal pants I ordered were a perfect fit The color was exactly as stated They keep me very warm 
Warm and Cozy The Thermals arrive quickly and were just what I needed to get through cold evenings at football games Very Cozy 
You really got to love them I really love the quality My daughter now has about two sets of them she looks so adorable in them My friends and family also like them and are going to get them for there kids as well 
stylish These tee tops are really cute and of good quality they also wash very good go with a bigger size becaue around the sleeve is a bit fitted for my son 4 months of age even though i bought 3 6month size 
Style at a great price This is my first experience with ordering shoes over the internet I usually like to try shoes on before purchasing to make sure of the style and fit I was pressed for time so I took a chance hoping that the shoes would be as pictured and would fit correctly The shipping was lightening fast and once they arrived not only did they fit perfectly but the style was better than what was pictured Not only did my wife comment on the look but 2 total strangers asked where I purchased the shoes I must admit that I would not hesitate to make a shoe purchase over the internet in the future 
Strong Shiny I was nervous about these tights but my mind was set at ease as soon as I opened the package These tights are soft warm strong and resist stains well My 4 year old loves the fact that they shimmer They are a fabulous value especially for those in rural areas where it can be difficult to find quality children s clothes in a local store My order was shipped in very secure packaging and arrived in about a week The invoice was clear and initialed by two persons who double checked the order The return policy and company information were clearly printed at the bottom of the page 
Great Shoes I was a little skeptical about buying shoes on the internet but I m completely satisfied with my shoes They are comfortable and great looking 
I bought as a gift and now I want a pair I bought these for my 92 Y O Grandmother who is very picky about what she wears on her feet She loves them They are very soft and comfortable Easy to put on and take off and soles are great for non slipping We wear the same size and if she couldn t wear them I would have kept them anyway Now I have to get me a pair 
Acorn arch support If you need arch support in a slipper because you wear them several hours a day Acorn is a very good buy I recently injured my heel and these were the only slippers I could wear that offered enough cushion and support despite being mules This model is very warm and can be worn for trips to the mailbox 
Poplin jacket I bought this jacket to replace a very old and worn London Fog jacket which I was not wanting to give up This jacket is a perfect lined light weight for virtually any season I even wear it here in northern NM in the Winter because it offers just enough protection going to and from the car The neck closure in addition to the regular collar makes it very versatile And it is a very comfortable fit plenty of pockets well made and a very nice color teal I give it 2 thumbs up 
Poplin Jacket Review Am very satisfied with this item It s light and comfortable yet keeps me warm 
Poplin jacket I thought that this was a nice autumn jacket well tailored sleek plaid lining Covers a sweater 
The perfect summer coat I was looking for a lightweight windbreaker but with more substance than the typical nylon jacket and this is it The shell is polyester cotton with a Teflon coating and has that London Fog feel and look to it very elegant And it has a very nice cotton plaid lining inside that gives the jacket the feel of wearing a coat and not that thin nylon windbreaker feel Yet it seems as light as a nylon windbreaker Should it rain the water rolls right off due to the Teflon coating Under the front flaps up to the neck is a netting that allows the coat to breathe and keep things comfortable inside The neck area and the zipper flap keep out the wind and rain when it s too warm outside for a heavy coat And it s machine washable and dryer safe I like how it looks on me and the way it feels wearing it Here in the San Francisco Bay Area where it can be chilly in the morning and anything from cool to warm or foggy and windy in the afternon with this coat I m ready for anything 
Great shoes great price I am very pleased with these shoes I accidentally ordered a size W instead of M so they are a little loose but extremely comfortable nonetheless I ve always known that Naturalizer was a good brand and getting these for under 20 was a steal I definitely recommend buying them 
I Can always count on Naturalizer As usual these shoes fit as expected But then Naturalizer shoes are what I usually buy since I have a hard to fit size I can usually find what I need in this brand I have gotten tired of trying to search for my size in other brands which don t always fit and are usually far more costly I have them on now and they are very comfortable 
nike boxing shoes recieved product very quick and exactly what i ordered very happy wih produc 
Nike boxing wrestling shoes I m very happy with this shoe I m disappointed that I had to go to a boxing equipment company to find the same shoe sold by all of the wrestling catalogs but only in black My school colors are red white and blue Our rival schools colors are orange and black I m thankful Title Boxing sells this shoe and I intend to continue to by from them as long as they sell red white or blue shoes 
Old School And Awsome I ve had a few pairs of DM s now and they are the best My first pair were 8 eye black vegans I ve had them for almost 5 years now I also have 10 eye steel toe Oxbloods These have been through many drunk nights fights and shows Comfort well after you break them in style and utility If you ve been thinking about getting a pair then do it 
Good walking shoe I m on my feet alot aprox 60 hours per week and these shoes have remained comfortable and are wearing well 
my cup runneth over This is the only bra I ve found that proves itself through the years It s the best bra for holding me secure when I m walking I feel comfortable and confident 
Comfort style and wears like iron This is one great bra I have two of them I ve thrown into the washing machine more times than I can count over the course of several years and it wears and wears and wears I would think stretch lace means flimsy but it isn t at all This is one of the most comfortable bras I ve ever found and I ve tried many of them If you want a bra that will hold everything up AND hold up well to multiple washing and still look feminine this is it 
Is it metal It looks like metal but it was as soft as a cardborard Terrible 
foot pleaser after about 3 months of using this sandal your foot won t want anything else i guess that s it s only problem i d wear them everyday if i could so comfortable i ve actually passed out wearing them and didn t kick them off whilst sleeping it s a bit pricey but justified after the experience now if they could make BCBG heels this comfy i d be all smiles 
Very comfortable Hopefully it s okay I use Amazon s kid review since I wish to remain anonymous I ve been wearing male underwear all my life but this is really comfortable Of course I could probably find the male equivalent of this panty but hey if it works go with it 
Just the best socks I practically live in these socks They are the most comfortable and longlasting socks you will ever own Somewhat pricey for socks but these are worth every penny Guaranteed to last 3 years at least no matter what 
Decent but far not for wet weather Arm band and case are convenient and comfortable Haven t needed to take my mini out since I put it in Window allows good control access As a runner I find the clip a little floppy but it s not fallen off Design Open at top and bottom allows easy access and keeps iPod safe from sweat during my 12 mile runs but I d never try using it in wet weather 
Best backpack This is my favorite backpack It never fails me even though I don t think a backpack can 
can t wear them I wouldn t wear these socks for two reasons 1 They have a red stripe at the toe and I wanted to wear them with sandals 2 They have their brandname emblazoned in red on the side also ridiculous looking with sandals 
Cheap rubbish I had these for a year 6 months of the time I was overseas and did not use them When I got to wear them the socking pulled out of the left boot and the velcro flaps came away from the leather leaving me to glue them I contacted the dealer who was rude and not interested in my boots me or the fact the things had a problem They did not answer my e mails either Stay away from this rubbish and a complascent company 
Better than shoes These are the cutest little baby socks that look like shoes I have ever seen The packaging is great the colors are great and I can hardly wait to gift them to my new grandson 
They re cute AND they stay put We love these socks for numerous reasons 1 they re adorable 2 they make great gifts 3 they stay on much longer than any other sock we ve ever found 4 they hold up in the wash no fading yet and it s been 3 months and everyone loves to comment on how cute our baby looks with the shoes I highly recommend this for anyone having a baby or going to a baby shower 
its not 42 in i just bought this iten and is only 34 in is not 42 in as describe by andrew chirstia 
It s fun being green What can I say Snug warm and very cuddly The truth is that it is fun to be grren or to sit halfway down the stairs or whatever This T shirt sports vibrant colors firm stitching and is just all round fun Sizes run a little small so plan ahead 
Leather Wrist Cuff the leather wrist cuff is exactly what I wanted and it is exactly what it looked like on line Very Please 
Very nice quick dry My daughter loved it she uses it everydyay Thank God it s quick dry 
Oh what fun Great purchase this Good quality and sizing This is a really fun costume to wear and the name is appropriate if you play the game Just imagine being back at school and very naughty then sent to the headmasters room for punishment Placed across the knee the sexy mini skirt lifted up your sexy panties on show and then being smacked Or whatever game you want to play Recommended for fun evenings in or out 
4 star + leggings I decided to review these since there were no other reviews listed I bought the large which have about a 30 inseam which is at the top of my ankle I m 5 10 The stretch is good without being constricting as I got them for light exercise biking treadmill etc I ve looked at the Sport shops for a running biking tight and though most are spandex lycra the cost runs between 65 100 for 9 00 at Amazon the cotton lycra works just fine for me The only thing that threw me off at first was the exterior seam down the front of the leg must be for style I guess Since wearing them I don t notice it anymore and it doesn t affect the performance of the pant 
Pretty comfortable I love these sandals because you can dress them up or down 
Comfortable sturdy and beautiful Just what you would expect from Steve Madden Fits true to size Best of the gladiators 
A great bra I ve been buying this exact bra for years but usually from a dept store This is a perfect bra for women who are full figured but more in the back area instead of the cup size the criss cross center allows more lift and separation than any other bra I ve tried the plus side of buying it on Amazon is the choice of sizes which I m not always able to find in the stores the down side is that the price is a little higher here but to find the correct size makes it worth it 
Great bra Sexy but still holds as well as grandma s bulletproof ones I ve been trying to find a decent bra for ages one that would be attractive and hold things in place at the same time I was afraid I d be doomed to the old 1950s bulletproof cone shaped bra in a box styles forever and those are anything but seductive I recently changed bra sizes from one that stores carried in multiple styles selections to a 34DDD which you have to order online or have made at astronomical prices I was hopeful about this bra because it was decently priced and I wasn t disappointed The underwire and 4 hooks give excellent hold the cups are deep enough to cover everything and keep things pointing up where they belong and the criss cross lacing between the cups gives it just enough of the peek a boo allure to make it sexy Even though this bra is a sedate white it still passed the husband whistle test Not bad 
Bra should feel like they arent there This bra is the worst bra I have ever owned fit wrong and made me pointy and odd shaped never ever buy this bra and you can get it way cheaper off line if you must buy 
Great Shirt I ordered this shirt for my husband to wear on our wedding day We had a very casual wedding the shirt was gorgeous I plan on ordering more for him 
Guayabera shirt The product was shipped on time and great condition I would recommend this seller to anyone 
Great Skirt I bought this skirt as a gift for my mother who never had one growing up and she just loves it The poodle is nice and big and the skirt looks just as good as the real thing I looked around for many skirts that would look authentic and this one was recommended to me by a friend The others might have been good but the prices were way to high and this skirt is not only affordable but is of good quality 
Nice Bowling Shoe This is a good shoe for an amatuer bowler like me Provides good support with a little slide not too much The price was great also 
A great shirt for the aspiring dancer My granddaughter loves the message on this shirt She says it still looks good after a few washes 
Poor Build Quality These shoes do not last very long and they tend to size differently between the left and right shoe In other words the size tolerances for the shoes are unusually large which tends to indicate a below average quality shoe 
Good shoes I have been wearing New Balance shoes for several years now as they were recommended to me by a friend of mine that managed a sporting goods store These shoes are very comfortable and have made my workday go much better as my old shoes were pretty worn out 
Great value and quality Jockey for Her is still the premium brand for fit and comfort and this company recognizes not all women are skinny minis by carrying a decent range of sizes for plus sized women I will shop from them again 
Excellent Purchase These glove liners are the best I have gortex gloves but with these liners my hands stay extra warm Plus if it s cool outside but not cool enough for heavy gloves these work great all by themselves 
Not Wool The suit arrived quickly and is beautifully made However the information in the add says it is 100 Wool It is not The label clearly says 100 Polyester That is a problem if you are expecting a natural fibre I have kept the suit because it is for a production and it looks great but would have preferred it to be wool so it could be retailored at another time I will still use this company because of the fast and efficient service and also because of how well the garment was made 
best thong ever originally got hooked on this because of an article i read in the wall street journal claiming that the two women who started this company were revolutionizing thong panties and boy did they by far the most comfortable thong ever they sit low on hips and come in every color imaginable 
shine up great no problem fit ok i like fit and confort nice shoes 
good looking boots buuut nice boots looks great i love them the only problem is that the sole wears too fast and they are not too much confortable this boots aren t made for walking as the nancy sinatras ones but as i told you they have a nice look and you just need to put some inner soles to make them a little softer 
Nice Pants I m wearing these great pants now They have a button and a snap at the top for security and comfort Made well Nice pants 
the best makeup kit ever I love this kit it has everthing in it anyone could want the customer service from salonwear is fabulous great products and great company thank you salonwear so muc 
Good Linen Trousers What you would expect from Linen Trousers very cool very light VERY WRINKLEY As long as you are happy with the Linen look these are winners 
Softspots Women s Trinidad Huaraches OFF WHITE 6 M B C Huaraches are back in style I don t know why they ever went out of style These are the most comfortable sandals 
Great Got to me in good time the shades are pretty slick The lense tenting could have been darker but aside from that these are pretty good sunglasses for the mone 
THEY SUIT ME They re very easy to wear light close fitting without being at all uncomfortable even for long periods The lens color is natural and pleasing and the shape good for my large head and broad face Those close over the eye glasses designed for competition cyclists and ski types tend to make me look like an alien from an unfriendly planet These help me look like the mature man I am 
Excellent Value A good looking pair of sunglasses well worth the 18 dollars I paid for them dealing with the company was also a pleasure as the glasses came very promptly and were exactly as described 
Great substitute for cleats I play competitive softball I needed a new cleat and wanted something with excellent traction on wet dry dirt grass I found in this a very supportive shoe Great traction great support I also found how badly my other shoes supported me Usually the day after softball was designated a recovery day because my ankles and lower back were so sore Wearing these I have no discomfort the next day One concern I had that came out ok The weight of this shoe is 13 ounces about two ounces heavier than my old shoe But I got used to wearing them picking them up and putting them down and there is no noticable difference in my speed base running or in outfield pursuits And if you run in Mizuno shoes you will find these as comfortable as those just with cleat like traction 
Almost Case needs a screen protector and was hoping it might fit the 60gig tigher because the sides flop outwards some Other than that its a solid deal 
Silicon Skin for Toshiba Gigabeat Mes30vw mp3 Player Plus Armband Black Purchased the skin for my MES60VW and fits just fine Excellent fit over controls which work just the same as w o skin 
Gigabeat Silicone Skin This is a good cover particularly since the options are few compared to the big mac daddy mp3 player The only thing I am disappointed with is the lack of a screen cover It would not only help keep the screen from getting scratched but also keep the screen opening on the case from getting over stretched and not fitting tightly around the screen 
Amazon gets the boot The boot arrived w in 1 week of ordering off Amazon Excellent quality from a class A company I will order from this provider DIRECTLY in the future There were no problems w this order but if there was Amazon would be of LITTLE OR NO ASSISTANCE Buyer Beware should be their slogan DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ORDER FROM HERMAN STREET THEY ARE CROOKS THEIVES YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR MERCHANDISE WILL HAVE TO FILE A COMPLAINT W THE UTAH BBB TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK EVEN THEN YOU MAY NOT GET A REFUND 
Fabulous Very noisy and beautiful and has not fallen apart after 1 dance day minimum 
Nice shoes I am a recreational bowler I don t even bowl on a league but I go often enough that it is more economical to buy my own shoes than pay 4 a pop for a shoe rental I really like these they are comfortable and just girly enough The pink is a lot brighter in person than in the photo though We ll see if having my own shoes will improve my game cause it needs some work 
Raleigh NC Cute and very comfortable sandles The narrow width is perfect for me and sometimes hard to find The sling back band is very comfy strechy material which leads to a perfect fit True to size A bargain Think I may need another color 
Lifestride denim slingback sandal These are a tremendously cute pair of shoes for summer They do not cause the upper surface of my big toe to blister as many open toed sandals do However the right sandal has a little squeak of air rushing out of it with each step and that is annoying 
One of my favorites I bought these a while back while they were on sale and I am glad I bought all three colors These shoes are comfy stylin and just plain good They are a bit longer than a normal shoe but I would recommend getting your true size in these I really enjoy wearing these shoes pull the trigger you wont regret it 
Best for comfort and NO panty lines I swear I ve tried them all but the Jockey Comfies are SO comfortable and have no panty line at all whether your butt is firm or squishy since I first tried them after my second baby I ve experienced them both ways I highly recommend them IF you re looking for sexy this isn t it they re more sporty But if you want something you ll actually love wearing buy these Final note of importance I didn t have a problem with too much shrinkage in the laundry which can spoil the even the best undies 
Comfortable Fit As a woman I often have a hard time finding checkbook wallets that aren t meant to be carried only in the purse I don t carry a purse I keep my wallet in the front pocket of my pants where it s in easy reach for me and not so easy reach for thieves The Brody Secretary is made of soft textured leather and fits nicely in my pants pocket It holds my cash without needing to fold it though putting in my checkbook is something of a stretch Cards stamps receipts and other necessary bits all fit within the folds with little trouble The only real downside is the lack of space for a pen With a checkbook inside the wallet there would be no room at all for an ink pen meaning I d still be fumbling around trying to pay for this or that which was the exact thing I was hoping to avoid 
Nice shoes I switched to these shoes from the Kayanos as they were getting too expensive and I had lost some weight no longer the heavy runner I was when I had them I have been very happy with these shoes They are lighter and certainly less expensive than the kayanos No injuries I had over 490 miles on my previous 1110s before I bought this one Still were running well but I was getting nervous as I used to have to change shoes at 400 miles or my knees would hurt I have to say they aren t the most attractive shoes I ve ever owned but they are excellent from a performance standpoint 
Very pleased with these shoes I m very please with the shoes they are light comfortable and seem to be durable so far I run about 8 miles a day and so far I haven t experienced any discomfort or blisters 
great shoes If you re serious about running go to a reputable store i e RoadRunner Sports Fleet Feet and try out a bunch of different models and brands You need to find the right fit for your build foot and gait etc Anyway the Asics 1100 is my shoe I love these and have been buying a new pair every 8 12 months for a few years now 
Good inexpensive shoe I have just got my shoes I have only ran once but I thought they are great for the price They are light and provide adequate cushioning I recommend them 
Blisters These are the only running shoes that have continuously given me blisters Even with good running socks after a couple 10K runs these shoes gave me a blister on my heel I tried different lacing but it didn t matter Threw them away I thought I would buy some cheaper trainers for when I have to run inside on a treadmill It can get down to around 40 for weeks here and I usually run outside If you run less than 10K or just walk slow jog it might not matter 
Most Comfortable Flop I ve owned I bought this for my wife after her bought with jealousy after seeing mine These are great flops with comfortable arch support The bottle opener is a novelty for fun discussion and works fine 
Very sexy and surprisingly durable They made my legs look great I wore these for an entire night at my husband s company party and was surprised that they didn t have any runs 
amazing i bought this pair of shoes for my dad and he just loves it he loves to go for running and he is absolutely amazing with its comfort and ease five stars to this 
nice shoes i bought these shoes for my girl friend she loves them a couple months ago she had asked for some heals but she wears a size 5 so i searched and searched and finally found these that she liked 
BEAUTIFUL This shoe was lovely online but was even more gorgeous in reality Every time I wear it I get compliments It is really nice 
Bealls Bealls got this product here and on time Nothing else to say 
Cute Shoe When I got these shoes I was afraid that they were unconfortable but to my surprise they were not They are just adorable shoes and they look oh so sexy too I truly recommend this product HYPE makes really nice shoes 
How come more kids don t wear briefs These briefs are awesome They are so soft and comfortable to wear I have always worn boxers but now after trying these on I ll wear them all the time and to school too No one even cares about tighty whities in the locker room More kids now are wearing briefs too So should everyone else 
puberty helper Hi im 13 and just started puberty I was a boxer guy till my friend told me about these He also wore boxers because kids said gay kids only wear briefs so he wore them under his boxers So one night when I sleep over at his place we went to his room and he took off his pants and boxers and left his briefs on I asked why he wore those and he said they hide erections and are great when you just started puberty He gave me a pair to wear to bed and to keep I still wear them and they help me in puberty 
These Briefs Feel Really Good Hey boys I m 12 and I want you guys to know that these briefs are really about the best you can get Of course to me briefs are the only way to go since they re cool looking they feel really good and they re not constricting like boxers You should try these colored tighty whities out 
if you want wegies get this look one time i was in chruch just setting right there MAN that was the worst wegie ever and i have a big brother so wear some thing else besides brifes unless you want to have to adjust your self in front of people 
Dare One time my friend and I were playing truth or dare He dared me to wear colored briefs for 2 WEEKS I was a boxer kid so this was the last thing I wanted to do He was also a boxer kid so I dared him to do the same We went to the store and each bought a couple of packs We both felt like such losers but we wore them At school we depanted each other After the 2 weeks was up neither us wanted to return to boxers We both fell in love with how comfortable they were 
Great Hi I m 13 These are so comfortable When I first got them from my grandma I was a boxer short kid My mom said that I should use them anyway The next morning I took a shower and put them on As soon as I got them on I realized how snug and comfortable they were Without realizing it I went downstairs with nothing on except these even though my mom wasn t home I decided to keep them on The elastic around your legs keeps your legs free to move about and the snugness is great I decided that I would even wear them to school Nobody cares when we change for gym that I wear briefs And when you are sitting down all day you have no need to move around to get comfortable These are great 
Best What is better than boxer shorts or boxer briefs it is briefs and since this is a trusted brand buy it it is Hane 
Naturalizer Women s Profit Loafer Comfortable fit leather medium soft heel excellent height for walking and the shoe lining very nice I am enjoying wearing them 
Nice They look nice and are comfortable They run about 1 2 size large I was able to make them work by wearing thicker socks 
NATURALIZER NOT LEATHER Let me start with these boots are lovely and comfortable However I was surprised that they are not leather if I had read a little closer I would have known this they certainly didn t hide the fact I guess I just assumed a boot that costs 89 would be leather I do love them however and shipping was fast I recommend them just be advised that they are leather like 
Goo Stuff The product came as described It was easy to use not messy and effective I used it on a pair of boots and so far it is holding up nicely 
nice shoes they are very confortable shoes very nice to outdoors um the upper its perfect to the hot cuz keep u foot with the fresh air let in 
The cushion version of Nova Trail There are two versions Control Cushion and this pair are cushion which means softer touch while you run them Good grid on grass running The first run on road they ground the rubber outsole since softer design but after miles they are fine Sufficient room for my toes and feel very comfortable either running or walking I would not suggest buying this pair just for fancy or walking because they are professional for trail running If you prefer firmer touch then buy the Control version Overall I rated them 4 star 
A Jock that s the Real Thing Wow I ve been testing out new jocks for the last week or so and I gotta tell you this one is GREAT It FEELS like a jock should feel where you re supported but it s not digging or pinching The 3 inch wide waistband is neither too tight or too big and has different but distinctive green and black stripes The pouch is so HOT it really cups and supports you in just the right way so you re not feeling too constricted My test for all Jocks is the treadmill to see if I m bouncing around too much or if there is too much movement which could cause abrasions This one passed with flying colors Its a great woven pouch that s absorbant and breathes well Definitely gives Bike a run for its money A GREAT GREAT JOCK 
bad shoe dye i apply boot polish to shine and protect shoes coloring rub off as if it were not dye properly the shoes themselfs are fine 
Just what I was looking foe The boots are excellent quality ang has a great fit 
Warner Bra I have worn this bra for over 25 years I can no longer find it in the stores When searching for it online I never thought I would find it on amazon I purchased 3 bras and I will continue buying them as long as I can find them I love the front closure the underwire and the look and feel of the bra 
Perfect Bra My Daughter loves these bras and has been wearing them for over 20 years She has tried many others and always go back to this one Thank You Warners Caroline Fisher Rome New Yor 
Warner bra I prefer front closure bras without a lot of padding this is a style I lik 
Excellent product At first I was afraid to purchase underwear online since it s difficult to get what you need even going to a store I m very pleased with these brassieres For a reasonable price you get a high quality product Soft strong durable and elegant material Nice shape and practical clip on front I recommend it 100 
Great bra s I finally found a wonderful bra and also a place that has them I will keep ordering as long as they carry the bra as the company is totally functional Wonderful place to shop Thank you 
Very Pleased I have used this bra for years and all of a sudden I couldn t find it in any of the stores so decided to go online Never thought I would purchase a bra from Amazon com Was very please to not only find it but to receive such great service from the Florida based company Beales Dept store 
nice for the price nice slacks a little snug around some areas for bigger guys though 
Happy customer This was an easy purchase quick response time and a very satisfactory product It s a happy face 
Very nice slacks Because they were made by Levi I was sceptical about these being good slacks but I ended up liking them so much I ordered them in 2 more colors Comfortable machine washable and you don t have to iron them 
Slacks for the older gentleman My 62 year old father loves these pants They require really no care except for washing and take forever to wear out He wears them everyday even though he would look younger hipper if he wore a more up to date pair of pants Thanks 
Favorite swaddler I really like this swaddler My twins resist being swaddled but they sleep much better swaddled so it s important to me to have something that s fast and easy to use I stopped using the sack when my babies outgrew it and now I only used the outer wrap I removed the top piece of velcro on the back of the wrap designed to attach to the sack because it seems like it could be irritating I know that there s some SIDS rationale for using the sack plus the wrap but I do the wrap really tight so I m confident that there s no way it could come off and get over my babies heads Some tips I tighten the velcro iteratively I wrap the baby snuggly once then I open up each half and re tighten it Also I wrap the bottom half of my babies in a snug traditional swaddle with a blanket They like having their legs tightly wrapped and this system allows me to focus on their arms with the Halo wrap and on their legs with a blanket 
I would never buy from Mass Closeouts Again I received my product but I also received a bill on my credit card that they illegaly signed me up for some discount thing with a charge of 10 00 for a monthly account I activated when I purchased a product from them Joel McLaughli 
Great Shoes I got these for a friend who has a 55 ford and goes to car meets wearing 50 s outfits She says they fit great and are SO comfortable to wear They came on time exactly as ordered I couldn t be more pleased 
great saddle shoes My wife used these shoes in a costume for holloween dressed in 50 s attire They worked out great and she got alot of compliments They made it here in no time at all very fast shipping Very happy with overall purchase 
saddle shoes These were difficult to find The shoes are very well made we were pleased 
Great comfortable jacket I left home for a week long business trip this winter when it was 70 degrees yeah 70 Since it was so hot I forgot a jacket Then of course the weather turned cold I lucked out and found a clothing store across the street from my hotel which had this jacket on sale I bought it as a quickie replacement jacket but fell in love with it I m sorry I only bought one It s incredibly comfortable and looks great at the office or anywhere It came without a liner so it s perfect for cool days or for below freezing days with a sweater or sweatshirt underneath I m actually kind of sad that summer is coming and I ll have to put it away for until it gets cold again 
Boot for the REAL working man Bought this boot cus had Timerland hiking boots that were VERY comfortable These did not disappoint me Working as a carpenter woodworker I am in these boots all day long My feet never get tired or sore from being in them Have added some comfort insoles but that is due to my foot being a 12AA rather than a medium or D width as most men s feet Foot never get hot they stay dry and in winter warm When I am not working my regular shoes seem to not comfort me as well Walking a mall or just getting around town in street shoes can make my back and legs ache after only a couple hours Yet these Pit Boss boots can let me be on my feet standing walking for as much as 10hrs straight without feeling sore These have been a blessing climbing or standing on ladders for extended time as the sole is solid enough to give me a good platform to stand on The ankle height of them is enough to have saved me several times from twisting or damaging my ankle Been using this pair for over two years Soles are about worn out but expect to buy this boot again Leather looks rough now but has not torn or worn through anywhere 
great boot im a mechanic and these boots got everything steel toe plus they look great and there comfortable if your in the market for a great boot buy the timberland pit boss i dont think youll be sorry 
Oversize I received the boots and found them to be extremley well made I liked the double zippers very much I was looking for a boot that could be put on easily when wearing thicker socks and the double zippers really worked well However I normally wear a size 9M so I ordered a 9 1 2M What I received although marked 9 1 2M was more like 10 1 2M Just way to big in length and Amazon did not have any smaller sizes Sadly I had to return the boots I found the same boot smaller size advertised directly from Kenneth Cole but was twice the price that Amazon had them listed for One thing to note on the return paper work there was not sufficient reasons or space to spell out the reason for returning item 
Hawaiian shirt Wonderful comfortable shirt at a very good price I love it Good service too 
Good Product Good Price I bought this gift as a Christmas present The recipient was very pleased with the size color and quality of the backpack It works well as both a backpack and purse for her It would be nice if it had a zippered pocket inside the main compartment for keys etc I was pleased with the price paid and the quality of the backpack 
warm socks received socks very fast and just what I ordered they are very warm and heavy work great in the cold I bought 2pr and glad I di 
cold weather boot socks Order arrived quickly and though I haven t worn them yet they appear to be a good bargain 
Comfort Style Nice light weight shoe that has gotten plenty of attention Had someone ask me initially if it was a gucci shoe 
Good Product The onesie is very cute is the exact size I needed Is a great product for a low price Fast shipping 
Bodysuits I love them all Our daughter looks great in them and my family adores the different phrases 
Cute This onsie is very cute It is made of soft material and can hold up with many washes The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the arm holes they are a bit tight but otherwise they fit great 
Handsome and warm This with the PJ bottoms was a nice gift for my son From all reports they fit nicely and look good 
Speedo Solid Ultraback Moderate Fit w shelf Bra Customer service was excellent The item is high quality and it suit to my necessity 
great style and color from goldtoe So pleased to find the shades of color offered in this great sock Many of us wear loafers and clogs Sometimes white and black socks just don t fit into the color scheme of our clothes Oatmeal is a great shade to be worn with khakis Keep making this shade and khaki color to 
I Look too Hot to Touch in These Holy moly and bless my soul What can I say these are dynamite Goosebumps shivered up my arms when I put these on I really looked hot To hot to touch felt that way too This is a very exciting ensemble and all the girls at our lingerie party were just simply stunned with how they looked in it No doubt about it this very hot two piece set will get your guy in the mood you re looking for 
Makes Me Feel Wanton Well I don t know about this I know I feel real excited when I have these on and the girl in the mirror looks very wanton very exciting I know my guy Jack would love to see me in these but they do give me the chilly willies in a good way One look at these and you know just what they were made for Come to think of it that s a good thing I know I ll break them out on special occasions in fact I can t think of a better way of making up then putting on this outfit because no matter what I did all would be forgiven the second Jack catches a glimpse of me in these Five big stars from me 
great case This case not only looks good but seems to protect it and is great for storing games in 
Nice item but could use more room This is a good product for protecting your DS Lite and keeping its accessories together However it could stand to be a slight bit larger I think the designers were more worried with having a streamlined look than practicality There are slots for 3 games and one large pocket for more games and or the charger The charger barely fits but I keep mine in there and over time the case has stretched some so it fits better This would be good for someone that uses the DS only sometimes like me and only has a few games Those with more accessories and games should probably get a larger case 
Good product Good case the kids keep all their DS games in it and it goes everywhere with them Thanks 
Not a Bad Case It s a very cute case I got mine in pink It s small and light but it could be the tiniest fraction larger so the DS fits better The corners hit the rounded sides of the case and it can t fit fully in the case You can still zip it up fine however so I m all aroun 
Univ of Mich clothing Excellent Service I got the order within a week in beautiful condition fits great Thank You 
The Shape Of Things Russell Athletics are always of good quality and these are no exception The University of Michigan tee shirt and hooded sweatshirt are one of this year s birthday gifts to our son We made a good choice They should keep him warm this winter and I am sure he will be pleased to receive them After all there is a reason Michigan is shaped like a mitten The Bos 
Love the shirt As a HUGE Zeppelin and Jimmy Page fan of course I had to have this shirt Tye Dyed black too I didn t want to take it off for two days until my wife said too lol fast shipping as well Thanks a bunch 
AWESOME if your a page fan get this shirt perfect fit great picture and durable 
Adorable Costumes My son looked so adorable in this costume Everyone who saw him loved it they never seen a costume like this before 
Great Costume We had so many compliments on it He was the cutest caterpillar in town 
Bad boots This boot Black Ultra ForceTM GI Style Jungle Boots is the best you can find i could do any thing i want with it Hiking also Looks Great At anything accept short trousers it dries very fast Leather is Great shine s very fast and not very hot in the summer It soles don t pickup mud easy And is Very comfterble 
So so I find it has few uses There is one hole on each side so it can not be taken on rainy or snowy days And in summer it is a little warm to wear it But it is cheap which is its most advantage 
Love it I just received this bag and I love it It s a little bigger than I thought but that s a plus I love the material very much like real leather Nice useful compartments inside The handles are very comfortable I would definitely recommend it I got the black one by the way 
GREAT LOOKING SLING BOOK BAG Samsonite Sling Rose Wine looks great and is constructed well and has all the great features the reason for the 4 stars ipod holder hole for earphones cell holder holder for school disks or cd roms pen and pencil holder and keyring I wish you could give half stars 4 1 2 stars Very sturdy and extra padding for comfort But be warned My daughters larger text books dont fit nor does her mead trapper looseleaf or her nike portfolio The top corner sticks out about two to three inches and zipper is unable to fully close so she has to carry them in her hands which kind of defeats the purpose of carrying a handsfree bag Spiral notebooks and mead composition books black and white fit perfectly Another gripe is she is probably 100 pounds soaking wet so the strap isn t flush to her body Shes a tall slim 13 1 2 year old It will fit the chubbies and the bustier girls a whole lot better The velcor strip is short so there isn t much more ability to adjust to make it tighter Samsonite can either make the strap shorter so it doesnt hit her booty when she walks or lenghten the amount of velcro they use so theres more ability to adjust the fit We thought that during the colder months it might fit a little better with her winter coats but it still hits her too low on her body We d rather it be a more snug fit She still loves it though because of the color and it holds all her stuff well cell phone ipod keys bus pass pens etc Minus 1 2 a star for size and fit Overall great bag 4 1 2 stars 
Very comfortable and it comes in hemp for the vegetarians vegans out there Very comfortable stylish I got the dark shale black hemp ones which are free of animal products which makes them even better 
awesome This made my fiance so happy that he was like a child on christmas mornin 
shade black great looking shoes I bought the gray shade ones and they look just like in the picture 
Great shoe Good looking shoe for the work site Comfortable right out of the box I never rate anything but this item was better than expected Goes striaght from the job site to the pick up scene 
Good Enough Product ordered came in on time and in very good condition They fit fine 
Not Disappointed Quiksilver quality at an excellent price I was thoroughly satisfied with the fit style and construction and wouldn t hesitate to order again 
Bay Studio Tee Shirt Bra I love this Bra I really need more of these 
I love these shoes They re just as described The shoes are good quality and this was an excellent price for them They are beautiful and fit well 
Woodland Jacket Shipping was fast Also the jacket fit perfectly I got a lot of compliments on the jacket 
Fun at wallmart This are very handy on sunday nights of insomnia They roll great on wallmart 
These are what all the kids are asking for In the sense that these are what my son wanted they fit the bill It took him a couple of days flailing about but after he got the hang of them they are pretty cool I can t imaging them being comfortable if I just wanted to walk Sketchers has a competitive product that the wheels can be retracted that I would choose if I were wearing them These wheels have a tool that must be carried with if you want to remove the wheels They are well made and have high quality materials 
Make nice PJs I bought this for my husband for Christmas he isn t a doctor but I figured he could use them to sleep in plus he really likes the show scrubs They came ahead of schedule and are really comfortable Nice fit on him as well I recommend 
Running shoe for narrow feet If you have a rough time buying shoes because you have a narrow foot then the New Balance brand is for you It is one of the few available which goes beyond just the Large medium and narrow labels and actually will go to the letter width Great shoe long lasting and very competitive price The only reason I don t give it 5 stars is that they stop at b and don t go to AA 
Awesome Awesome chair So far we ve used it inside for extra seating with company and of course to watch the Steelers on TV We look forward to using it for camping in warmer weather It s surprisingly lightweight but sturdy 
The best shoes These are the best shoes for your infant toddler They won t slip off at all Made of soft leather they truly conform to your child s feet Closest thing to being barefoot This is my third pair of Robeez shoes I LOVE Robeez shoes The design is really cute for winter also 
Love them Perfect for tiny toes I am just sorry I didn t discover them 3 children ago Easy to slip on and off perfect for old houses with cold slippery wood floors 
Too cute These shoes are so adorable We just can t own enough pairs of Robeez 
We LOVE Robeez These are the best slippers With any other footwear my daughter rips it off and is barefoot in no time But with her kitty slippers we have the pink white cat slippers she wears them proudly and loves to show them off They wash up nice in the machine too We are in desperate need of a new pair because hers are getting tight She got a good 5 to 6 months of use out of each pair she s had You won t regret buying these they are worth every penny 
Great value for comfort and fit I requested this brand because it comes in my off size 35x33 I was pleasantly surpised that in addition to the great fit they are also very comfortable I didn t buy these to be rugged work jeans and the soft weave is appropriate for casual wear only 
Freedom to experience THE SUN I totally enjoy wearing A type tank tops for leisure and they add something to my body I also like the freedom it provides for my arms and shoulders to breathe The order was put in and received in a timely manner and I appreciate Amazon Thank you Kenric Pierc 
Male Rockport shoe review Have had a pair of Rockport shoes and have worn them daily through rain snow and summer heat for about 5 years They have been very comfortable and worn well The first several years I was on my feet daily in an Aircraft Maintenance Facility Several years ago I retired and continued to wear these shoes Looked for a dealer locally with the wide designation and could not find any so reverted to the internet where the shoes were found and bought Present use is for dress while still using the older pair for every day use Mike E 
Swimsuit or Summer outfit This swimsuit can double as a summer outfit The colors are perfect and then there is Eeyore Nice for girls that wear larger sizes 
SIzes Run Big Happy to find these for my daughter Sizes run big so order conservatively She s going to have to grown into them 
Cuffed Thermal Top Heather Rose I love this top It is nice and warm but not heavy and bulky I love the color of the top 
Quality and Ease As a college student without a car it was great to be able to order these warm duds online the quality is great and the mall would have been a long bus ride away 
Players Tricot Nylon Athletic Tank Shirt NAS1 Very silky feel comfortable Hems could be tighter stiched 
Lovely shoes These shoes were purchased for a wedding and they were just what I was looking for low no heel and blue The dark flower design on them is very tasteful The rubber bottoms are kind of stinky but after being aired out the odor is not noticeable These shoes are very comfortable but if you do not have an instep or have fallen arches be warned that these types of shoes have no arch support 
Oooo So Sexy I like these made in the USA crotchless panties I got them in red but they come in black and white as well The red is just so darned sexy it s scary Anyway I think you ll like them especially if you like giving your man a thrill 
Perfectly Daring Perfectly Risque Love them in Red I have to say that I liked the crotchless French Knichers also by Love Fifi better and that I ll probably buy a ton of them but I ll get a pair or two of these as well because there are sometimes in the bedroom when you just want to play the Devil and everybody knows Satan always wears red 
SEXY and delicious feeling Here s what you wear so you can walk around with a secret grin on your face I love these panties crotchless they re airy and you feel fresh all over The flirty ruffles make you feel girlish and giggly Wear them on a date hike up your skirt spread your legs apart and drop your napkin on the floor while you are eating at a restaurant Better yet when dining out with several guys Sharon Stone would die with envy 
Great quality and really nice colours These bodysuits are great and the quality is excellent the cotton is really soft and not thin like some other brands I would recommend this to anyone shopping for a baby boy 
great The product came very quickly packed very nicely and is great Very impressed would definitely purchase again 
Beautiful but delicate material When the bustier arrived I was very excited to see that it was even nicer than it appeared in the picture When I tried it on I wasn t very careful and a small area of the lace tore I would recommend this item but be very careful when putting it on 
Good Product While I wish the neckline was a little smaller this unitard fits well stays in place on the shoulders and is made of sturdy material I would purchase another 
Watch the sizes These slippers are really sharp looking I purchased them as a gift for a male relative who s a big Cardinals fan My only watch out is the sizes I ordered a size large which was supposed to fit his size but I had to re order an XL because his heels were hanging off the back 
You need to sleep What can I say they are pajama s Here in southern california it is often too warm for full on pajama s but too cold for going kamando not to mention socially frowned on Often I just wear a tee and shorts to bed but decided to get something suited to the task The short sleeve top and short bottoms work and match The Large I ordered came marked as an XL twice so I guess that is how amazon sees it Indeed the XL fit like a slightly oversized Large maybe too baggy in the drawers 
Quick service I was pleased to receive the product ordered promptly and accurately the product itself is of high quality 
Betula Licensed by Birkenstock Black Nubuk Thong Sandal The color is really nice The size was perfect The sandals are confortable 
Betula Nubuck Sandal Very disappointed have worn sandal perhaps 10 times and the main strap has torn from the sole until repaired the sandals are unwearable These sandals were not worn in rough terrain they were not buckled too tightly they were not abused I am unlikely to purchase any Betula product again 
Stride Right Girls Sandle Fast shipping I bought these for my granddaughter to wear in the summer Great product I also ordered some tennis shoes as well 
Perfect shoes Another masterpiece from Rockport I recently purchase these shoes and I am so happy with this product It is very comfortable Its worth every single penny 
My son is enjoying his birthday present The costume is great the material gives a very similar reproduction of the Darth Vader look The mask is a little heavy It does not include gloves neither the lisghtsable 
Great Boat Shoe I have always been a New Balance shoe fan I own several of their walking and running shoes Their shoes are so comfortable you feel like you are walking on a cloud However they never had a shoe for the boat until now I am a charter fishing captain and spend several hours daily on my feet and the support and comfort of these shoes is awesome I have tried numerous different shoes over the years due to my old tired feet that get very sore in a shoe with no support I can tell you these are the best yet Before I found these I wore the New Balance walking shoe however it did not have the proper boat shoe sole Thanks New Balance for helping out a hard working skipper 
Dress Shirt This is an excellent product If you wish to look casual simply use the button on cuffs If one desires the more classy style purchase a pair of cuff links and use them on this shirt 
very good got these boots for a trip to Mammoth Mountain Very warm and comfortable Like waterproof uggs Very good price for this product My boyfriend has had a pair of these for 5 years and they worked great for him too 
Best sports bra ever I have tried many other sports bras and lucky for me found the enell on the internet search engine which led me to amazon who i trust to order items from and it has changed my gym workout very much I can do what everyone else is doing without the discomfort associated with bouncing I am so happy to have found and purchased the Enell Bra 
Best Sports bra for Large Breasts I am a 48F and I have tried many sports bras in my day This is the best one on the market for large breasts No bounce It can feel a little restrictive at first but once you are used to the bra it is great Best for sports that involve running walking or any kind of bounce Not very good for sports that require intricate upper body movements like yoga 
my hunt is over I have been on the hunt for a bra that holds me in place for a very very long time and I have found the prey that satisfies It definitely wraps itself around most of my upper torso but it provides the least amount of bouncing even when running I ve always been a person that needed to wear two sports bras while exercising to support me but not anymore as long as I wear Enell I wear a 34 C and the size 0 fits me very well This bra was designed for the full figured woman who really wants to be held in place while being acitve and I m really satisfied with it Oprah recommended or not 
The last sports bra you ll ever buy Pricey but worth it I used to layer 2 sports bras and still be uncomfortable while horseback riding until I dicovered the Enell Now I own 3 and won t ride without wearing one Follow the instructions for measuring and don t worry that it feels too snug the first time you try it on With this bra there is NO BOUNCE Can t say enough good things about the Enell 
The Best Sports Bra I ve Ever Used This bra is great especially for larger woman When I use this bra I don t move or bounce at all Before I was having to use two bras even when using one of Champions best I purchased one because they are pricey but soon after purchased another because I didn t want to use anything else This is well worth the money 
Great quality I just received this bra and I rate it 4 stars just because it is tight as mentioned in the other reviews Otherwise it looks good and it seems to perform well I like the fact that it closes in the front I will keep it and I hope it will loosen up in time 
I can jump up and down Nothing moves Finally I ve tried so many sports bras since my chest bloomed cantaloupes I ve lost count This is the one I will never ever buy another brand model of sports bra Be advised getting into it the first time will be a struggle Do the bottom most hook and eye first then position the breasts into the cups then continue There s no other way to do it This is a TIGHT bra It has to be to immobilize comfortably If this bra had been available when I was in High School I might have actually learned to enjoy sports and I might have ended up a lot less klutzy And I m wearing it to work as a minimizer today 
The only sports bra that works for large chests and high impact OK so Oprah recommended this bra you might have heard Particularly if you visit Enell s website But there s a very good reason As a sports bra this bra is completely perfect it has eye hooks all the way up the front and while you may feel a bit at first like you re wearing a chest girdle I can honestly say I ve never enjoyed high impact activities running aerobics as much as I do now precisely because it was so uncomfortable in the past The bra will feel tight at first particularly around the ribs but trust me if you get the right size for yourself and you follow their instructions for putting it on you ll be amazed at what you can comfortably do 
Excellent This is my second pair I recommend the brand and you can t beat the price Very foot friendl 
Great shoe This shoe is great my daughter loves the styling and the fact that it is a slip on makes it easier to put on by herself As always I am pleased with this Stride Rite shoe and even more pleased about the price 
Chic Boot I should be the spokeperson for Carlos Santana s shoes I have numerous pairs of his shoes boots I have this particular style in both the brown and the black I couldn t bring myself to pick just one pair so I bought them both They are stylish and head turning Every time I wear a pair of his shoes I feel like such a DIVA 
The Best of The Rockport shoes I have walked in every rockport made these have more cushion than any of the others 10 STAR S+++++++You will Love these 
Red Croco Patent Leather Belt Great Belt Hard to find a quality red patent belt This belt is awesome I am addicted to Amazon and the products that they offer I highly recommend Amazon Thank You Amazon A Customer for Life Kare 
Ryka THIS SHOE WAS BRAND NEW AND WAS AS THE SELLER DESCRIBED AND BOY WHAT A GREAT PRICE TOO 
Yay for these shoes My feet were hurting so badly in my old shoes that I would have quit Jazzercise Now I never miss and never want to take these shoes off They are SO comfortable and support my feet so wonderfully I actually received them wore them twice and got back on and ordered three more pairs One for my Mom and one for my sister and one more for me because I never want to be without a pair 
Rykas Rule Love the shoes I ve used Rykas for years I ordered a 1 2 size larger and they fit great I use them for all types of aerobic activities 
Best aerobics shoe This is my third pair of Ryka N Gase Studio shoes I hope they never discontinue this model This shoe has great suport and cushioning for kick boxing classes and other floor aerobic classes 
Very Nice Bag But Expensive Shipping I got this bag in black and it is exactly what I was looking for in a mesh tote However I give it 4 stars because although the price was only 13 98 SHIPPING WAS 10 98 I purchased it anyway because the bag was priced lower than anywhere else I shopped which made the final cost acceptable Granted I did receive it in one business day however I do believe that the shipping cost was excessive for an item weighing about 1 pound that was shipped within the same state 
Great for Preemies under 6lbs my preemie was so tiny and finding clothing that was actually for preemies born months early 11 1 2 weeks for my kid was tough But this set is just the right fit 
a bit on the small side I got this pair for my son 5 year old son and he just loves them My son also wears his skechers which are size 13 so when I ordered these heelys i thought size 1 would be big enough to last him a year guess I m wrong Size 1 of the heelys is actually smaller than the size 13 skechers he had So when you by a pair of these make sure to order at least 1 1 2 to 2 sizes up 
M1122 Possible Defect Producing Bad Odor There is a possible defect in the M1122 model I wanted to post my experience here in case others are having this same problem After wearing the M1122 shoe for only a few months my pair started producing a very strong odor The smell was not from the inside but from the outer backside specifically the area consisting of the ENCAP material which according to New Balance is a polyurethane plastic The smell gradually got worse so bad in fact I had to keep them in my garage with the smell being like a mildew urine odor I don t own pets nor had I gotten anything sprayed on it The smell didn t suddenly occur either it gradually became more intense over a few weeks Washing the shoes in the washer wouldn t get the smell out so I returned them to a New Balance store in late December 2006 and they replaced it with a new pair Up until this past week late March 2007 the new pair has been great but now they have started putting off the very same odor again not inside the shoe but coming from the areas on the shoe that the ENCAP material is featured I decided to call New Balance directly and informed them of the problem They told me that they did in fact have other complaints from people all commenting of an odd odor coming from the M1122 model shoe NB requested the pair be sent to them for testing If you have experienced this problem with your M1122 or other models contact New Balance customer support via their website With regards to comfort I give this shoe a five star but with regards to the problem above I would have to give it a zero star A common ground I have it two stars but based on the problem I have experienced now in TWO pairs of the exact same shoe 
Amazon shopping is the best With the proper sizing of my foot by a podiatrist I then logged on to Amazon knowing I wouldn t be disappointed My New Balance size 13 D shoes arrived well within my expectations I knew I could count on Amazon A very satisfied customer 
Happy Feet Functionally these shoes are great They feel really good I get good support on my problem feet and I no longer have knee pain after running I guess the only draw back is that these shoes look like medical shoes The kind that would be prescribed to old folks with foot problems 
shoes you ll love best shoes i ve bought Rollbar technology works wonders for the normal person keeps your heel stable and supports Great if you have fallen arches or are overweight New Balance make the truest sized shoes out there and in wide sizes Highly recommended 
great product just a short note to share with others my shoes that i have ordered is one of the best shoes on the market right now and i must say i m very please with this shoes from new balance its one of the best shoes by all means its mt second pair of this product and i ll advise any to buy this shoes its serves all u can do any thing in these shoes i have been wearing this type of shoes for many yrs and never had any problems thank u for making such a great shoes 
A Great Buy This jersey is a great buy because it looks just like the real thing yet it only costs a fraction of the price The part I really like is the SuperBowl XLI logo and the authentic NFL logo on the chest The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the material is kind of well flimsy it s the only word I can think of to describe it which means it will be slightly difficult to wash and keep wrinkly free But for the price it is worth every penny I wish it came in home colors 
Pricey but Worth IT Like many people I bought these shoes after reading the high endorsement by Tennis magazine They re definitely not the cheapest around but they are great performers I m a 3 5 level player and I could tell my footwork improved a lot while wearing these shoes Took a while to break in 
Flashy Shoe I own these Barricade IV in size 11 mens I could never wear Adidas court shoes before because they were all too narrow for my rather flat and wide feet and because their soles always seem underpadded rigid stiff The Barricade IV are wider in the sole and surprisingly fit my feet perfectly I play USTA 5 0 tennis 3 times week and the shoes take quite a pounding yet are firm enough to give my feet cushioned support without a sloppy fit These shoes in this black white red combination are highly flashy and I ve noticed people staring at them at the tennis courts guess you better bring a game to match wearing such high flash shoes Also they are the only 100 tennis shoes I ve ever owned Always wore Prince Screams and K Swiss Acsendors because they are wider and run in the 60 70 range A very well designed and beautiful shoe but you pay big bucks for it 
Just as reported in Tennis magazine The shoes took a little while to break in but they are now perfectly fitted to my feet Tennis magazine was raving about these shoes and I now know why 
Very Comfortable This is the best Jock Strap I have ever had The waist strap was not too large or small and the pouch was made of extremely supportive and comfortable materials 
Very nice but very hot I guess I should have known that an ultra plush bathrobe would be warm but this robe is almost uncomfortably warm unless the house is cold That said it is soft the length is perfect mid shin and it does everything that you would want a robe to do I would suggest however that you not purchase this robe unless you live in a climate with actual seasons i e not Texas as you may find it to be too warm to actually wear it 
Everyone want s one This robe was given to me as a gift not only do i love it because it is so soft and snuggly and color selections were really nice But My boyfriend tries to steal it one of my dogs tries to climb in it with me and even the cat can t stop clinging to me when i am wearing it 
so luxurious i love my pink robe it s the softest thing i own i received it as a present while i was pregnant what an awesome gift the robe makes me feel pampered the matching pink slippers are also super cute and cushiony my other robes don t even compare to this robe this robe is made with high quality makes a great gift anyone 
Like a giant teddy bear Got one of these robes for my wife and she loves it She s worn it nearly every day for the past few months and it s held up very well not like the other robes she s had Still very soft and comfortable All in all it HIGHLY exceeded our expectations she loves the way it feels and I m happy that I don t have to keep buying a new robe every few months 
So comfortable This robe is so comfortable I use it to stay warm in the evenings 
One of the classics Adidas started the Trail in the early 90s and has perfected it since Great running shoe and when its running life is over its a great looking every day shoe 
Maternity Nursing Bra Review I m content with this purchase though would have liked a little more support than the bra gives However the price was right for the over all product 
Great Bra I bought the non underwire bra I didn t think it would do as good of a job as the bra with the underwire but I get tired of the underwire poking me in the belly so I thought I would try it This bra is great It has better support than most of the other bras I ve tried and it s comfortable too I recommend the bra for anyone 
Great Bra This bra is great I am a 38B and it does what most other bras don t the straps stay up all day long and it is comfortable all day long I love it 
great bra I disagree this is a great bra if you want a good full support bra I am a 36 DD tried it on and I plan to buy it soon 
Children s New Balance KX621 Pros These shoes are stylish and fit well Cons A little heav 
Amazingly Sexy The product arrived in a prompt manner and the sender contacted me to let me know the status of shipment If your female lover has skinny legs she will probably look amazing just like my wife in these stockings She loved them We were so happy with the product I searched and bought more items from this vender 
Great Ascott The sheepskin really keeps your feet warm I tend to just want to wear them everywhere because of the warmth and comfort Only complaint is that they don t come in 1 2 size so slightly too big Definitely worth the money 
Soft and roomy These are great pants for your baby They are soft and roomy and the 2 pack makes it a great value Highly recommended 
My first winter coat I love this jacket It fits really nice in the shoulders but the bottom looks like a maternity jacket I wear a 16 18 and I got xxx large I wish I would have gotten a xx large Its on the big side but it gives me a lot of room to wear my wool sweaters 
Exquisite fabric Cashmere feels and lays like no other fabric If you can only have one cashmere item I suggest this shawl it is light weight and warm You will look chic wrapped cashmere 
Cool I liked the pants They are warm stylish and cool I love you 
Overall Good Bra This is a good bra for the price It s comfortable well made and provides good support 
Dont be fooled ok so i bought the Freddy Krueger Sweater Deluxe Adult Costume and in the pic it looks awesome it comes in Standerd One size X Large i bought the standers size HOLLY CRAP WAS THIS THING HUGE it looked awesome BUT it was sooo big i could fit 2 or 3 of me in this thing and yes it was the Standerd One size i love it but its just sooo wide thats all i have to say 
Hockey shirt It was the right size and clean and package nicely It was here when they said it would be 
Suit of armour I didn t realize this camisole had molded bra cups when I ordered it and they re quite rigid Otherwise it is attractive and fits well 
fabulous this is a great tank it can be just as easily worn alone as under other clothing i own a white one and will be adding other colors soon the bra is very supportive even though i had to buy a size that wasn t my normal size typically a 34dd but the 36d is okay 
Warner bra I prefer front closure bras without a lot of padding this fits my needs perfectly 
Very Cute Wallet I have gotten so many comments about this wallet ever since I got it I have had this wallet for about a year now and with regular use it is in the same condition as when I bought it it has collected some dirt stains but I will excuse that This is a great price and a cute wallet cannot go wrong with this one 
This is by far the best I am a long distance runner and this bra is by far the best one out there It looks good enough on its own that you don t have to wear another top unless you want to of course and the straps can actually be criss crossed to wear with racerback tops It fits snugly so my breasts don t slip out underneath and they hardly bounce The shape is nice so that you still look like you have two round breasts instead of one flat boob If you re going to wear it for more than 5 miles 45 min of exercising I would highly recommend buying bodyglide or using some vaseline as it does start to chafe the skin in the center of the bra band in front Don t let the price make you think twice if you are looking for the best exercise bra you ve just found it 
The best bra for high intensity activities I recently purchased two of these and I m happy to say that I ve finally found the perfect sports bra Perfect fit and support doesn t flatten the bust as other styles do very comfortable and completely adjustable with hooks in the back and velcro for the shoulder bands An avid runner and horseback rider I just love the support this bra provides during high intensity workouts 
THE BEST and I ve been wearing them for 10 years now As I just bought two more Action Shape bras I was compelled to write about how much I love them A little over 10 years ago my sister turned me on to them Genetically we re predisposed to big bustlines which has its advantages and disadvantages one of the latter trying to find bras that fit and support and still look good I ve tried many many other sports bras trying to find one from the 20 range that works and none of the other compare the racerback types don t give me enough support other high compression bras create that oh so unattractive uniboob look underwire sports bras have a very short life they re a pain to keep washed and it doesn t take long for the underwire to pop out of the underarm area ouch always seemed to happen during a heavy workout et cetera The Champion Action Shape takes care of ALL of that There is enough separation where this looks fine even wearing under a shirt I ve even been able to wear this bra under a blouse or sweater if I m planning on going horseback riding after work The straps and fasteners are totally adjustable The bra is mostly cotton there might be some lycra or polyester there but I m a cotton freak no itchiness no seams that chafe and best of all NO UNDERWIRE It s totally supportive as I mentioned I ride horseback this trumps the popular rider s No Bounce Bra that sells for over 50 and has a ton of hooks like a corset UGH and am also a gym rat doing high impact aerobics weight training Spinning Pilates and yoga this bra is EMINENTLY suitable for all those activities Care is easy just toss it in the washer and dryer or air dry I generally airdry as the hooks have a tendency to get caught in the holes in the dryer And they look GOOD I just wear this as a top on its own BTW Champion has come out with a new color this year Champion RED I just got it and it looks AWESOME HIGHLY recommended 
The best sports bra available I have 2 of these bras that I have had I think since they first came out and they are still as supportive since the day that I got them This is by far the best sports bra there is out there I am a runner and have always been bigger busted and this bra does the trick no bouncing It is well worth the money They last forever and I wash and dry them and still years later they are still great 
Hope Springs Eternal Even in the deep dark night of winter a white T shirt sends thrills of hope for the deep dark tanning rays of June July and August So in anticipation of the warmth and sunshine of summer I bought a this garment It sits in my drawer and together we yearn for the days when the sun rises before I wake and sets after I have found a place in the hammock under the maple tree I have not worn the garment therefore I cannot critique it except to say it was packaged very well I hope it is really ivory because I do not look good in Clorox white 
Good fit inner cup can be itchy The fit of this bra is flattering and the clips are easy enough to fasten and unfasten However the inner cup slightly cuts into your skin which can lead to itchiness after wearing it all day I am still trying out nursing bras so this I don t have many to compare this to However it is the best fit I have found so far in a nursing bra especially if you are well endowed 
Paper Denim does it again Let me start by saying my opinion is biased as I loved PDC Jeans before I bought these But these are really great jeans nonetheless Their shining feature is definitely the unique distressing It kinda looks like crinkled paper with original spiderwebbing details If only amazon did custom hemming this would have been a perfect transaction lol If you re trying to figure out what style these are letter code they are LTD That is their original fit bootcut Not too slim not too baggy Although these LTDs are aslightly baggier than the average LTD not by much 
Great After a small mix up with the order the item was shipped overnight The garmet looks great Thanks for the great service 
Very good quality and good fit These tank tops are very good in quality They are soft with very minimum shrinking if at all They do not fit very tight but they are not baggy either like many others where you might have to buy a size smaller Very comfortable to wear I plan to purchase some more 
OCC hat What can you say about a hat The hat is well made with no flaws Easy to shape the bream to how I like it right out of the box Willing to beat this hat is going to last a long time Well worth the money 
WONDERFUL This set is perfect It fits my Gigabeat like a glove The stand clip and armband are wonderful I highly reconment it 
Good Stuff This stuff is good to have when you are on the go and you just want to listen to your music w out having to hold it or anything I would choose this over anything 
Nice package This product is well worth the extra for the two chargers Everything is good quality and fits well I have the 60GB Gigabeat The belt clip is not the best I ve seen but arm band works well 
The only accesory bundle you ll ever need This is a great deal don t buy them seperately While incredible like other players the Toshiba Gigabeat S30 has a short battery life With this package you ll never have to worry about that Similarly you will be able to enjoy the player at work the gym and your vehicle Well worth the price Purchase and enjoy 
Decent package This is a very decent accessory package the chargers work very well and are incredibly convenient compared to the bulky Toshiba charger The belt clip feels a little flimsy but it has held tight The silicone skin works it doesn t fit perfectly and it doesn t cover the screen of course but it keeps the body from getting scratched The removable stand is great for video viewing 
great product This product arrived on time and works terrific Couldn t find the silicone case anywhere in town only one place had the car charger and it was 30 by itself This whole package was a GREAT deal The case really protects the Gigabeat 
Watch how you Wash The t shirt is just as advertised I like the yellow color a lot but like any t shirt the design will fade more easily if you tumble dry it rather than hang it up 
Best price bargain I looked all over for this type shirt for my picky husband this was the best price I found anywhere He s happy so I m happy Fast shipping too 
Heavy Apron This apron is quite a bit heavier than I thought it would be more like denim than cotton Definitely a heavy duty apron It is comfortable though and does the job 
Clutch is hot This clutch looks so expensive and has so many different slots for money credit cards and change I originally bought it to go with a dress but returned the dress and kept the clutch It looks like real alligator skin though I love the fact its faux Everyone tells me how nice it is And I don t know why the person reviewed it as poor quality and that it fell apart because it is so durable and I ve had it for a month and it still looks brand new Hopefully you make a purchase Enjoy 
Beautiful Shoes I have tried different Mary Jane style shoes I am so happy with this pair and yes the front is very low so you have toe cleavage but if you wear pantyhose it shouldnt be a problem They are beautiful and comfortable I am so happy This is my first pair of paten leather shoes since I was 10 years old they sure do bring back memories 
New Balance 408 The shoes are extremely comfortable and light weight I definitely got my money s worth 
purple slide on leisure shoes They were comfortable and easy to slip on at a moment s notice 
I would have given 5 Comfy light and cute but too loose for thin feet like mine I feel like dragging them around Great for pool side or gym shower not walking around 
Comfy shoe for WIDE feet I am addicted to my pair of Kobo III for women and plan on buying multiple pairs for next summer Perfect for beach or pool or gardening or running errands these shoes are one piece construction with plenty of drainage for wet conditions They are light and pack easily and come at a very reasonable price Best of all these shoes are wide I have wide feet big wide ugly feet but I rarely buy wide because the heel on such shoes is too loose for me The end result I m limited to boxy styles from pricey european makers ecco dansko etc that I buy in medium width generally about one to one and a half sizes bigger than my foot measures With the Kobo III I could fit my actual size I haven t done that since I was a teenager I wish I d known about these shoes when I was pregnant and my feet got even wider My only complaint is that they are obviously a casual sport shoe no real way to dress them up and make them go with everything 
Very sexy The nylon is a nice quality They are sheer smooth to the touch and have a silky sheen 
Try fit at a store before buying online Can t even get my foot into the shoe I don t have a high arch and always wear a standard shoe size This shoe must be designed for somebody with an inverse arch 
Rockports with poor fit I have worn Rockport size 10 1 2 loafers for many years So I had no qualms about ordering them online These loafers did not fit and seemed to be at least one size too small I returned them and went to the store and bought them size 10 1 2 
Excellent Go for it Your goggles may fog up though If so use medical tape just between the top part and your skin to prevent air from escaping from the upper part and up to your goggles I tried them in the very cold and still was ok And if it gets too warm you can bring the nose part lower to your chin Perfect to use wit a hemet Good price too 
Horrible save your money I bought these shoes about 2 months ago and they are already ruined The leather is so thin that it has separated and is peeling 
You wont get cold with these ones I bought these mits because I live in Wisconsin and I ride a scooter year round I wore these riding to work at night in 5 degree temperature at 40 MPH and my hands did not get the slightest bit cold These mits are worth 10 times what I payed for them 
Artiga has slight edge over Soffe We bought both this brand Soffe and the Artiga to compare We like Artiga more as far as a somewhat silkier look and feel but they run a tad small and you may want to order a size larger than you usually wear Soffe was also excellent quality but more in the vein of a true cotton t shirt and runs true to size 
Great customer service I bought this shirt as a Christmas gift for my husband It arrived on December 19 with a small smudge on the front I called the company right away and heard that they ve had this problem with their factory and that he d be happy to overnight ship a new one with no charge to me Tim the guy I spoke with even knew not to leave a message at my home with the new tracking number because it would spoil the surprise for my husband so he left a message at work for me Good looking shirt and great service what could be better 
Love these socks I chose to buy these just because they were cute They are the most comfortable socks I have ever bought I m definitely going to buy more I love the cute colors that they come in they do shrink a bit in the wash but once mine did they fit perfectly I am a size 8 but they also stretch and were padded and comfortable enough to give my feet cushion but also kept my feet dry and at the right tempurature warm on the cool days cool on the warm days Honestly definitely worth the money 
Adorable A cute shirt with the great quality I have come to expect from The Children s Place 
this shirt keeps me lookin all pimped out I PUT THIS SHIRT ON SO ALL THE FINE LADIES CAN SEE WHAT A MACK DADDY I AM ITS LIGHT WEIGHT ITS LINEN AND ITS FRESH 
Cute practical bag It s rare to find a backpack that looks good on college women that has the size and durability to match This bag does it I purchased it in turquoise and it is gorgeous There are plenty of pockets and ways to organize the side water bottle pockets are waterproofed zippered as most of the pockets are and will be useful for items other than bottles Although it seemed small when I opened it as soon as I began loading it it quickly expanded to meet my demands I purchased this to study abroad with in Spain and don t feel as though I ll be disappointed 
Great item I bought these as a replacement when our new puppy chewed the end off of a similar type lace on my husband s favorite shoes They come with easy to follow instructions and after a few minutes all was as good as new and harmony was restored shoes are now kept well away from puppy 
Not comfortable Not only do they make me look frumpy the stretchy belly portion of these pants start about 3 inches higher than the pubic bone which makes them pull very tight when sitting down especially in the later months of pregnancy They fit fine at 5 or 6 months along but at 9 months the denim is too tight for the lower abdomen section I end up taking them off for something more comfortable immediately when I get home 
cute and what I expected Thought this was very cute and was just as it was described My daughter gets compliments on it when we go out 
Baby Gund First Purse My 1 year old granddaughter LOVED it from the start and knew just what to do with each item in the purse It s great to carry along because it weighs so little Great gift 
Perfect gift for a little girl From my perspective it s the perfect gift for a little girl that wants to be just like mommy Your daughter won t mess with your purse anymore she ll be busy with her own Bought it for 2 of my nieces and they both love it 
Middle aged Fat Guy Running With Stress Fractures Calcium Deposits Shin Splints Bone Spurs Not a pretty sight Middle aged Fat Guy Running With Stress Fractures Calcium Deposits Shin Splints Bone Spurs Not a pretty sight these shoes 
Best Shoe I have Worn I have been running in the top of line New Balance for over ten years and have bought every top brand running shoe to try to compare Even though they are overpriced still best shoe on market especially for those with injury or pronation problems as I have 
Best shoe around I have a heavy gait and a wide foot These shoes fit perfectly and they last I just retired one pair after 400 miles compared to the typical 185 miles I got on the NB 991 I couldn t disagree more with the first reviewer I think these shoes are great 
Lifetime Running on New Balance I have been running on top of the line New Balance for over 15 years I m overweight and pronated As a 50+ year old runner I m more interested in running tomorrow than if I got a personal best today New Balance minimizes my injuries better than the other four top shoes I ve tried from four other brands 
excelent shoes for running This is an excelent shoe for running in and being in the military I do quite a bit of running I have found this shoe to have great shock absobtion like most new balance shoes but this one is better than most I would recomend this shoe to any avid runners out there I only wish it cam in more colors 
Great Boots I had these boots for over two years and hiked with them various places around the country and the world They re comfortable reliable water proof durable I finally ruined them after tramping through seven miles of jungle mud in Belize and then leaving them in a garbage bag in my pack for a week so now I m here to buy another pair 
Great all purpose boots I have had these boots for about a year and a half now They have been all over the world with me from the desert to the woods thru snow and extreme heat These are the most dependable boots that I could ever ask for I have never had any water leak in even in 14 inches of snow or in the rain They withstand every durability test I put them thru from hiking the Alps to raiding houses in Iraq I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THESE BOOTS TO ANYONE 
bait and switch Be forewarned Never mind all the mellifluous flubdrub about nature formed last footwear classic nineteen sixty five etc The facts of the matter are that a the Irish factory where Wallabees were handmade with love closed down in the late 1990s b the product has been made in mainland China since that time c the materials and workmanship don t begin to come close to their former standards which is duly reflected in the downward price shift 180 in 1998 but 110 in 2006 inflation notwithstanding yet d the Web sites which claim that the shoe is even better seem to have no problem with posting photos of the no longer available Irish craftsewns while shipping the Chinese hack jobs Very very disappointing gentlemen I once found a fellow in Ottawa who had bought up considerable quantities of sand suede Wallabees and was selling them at a premium 225 that I was happy to pay but even he ultimately went out of business just like Peter my custom Birkenstock sandalmaker in Germany I once phoned the vendor to complain and some imbecile tried to explain to me that the product was better than ever I flew into a rage telling her what she could do with her lies I also chastised her for having the brass bound gall to lie to me a diehard Wallabee fan who has continuously owned and worn day in and day out several pairs sand suede oakwood suede brown leather and or black leather since the age of fifteen two thirds of a lifetime ago The oakwood = dark brown suede were always my favorites since the sand suede always looked a little too smart Alecky for me making me look quite accurately like an upper middle class New York City Jewish boy just mate them with Sergio Valente jeans a creamy velour shirt and an ultra expensive sweater All that having been vented the Wallabee is still a reasonably comfortable shoe assuming you can find two members of a pair that actually match within a reasonable margin of deviation Teenage kids won t know the difference but baby boomers will be moved to tears Get with the program and buy either a pair of those ultra advanced computer designed ruggedized flip flops there are scores of vendors or some quality suede sneakers leather ones are far too oppressive for the educated foot CAVEAT EMPTOR

Good value This cap is of excellent quality and is available in a large selection of colors The profile is a little higher than some so if you want a cap that fits snug down over the top of your head this one is not for you The price is comparable to my local walmart but the quality is much better I bought several to off set the shipping costs and it became a real bargain 
big black bag sizing this bag is huge read the description and measure out how big it is i did this before i purchased it so i knew what i was getting into this purse is roomy and i enjoy that style this bag isn t a high end bag but it sure is nice for the price an other review mentioned that the stitching is gold which upon further inspection is true until they mentioned it i didn t even notice i really dig the big buckles seller this seller ships SUPER fast i received this bag about 2 days after ordering it sweetness feel confident when buying from them overall i m really happy with this bag it holds up fine in the rain and looks good with nearly everything 
Genuine style and ruggedness like we used to expect as standard from L L Bean and Timberland Before Carhartt goes the way of L L Bean Fox Racing Inc and Timberland and Barney s New York for that matter stock up on great genuinely tough useful comfortable and attractive clothing like these shorts and everything else Carhartt makes These are clothes that make you feel and look good comfort clothes you might say while you re rolling around in the dirt or even on your living room floor I laude the previous reviewer s honesty in saying they re great for wearing without underwear in the hot weather because they really really are Jeans denim and most cotton cloth can get hot and that can be real uncomfortable particularly for a man s bait and tackle whereas this cloth breathes exceptionally well They re particularly great for after doing endurance sports and taking a shower when you re body is still all reved up as a loose comfortable cool down clothing that you re fine wearing the rest of the day The pockets and loops are also very handy not only for working on a car bike or doing construction but also plenty big enough to carry your cell phone even my Treo keys and wallet comfortably without being like those huge ugly military style thigh pockets I expect Carhartt might someday start marketing itself just like other great functional brands that went hip hop style or suburb country sheik and if they do it will be a real loss But for now at least we can enjoy another in that long series of brands that became famous for function before it was popularized as a suburban teenager fashion and then ruined 
Carhartt shorts These are great shorts to work play or live in Like all Carhartt jeans and dungarees they re very comfortable to wear without underwear on those hot days or any day They tend to be sized a bit big I normally wear a 38x36 but with Carhartt dungarees I wear a 36x34 Well worth the money 
Your wife or girlfriend will thank you These are extremely confortable The material is a very soft cotton The pouch allows for comfortable support and they are very flattering My wife s jaw dropped the first time she saw me in them 
Buggabootres bugga best I bought these boots to go four wheeling in Not only are they perfect for that they re still nice enough to wear out in public too Also another plus is that they are easy to clean comfortable and most importantly warm 
warm nice looking boot I have been wearing these around the house for 2 days to test the comfort and fit They are very comfortable and cute too They are a bit stiff out of the box but I have been able to bend and stoop better than I would have thought when I first put them on They are also surprisingly lightweight for warm winter boots They are true to my size 9 womens foot The only negative I can come up with is that the shaft is big and the laces don t help in tightening them up I do have small legs though and I do not tuck my pants into them either If you have bigger calves or want to tuck in your jeans or snowpants you ll be fine My jeans fit over the top just fine I would wear a long sock to keep them from rubbing my legs 
T Shirt Do not waste your money on this one Champion Men s Cap Sleeve Raglan T Shirt Oxford Gray Navy X Large 
love this shoe I love this shoe So much that I bought the blue ones too The only thing is it runs big I suggest going down a 1 2 size It must be the style I tried the same style in a different brand and it was the same 
my beloved wallabees I had a pair of these as a kid and never forgot how comfortable and fun they were But those weren t Clarks Very happy with this purchase 
New to the Blue shoes I ordered the Blue Brocade Silk Mary Jane Chinese Shoes a couple of days ago The shipping was amazing It was so very fast I was very impressed I have not really worn my shoes out yet and orginally was not too sure I like them but I am impressed with the quality and beauty of them They are amazing 
I love these shoes These shoes are wonderful They are very soft and pliable and easily mold to your foot They are fairly comfortable unless you are going to be out all day long but then most shoes aren t comfortable all day long I loved them so much I bought a pair in bronze as well They are easy to clean and easy to get on and off I recommend them for anyone 
Schweet I needed a man bag and this is perfect Front pocket for a Moleskine Journal the larger back pocket for books golf discs 2 3 or an external HD Now I just need to find a giant multi tool to populate that cell phone pocket It s not very big but if you need a small bag for travel and hitting the town this is a good un I ve been carrying it for two weeks and noone s called it a murse yet 
Crossover Sling bag This is a great bag just the right size for what I need and the cell phone case on the strap is placed in a great spot It seems to be very sturdily made and I believe I will get a lot of use out of it 
A Long Shoe These New Balance shoes are great My son is a size 14 and is hard to fit New Balance had the right style and the right fit He loves those shoes 
New Balance mx621wn I bought these for my uncle for Christmas He loves them very comfortable Great value for a great price 
Nice case for DS lite Great case everything fit perfect and durable except for the beaner clip that fell off 
neat case The Nintendo DS lite fits in the case perfectly The LCD protector films are nice but a bit thin It s difficult to put them on the screen without trapping air bubbles even though the bubbles don t seem to affect the view when the LCD is lit The net in the game compartment seems too loose and does not hold the games well in place The loop on the outside is a nice feature 
I Love This Case I just got my DS for Christmas and needed a case I decided to buy this one because it s the same one my 2 friends have They got theirs to match their DSs so naturally I had to do the same I like that it has a pocket inside to hold games and extra styluses It keeps everything in one place looks great and is pretty high quality I highly recommend it 
really nice material and shock proofness this cover is nice overall stylish effective and affordable if your going to get any cover get this one its a great buy 
Walking shoe review The walking shoe is made for just that walking There s less arch support than I had hoped for but it s still an excellent shoe I do alot of treadmill walking in the winter and it s very comfy and fits very well When I need to run I use my running shoes for that I try and keep my athletic shoes separate from the sneakers that I use to run around town in 
Great shoes My favorite New Balance shoes were discontinued so I decided to give these a try They are even more comfortable than my old favorites I like that they are very lightweight and dip down a bit so they don t rub against my ankles The toebox is nice and wide so when you are walking all day as I was on vacation your feet stay comfortable no rubbing or blisters 
Great walkers I haven t always found NB shoes to be comfortable usually ended up with Nike Walking the dog I go through shoes pretty quickly These are extremely comfortable fit with room at the toe box but still allowing tight adjustment around the heel so they don t slip Also very lightweight I bought these at a store then ordered a second pair online since the price was so right and who knows when they will discontinue these for the next generation which may not be as ideal for me 
Very good seller This is a very reliable and responsive seller My order always arrived on time When I have any question I always get my reply immediately I appreciate their service and enjoy internet shopping especially from this seller This wonderful seller was by far the most attentive courteous and accommodating seller I have ever encountered on this site or any other They truly stand behind their word 
Goes perfect with the gown I LOVE ALL MY PRODUCTS FROM AIMEE GOWNS THE ROBE PJ S AND GOWN GREAT PRODUCTS THANK YOU 
Great Gloves Shipped fast Received in good condition very nice gloves Better than expected I highly recommend this company 
A great product I couldn t find this product in stock in my local store so I was glad to find it online I can t get my cup size in ample enough width so this really helped to get my bra from cutting into my back It s a great value too you can even use more than one if you need to Even though I didn t like needing to pay shipping and buy so many 3 or 4 at once they are good durable quality products Just be careful doing the wash so you don t lose them I couldn t find these at a major maternity store not the specific one I needed and my local nursing store was sold out which was too bad but I needed good support late in pregnancy and post partum 
totally sweet this shoe is the most comfortable shoe i ve ever worn i put on 50 80 miles week and they re there with me all the way i m not as fatigued as i used to be my body isnt worn down and i run faster in the 992 s than the 991 s i m just about ready for my second pair and i doubt i m even going to shop around for a different shoe outstanding 
Not too bad of a Shoe If you are new to the New Balance 99X line then you wont notice that these shoes are stiffer than the 991 s The 991 s were the Cadillac of running shoes your could wear them ALL day and suffer very little fatigue The 992 s have a stiffer sole and the overall quality of the shoe seems like it will last longer The 991 had some cheaper plastic parts that liked to crack and fall off 991 pros comfortable the better running shoe cheaper 992 pros not quite as comfortable but still better than most will last longer looks more stylish For those of you trying to choose between these and another brand remember that these shoes are made in the USA and not by sweat shop workers in another country They both hold up very well over the long run compared to other brands 
Fine improvement over 991 The NB 992 is a worthy follow on to the 991 For me it gives a better fit with more support and comfort I m in the process of buying my 3rd pair 
Great Shoe New Balance has another home run in the 992 I absolutely love the shoe and think the fit is excellent The cushioning is a bit firmer than the 991 but my feet still feel great at the end of the day 
992 vs 991 I m a 56 year old 200 6 1 pronator with flat feet and left leg 1 2 shorter than right leg The 991 was my first running show and I wore it out in a little over 6 months at about 500 miles or so or walking running The 992 has more cushioning and is holding up better The Plastic stuff on the back of the 991 just fell apart I still have the 991 s for alternate days and wear them on short runs or walks The 992 s do 4 6 mi comfortabley for me They are wider than the 991 Both are 11 1 2D I beef them up with a left heel 1 4 cork 1 8 foam in each shoe and arch molds with strategically placed felts and a ball pad I think the 992 is a better shoe and it is wearing well with a couple hundred miles on it I don t have experience with other brands so any suggestions for a pronator with bad knees would be welcome I need another pair so I can retire the 991 s 
Women s Reebok Princess Sneaker s I Love them They fit perfect and were comfortable from day one I couldn t get them for a better price anywhere else 
Top quality details I have been looking a long time for the several features that this micro fleece offers First of all the inner sleeves have a nylon lining that makes it easy to slip on and off without the static and bunching up of your shirt sleeves that most others result in The density of the fleece is top notch not the weak thin stuff you see way to often It has the usual and required adjustable draw cords I think more people would be attracted to it if the picture displayed the solid colors black as I think the two tone combinations look cheesy Try it You ll like it 
Not too bad Hello I ordered these jeans on sale at 19 99 I really love these jeans They are a comfortable strech material They do seem to run a little big though I am a size eleven and I should have ordered a size nine Sence they were so comfy and nice I went ahead and ordered a size nine also and just kept a hold of the size eleven for my fat days HA I do recomend these jeans They are a great buy Especially at 19 99 I sure hope this helps and that my review is as acurate as possible I am a jeans fanatic I am the type to try on 40 pair of jeans before I find one I think fits just right ENJOY I know I am 
The best jeans The jeans were good quality and a great fit for lady s with curves i would recommend them to everyone i get so many complements on their fit They arrived quickly and when they said they would Thank You 
nice these jeans are beautiful fit good love em love always valerie rosentha 
Best Jeans Evah These jeans are the holy grail of jeans they fit a curvy figure they are extremely flattering pocket placement helps to make a big rear end look good and they are stylish to boot Seriously I have been looking for jeans like these practically my whole life If I saw Tommy Hilfiger in the street I would have to kiss him 
LOVE these jeans I recently bought these jeans in the store and am getting another pair online I have always struggled finding jeans that fit is there a woman that hasn t I have a small waist compared to my hip rear and I have had this shape since middle school highschool when I was a size 6 After two kids I still have this shape and they still don t make jeans for it except the high waist tapered leg really out of date looking jeans Until now These jeans have a just below the waistline waist that is very acceptable to me I hate todays see my stomach jeans Never seen so many bare pudgy waists in my life Yick The hips are relaxed and are comfy for me without emphasizing anything I don t want to And I love straight leg Not tapered not 70s flashbacks Just straight Yay If like me you are happy with yourself until you try on todays low waist straight hip are we guys 70s flare jeans that tend to be too long on me and I m 5 9 Who do they make these things for Try the Hilfiger Boyfriend cut 
Great look great fit These are the most comfortable jeans I have ever owned As an almost 60 year old who still feels young at heart I wear jeans often on the weekends At my age it is hard to find a comfortable fit with a youthful look BUT THESE JEANS FIT The slightly dropped waist is comfortable but not too low The slight flare of the boot cut gives a youthful but not sloppy appearance I bought one pair and loved them so well that I went back and got another pair If shopping for jeans causes you angst try these I think you ll be impressed 
Case Logis 128 Capacity 3 Ring Binder I gave this as a gift to a friend and she said she LOVED it 
The 2nd Best CD Binder Ever I ditched the bulky jewel cases for my cds a long time ago in favor of nice binders that would hold the disk and the artwork securely without taking up too much space Since my collection continues to grow much faster than I anticipated I recently started looking to buy more binders Alas the ones I already had No Boundaries from Wal Mart of all places don t seem to be available anymore so a pretty exhaustive search of online options brought me to this item Basically this binder has pretty much everything I was looking for three ring construction a sturdy zipper closure to keep discs safe and contained and a sewn in handle at the back so it s portable A plus about this particular model is that the rings are slightly oversized for the stated capacity so there is the possibiity of expanding by buying more sheets I bought three and they work great I will buy more several more because they are the best option there is at present Let me tell you however what I don t like about them First the cover is some sort of plastic or vinyl I can see this cracking or disintigrating in a couple of years even with gentle treatment Second there isn t a proper spine to the binder it s basically a single flexible sheet that wraps around the outside but doesn t make square corners That means it will look untidy on the shelf and also makes me question its long term durability Third the sleeves they are too tight to put the disc and the artwork in the same slot the ones closest to the rings have their corners notched in to accomodate the rings and the slits are oriented to the zipper side instead of to the top Those drawbacks aside I plan to buy more of these They are the best choice available now but I wouldn t hesitate to ditch them if something better became available If you are looking for a safe flexible and smart place to store a lot of cds this item should be at the top of your list 
Slipper socks The slipper socks are just as described Good quality material My only complaint is that I did not get the colors I ordered and I did not want to go through the hassle of exchanging It did take longer than usual to receive and I didn t then want to have to wait again for the correct color 
Great product I bought these for use in a gym shower They channel water perfectly and never make my feet feel sloppy They air dry quickly and are dry and ready to use the next day 
Olga french cut Product is great But Did not understand what number equivalent translates to large Herroom charges far too much for shipping and handling in comparrison to others 
Its what I ve been looking for I ve searched everywhere for these zipper wallets Its just something I honestly think is very hard to find I stumbled across this particular one listed above and I just had to have it Its perfect The feel of the leather is super soft had the flip id holder dual money pockets along with the coin pouch Not to mention its at an amazing low price If you are unsure whether to buy this wallet or not don t be This is the one for you 
nicely made I like zippered wallets for security reasons This one fits the bill no pun intended The id slot allows for easy access with a thumb hole so that you can quickly slid out your id The inside zippered compartment is a bit too snug for anything other than a couple of coins I did not give it 5 stars because of that Also an outside id compartment would be nice I have an old Paul and Taylor with that feature and it was very handy no need to open wallet to show id This wallet has a wealth of slots for credit cards though 
Wallet Gift I ordered the wallet on the 29th of November 2006 and it arrived in Tucson AZ within the week It was a gift for a friend and he is very happy He was looking for a wallet that zipped as his job is physically demanding and movement throughout the day was causing change and receipts to fall into his pocket He loves it and I love that I got him a great quality gift that shipped quickly 
Good buy This wallet arrived very quickly It is lovely soft leather I like the fact that it is zippered on three sides keeps everything in the wallet I am female and while wallets are traditionally a male style I wanted something that wasn t just a coin purse or a typical woman s purse you know with the clasp pouch for coins and dividers etc b c I find those very cumbersome This is compact light it has plenty of pockets slots and dividers inside that zip again comes in handy if you fill up all the spaces inside it ensures you won t lose anything I gave it four stars instead of five just b c the coin pocket while strategically placed and pleasingly compact is a little hard to get your fingers in to put coins in and take them out quickly it s kind of tight Also the center divider for your pictures or drivers license etc sometimes gets in the way when you want to zip the wallet up like if you are in a hurry to get out of the line at Starbucks and you are struggling to shove your change in the little slot and zip it up But this really is a great purse wallet I love it and the soft leather which the interior of the wallet is also made of it s not just a cheap fabric filler inside looks and feels really nice 
all it says it is this a totally awesome fitting bra even better for the fuller figure I am a 36 DD love this bra no poking and digging of the unerwires Great everyday bra This and CHAMPION every day sport bra these are my all time favorites My body has changed a bit I think all women change through the years so it s really imortant to try different styles of bras for me this one and CHAMPION work the best Bali bras have always been my very favorite anyway I am not sure I think Bali makes the CHAMPION BRA Thank 
Comfortable and pretty I usually struggle to find a bra that s comfortable supportive and pretty This bra is all three In addition it s seamless which is great for me I bought one of these to see how it would feel then after wearing it for a while tried to go back to my old bras and couldn t I immediately bought several more bras The amazon price is a little steep though I got mine at the Bali outlet store for 19 99 and sometimes they have a sale The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it is not tagless The tags always bother me but I just cut them out 
All I feel is my feet not the shoe I m not athletic by any stretch of the imagination I typically wear the Converse Chuck Taylor hi tops and have a pair in nearly every color and wear them until my toes poke out of the bottom but as I recently discovered they are not too comfortable when walking for miles on pavement I have started a new exercise regimen which involves me walking about 2 miles a day in my neighborhood After a few outings with my Chuck Taylors my dogs were killing me and I knew I had to get new shoes I had never heard of this brand before I tried them on but I knew once they went on this was the shoe for me I use these shoes with the Nike Sports kit the RunAway by Switcheasy and my iPod Nano to keep track of my mileage I feel my feet not the shoes and that s how it should be Most importantly after my 2+ miles of walking my feet aren t sore as they were with my Converse my New Balance and my Nike shoes I hate spending a lot of money on a shoe that s made out of rubber but honestly they re worth every penny 
Great Skin for Your Nintendo DS Lite My children get the DS all dirty with fingerprints all over it This cover is perfect It does not cover any of the buttons or blocks the little stylus from being accessible Worth the money and the protection 
My Review I recently got this item and it actually isn t that bad I purchased the one that doesn t come with the screen protectors in color black There is one problem though I wouldn t advise putting your DS in a dusty or hairy area or even in your pocket with this skin on It catches materials fast but they an be easily removed 
Excellent for working out but I only wish they had a 9 inseam They tend to ride up quite a bit Other than that they are excellent for working out They keep you cool 
Wonderful My husband absolutely loved the t shirt Guy Harvey has great designs The items shipped quickly We will be back to shop here again 
Great Value This is a very good deal for the money On a small budget we just needed something to illustrate Sherlock Holmes and couldn t afford the entire costume I recommend this to anyone who is looking for something simple and inexpensive Perfect for the Get a Clue 2007 Summer Reading theme 
Terrific Onesies I purchased these bodysuits for my 8 month old grandson They are perfect for him because he is constantly up and down here and there and constantly moving and wriggling and these onesies fit perfectly while adjusting to his constant movements They are easy to launder and care for and the colors in this package are great to coordinate with shorts and pants Because they are stretchy they will last a long time as play clothes for your little one I highly recommend one or more packages of these bodysuits 
guess they re updating some stuff The colors are pretty nice and Luvable Friends doesn t use velcro anymore apparently Lightweight fabric means it s thin material Some of the stuff I got of theirs recently has printed care instructions on the back of the shirts instead of the regular tags but these still had the tags they didn t seem to be a problem though 
Very sexy but let s be practical too Like all 2 x ist underwear I own this brief is made of superior materials and appears to be built to last It was certainly WELL worth the price I paid If you like wearing extreme low rise jeans or simply do not want to flash your waistband for any reason then this brief is for you Period For those men who wear standard low rise jeans or the like then you do not NEED this but you still very well may WANT it Clearly this brief is meant to do two things 1 make it so that you can wear very low rise pants and 2 make it so you look irresistable when you are NOT wearing your low rise pants I found that even though the underwear is cotton as opposed to the synthetics of the X Factor line for example this brief still conforms to my body s contours pretty well Actually very well everywhere except it bunches a LITTLE where it meets the very inside of my thigh Regardless this is going to show off everything you got and subsequently make it look more or less more impressive Practical consideration the pouch and the area above is reduced in size since it is accomodating the very low rise Translation be cautious when you get aroused as there is not a great deal of expansion room Enough said on that but that is why I gave this pair 4 5 stars Everything else is great I never had a problem with my rear being exposed in these briefs If you forsee this as being a problem for you then may I suggest the 2 x ist Contrast Countour Pouch Brief 3103C It is the same price at review time and the same materials but in a standard cut and features sexy contrast lines I own it as well and you may read my review about it on its product page 
Seahawks NFL Jersey I was pleased with the promptness of the delivery and the jersey was in good condition I would purchase from this site again 
Really a great jacket What a great jacket this is I ve got it in stone Simple casually elegant I guess that also depends on who wears it seems stain resistant I have received many visits from dirty muddy tiny shoes and nothing shows and absolutely water resistant I clumsily sprayed myself with water while handling the garden hose and nothing went through it dried up quite quickly Sure I could have used an extra pocket inside but hey for 40 bucks 
Note SHORT sleeved Okay maybe I m an idiot for not realizing that the S S in the description meant SHORT sleeved but in fairness the man in the photo is wearing a long sleeved model I just assumed that for some reason the women s version came with short sleeves and the men s version in long sleeves Anyway I had to send mine back and it was promptly credited to their um credit 
Comfortable wet shirt The shirt is quite comfortable Feels good on and is as advertised Dealing with Diver s Direct is a total nightmare Buy the shirt from someone else if possible 
Huh These are NOT as they appear in the pic They are 90 white with blue trim NOT cool 
Real eye catchers I get stopped all the time when I wear these boots by people wanting to know where I got them They just make you happy to look at them They are fairly comfortable but because they are high heeled rubber boots they take a little getting used to walking in them They are easy to slip on but whoa they are hard to get off unless you have a nice slippery sock and they are pretty hot for people like me who have hot feet I have to wait for a cold day to wear them when I am prepared to wear them for awhile since getting them off is a challenge I like them though They are FUN Four stars 
Styling in the rain I live downtown and have to walk my dogs everyday so I thought some stylish rainboots would make rainy walks more fun The color was not very accurate from the website picture much more yellow than brown but they re still cute The only complaint I have about them is that the insole tends to slide around when you walk which is kind of annoying 
Great product I purchased 2 pairs of these tights for my 7 year old who has to wear school uniforms I bought them for days when it is too chilly but not chilly enough to have to wear pants She wears with with her skirts and skorts These tights are thick and warm and have not snagged even once Great buy and highly recommended 
Very nice pair of shoes I am ery pleased with my purchase Delivery was prompt and the product was just like I expected 
Comfortable and elegant Very nice shoe right size and very comfortable The strap is nice and the big buckle gives an interesting touch 
VERY comfortable pump I ve had trouble finding a great looking pair of pumps that were also comfy to wear After trying 4 or more different styles and brands these hit the mark They are stylish and the toe is neither too square or too pointy 
Beautiful just like VIctoria s Secret Very Sexy I loved finding a nursing bra that does not look granny ish It is very pretty and hooks and unhooks easily I am a 34C and holds the goods properly If you want something that does not bind you on the shoulders this is a good choice It also makes you feel sexy I loved it 
review The shoes were not as shown They appeared to be bulkier and sturdier but instead were a very minimal shoe not one for a day of shopping when your feet need a lot of support They were narrow meaning not much shoe sole on the ground In summary I was disapointed 
Works of Art with unsurpassed comfort I received my two pairs of these shoes today and cannot believe the IMMEDIATE comfort they impart If you can imagine BRAND NEW shoes with the BROKEN IN ease of wear of an old beloved pair this is what you get from this terrific shoe They are unique beautifully made and have the hand crafted look of VERY expensive shoes to boot Me I m ordering another pair for good measure in order to keep my feet HAPPY 
Exceptional quality Without equal most comfortable shoes on earth today The Mahogony color is so rich and smooth and the price is so good I m going to have to save up and buy a duplicate pairmso I won t be without them for a long time I am simply dazzled 
Rockport Women s Swansea Clog Black Leather 9 M They are comfortable I just wished they were cheaper in price Thanks 
smart and sassy Clogs were recommended to me by a nurse because i was having some trouble with arthritis in my knee I was told they would distribute the weight of my body in a more comfortable manner I found these Rockports on Amazon and they have been under my desk at work since As soon as i get to work i slip into them Besides being really comfortable to walk in they are like having super shock absorbers under your feet they have a nice sassy look with out the discomfort of a high heel I love them 
Great value Great product with an even better price I priced these cleats much higher at a local sporting goods retailer My 15 year old son is really enjoying them 
military style shorts I m very pleased with the product with the only exception being the cost of shipping I think is too high But other than that everything is ok 
Very Lovely The shipping was very fast I received the order in a few short days The parasol is beautiful It is made of silk and it does provide a decent amount of shade The previous reviewer was right in that it can be difficult to close Otherwise this is a very good purchase 
Pretty parasol For some reason parasols for the photosensitive are hard to find most are hideously expensive and not very good looking The House of Rice silk parasol however is an exception to the rule They manage to be pretty useful and surprisingly sturdy Except for a white painted handle the parasol s frame is entirely made of bamboo It looks fragile but is surprisingly sturdy especially since it is bound together with colorful threads and bamboo pegs Over that is asemi transparent pale yellow silk canopy and a matching ribbon on the top to hang it from How does it stand up in the sun Well the silk is technically transparent but when unfolded it does provide a certain amount of shade about the same as a pair of sunglasses Aesthetically it is also very good simple and unadorned except by a few extra scraps of silk but very elegant and understated The only problem is that to keep the parasol open you have to essentially shove it up onto a jutting wedge of bamboo It s a bit of a pain to close The House of Rice silk parasol is meant to look pretty but it can also be used for the parasol s origina function Definitely a good find if you can get it closed easily 
kenneth cole reaction toddler girl pink sandal AWESOME Very cute sandals high quality Super fast shipping Will buy from again Thanks 
grat first heel for 4 year old My 4 year old daughter had been bugging me to get her heels to wear with her dresses This shoes is the perfect height heel for a lttle girl not too big The butterfly is sparkley and she loves to wear them 
Beefy Tee I ordered this as a night shirt for my husband When his head gets cold at night he puts the hood up It seems to work rather well 
Best Sandal ever made In 1999 I purchased a pair of these sandals in a Birkenstock store in Key West FL I have worn them ever since every day in the summer months up North and now that I reside in FL I have worn them every day for the past 2 years I have never ever found a shoe as comfortable as this one and that wears so well I am in the process of ordering another pair of the exact same thing as my other pair is just starting to show some wear on the soles I recommend these sandals to anyone that wants a terrific comfortable shoe that lasts almost forever What a fabulous product 
Warm and fun This mask is not only wam in the winter but fun as well 
If you can stand to look like a freak I bought this for my 18 year old snow boarding son He loves it as it makes him look like even more of a freak when he is shredding the slopes his words not mine One size fits all and it fits his 7 3 8 head just fine Even though it is thin he claims it is perfect for keeping his face warm Vision out of it is fine The only issue I have with it is when I call him on his cell to tell him to get the heck off the slopes and get home he claims he can t talk to me as there is no mouth opening Yea right Thank goodness for text messaging 
Beautiful I gave this gown to my mother for Christmas She looks beautiful in it and she says it s one of the nicest she s owned It has been washed in the machine and it looks great She s pretty much bed ridden so I wanted her to feel better about that fact This has put a smile on her face The fabric is thicker than most nylon knit type gowns yet it has a flexible creamy feel to it My only regret is that I didn t select the pink for her as the blue is a bit too light and seems faded 
Intimo Men s Classic Silk Knit Tank Top I love my Silk Tank Tops I wear them to work under my dress shirts and the feel is very nice Much more comfie than the Hanes cotton tanks The quality is very good for the price The initial fit was just a tad snug but stretched out just a bit after a couple of washes wears and is very comfortable now I tried wearing one on a hike but i find the coolmax type active wear handles sweating much better than silk But for casual wear or sleeping at night I love them 
nice fit This is a great fit for a silk shirt I thought it would not be a close fit being silk but I was wrong This item fits snug and looks great on Both alone and layered I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank 
Very silky and wearble I bought this top for my 18 year old son thought it looked comfortable to wear under shirts etc It is He likes wearing it but he says he would never wear it alone It is a wee bit too feminine to wear on top Would I buy another one I don t know I think for him the basic cotton tank tops are more versatile 
Nice Sandals I bought these sandals for 14 including shipping They are well made and sturdy and worth 50 or so they normally cost I bought these sandals so I could walk around the beach They are fine for walking around the beach and going into the water They aren t comfortable enough for me to wear them while taking a long walk Shoe comfort is so personal that I can t say catagorically that these shoes are uncomfortable I can see where some people would find them comfortable on their feet since they are sturdy with soft soles 
not as comfortable as I hoped The color is very nice but the sandals are rather stiff walking is not very comfortable I rarely use them Going downhill is especially uncomfortable Will not buy another pair 
a brand you can depend on Columbia I love my sandals and knew I would be pleased with them as I have always found the Columbia products to be the best Quality comfort and value you can count on These are no different and are in the nicest shade of blue Took them on a major walking trip and have no complaints That was a true test 
Love Those Shoes I have problem feet bunions hammer and claw toes These shoes do not affect any physical impairment Thanks to Columbia I m walking hours and hours in sandals 
comfy casual sandals These sandals are very adjustable for a good fit and comfortable to wear The blue color is pretty bright but I like it after a little getting used to it time 
great color sweatshirt I love grey and this is just perfect I buy my clothes very large and this jacket was true to size Liked the material too pleased 
More than expected I am extremely pleased with the sweatshirt It was the perfect size and fit It is plush and very warm It also had lots of extras like the Russel logo zip pull and the embroidered logo on the sleeve I am very pleased with the item I have ordered more 
Could be better Fits nicely I m a very big dude very comfortable and warm Zipper is the one weak point too small and too light for the beating it will take under heavy use Nice for the price 
Awesome boots These are awesome boots they are warm fashionable and comfortable I ordered these and they came within 2 or 3 days Overall I am very happy with my purchase 
Not great The fabric surface hangs up on lighter weight fabrics Silicone surface is much better product to look for 
They work These really do work Once you ve got them on right it took me a couple tries but then I got the hang of it they really STAY on and do the job wonderfully They do hurt a bit taking them off I ve found that if you take them off in the shower it helps much like a band aid but otherwise they re very comfortable to wear and I always forget I even have them on They re a god send for today s tight fitting fashions 
They really work I have tried the petal shaped nipple covers but I found that you could see the petal shape under clingy tops so that was no good I tried Nippits and they work perfectly and did not show at all under any of my tops They do not hurt me when they are removed I have sensitive fairly big nipples but they still did the job They could do with being a bit wider but this really isn t a problem 
Amazing This product really worked I would purchase again in a heartbeat You don t even know you have them on and they do what they are suppose to do 
serve the purpose These work pretty well Don t waste your money on shipping go to walmart and look in the lingere section 
Love the stockings I have for the past few years purchased Hose Without Toes in my local department stores I went shopping this evening for some since the weather is warming and was saddly disappointed that the selection was very limited or that there were none available I went online tonight and an thrilled that I can buy some It is extremely tacky to wear stockings with sandles and with airconditioning in buildings I need stocking to keep me comfortable Quite often I remove my stockings when I go outside to the hot day I only gave 4 stars because I wish the shade selection was better and the sizing is sometimes strange Still I am happy to buy Hose Without Toes 
better than cashmere if they made cashmere crib sheets great brand my FAVORITE high quality withstands tons of washing very very well made and quite soft 
can t praise them enough great brand my FAVORITE high quality withstands tons of washing very very well made and quite soft 
love em great brand my FAVORITE high quality withstands tons of washing very very well made and quite soft 
small and fit my ears not those huge ones Wanted a small size earmuff not the MEGA muffs Old style over the top of the head Sent quickly and good price 
Good product for the price I LOVE my earmuffs I have trouble with wind I get an earache when it blows so I need to have something to cover my ears I hate hats The only problem I have found with these is that they try to regain their original twisted shape they arrived in No big problem just readjust 
comfort My black leggings are immensely comfortable and fit great I plan on purchasing a few more pairs however in different colors I have received catalogues from Silhouettes and am very impressed with all the great clothing 
leggings I was impressed with the product I purchased directly from the company and found the price was close to that on amazon maybe a few dollars cheaper I have had them for over a year and washed them several times with no problems The hold their shape and color black normaly fades but these didn t they are worth it and so comfortable 
Buy this shoe Oustanding quality and comfort You will forget they are on your feet I have all colors 
My toddler has very Happy Feet These are the best shoes They are the first pair I could keep on my son s feet Other shoes have very hard soles and are difficult for new walkers The Komfort Kidz shoes are soft enough for new walkers but thick enough to handle the elements from walking outside I tried Robeez but I didn t like the way they seemed thin plus he would kick them off He actually likes wearing these He will hand them to me to put on his feet Great product I wish they had a few more styles though I am on my 2nd pair of the same shoe and I am sure I will get another pair when he goes up a size 
the best first shoes for 1yr old I bought these little cute shoes for my 1 yr old I love them my son can only walk with these because of their soft sole I highly recommend them for kids under 2 yrs of age I will buy the next size up Great shoes thanks Komfort Kid 
Great Shoes I bought Komfort Kidz Happy Feet shoes for my 2 year old son Boy do these shoes live up to their name He won t wear anything else He says that they are very comfy and I love them because they are durable and easy to get on I will definately buy again 
Great shoes I lvoe these shoes My son is comfortable in them and there is no struggle to get them on and off We have tried all kinds of shoes for him Stride Rite shoes in his size are made for older feet not really big baby feet We have had a hard time finding softer soled shoes that come in his size so having them up to a size 7 is great he wears that at 15 months I wish they had an 8 I would be stocking up 
Truly Happy Feet I have been searching high and low for a true soft soled shoe per the recommendation of our son s doctor After numerous negetive experiences at Stride Rite I took my search online and luckily came across Komfort Kidz These shoes not only have a very flexible soft sole but they are adorable durible affordable and sensible with the easy on off velcro strap Thanks Komfort Kidz 
Buy this product if you want to break your MP3 player This is by far the worst product you could ever purchase for your very expensive MP3 player I had purchased this item after trying out one of the silcone skins that ripped apart after about 3 months of use I use my MP3 player when I go running and so I need an armband product that can withstand the elements and my running After using this product only 3 times it began to fall apart as follows 1 The protective screen cover is nothing but a flimsly piece of plastic that is glued to the case It basically falls apart when you try and squeeze your vision M into the case 2 There are these oddly placed velcro dots on the armband that are used to secure it after you wrap it around your arm The huge design flaw is that the dots needs to line up on top of one another in order to be secure So if you arm is an odd sign you end up having to make it tighter in order to align the dots If you re in the market for a tourniquet then you should buy this product 3 If you sweat at least a drop while you exercise or run if you don t then you re not really exercising the velcro dots lose their stick um I discovered that the fuzzy part of the velcro was glued onto the armband As it heats up from your body temperature rising it literally melts and causes the dots to fall off It was because of this that my MP3 player almost flew off my arm and onto the cement So if you are looking to shatter your MP3 player then buy this nifty product I think that my son age 4 could ve designed a better arm band holder in his pre school class 
Sexy and Supportive a great combination This is advertised as a long line bra but I grew up calling it a bustier Regardless of what you call it let s just say it s a perfect combination of physical support and visually sexy I have both the ivory and the black to wear with formal dresses It also comes with removable straps so you can go strapless or not it s up to you I prefer strapless it adds to the illusion of Goddess Wearing this Goddess Bra makes me feel like a 1950 s pin up model especially when I wear it with lace panties and high heels Honestly it conjures up images of Rita Hayworth as Gilda and listening to the seductive singing of Julie London girldiver 
Perfect strapless bra I have searched high and low for a great strapless bra For those who are more endowed it is hard to find good support without having the sides of a long line bra buckle When looking for undergarments on my wedding day many people recommended this bra to me It was perfect I felt completely supported and had no fears while wearing my strapless gown In addition the back sits a bit lower so you don t have to worry about it showing in the back I loved this bra so much I got one in black too I have worn these bras several times and haven t had any problems with them breaking Tons of brides recommended this bra to me and I am glad they did 
A Must This is one of my favorite bras It is sooo glamorous as well as comfortable I wear it with my formal gowns The support is fantastic yet it feels light as air I feel very comfortable and sexy A must for your wardrobe 
Great socks I love these socks Great wear and feel I am in the desert and they are holding up very well 
Great product These shoes are great just what I was looking for and the buying was so easy comfortable my size was out at every store I visited then visited Amazon Online and just a couple days later at my doorstep shop with ease 
Super comfortable and incredibly cute This is a fantastic shoe It s incredibly comfortable stylish goes with many outfits and is reasonably priced I got the luggage chocolate leather I m not sure what the chocolate refers to as to me that implies dark brown and this shoe is really more light brown tan The only caveat is that if you have wide feet you will get a little gap on the sides and the heel is a bit slippy Also the sole is not really made for a wide foot However despite the wide feet issues the shoe is still really comfortable I recommend it for comfort and style 
Picuture looks different than actual product I purchased these shoes for a great price on Amazon When the shoes arrived they did not look like the picture The shoes are very pointy almost to the point of looking like womens shoes 
So glad they re available again Munsingwear briefs are the most comfortable I have ever worn For many years they seemed to be unavailable and as a result I have been uncomfortable Am glad they are being manufactured again and that the quality is as good as or maybe even better than before I slightly prefer the boxer brief in cold weather and the regular brief in warm weather 
Pretty Comfortable Bra This is a pretty bra very sleek It looks great under sweaters and tees I like that the straps stay in place and there is no show through 
jockey for her bikini The bikini underwear were exactly as pictured They are comfortable and don t have those high cut legs that make the underwear bunch up in back Will buy again 
poor replacement I had a pair of Bass sandals that looked similar and it came time to get a new pair I found that the old style was no longer available so I ordered these They are a poor replacement the fit is off The straps are very rigid after a few attempts at breaking in and rub awkwardly on various places on the foot Can t wear these for more than a few minutes at a time 
Narrow frustration Good quality but a mixed review Shoes com provided wonderfully fast service and a decent sandal price Too bad my feet are so impossible my fault not theirs A friend with a larger size and medium width tells me she has worn hers Margie sandal comfortably for 12 years They still look new as evidenced by my ordering them after seeing how lovely they were when she wore them to a recent event Bass always produces a good product I ordered the tan distressed and they are beautiful sandals with sumptuously comfy soles They are adequately sturdy while also enabling feet to still look dainty and shapely For the 30 which I paid free postage they are a fairly good buy Nevertheless these sandals are not perfectly comfortable for me perhaps more my fault than theirs My advice to a person with small narrow feet is that this product may not be exactly right The front straps are in a fixed position as are most strappy sandals while the back ones are adjustable This said the size 7 Narrow is not for a truly narrow foot mainly due to the positioning and size of the front straps I will keep these sandals and can wear them around but on day trips or shopping I would probably not be able to endure the slight floppiness There is just a tad too much give for my foot Even the back strap isn t quite perfect for me as it tends to force the foot forward when adjusted in the tightest position Yet I need the very tightest buckle hole in order to keep the shoe on my foot at all Would I have bought these had I been shopping in a store where I could have tried them on Probably not But I ve been to dozens of quality shoe stores already this summer to no avail seeking my size in this type sandal At one point I went store to store at a huge outlet mall hitting every place with shoes including Bass itself At one store Etienne Aigner I was so frustrated that I made the comment that they no longer carried either my size or my style When the saleswoman heard I wore a narrow she said Oh we ll never go back to THOSE again It seems as if most stores consider customers with dainty narrow feet an oddity not deserving to find shoes at all So perhaps in spite of my dissatisfaction with the sandals in question I did well by ordering them 
College Daughter Loves It Mom Loves It I am very happy to see this top back in spring colors I bought this top in the fall for my daughter who is attending college in Florida myself I have received numerous compliments as the embroidery is perfect not flashy or overbearing at all When Amber called told me she loved hers I almost couldn t believe I had picked out clothes she liked It is very comfortable and breathable being 100 cotton The crew neck is not too high the 3 4 sleeves span the seasons well for us in CA FL Great top 
Perfect On doctors orders I needed to start working out again so I decided I d start to swim again My old clunky boxer style suits weren t good for doing laps so I wanted something with less drag I searched amazon and found exactly what I was looking for The Agon suit is amazing Good fit good look and modest too I couldn t be happier In fact I ordered another one If you re looking for a suit to swim laps in hang out at the beach or general comfort this is the one 
Great swimsuit I couldn t be more pleased with my new swimsuits from Agonswim This suit is very well made and the color choices are truly extraordinary in men s fitted swimwear These are not just great for competition but for the beach as well The materials workmanship cut and stitching are first rate Remember to take a look at the sizing charts before ordering generally speaking you will need to order the next size smaller than what you are probably used to from manufacturers like Speedo 
Good case slightly covers the screen I bought this case and it works very well Some people have complained about scratched but I havent noticed any There is a slight stcky residue but it comes off fairly easily The only real complainted i have is that the case covers part of the top of the screen Overall its a good case 
Good Case Stylish but may cause scratches The case arrived looking as good as it did in the pictures I thought it looked stylish retro I read from the other reviews there were scratches caused mainly the space above the click wheel and below the screen I checked the stitching before placing my 30GB video iPod in The stitchings around the border were soft But when I felt the stitchings around the click wheel hole I can see why there were alot of complaints of ipod scratching around there The sitchings were a bit more rough aound the click wheel than it is around the screen But from other reviews i have read there were no scratches from long term use of the case But i have nothing to worry about because I have kept the plastic adhesive sheet that came with the iPod So I suggest to those who want to be cautious try buying the adhesive protective sheet if you dont have it or you could just wrap your iPod in saran wrap After just taking my iPod out it left some sticky residue on the back ugh took me forever to rub it off the edges but it still left some residue On the sides with in the base there is a lining of glue figures But its still a good case Guess you just have to fully cover your ipod front and back before putting it in 
an awesome case i got this case as a present and it is a really great case apart from the cool retro look of it it protects my ipod and isn t at all bulky this case uses magnets for the flip top which makes this case less bulky than other ipod cases my ipod fits very snugly in this case and theres a clear plastic that protects the screen the sides of the case stretch so i m pretty sure it would fit both the 30 and 60 gb ipod it is a bit pricey but totally worth it buy this case 
A good case I was pressured into buying this flip case by a Radioshack employee and it turned out to be a great case Although it doesn t completely cover every surface of the ipod you can see the sides a little near the top it protects most of the ipod from scratches and smudges The leather on this case is soft to the touch The flip design is nice and the magnets work much better than a snap or velcro would I was also wary of the magnets screwing up my harddrive but I haven t had a problem with it One more thing the belt clip is a piece of leather on the back with velcro and a snap so there is a chance that it could get ripped off of your belt if you are doing some wild activity while wearing your ipod on your belt I just keep mine in my pocket 
Good product excellent protection Well I recieved this product as it was one of the only cases made for the Video Ipod when I got mine As soon as i got it I put it on it was a bit difficult at first but once in there snug i have never taken it out About 2 days later my IPod fell out of my jacket pocket and tumbled hard down a flight of CONCRETE stairs I was sure that it was damaged but I opened the case turned it on and and was fine I was quite relieved That alone justifies the price of the case I am proud to say that it is still in there to this day and the only thing I could have asked for would have been a somewhat tighter fit around the clickwheel as there is a bit of space for dirt dust to get into That and the whole made for the headphones could be a tad bigger 
Stylish and Great I bought this for my 30 GB Generation 5 IPod after doing tons of comparison and I love it For those who are worried about showing off the design of the IPod this is not for you but for people who are deathly afraid of dropping the IPod or scratching it this is it The clickwheel is VERY accessible as are the ports It won t fit in a dock but if you don t have the dock it can stay on when connected to your computer with just the wire I also love the look of it It looks like a wallet One note if you are interested in hanging this from a belt loop with the back strap it is functional but a bit awkward The snap and the velcro are safe enough to keep it on but it always seems to be in the wrong position to fiddle with I am very happy with this purchase 
Cool Shoes I got tese shoes for my birthday and they are great you only have to lift your feet up a tiny biT THESE SHOES ARE THE BEST 
briefs Briefs are great They give you superior comfort and support Hanes is a trusted brand that perform well If You are a kid who wears briefs and get made fun of for it listen to this Briefs are only bad if you think they are If someone makes fun of you for them dont get immbaresed just act like they re a good thing and people will stop Some people will even giv briefs a try themselves 
Great Shoes Pretty good shoes they hold up well on the court and they don t loosen when you run Thanks for a great pair of shoes T Mac 
Wide toebox good stability I would never recommend buying shoes for serious running online unless you ve tried them out first but this is the line I wear and Amazon was doing a promotion so anyway this is a great stability shoe for people who want a wider toebox basically the opposite of Nike I actually liked the GTS 5 better but that s the way these shoe companies work they never seem to stick with a formula for longer than a year or two 
Love my Pettipants These are so cool I call them my bloomers They decrease the bulk in my clothing because they serve as both panties and a slip So it saves money too They can also be trimmed to a custom length for you because of their ingenious design In additon they protect that tender inner thigh area when you re wearing a dress My usual size is 10 12 I got a size L which works for me They re a win win 
Love them I finally found these purchased several I find that pettipants are more comfortable than full or half slips I am very pleased with purchase 
Great Boot This boot runs true to size The calf is generous and a great fit for us athletic girls with larger calves I purchased two months ago and have worn them many times they are very comfortable for all day wear They would work well if you have short legs because the shaft is not very tall I have long legs so the top hits about 3 1 2 inches below my knee 
Great Backpack Bought this for my middle school daughter and she loves it Great design that actually has more room than her older bigger one It is comfortable and easy for her to manage without too much strain on her back We are impressed 
Great Value This backpack daypack is a great value Super efficient pocket layout Beware that the straps are a little stiff when brand new and will take a few hikes to soften up I plan to by a few more for wife and kids 
Simple Solid and Sturdy Simple Solid and Sturdy This backpack was exactly what my 9th grader needed to carry her things to and from school and between classes 
unCOMFORTABLE This shoe is very uncomfortable The pinky toe gets caught between the straps and it hurts very badly I tried to give them to my aunt and she would not take them for free 
Easy Spirit Women s Daryle Wedge Ankle Boot Very pleased with the purchase These shoes are comfortable and durable 
inexpensive comfortable shoes I received these shoes as a gift from my husband and I love them They are very nice looking shoes and also very comfortable I didn t have to break them in because they were comfortable from day one They also have a classic timeless design So many of the other loafers I looked at had trendy additions like a platform heel etc which I didn t want These are inexpensive yet high quality shoes I highly recommend them 
best fitting ever I love this item It fits really well with my low cut jeans I finally have a butt with these They are not to big or over welming I recomend to all that need some extra padding 
Expensive but worth it Great quality real thing Although knock offs are everywhere you CAN tell the difference 
Burberry scarf Excellent service Quality of merchandise was perfect Nicely sealed in cellophane bag Very please 
Good Product The onesie is very cute is the exact size I needed Is a great product for a low price Fast shipping 
Offensive Review The above is the kind of review that shouldn t be on Amazon If you don t want the shirt don t buy it you homophobe Looks great to me I think I ll buy it for my heterosexual husband 
Half Naked Men Apparently men don t wear pants while walking around camp with a guitar in hand Welcome to gay man s paradise 
Great shoes Good looking and comfortable a bit retro in look Have been worn daily since purchase very satisfied 
great fit so comfy I love em I m only 5 4 and these pants are perfect Not too long and soooooo comfy Not too tight hang just right soft and I love Happy Bunny stuff and this one doesn t have a specific saying so I can wear any top with em Of course I ve only worn them to bed so far but I m pregnant too and these are gonna be comfortable to wear the whole time I can tell 
Totally feminine My mother gave me 2 packages of Hanes Her Way Elegance Nylon full brief panties for Christmas I love the fit and the silky soft feel of these panties I especially like the pastel colors very feminine In my opinion these panties are of excellent quality Thank you Hanes Her Way for an excellent product David Steven 
Good Steel Toe Work Boot This is my second pair I bought another brand in between and quickly realized my mistake I buy a pair of work boots once a year this boot lasts a year in my work environment most others don t caustic acid fats protiens I thought the ankle support was a bit strange the first time I bought the boots but I really missed it when I bought another boot It holds your foot in so the boot does not feel like it will slip off 
dr martens are always great i gave these to my husband as a gift and he just loves them he said that they are super comfortable and required very little breaking in we will probably by another pair soon highly recomend 
Rockport World Tour Walking Shoes I put my new Rockport shoes on and they fit me perfectly allowing me to wear them all day without the slightest discomfort I have never worn a more comfortable pair of dress shoes I walk all day and usually my feet are dead when I come home With the Rockport shoes I can do a 10 hour shift with no foot discomfort A very dressy shoe I get a lot of compliments on the styling And when I flip them over and show people the soles they want them I was originally put off by the price of the shoes but after wearing them for a week they are worth every penny I will buy this product or a similar Rockport shoe again 
rockford walking shoe this is a great shoe comfortable and surdy Good support and oerfect for a walking tour Amazon s price was incredible 
Best Shoes Ever I have foot problems My foot Doctor prescribed these shoes along with orthotics I ve been wearing them for the past 15 years These shoes have a very strong mid sole and arch 
5th pair and still going I ve used this exact shoe for 5 years 5 of them and love them 
High Comfort Most shoes have a distinct comfort lifespan in the shape of a bell curve They are uncomfortable for the first few days while you shape them then are fine for a year or so till they start to lose padding But not these I just bought my second pair of this wonderful design as my first pair was starting to lose tread after over three years These shoes feel great from 15 minutes after you first put them on forever or at least 3 years These shoes run a little bit larger than normal and I find myself comfortable in a 10 0 instead of my usual 10 5 
great May just be the best looking walking shoe on the planet Its designed for real walking not just to look like it 
Good Undies Very happy with the fit feel look of these pouch briefs For those guys out there who like pouch briefs I recommend 
SEDUCE 3010 5 Thigh Boot Hot Pink Patent Size 7 The boots are a tiny bit tight but will work great for my costume 
Nice shoes for kids This shoes are very nice especially for little ladies It fits very well and i hope this shoes would be again in differents size in color white 
Best thing since sliced bread I am a Plus size girl Bra size 40F I like to wear halter and strapless style tops and was unable to do so until I discovered this bra Excellent support nothing falls out I swear you can do aerobics in this bra and everything will stay where it belongs It is however important that you purchase the correct size My advice is to be measured professionally before making the purchase If you wear the correct size it is comfortable for at least 8 hours if it is too tight you will feel as if your body is in traction Now there are very few styles I can t wear and to paraphrase Bridget Jones I feel like a Sex Goddess no pun intended 
Pleasingly surprised The quality of the material was better than I expected The color was a visually pleasing tone different than anticipated I appreciate the cut of the design 
My favorite comfy gown These 100 cotton gowns are so soft and light that they are a delight to slip into at bedtime They have a modest amount of tone on tone silky embroidery and just enough trim detail to make them pretty without being ornate or overdone Their true appeal however lies in their comfort There is nothing binding or fussy about these gowns and their length below the knee to mid calf depending on your height helps prevent night time tangles The light weight of the fabric does make them a bit revealing as an earlier poster noted so add a robe if you re not feeling particularly brave when you step out to pick up the morning paper 
have two buying more I received these as a gift They are so light weight and cool The softest and lightest possible cotton The cut is so flattering The gown is so comfortable I wear them nearly every night and have just about worn them out in two years I cannot wait to buy more 
Beautiful boot This boot is a quality item The upper part of the calf is rather slim although around the ankle it s a bit too loose Very stylish although the heel height makes it not very comfortable to walk in 
Highly recommended This is the best nursing bra that I purchased It took me a few tries to get it right but when I finally found this one I purchased a few The style and fabric is very supportative and I love the fact that it is not an underwire My only negative comment is that it is not available in a nude or bone color Every nursing mom should own this bra It is well worth the price One last suggestion get properly fitted by a professional 
Worth the money I have bought plenty of cheap nursing bras that are so uncomfortable and ugly I splurged on this one at Nordstrom and I am going to order another one It is SO comfortable and has great support for my 34E size I highly recommend it 
The best This is the best nursing bra ever made It has very good support and it is so comfortable 
The solution period For the cost I thought might as well try this gadget there s no real large financial investment so if it looks or behaves goofy i ll just toss it in the trash So my husband buttons one end of the Tiedown slides the Tiedown through the necktie s nametag with the shorter necktie end tucked in also and buttons the Tiedown at the other end I would ve bet money on the fact that you could see the edges of this cheap tie holder or that the tie just wouldn t lie right Well I was right The tie crumpled all up and looked goofy until we moved the Tiedown down one button Then I had my husband stand up straight lean forward lean from side to side OMG I could not see the Tiedown at all and the tie was completely well behaved We were thrilled with this new gadget Hubby has worn it for a week and has not heard one comment from colleagues about the unusual tie holder Because no one can see it I do have one suggestion though they should be sold in packs of three or five that way if one gets broken by the kids chewed up by the dog or lost by dear hubby then you ll have extras on hand So in the meantime by a few when you order I didn t realize at the time of this review that a multi pack was available This is a product that will eventually be sold in high quality retail shops get them while they re still so CHEAP because once the designers get a hold of them they ll crank the price up so high you ll think you re buying a slice of gold instead of plastic Trust me I m stocking up NOW Buy em You ll love em 
Good for low cut tops leopard too I find this a very supportive bra for 38DD and it s perfect for my low cut neckline stuff most nursing bras are not low in front The snaps are very strong and I can use either washable or disposable pads with it The back is wide in order to support the low cut top by the way it looks more low cut on me than in the picture I love the leopard 
Good visors Great service from the vendor sent by mail quickly The black material on bottom side of visor should be white especially for wearing in Arizona Otherwise I m very pleased 
looks good I bought this shoe for my wife I like the slip on wedges She says it feels comfortable and she likes the look nice to go out in the summer feel 
Great Once Worn In They were a little uncomfortable at first across the top of my foot they were tight I ended up with blisters on both big toes But once I wore them in a bit they were fine Now they are the most comfortable sandals I m loving them 
Awesome shoes I m not typically a shoe person usually I tend to own one pair of sneakers until they basicly disintergrate from use However with converse s I found a shoe that I actually really did enjoy wearing Often people complain that the converse s are overly trendy and that s the only reason for the popularity However I currently own 2 pairs might consider getting another and will probably keep with the brand for life due to their conform and easy to wear style 
Good shoes Good shoes They were a great buy for 20 back around Christmas time Casual and comfortable They did take a while to break in 
My hubby loves em My hubby thinks these are super comfortable and I think they look great A good compromise between boxers and briefs Pretty pricey but worth the dough for comfort style and durability 
Boxer or Brief or Thong While I seem to be going against the grain here having never worn a thong before I think these boxer briefs are awesome Boxers tend to be too loose and briefs can sometimes ride up places you don t want them to go if you are extremely active These are the perfect medium comfortable and if you go with the black I think they look pretty good Or you can go with the thong lol Your call 
CHRISTMAS GIFT ALL YEAR LONG I received this robe as a Christmas gift from my son this year and each evening I can t wait to slip into it The robe envelops you with softness and warmth and it reminds me of my son The shawl collar is very flattering and although the robe can keep you very warm it is not heavy The arms can be rolled or folded to whatever length you desire I have tacked mine in place with thread the color of my amethyst robe There are nice deep pockets on either side of the robe and a nice long sash If I was to use one word to describe this robe it would be PLUSH It is well worth the price 
CozyChic Bathrobe One of the softest robes I ve ever owned Good quality and fit The color is a rich looking dark cocoa color Incredibly prompt delivery 
nice shoes true to fit be sure to order your correct size clarks shoes are grea 
I love Clarks These are the only shoes I want to wear The pair that I bought here fit perfectly I had already been fitted for Clarks in a department store so I didn t have to guess the size I only wish I could find a blue pair that I liked on Amazon 
Wonderful I have two pairs of these and I love them They are extremely soft and warm They fit well and the colors are exactly as pictured Not to mention the price is unbeatable 
Very soft The color is true to the picture and the fabric is really soft I just can t say how hot it is since I live in Rio de Janeiro Brazil and the coldest it gets here is 20�C 
Looks nice handles well but good quality I am an experienced lightsaber fighter and Star Wars fan When I ordered this saber I expected it to be hard and sturdy like the basic sabers It s electronic all right but it trades that for quality The blade is made of flimsy plastic and doesn t stay in the hilt when pointed downward when deactivated On the other hand it is a pretty good flashlight If you are going to buy it buy it because it s the cheapest electronic lightsaber you can get new not for the quality 
This lightsaber is nice I like this lightsaber because it lights up and is one meter long like the real ones 
warner s right moves bra Very well made I should have gotten C vs B my fault 
No Cotton I bought this bra because the ad says 100 cotton There is no cotton in this bra It is 76 nylon and 24 elastane If you want a cotton bra this is not for you 
Not so pleased The service and everything was fine I just did not like the product Instead of being cute like Uggs are which is what I was looking for they were big and clunky They looked like men s work boots I hated them 
Sheepskin Boot When your feet are cold it s hard to get warm With these boots your feet are toasty keeping the rest of you comfortable 
sent 1 boot wrong size nice boots soft warm inside but too bad they sent me two different sizes i have 11 5 mens and they sent me a mens 11 and a mens 12 and i ordered size 12 boo hoo 
Absolutely Wonderful Wonderful boots Great deal for the price also They come with optional memory foam inserts that you can use with other footwear if you wish and a bottle of treatment that works great They are easy on easy off and keep my feet warm even in 30 F temps I ve never owned a pair of Uggs and now that I ve tried the Warmbats I probably never will 
Way better than Uggs Great boot Well made Strong and durable for any type of weather condition Comfy and stylish Affordable and well worth the price 
Best Sheepskin Boots Ever I have been wearing sheepskin boots for a few years now I have Uggs made in China and another pair that were made in Australia and these Warmbat boots are by far the most comfortable and best looking in my opinion It seems all the good shoes are made in China now I love that they include a bottle of protection and the fit is perfect My other boots have stretched over time and this company includes extra insoles that can be put under the lining if they get loose I m sure I will need to use them because I have worn them every day since they came to my door Great grip in the snowy weather that has finally hit the ground here I LOVE these boots 
Chinese junk Typical chinese fit too wide in heels too narrow in toe In spite of warmbat australia logos all over the little tag deep inside says made in China At least one size too small returned for refun 
Excellent service I was given very good service and also was shipped very fast Thank you 
This is what you novices need for your local yearly cycling event The old standby for a suddenly wet and or chilly windy ride is to wear a garbage bag It works but you would really rather be wearing a jacket that can be zipped and unzipped A decent cycling jacket costs about 150 more or less but if you re a novice you don t need to blow that kind of cash and this jacket will serve you fine Keep it with you just in case and see the envy on others faces as they shiver in their lycra or suffer the sauna conditions of wearing a garbage bag to keep dry because they didn t carry this handy bit that easily fits in a jersey pocket or any kind of backpack without too much bulk Keeping the wind out alone is a big way to keep warm in foul conditions while continuous riding will produce more than enough heat to keep you warm most of the time If you re heading out for say NYC s Five Borough Bike Tour in May and don t know what to buy your basics are some kind of jersey a CoolMax shirt will do 6 panel or more cycling shorts with a chamois pad where the sun don t shine light thin socks Air e ators are best and one of these jackets These and a helmet and you re set for serious riding Skip the bulky layers for warmth If you want that bit of insulation you may need get a 10 polarfleece vest from a bargain store and one of these jackets I take one star because it doesn t have vented armpits but on second thought I probably shouldn t have in consideration of the price to value ratio 
Warning These are mens shoes These are mens shoes and I didn t know and ordered a pair When I called the company to question them invoicing me for mens shoes they were not very helpful at all She thought I should have been able to tell from the picture of the feet ummm it a picture of FEET if they arent in mens dress shoes they are not gender specific I think I will take my business elsewhere 
Comfort Comfort and style for those of us who are on our feet all day These were inexpensive worth every penny 
What size should I order After reading the product description and looking at the photos I was ready to buy but when it came time to select a size I couldn t start Without a sizing chart I don t know which size to order not for a unisex item 
Fabulous Luxury Robe I was looking for a comfortable luxury robe to take travelling that wasn t so bulky in luggage and this is perfect It feels wonderful packs up beautifully and is made very well A great robe for the price 
Great quality lightning fast delivery Our family was taking an extended vacation and I wanted to surprise my wife with a travel robe not too light nor flimsy but not too bulky either since our bags were already full and after the vacation we d be returning to our home in the South I shopped around locally in the Houston area dept stores and was surprised that I couldn t find a decent quality robe They were all cheap and poor quality Needlessly Marked up had a great quality robe but the price was in the hundreds of dollars range I then looked online and was really tempted to buy a generic robe in the 65 price range but I became leery when I found too many negative reviews complaining about the poor fabric quality Hence I decided to spring for the Luxury Spa Robe You should note that the exterior is smooth microfiber and the interior is the cotton terry My wife was really pleased with its look and quality and continues to use it regularly I also bought some matching slippers she likes those too The delivery was lightning fast I received it only 3 days after placing the order 
Luxury spa robe Ordered this for my wife and it turn out to be a wonderfull surprize for her It arrive on time and the fabric is of great quality cant fault it in any way 
she was so happy with it The microfiber was not only great feeling but was a very beautiful color The terry lining was the perfect feel without being too thick The weight was heavy enough to cause it to drape nicely It went down to her ankles which is where she wanted it but that would have been easy since she is 5 2 We were very happy with it thank you 
Great Robe Bought this robe as a gift for the wife She loves it Nice materials and good quality Would buy again 
Super plush robe I love this robe I received this as a gift and it s my absolute favorite one it is super soft and way better than the ones they sell at spas for double the money Would definitely recommend this robe as a perfect gift 
ABSOLUTELY THE BEST ROBE The Luxury Spa Robe with the Cotton Terry Lining is the BEST robe that you can find We have gotten so may other robes but this is the one My husband and I each have one and it feels like we are in the spa every day You can t go wrong with it and it s worth every dollar And it s the greatest gift to give 
Perfect gift and excellent customer service We purchased the robe and slipper set for my mother s birthday and she loves them When we ordered them we ordered a large which was a bit too large on her and exchanged it for a medium which was perfect The exchange process was quick and painless and the customer service was excellent She loves her robe which is extremely soft and luxurious 
Lovely but First thing you have to buy half a size bigger I m a 6 5 and got a 7 and it feels about right Second they hurt at the beginning You have to get used to wearing them But they are totally cute good materials and unbeatable price 
comfortable and supportive The fabric and cut of this underwear is decent and comfortable perfect for everyday wear The front pouch is slightly different from the other similar underwear I own but it s still quite comfortable All in all this thong is essential for the guy who likes variety 
i have these i have these pants in green i didnt buy them off amazon but i did buy them from target I LOVE THEM they are some of the most comfortable pants ever i have so many gauchos i just dont have them in black i NEED them though i prefer to wear gauchos to normal dress pants anyday they make my butt look much smaller than it really is I Really recommend you get these pants 
Ten Stars If you are really narrow this is it I ordered the AAAA width They are comfortable and fit perfectly comfortable right out of the box 
New walking shoes These shoes are very very comfortable The price was reasonable delivery timely All in all quite a satisfactory purchase 
Fantastic These are fantastic extremely comfortable and a great value for the price I love them and will be ordering more as needed 
Good price average value I was looking for some glasses that have a lot of functionality and some decent quality at a LOW price found it Make no mistake though its a good value for what you pay but you do get what you pay for 
Excellent Deal The sun glasses are a great deal I have had Three Pair of Ray Ban Aviator sunglasses in past year between work and play some things just dont hold up as well as i d like needless to say at one hundred dollars a pair that gets expensive i thought i would try these as an alternative and they are great stylish and economical as well as comfortable and light weight 
I don t think they should use a name brand like Ray Ban when they are selling copies My order arrived on time the product was not as I expected In my oppinion people shouldn t be allowed to use brand names like Ray Ban if the product they sell is not that brand in particular I guessed it by the price but still I thought maybe was some crazy clearance or who knows why The package got here in excellent conditions The seller offered a full refund but I kept them to remind me of my mistake So the product s description is confusing and tricky I am not happy with my purchase but I hope I learned a lesson nobody sells 100 bills for 20 
Bronco Beanie YEAH What can one say about a beanie comfortable thick and soft Only a short season to wear it in Phoenix but perfect for trips to mountains Go Broncos 
BRONCOS KNIT BEANIE THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT IT ARRIVED BEFORE CHRISTMAS THE RECIPENT WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE GIFT 
Broncos Knit Beanie Great buy It was a great Christmas Present Packaged great got here on time and was surprisingly a better quality than I had expected Loved it Thanks 
Extremely satisfied The color was true to the picture it came in a timely fashion and the price was right I would order from them again 
Great Buy First of all I think these glasses look fantastic They did look a bit flimsy when I got them and I thought they wouldn t make it through the summer Most of all because I ve never owned a pair that has I guess I m a bit rough However its been about 6 or 7 months now and these things are still going strong The lenses seem pretty resistant to scratching Oh yeah and all for just 10 I think its an excellent buy When I got the shipment in the mail it came with a coupon for 2 more pair for 10 Close in style but not identical Since I thought these weren t going to last and it was a heck of a deal I bought the two more 
A huge success We got this for my daughter s age 6 father daughter sock hop and it was a huge success Most of the other girls were wearing pink and I think the red one really stood out beautifully 
it is realy nice i realy liked it and it is confortable and attract everybody eyes 
Not Good As soon as I recieved the shoes I opened them with excitment when I went to strap them on the buckle was very limited and did not stretch much This became a problem because they ended up being uncomfortable and on top of that two rhimestones came off also just trying them on I returned them Not Satisfie 
Love these shoes Me and two of my girlfriends all bought these shoes in silver for a wedding that we were in All of got amazing compliments on them and many women asked where they could buy them for themselves The shoes are very unique and sexy looking and I love them They can be kind of tricky to put on however and they re definitely not comfortable if you plan on standing up for a while but other than that its a great sexy pair of stilletos for an awesome price 
desert boots These are just like the ones I wore in the 1960s except they are made in Vietnam instead of England which is dissappointing They re still great though 
great ordering from amazon is always a good experience and the promotions you folks run whether sales or dicount codes are great 
Men s Desert Boots These boots are comfortable and neat looking Exactly as I remember the desert boots I had in High School about 48 years ago 
very good boot I am very pleased with my purchase of Clarks desert boots they are very comfortable and a good fit they are a diffacult boot to find in any local shoe store I had these boots many years ago when you could find good shoes and boots A A D Camb Ma 
Good sturdy but attractive boots I get compliments for them all the time They are comfortable sturdy and good looking footware They were created as heat resistant hiking boots but they are good general purpose shoes Probably not the best things to wear in the rain but they d be great at Burning Man 
Desert Boots What A Fantastic Find I have looked everywhere for desert boots without any luck They did not seem to exist anymore This was a shoe that I had worn forever On a whim I checked Amazon and was pleasently surprised to find these shoes They are exactly what I wanted Great shoe great service 
Part I of the outfit This is a bit more sheer than I thought it was so I will be wearing it differently than I orginally planned I had thought it would be good with shorts but with the cami it is a bit dressier I like it it fits well 
Old fashioned style Like the design and the color but didn t like the t shirt style It is too wide like an old fashioned kind of shirt Doesn t fit at all 
great shoes My husbnad wears these to work everyday He stands on concrete for 9+ hours a day and they are very comfortable The delivery was fast and arrived even sooner than we expected 
Very Satisfied The replacement windows are just what I needed They will let me keep a wallet that I like very much If you need repacement windows for your wallet this is the place to buy fro 
WOW is Right After getting my first turquoise pair I immediately ordered two more colors Good weight well made readers with good lenses 
Excellent I looked beautiful in the dress I would definately recommend it to Plus size women like my self The price was very reasonable 
Lovely Wedding Dress I purchased this wedding dress for My wedding on 4 23 06 It looked good on the website but it blew my mind when I finally recieved it I highly recommend the store and I received my dress in record time 
A comfortable shoe that s becoming extinct Clarks Men s Falcon has been around for years but it appears that the Company in it s questionable wisdom may be discontinuing the line It is very tough to find a retailer with Falcons in the size and width you need This is very unfortunate as the Falcon is comfortable durable and smart looking I became a fan of these shoes the moment I stepped into them they require no breaking in period You put em on and you feel like you ve been wearing them for years They are suitable for every day wear in less than business suit required work environments The Falcon comes in brown and black suede with a leather upper portion around the side and back of the shoe Many newer Clark s seem to be crafted with ugly thick soles and an upturned front A water proofing spray can be applied to the Falcon without marring or significantly darkening its appearance If you can find a pair of these shoes I recommend applying the water proofing it ll add months of wear 
New Wing Air Force Very Impressed I was searching for one in the malls prior to Christmas with no luck Just received this one as a birthday present No disappointments here 
Quality Product My wife loved the bodystocking and I loved the price and reliable shipping 
Wow This is one incredibly sexy piece of my wardrobe Wearing it at the office or out shopping does make me feel naughty but very nice And talk about driving the men crazy they love it It definately sets the mood I love the sheerness and smooth fit I ll be buying more 
sexy stocking This bodystocking has really become prominent in my day to day activities Whether I m wearing it at school or at the home it s become a staple Plus the product name doesn t mince words here this is one sexy bodystocking 
This bodysuit is VERY HOT This bodysuit is very HOT It s comfortable and very flattering to my size 12 figure The openings give the ease of not having to unbutton untie or take anything off It will make you feel just a little naughty and incredibly sexy I was very pleased with my husbands response when I tried it on for him I ve never bought anything like it before I highly recommend it 
Love this bodystocking This is an amazing bodystocking and its one of my favorite pieces of lingerie The exposure obtained with the open cups and the open crotch is perfect we are talking total access The garment is well made and the seams are quite strong but a girl will really appreciate the sensuousness of this exposure suit 
cat interface The shoes are very comfortable and sturdy I bought a pair for work and liked them so much that I bought another pair to wear as everyday shoes I usually go through a couple pair of work shoes each summer and these have lasted me all season Unfortunately they have been discontinued although they can still be found online 
Not for the under endowed this thong only accentuates what you don t have down below 
just love it Just exactly what I excepted Not too formal not too casual Suitable for all the occasions Also it s high quality 
Warm cozy vest good value Very flattering fit not to long and not too short Warm great over a t neck with nice pockets and details such as natural v collar Perfect for chilly nights Looks perfect with my shearling boots tucked into slim jeans Only drawback is faux fur sheds a bit Shake out good prior to wearing 
Awesome Versatile and Beautiful Perfect in Red for Holidays AND Halloween Quickly delivered nicely packaged and will use for many years Great addition to any wardrobe Offered below their competitors prices and very nice Thank you 
Couldn t believe the Quality for the Price We had to outfit an entire group and this Merchant s cloaks we bought from several places prior to our big order were by far the highest quality within the price range They offer lots of colors the crushed velvet is nice and the delivery and customer service excellent Thanks for making our event perfect 
High Quality and can be used for Christmas Dickens too Am using this for Christmas caroling and will be great for next Halloween Valentines and lots of fun Higher quality than anticipated for the price especially Will continue to collect the various colors as they re available 
Incredible Quality for such a Low Price I was absolutely amazed at this quality Yes it is crushed velvet but both my teen daughters and their friends have all used this repeatedly to dress up many costumes and events We will definitely consider more as they add more color options We have midnight blue dark wine black and will be getting red for Christmas Thank you again 
not what I spect the size of the trophy is about 4 cm 1 1 2 inch tall the size of the trophy doesn t appear in the seller s description 
Awesome I got them about a month ago they re really comfortable no blisters and they even have arch support im in love 
Formaggio Parmigiano Cycling Jersey Well made Italian and named after cheese What more could you want IT is a great Jersey But for those of us not quite ready for the Tour de France you have to ask the question when you where it Honey does this make me look fat 
Great fit for my feet I have a very high arch and wear orthotics which will fit into these shoes if I take the insole out When I want the arch area tighter I tighten the elastic straps across the arch The toe box is high enough that your toes are never crunched and it feels like I m wearing bedroom slippers but with great support I ve found that they run a little large I m wearing a 6 1 2 whereas I normally wear a 7 The dark color isn t noticeable like white shoes with dressier pants and I get great traction in the snow Michigan They don t LOOK like athletic shoes the shape is very feminine I looooove these shoes 
Cute little shoes What can I say that the picture doesnt say My son loves them 
Your size is the most inportant Nice and good looking shoe but you have to be sure what your size is or you could be annoyed by unfriendly noise under you feet while you walk 
Great Shoe Have worn Rockports exclusively for 15 years with nary a problem No break in needed Comfortable What more could you ask for 
Comfortable Rockport equals comfortable and light and stylish It is exactly what you would expect in a walking shoe If you have wide feet as I do this is a product you want to try out see the results and stick with it for qualtiy comfort and longevity 
Good once broken in Very comfortable shoe once its broken in Which can usually be said about a lot of shoes Very light on your feet and easy to move around in 
Comfortable and supportive I ve tried many brands of walking shoes over the years with varying degrees of comfort and support I wear walking shoes at least 6 days a week so I need a pair that can last Since I purchased a pair of Rockport last year which I really liked I figured that I would do the same again After having worn the Astride for a good month I was not disappointed I consider Rockport to be one of the best companies when it comes to making quality shoes for a reasonable price I would definately purchase this item again through Amazon 
This is a bra extender The cotton on this is soft not scratchy and the hooks seem to work well I don t need the product anymore not breastfeeding anymore but I may save it in case one of my bras shrink in the wash I bought one in black too and it really helped our budget I did not have to buy a bunch of new bras while I was breastfeeding and had a larger bust circumference for a while 
Great Shoe I bought these shoes last summer and they are great They add just the right amount of sexy to any outfit They make your legs look slender and sexy A great buy 
Top shoes These are the most comfortable wedges I have ever worn The soft lining keeps your feet dry and the wedge height is not a problem I have worn my almost every day and my feet feel wonderfully Highly recommended 
Volatile ankle tie espadrilles LOVE THESE SHOES They are lots of fun to wear VERY comfortable and I have received TONS of compliments on them Buy them 
Port Authority Totes 2 purchased I am pleased beyond belief with this product and very happy indeed to have thought ahead and ordered TWO of them the quality price workmanship and everything about this product is above my expectations and I will look for this manufacturer if and when I have anything in their line of products to insure similar results The description and photo of the tote bag is only HALF as good as the actual tote bag Excellent just excellent 
quality product fast shipment High quality product great customer service fast shipping Only problem was that the sizing was not very clear on the web page but after calling them every thing was fine 
Perfect for Sony T7 This camera case is perfect for my Sony T7 My camera fits snugly into this padded case to prevent shock and damage if I were to drop it It s has a small pocket that allow me to carry two extra memory cards and an extra battery Besides green it comes in two other color blue and orange Price of item is very reasonable So I recommend this item to those who own a very compact camera like the Sony T7 or other Sony T line of digital camera 
Too Cute I love baby clothes I loved to look at baby clothes even when I was not a mother yet When I saw and tached the cutton clothings I went OHHH my baby 
Good quality odd sizing The cotton fabric of these bodysuits is really soft and cool and didn t shrink when washed The only thing I would comment on is the sizing the 0 3 months and 3 6 months bodysuits we ordered were almost exactly identical sizes and it would be hard to tell the two sizes apart without actually checking the label reviewed by the wif 
Nanna Loves I bought this for my Granddaughter that we are expecting in March I couldn t believe the great quality it is for the price Can t wait to see her in it 
AWESOME BABY These shorts are awesome Fit like they are suppose to wish they had more colors thoug 
Terrible service EXTREMELY slow shipping yuck I paid for expedited shipping but my order took forever Communication with the company was unacceptable to say the least At first I received only half of my shipping refund and had to complain to Amazon and BestPriceCenter to get the rest There is NO way I would ever do business with this company again and I would like to urge others to do likewise This is not personal just bad business practice 
Great What a great deal Everything works great it s MUCH cheaper to buy this pack together I was wary at first too good to be true Nope 
Great value For the money the package containing two docking charger multipurpose cables AC and car charger adapters and the silicone skin case was a great deal Overall this was a great buy for me The only criticisms I can make are 1 the skin was a bit thicker than I had envisioned However the slightly thicker form factor my Zen Vision M with the skin is balanced by the added drop protection And 2 the skin covers the lighted blue buttons giving the whole player a slightly less cool appearance Having said that I d gladly make this purchase again given the opportunity 
Fantastic tayloring and perfect fit This is my favorite jean by far Not sure if the above review is even about the same jeans or not These jeans are very well taylored with added features all around The nicest feature is the gusseted crotch which is very comfortable The back pocket trim and leather patch for the front pocket are nice Very deep inside trim on the front pockets never shows And the 5th pocket is very roomy and placed well As for the baggy rear well I am like most guys not having much to sit on and the seat fits me perfect I m average build I think the descriptive pictures above shows this well I have actually been stopped in the office by the girls to comment on how nice they looked The kicker my co worker buddies have even asked me where I got them These are very comfortable and well made I hope Wrangler never changes anything about these jeans They are made for men You should try a pair Not your average jeans Want something really toasty for the winter Check the Thinsulated pair of these jeans out They are great as well 
Nice work jeans I bought these for my husband who is very reluctant to ever buy any jeans other than his Levis 550 s The Riggs workwear jeans are well made and fit ok but there is much room in the seat where most guys don t need it The inner part of the front pockets also show when worn as they just don t stay in place Other than that they have been good jeans so far 
NOT true to size I ordered these shoes in a size 7 because I have another pair of Sodas in a 7 and they fit These shoes are way too small I d say at least a half size too small Be careful to order the right size Apart from that they are SUPER cute and a GREAT shade of red 
Cute but not very comfortable They are adorable shoes but I have some other flats from Soda that are more comfortable I have wide feet though so that might explain why I feel so cramped in them 
Exactly what I was looking for I love the look of the Adidas Gazelles and they are a great knocking around shoe I was specifically looking for the navy blue uppers with the lighter blue periwinkle bottoms and if I had wanted to pay more than double for them I could have bought them in the city where I live But thanks to Amazon I was able to get them at a reasonable price and they arrived promptly I highly recommend these shoes They have a great causal look go well with blue jeans and don t leave your dogs barking after cruising the city all day and night 
Men s Andover Cap Toe Oxford The shoes fit good I ordered 1 2 size larger and he needs to break them in Nice looking shoes and I would recommend them to anyone He has wore them 3 times and he says they feel better 
Very nice shoes I bought these shoes for my 12 year old son They are just right in so many ways The style is simple and masculine he does not like loafers They have enough shine to look dressy but are not glossy like patent leather The soles are leather a detail I have normally seen only on much more costly shoes He also finds them to be comfortable which makes it much easier on all of us on the occasions that he HAS to dress up 
Where has this bra been all my life I ve tried many many many nursing bras and this is BY FAR the absolute best Very comfortable and very flattering compared to other bras that are comfortable but give no support or shape Very easy to use and doesn t create a visible line through my clothes like other bras do I love the padded shoulder straps and stretchiness of the fabric Fabulous 
Not my favorite I found the band underneath the cups rolled under and wasn t very elastic very uncomfortable It fit great when I tried it in the store even had it fit to me by a Medela rep but after a few wearings the band issue just soured the deal Also I had a hard time getting the cup fasteners hooked with just one hand The fasteners are pretty fiddly My favorite bras are by far the Bravado line 
Great bra except Bra is really comfortable and easy to use The material is soft and breathable and it looks good under clothing The only problem is that the shoulder straps are extremely short and cause some ride up I am not long through the shoulder area so any normal length strap would be more than sufficient for me This would be 5 stars if they would lengthen those straps I have another Medela bra in a different style and it has the same problem 
Nothing Compares The BEST nursing bra I own 6 different types of nursing bras but this is by far my favorite It has great support that is long lasting doesn t loosen up Opens easy with just one hand easy release rather than a hook Wide straps are easy on the shoulders although I wish the wide part was a little farther back on the strap If you like to wear wide v necks you might want to wear a different bra though since the straps on this one often show when I wear a very open neck I have slept in this one although it s not the comfy soft type that are best for sleeping I wore this throughout feeding my first baby for 17 months and am buying more for my second baby Nothing compares 
going back for more thorlo socks are wonderful I own a lot of them they last for yearsif taken care of so I wash on permapress and hang to dry just takes a night BEST ADVICE BUY AT LEAST TWO PAIRS AT TIME 
Perfect Winter warmers These socks really keep the heat in your feet without feeling static cling They feel as if they give you a lift in your step Like walking on good thick carpet Purchased these several times never let down by quality 
Good sleeveless tanks hard to find This sleeveless tank from CK is one of the best I ve tried its soft cotton stretches to fit well and is comfortable in cold and warm seasons The stretching quality compensates for the slight shrinkage that happens upon first wash Only downside I see is durability these tanks either lose stretch quality or shape after about a year or two of washing But who said that underwear must last for ever If you know of a better tank I would be happy to hear about it Good tanks are hard to find just like good jeans 
Simple non trendy and full of potential I was never one to wear something other than a baseball hat for the longest time Finally I started branching out and looking at different clothing styles Something that said me but didn t put me into any specific category I found that in hats with the Bailey Wool Felt hat Its comfortable and because of its material you don t have to baby it like some hats If something smashes it down it can easily be reformed back to its original shape The hats style alone does not say cowboy or retired yuppie but has more practicality to it that represents an adventurer or even just an average joe with class Its a working mans hat to wear to town or a city mans hat to wear while relaxing by a stream after a day of fly fishing Make sure to check the sizing chart if you are ordering online I use my baseball caps which have the sizing mark on the inside tag as a reference otherwise it might be best to try one on at the store and make sure it fits I like the way they have various sizes that encompass different exact measurements that way no matter what you ll find the size you are looking for I only say this because with baseball caps I ve had trouble finding the cap I like in the pro back non adjustable size I need I found the drawstring a nice addition but not something I really needed as there are never to high of winds whenever I m wearing mine A nice change of pace and a statement in simple style the Bailey Wool Felt hat is affordable durable and classic 
my little purse I like it It s small but has enough room for the things I need to carry on an everyday basis 
practically perfect in every way we were looking for an insulated bag large enough to hold luncheon salads in a 1 1 5 quart size plasticware container this is one of the largest coolers we found online that was still lunch size Since the salad containers are round the oblong shape of the cooler bag gets distorted but it is still large enough for the salads to fit It has other cute compartments some chilled some not but my family doesn t use these on a day to day basis I think they give extra flexibility to what can be carried though We ordered the same bag in 3 colors one for each person They look as if they will be very durable but we ve only had them a couple of months only negative is that there is not a separate pouch for the ice pack I had hoped with all the compartments in the cooler one would hold the ice away from the chilled food but that is not the case It is not a big deal Just keeps this from being pretty perfect 
The best little lunch bag I bought this bag because I wanted something compact and lightweight It conveniently holds a frozen lunch in the cold section as well as fruit and snack in the non cold section It s the best buy for the money and I love it 
SHOE REVIEW The shoes are comfortable but not for walking long distances They are true to size 
Steelers Received promptly and was very happy with the product Would absolutely order from you again Thanks 
Heely s My grandson has asked for several months for these I finally bought them for him and he loves them 
Great service great shoes great price My son just loves his new Heelys He could keep them to go to bed if I would let him 
Great fun not practical as a shoe While I love these shows when sliding across the parking lot to my car in fact I have them on now they are not all that great when standing for long periods of time I suggest them very durabl 
WOW Great Service I am so pleased with this product My son loves them and I can t brag enough about the lightening fast shipment 
Awesome It s comfortable and sexy I also use it as a nighty to sleep in and not as a slip under clothes 
Wonderful My cousin let me borrow one of these to sleep in one night in Florida absolutely comfortable and the slip wicks away any persperation I could not find them in the store and was thrilled to find them here bought 3 for her and 2 for myself These are my new summer nighties Highly recommend 
Received wrong item I did not receive the correct item I sent the item back for a return The picture shows what I wanted but got something else So I can say I was disappointed I received some kind of chamisole instead 
Really hot Get this for your girfriend spouse significant other and take your sightseeing to anotehr level Excellent CK quality as always 
Three prongs better than two I pruchased both this item and the two prong version I only used the three version as all outlets in Australia are grounded Good and sturdy it performed well My only complaint is that the female end is recessed which makes it difficult if you have a cube tap or transformer to plug in one then has to use an extender with the adapater 
Sleek Sexy and Masculine The 2xist y back thong is one of my favorites I wear them all the time and they are great for everyday If you are looking for minimal coverage something a little sexier but still comfortable and masculine this is it If you haven t tried a thong before you should definitely try these They are designed to fit very well giving great support and lift Perfect for under your workout clothes your jeans or dress pants Don t be afraid to show off a little in or out of your clothes 
Adorable shoe very comfortable I just bought these shoes Adorable and so comfortable Wolverine makes a wonderful product Merrell Hush Puppies Patagonia You can always count on getting quality when you buy these name brands Very classy shoe 
Way Cool Wearing My Favorite Legends I love this shirt It s so cool to wear a great T Shirt that goes along with my all time favorite music and musicians Just my own tribute to the people whose music brings me the MOST joy for over 35 years AWESOME 
led zeppelin t shirt this was a present 4 my boyfriend 4 xmas which he really love 
New Balance 101 Sandals Excellent product using showers after work out Sandals are dry quickly and are sturdy and comfortable 
Great retro shirt that would look fine on either By Tor or the Snow Dog Highly recommended 
Great but slippery I bought these for my daughter she s 16 and working as a waitress she has to wear tennis shoes and ofcourse she has to look cool she loved these so we bought them and when they arrived earlier than expected she couldnt wait to wear them to work that night she said they were comfy and she loved them the only downfall she had was that the bottoms were slick as glass and she just about fell numerous times now before you think they are bad remember she is a waitress the floors are already slippery from grease so I cant blame it totally on the shoe I just wouldnt recommend them for working in a resturant otherwise they are GREAT 
My Standbys wore boxers for a decade before switching to bikinis I love the look and the comfort and support Jockey Elance bikinis were the first I bought and years later they are still what I wear most of all I ve since bought many other styles boxers boxer briefs classic briefs thongs and other bikini styles and brands but it s pretty much the exception to the rule when I wear anything but Jockey Elance Contrary to what others have said they are well made I ve had a number of them for years and they still hold up I also think they are really comfortable Also someone said they are knock off of women s underwear Jockey made men s Elance bikinis long before they made ANY underwear for women However online you can generally only get them in black grey and white which are ok but not the most fun You can get a wider variety of colors at department stores Walmart sells them in a huge variety of colors as the Life brand But a lot better than these are the Hanro Cotton Stretch brief also for sale on Amazon They are better made more comfortable but extremely pricey You can buy about 4 packs of these for the price of one of those 
Very Comfy Shoes These shoes are very comfy This was my first order placed with Amazon and I was amazed at how quickly I received my order and they were exactly what I thought they would be 
CLARKS GLOGS THE CLOGS ARE GREAT IT WAS A VERY GOOD PRICE WHEN I SIGNED UP FOR THE VISA CARD SHIPPED QUICKLY WOULD BUY FROM YOU AGAIN 
chucks r sweet I love these shoes they are durable comfy and cool they dont rip easily and i love them they r sweeeeeeeet 
Comfortable Thong This is a great pair of underwear It is very soft against your skin It doesn t feel like most thongs and ride up on you or give you a major wedgie They are comfortable enough to be worn all day There is enough waist to these that it won t be obvious that you are wearing a thong if your pants droop Enjoy the minimal back coverage that is provided while maintaining the comfort of this underwear as it holds you nicely in place 
Review of Jockey Thong I ve owned several pairs of these for a while now and I have to say that they are extremely comfortable and feel great even when one is exercising at the gym Of all the styles I own these are the most comfortable 
my fav underwear ever I own about 5 pairs of these they are super comfy and feel like you are wearing nothing at all in the back no rididng or wedgies here with good support at the front The fabric allows you to wear them low or high depending on how you feel most comfortable and there is enough fabric at the top so you dont end up with butt floss showing when you bend or sit down Dont just order one pair order a weeks worth you wont regret i 
Awesome This is my first thong and let me tell you I am definately glad I tried these out The fabric feels so good on the skin it s fantastic and you get over the butt strap the minute after you put them on Don t be afraid to wear these in public because there is enough fabric around the waist band to let your pants sag and thus making it look like you re wearing regular underwear Nobody will realize what you re wearing Try these out 
great underwear After buying a pair I purchase more These are the greatest for comfort It is like going without but better 
all the right stuff The reviewer below hit it on the head If you want your boys to ride in comfort all day long and want to not even notice your underwear all day long believe me the thong is a LOT less annoying than either boxer briefs or especially briefs And yeah the wife likes me in em too but the real bonus is the all day comfort Guys you d better try these things Try all kinds but this one is near the top of my list Lots of room and no binding Go slowly buy one thong at a time and make sure it fits before buying moe of the same kind Some fight tight others loose 
Best Kept Secret in the Thong Universe Wow This is the first review of this thong Unbelieveable I am a newbie to the thong market after growing up wearing what my Mom told me to wear cotton briefs tighty whiteys Consider me liberated After going through my initial ordering frenzy of thong underwear much to my wife s you re developing a mid life thong fetish dismay I happened upon these They are what I would consider a contour or pouch style thong and they are hands down the BEST OVERALL THONG I have ever worn They have a cotton mesh pouch sexy but not really see through that is the most comfortable ride my boys have ever had I absolutley love them live in them The Brazilian T back makes the support across the Netherlands all but unnoticeable while the stretchy sides provide frontal support and all around comfort Plus check out the price OMG Anyone who s shopped for a name brand thong knows the average going price is between 15 and 25 dollars At 8 bucks these thongs are unbeatable and if you don t mind the color yellow you can own one for 5 Too good I bought two of every color and am hoping they still make these when those wear out It will be a sad day in the Underworld when these thongs become unavailable Attention atheltes added bonus These are comfortable enough to wear while running jogging or working out The cotton pouch is softer than any jock I ve ever encountered while offering equal support and the lack of those butt straps adds an easy 2 3 mph to my runs Seriously I m sure it s physcological THESE THONGS ROCK Plus she thinks they are way sexy bonus bonus nudge nudge as the pouch was designed and sewn by someone who knows something about the male anatomy and physiology evoking Yeah Baby Yeah from the Mrs Don t miss out on these you ll be sorry 
Extremely comfortable Bought a pair of these a couple months ago The styling isn t too bad but they fit my foot so nice I have since bought 4 more new pairs to have later before they get discontinued everywhere 
T Mac 3 B Ball Shoes These shoes are sweet I also recommend the Garnet B Ball Shoes 
ONE OF THE BEST SHOES the t mac 3 is a great shoe it looks so niceand is very comftorble I have 2 pairs the white and the black becauce i like thoughs more then then the blue and red And just let you guys now the black ones have better traction then the white DA T MAC 3s ARE DA BEST 
Great Shoe I wasnt really sure if I liked this shoe at first but after trying it on i realised just how comfortable and stylish this shoe is This shoe is awesome for basketball and just walking aroun 
New Flight of T Macs The new style of the T macs These are the best They are very comfartable I bought them the day they came out If you are into black then buy them now Because I know they are coming out in White and Blue so they will have the same pattern as last year So if you like black buy now if you like white wait till mid December Otherwise this show is very comfy and better than last year

Invisible Boots Ordered my boots on December 15th of last year Still haven t received them yet One star for the boots looking so good on the Amazon web Minus 4 stars for not being on my feet 
Very Cool I had been looking for a pair of boots for months When I came across these and was very interested in the way the looked I was unsure if I wanted buy these after reading the Elf Shoes comment However I decided to take a chance with them after realizing that finding boots was so difficult in the stores Needless to say I am very happy I bought them as they are very cool and comfortable I have received positive feedback and have NOT been pointed as wearing elf shoes I would of given them 5 stars but there was a blue marking on one of the boots Luckily it was on the shoe wear the average onlooker would not see it But I can 
Great gift Bought it for my wife on Valentines day She loves it Fossil makes great products 
nice socks I bought these for warmth While they feel good my feet are still a little cool when it gets below 30 degrees Also after first gentle hand wash they got a little nappy 
Great Great Jacket It has all I wanted a lot of pockets a fleece sweater that can be separated I loved it 
Exactly what you want in Chinese shoes I wouldn t say these shoes are exactly true to size I m a size 10 and ordered as such however these shoes were a bit snug They stretched a bit but being silk not as much as the 3 cotton variety I d bought at a hippie store However these silk shoes are dressier and sturdier and when they get dirty or smelly you can throw them in the washing machine I m not sure if I was supposed to but I did and they survived good as new 
Good for the beach This shoe works as it is supposed to do I use it because instead of going barefoot when I have to go long distances jog or if I m not sure that there aren t sharp stones shells or chards of glass in the sand or on the pavements close to the beach The only problem is that the fabric material picks up stains easily that do not come off 
I love it I have worn this several times sans bra and find the fit support and comfort to be terrific Surprisingly without underwires which I usually wear or other heavy structuring it manages to lift and hold and I m a b cup I only wish there were more colors 
Not much lift but a lot of riding up What a lift Not exactly I can get away with wearing this without a bra only when I am looking for the tied down look but maybe that s because I normally wear a D cup But I wasn t really looking for a bra substitute I bought this looking for and expecting a control garment to handle the bumps and rolls that ruin the look when I wear a fine gauge swaeter or twinset Not too much to ask and it would have done the job except it rides up something fierce I immediately thought this was because the garment ran small so I bought one a size larger no luck The only way to stop this annoying feature of the undergarment is to tuck it into the waist of a snug fitting skirt or pair of pants and then not to sit down Not so much fun Oh well back to the drawing board 
I LOVE THESE As a late 30 s mom things tend to react to gravity over time and these little camisoles are God s gift to women They literally put everything back where it was originally and make it look better than it did before Total support and slick easy fit make them wonderful under anything and incredibly sexy on their own I have 4 of them and I can t live without them You will NOT regret trying them 
Rider best sandal available This is my second Rider sandal They have a confortable feel padded sole for cushion and are reasonably durable My last pair made it for about 6 years of pretty active use With my bad heels the cushioned stride is great And I ve never found a more comfortable and customizeable fit in a sandal 
Very comfortable dress shoes These shoes are very comfortable I can wear them all day without pain They have rubbery soles that don t make noise when you walk on hard surfaces 
the best these heely s are the best when i first got them i did not know how to heely now i do they are tons of fun i recomend them forshure 
Great Looking Shoe I bought these shoes because I typically find Aerosoles to make a comfortable and stylish shoe However the area directly under the buckle seems very tight and there is stitching that rubs against the top of my foot It s still a comfortable shoe however I have a desk job so I don t have to walk in them all day I love the way these shoes look however I wish that I didn t have to deal with this annoyance 
more good panties from VF I have several pairs of VF panties and they are all among my favourites The material on the lace band panties is not quite so silky or sheer as the lace nouveau which are my all time favourite but they will probably prove more durable Time will tell I do like a little lace on my panties as it adds interest and a classic look This lace waist band though is rather narrow and tends to roll over and become invisible I have owned panties with a wider lace band and quite liked the effect The rear seem is nice as it tends to define my rear cleavage To sum up Good value panties but they usually get passed over when I m dressing for a special event I might wear them to the beach and see what others think of the 
GREAT I really should have bought two one for me and one for my husband I wasn t expecting either of us to get as much use from this jacket as we do It is a wonderful jacket to have in the car for the just in case times Weather here in the midwest is so unpredictable and this jacket takes all the guess work out of what to wear 
christmas present I bought this jacket as a Christmas present for my brother since he was going snowboarding Well the snowboarding plans fell through but he wears it all the time Since being a teenage boy he s not very verbal the best I can say about this jacket is that he didn t want me to return it and said that it keeps him warm I ve also seen him wearing the fleece part alone which he s also said is very warm No technical difficulties with the zippers hood pockets etc 
It s good Actually First time I didn t know clothes quality But now i can say this is awesome don t hesitate just buy it 
Great Hat I bought this hat for myself after I had purchased a smaller one for my toddler I was so impressed with my toddler s hat I live in Arizona and own many hats to keep the sun off of my face This one has a wide brim and it also has a great flap in the back that protects your neck I have other similar hiking hats but only use this one now that I own it 
Very Pleased Great quality sun blocking hat Well made with quality materials I don t spend much time in the sun without it Best of all IT IS MADE IN USA 
Review Tried to purchase this shoe on Eastbay s website but without success Was able to succeed getting the same shoe from Eastbay through Amazon Thank God for Amazon a company that knows ecommerce 
Great pair of runnning exercise shorts I have a pair of adidas mens running shorts I bought about 12 years ago which are still good they have the red stripe on the sides I saw these and the description looked similar so I bought them They are great and keep you cool and dry when exercising I bought 2 pairs with a different color on the sides The factory did ship me a wrong color but I kept them anyway no problem Just check your invoice before you wash them 
Nice Gloves I Like the gloves but agree too many tags at the outside of them and I ll hope a little more quality in the color of the leather used in the side of the palm it is black and at the borders looks like it was used blue 
Black Diamond gloves On the good side these gloves are have a nice look and I like the curved hand design I also like the no slip palm The bad part is that they have tags and stitching and elastic that s exposed on the inside which makes sharp edges that rub on your hands and wrists I consider that a serious design flaw it s very uncomfortable 
nice shoes very reasonably priced My 16 year old loves these shoes Says they are very comfortable and wants me to get him another pair 
ASICS sneakers are great Very comfortable good support Wouldn t buy any other brand of sneaker Helped relieve foot pain almost immediately from wearing other sneakers 
Excellant cushioning shoe I have run in Asics for years I have been very happy with this line of shoe They are light weight and well cushioned for the runner that needs cushioning I run distances of anywhere from 3 miles to 26 2 in these shoes 
Always Asics I ve always liked Asics since the 80 s They just work This model Gel 1100 not my first choice but available in my size turned out to be good It fits well very light heel support is very good and I ve worn it all day at work and it didn t make my feet tired Running with these shoes is very good as well I like it so much I bought two pairs The price is great and the value is unmatched I have other brand of running shoes but this is my favorite Highly recommended and at this price it s a best buy 
BEst running shoe ive ever worn my freshman year i joined cross country and needed some shoes so i immediatly thought nike boy was i mistaken as i soon found out in about a week of running that they sucked and that i needed to buy new shoes so i bought some asics and i before i got asics i had never heard of them but then i bought them and wow were they good they are durable and the gel is awesome it conforms to your foot and i was injury free the rest of the season and beyon 
Great thong Wow this was very comfortable Not sure what the other reviewer was talking about Basically if you want a good thong then this should be a top contender 
Elastic Stretch Belts These belts are great They are especially good for below the waist pants Leather belts don t conform to one s body and look bulky I bought all five colors available and would buy more if they become available Elle 
Just What I Wanted Good belt that looks good and gives the flexibility we wanted 
I love these slippes I odered these slippers using a gift card discount Once I received them I sprayed them with waterproofer and for the most part have barely taken them off I even sleep in them They are so warm and comfortable I don t want to wear anything else My husband is even becoming interested in getting a pair for himself I would reccommend going directly to the Acorn website to be sure of correct sizing since they are unisex all in all I would give them an A++ in comfort and quality 
Great shoe for the price I am really enjoying this pair of shoes They are perfect for work The quality seems great they are very comfortable and they work well with casual and dress suits I ve had them for a little over a month and they appear to be holding up fine For the price they are hard to beat I would definitely purchase this product again 
Best deal and good quality The product was genuine Dockers and very good quality No other store can match these prices I highly recommend this site for dockers shoes 
nice looking at nice price reasonably comfortable shoes that look very nice great value 
Thank you The Urlacher replica jersey that we ordered was delivered quickly and in perfect condition My husband loves it Thank you 
Fast delivery Very Nice I bought this booties for the gift of my friend s baby I am very glad that she really likes this one Good quality Fast delivery Great 
A shirt that FITS This cotton shirt is ideal if you are looking for comfortable fit and style at the same time 
BCBGirls Leather pump This shoe is stunning I am a bit disappointed however that the shoe seems to run slightly big one 1 2 size smaller would have fit me perfectly The navy blue is a very dark shade but still distinguishable from black It seems that fashionable shoes in navy blue are hard to find but this one is exceptional 
i liked t very much My wife and I ought this bag for our little girl It came in a perfet state and we recommend you to buy it 
Great rolling bag Bought this for my 5th grade daughter She loves the bag and it is fairly stable as it doesn t seem to tip over sideways easily Only complaint is that Snaredrum Grey color is much lighter than we had anticipated and after a couple of months of daily use it is getting pretty dirty 
Great and roomy bag I really like this bag I use it for school but it can be a bit bulky so I could use it for overnite trips too Very durable and a great price on Amazon it costs 80 00 at the local Sports store 
Nice I was surprised at the quality of this skirt It is well made and fits nicely washes without wrinkles or shrinkage I didn t put it in the dryer 
Outstanding Product company and most of all customer service is above reproach I received my jersey in record time needed to exhange it for a different size and still got it in time for my daughters birthday Will definitely do business with them again 
These are wonderful These are everything I hoped they would be and I especially like the soles on them The soles are waterproof and grip the floor stairs nicely I think they will last a good long time and were only 20 
Moc Slippers I have M D and have a very difficult time finding shoes and slipper that fit properly and are comfortable These are great I even wear them to go shopping They are easy to get on and off and stay on when I manage to walk Love them 
Best slippers I ve owned Aside from the fact that I mistakenly ordered the green ones and they re VERY green these slippers are the best They are soft and cushy and warm fantastic to put on after ten hours of high heels and you ll forget you re wearing them Sometimes I just want to wear them to work The suede is good quality and the fleece lining is just right I m thinking of ordering another pair to have on hand if these wear out or somehow get ruined 
Great slippers These are so comfortable When I took them out of the package they looked long and narrow and I didn t think they would fit I tried them on to walk around in them An hour later I d completely forgotten they were on my feet and that I was supposed to be testing them Another reviewer was right when she he said they conform to your feet Definitely recommended 
great mocs nice color comfortable nice fit i have wide feet but even though this isn t a wide it makes room for my feet the first time i put them on they seemed tight but after wearing them a few times they conform to my feet now and they are very comfortable you can make short trips outdoors in them too since they have sturdy but flexable soles i love them 
Lands End Suede Moc Slippers The slippers were of very good quality and Lands End shipped them to me very quickly I have only two very minor concerns One is that the soles of the slippers were a little thinner more flexible than I would have liked The other is that the slippers don t come in 1 2 sizes I normally wear an 8 1 2 shoe and with this type of slipper I usually buy a size 8 Because the sole curved up over the front I found the slipper to be a bit short However I know that the 9 would have been way too big Over time the slipper did stretch a bit so it is more comfortable now than it was when new 
I love the Tigers I love the detroit tigers this is a good buy for any baseball fan its cheaper here then in stores 
These socks ROCK These socks are awesome I LOVE how soft and cozy they are Yes they shed a bit and the first time you wear them you ll get little fuzzballs under your toes but I have remedied this by washing them inside out first then outside in and the problem is solved These wear extremely well One year after buying wearing these socks they are still in great condition and as soft as day one Gave them as gifts this Christmas with rave reviews I highly recommend these fabulous socks 
they shed yecch The black velour socks Keep your vacuum cleaner handy if you buy these They shed all over the place while you re wearing them The first wearing I wore them at home with sandals and kept noticing black fuzz all over the house Finally I realized the socks were the source of the mess I took the socks off and the bottoms of my feet were black and furry This was a waste of 8 dollars 
Rich looking beautiful functional I previously used one of those carabiner type keychains because I liked being able to easily remove multiple keyrings as needed However I had problems with keyrings occasionally falling off of it when the clasp somehow was activated Enter the Snaplink a low tech form meets function solution It s more secure than the carabiner though a bit more work to remove a ring kind of like unlatching your belt The leather is absolutely beautiful and clearly very high quality The spring loaded clip on the other end is extremely almost too strong 
Cool Key chain I love the Italian Leather Key Chain it is made very sturdy and you can either clip it to your jeans or your bag for easy access It also is a very classy sharp looking leather strap it looks expensive and the price is right 
Great buy Very good quality looks better than the picture snaplink is sturdy and heavy beautiful leather I got a tan one 
Not just stylish useful I have a black one Besides looking cool and the nice belt buckle design this key chain is made with good materials The Italian leather smells great the snaplink is really strong yet easy to open when necessary It cut down in the number of times I went searching for my keys The belt buckle is actually functioning and it locks 2 key rings This means that you can fairly quickly remove or add key rings That is low tech at its best I would recommend it as a gift for men 
Good Seller Fast shipping product neatly packed and as advertised Would buy from again Recommended 
great quality These were much nicer than I expected Very cute and classy including their fabulous packaging I ve already received several compliments on these shades after just 2 3 wearings 
Cheap Pretty thin not well made will not last long Other than that I really liked the 
Beautiful and comfortable These shoes are very pretty and they didn t hurt my feet at all after wearing them for 6 hours at a holiday dance I purchased them in black and they ll be versatile enough to wear for formal or everyday occasions They are well made and I feel that I got them at a bargain price especially with the 20 discount offer I am debating on buying another pair in a different color 
long sleeve button up shirt I was satisfied in the matter of time that I received the shirt It s a great shirt 
Bali Seamless Minimizer Underwire Bra 3364 32DD Light Beige Sizing was a little off making the bra a little tight I feel it will relax and fit perfectly after a few wearings 
Bali Minimizer Bra I love this bra except the underwire can be uncomfortable by the end of the day 
Sexy bottoms I love these for my husband I got them for a cruise we are going on next year They look so sexy on him and they are comfortable for him WE LOVE THEM 
Great for those with arthritis or other hand issues I ve bought several of these and have replaced all the laces in all my shoes they are awesome I highly recommend these 
secure without tightness These work wonderfully on my walking shoes With ordinary inelastic laces there s always local tightening when the foot is flexed I was so accustomed to it I wasn t aware that it was happening With these laces however that local pinching goes away Previously I d not regarded that local pinching as a problem Now that I ve experienced its absence I ll not want to return to it I ll be adding laces like these to hiking boots 
Perfect Perfect What can you say about perfect Seams sewn well elastic stitched properly fabric very comfy against skin Nothing bites you anywhere Fabric seems to be thicker in the crotch area as is needed Color doesn t fade with washing They do shrink when washed the first time but this is allowed for in sizing Order your correct size and they will seem a bit loose before they are washed after that they fit exactly to size chart I m getting another 6 pair I like them so much and I wish Jockey had a matching sleep bra 
My husband loves em My husband and I are getting along great these days We just had a baby about six months ago and I m now getting into the whole new groove I got the special nursing bras from here and they have helped sooooo much And I got the New Sex Now dvd also which has rekindled that special spark which had been missing And one day last week after we had spent the afternoon together enjoying the New Sex Experience my hubby said to me You know Sue you have such a cute butt and I love the way it looks in those black panties They re just so simple and low key you re not trying to prove anything or show off you re just being you and I love you 
Hot socks Finally socks that stay up without making dents in your legs These are great for work outs or just walking around and shopping in slacks and loafers Ideal for us seniors 
Excellent I bought 6 for my daughter and all my nieces and they are happy with it Excellent quality excellent price 
comfortable The bra is very comfy It s thin so nursing pads can be seen in certain clothing But over all great and a great price 
Comfortable and Great Value This is a great nursing bra I have no trouble opening and closing the bra with one hand and it is very comfortable It is very soft but still provides good support The washing instructions say to hand wash in cold but I have washed it on the delicate cycle about 6 times and it looks great I am so happy with my purchase I am buying another one right now 
Good bra This bra is surprisingly good quality considering the low price My only complaint is that when the clasps in the back are on the last ones when it s clasped to stretch widest the clasps rub against your back and are somewhat painful 
Best Bra Ever I absolutely love this bra It is so comfortable you hardly feel that you are wearing a bra at all yet you are supported in all the right areas It has just enough stretch in it for those days when you a little fuller than others It s super soft and feels great against the skin This bra is also very durable I wasn t sure if I was going to continue nursing when I firsy had my baby This the only bra I had and wore it every day As you can imagine it had to be washed almost every day as well I did this for about 3 months and the bra was still in excellent condition I finally bought more of these bras 
Good fit Fits perfectly and the hold lasts all day doesn t loosen up Wouldn t recomment sleeping with this bra on 
Simple and good Fits your needs as a nursing mom Cotton is soft Thickness of material is adequate and so far it has stood up through many washings 
Supportive and comfortable These bras are great value I find them comfortable and supportive They are also easy to open with one hand 
Wave Creation 8 Great shoe for supinators I strongly recommend for people that train 3 times a week around 20miles per week I really satisfied with the product I used to have a Asics This Mizuno is lighter and I felt it is not hurting my knee as Asics did Great purchase 
Fantastic cushioning ride and comfort I am a big heavy runner and a bodybilder 215 pounds with high arches and a neutral stride running 20 35 miles per week My needs are for a neutral shoe with a lot of cushioning I have tried a lot of different shoes Asics Gel Nimbus 7 Nike Air Max Tailwind Adidas Adistar Cushion Brooke Epiphany etc etc and these are simply the best shoes I have ever owned Light weighted soft riding very confortable and keeps your feet dry from sweating These shoes have simply been perfectly comfortable from the first day on I m impressed Highlly recommended 
Not bad Bought a bandana that if memory serves was not clearly marked as a costume item So it s a little different than I expected but it s not necessarily bad Shipping etc werew great 
great undershirts This keep their shape the best and now have the label printed on the shirt instead of a tag So much more comfortable 
Great for the price Can t go wrong here this set up does not require the Zen docking hub to charge so you can leave that on your computer s USB port 
Fast Charger I needed a car charger for a long trip for my creative zen and at the creative store this charger was more expensive This charger came with a home charger as well and it chargers 10x faster than plugging into the computer I love it 
Excellent Articles The Chargers work fine with my Zen Vision M 60GB I don t any problems and both chargers charge as promised Good choice if you consider to buy some chargers at low price 
Good Choice Both of these work great as they should since they are only chargers I recommend to anyone who has compatible devices 
Great Running Shoes These shoes are light and offer just the right amount of support 
Love these shoes I have worn Sauconys for years and this is my most comfortable and supportive pair yet 
good fabric lt lt lt really like the shirt fabric is pretty thick and substantial only complaint is i wish the shirt was a little longe 
Headband Sand Village It was exactly what my son wanted The only problem that I found was the metal on the headband edges were not smooth My son cut his hand when grabbing the headband without grabbing the material with it 
distressed Keds I bought for my daughter and I like them but they were not exactly what she had in mind 
Red star t shirt I bought this item for my son and he likes it a lot He said everytime he wears it he gets complements on it 
A great hat This hat is very well made Sturdy yet pretty My 6 1 2 year old loved getting it for Christmas Probably not for really little kids because if you crush it it might not recover But perfect for a fairly responsible 5 year old and up 
Pink Western Cowgirl Hat My Granddaughter loved the hat And I was so glad to find one in Pink for her 
The most adorable hat for a little girl We purchased this size small hat for our soon to be 4 year old daughter The fit is perfect for a small child and even allows for room to grow since it has the elastic band inside I can see her still wearing this at age 6 or 7 even The material is stiff but it IS a straw cowgirl hat My husband s cowboy hat is the same way and is also a straw hat If you want soft material your best bet is a crushable fleece one We were thrilled it matches her boots and saddle perfect 
Top notch product from Adidas This track jacket is by far the best jacket I ve bought from Adidas The fabric is of good quality and the logo is great I ve gotten complements from friends and strangers about it so It s very amiable Only thing I was a bit distressed about was that the color orange one is stronger than on the Amazon com picture so you will stick out in a crowd 
Great Set Girls this is a great lingerie set The feel and fit are supurb the panties are almost like second skin Very true fit Very sexy too Highly recommended to please you and your partner 
Cute reasonably priced and they get the job done I love these rain boots My daughter and I enjoy puddle stomping and these keep her feet truly dry The handles to help her pull them on are a thoughtful touch and they are sufficiently girly to encourage her to wear them I ll be purchasing the next size up when she outgrows these 
perfect boxers absolutely the best excetp for the thick waistband but that s a small shortcomeing 
Wow Pretty dammm Hot pair of boots the buckles could have been a little longer for my calfs God I love these boots Simply the best 
poor sizing I am a 6 1 female and ordered a size 12 The actual shoe part fit fine however I could have fit both legs into one boot The sizing was utterly ridiculous You will also be charged 20 restocking fees for any returned merchandise Don t waste your time 
A pair of shoes for all occasions I have to completely agree with the review by Cary Babka Bookworm in Chief These are the best shoes I ve ever worn before Period I have worn my pair for several years I wore them daily while walking everywhere I went in Europe Then I wore them daily while walking miles a day in the advertising business These shoes have never let me down The only thing I had to replace was the shoelaces one time I never felt out of place wearing these shoes Never did I feel that I was too formal in these shoes nor too casual when meeting clients or attending formal dinners My so called casual sneakers got demoted to strictly playing tennis after I bought these shoes As for the comfort my feet have probably been spoiled because of these shoes Even if I have to work 16 hour days my feet are still fine For as much as I ve worn these shoes and worked 80 hour weeks in them the shoes still don t have an odor to them other than that of well worn leather and it s barely discernable I ve never applied anything to the shoes save for shoe polish I m having to buy my second pair now because my first pair I ve worn out after owning them for almost 5 years The top of the shoes are fine only minor abrasions are visible if I don t polish the shoes once in a while It is the soles that are wearing out I ve worn them down to almost nothing I was very lucky to discover Bostonian and I believe I ll never have to hunt for comfortable shoes again that also look great 
LOVE THEM These boots are so comfortable I can wear them all day And actually I wore them all week one time since they go with almost everything I never wear the same shoes twice in the same week but they are so comfortable 
BOYS SLIPON BY KENNETH COLE GREAT SHOE THE LEATHER IS REALLY SOFT AND THE SALE PRICE WAS WONDERFUL A REALLY GOOD DEAL 
True Champion Bra First of all I ordered 2 However I only receieved one The bra is very good item It truely delivers It is ashame I was only able to receive one However It is a good product I would recommend it to anyone 
Love Them I have these shoes also in black pink and white I found them to be really comfortable I have a narrow foot and they fit me fine They tend to be a little stiff when you first get them but once you break them in you can t live without them 
New Navy White Nautical Short Set with Hat 12 M This suit is put together very well Since the great grandson has a daddy as a marine lol Great grandpa is a navy man Thanks Love it 
Color s My Male Color Chart does not have Lapis or Heather so I am unsure what color I am ordering It would be very helpfull to have the colors next to the names in future products 
Great to lounge in I have had this item for a few months now it is great anytime that i don t feel like getting dressed to lounge around the house 
I love my shoes I purchased these shoes after seeing how cute they were on Sarah Jessica Parker I love them Not only are they super cute they are actually pretty comfortable I am so pleased with this purchase 
Poor fit and uncomfortable save your money First of all the size chart is way off I ordered size 9 men s 10 women s for my husband who wears size 9 but he could not even put them on I tried the slippers myself I wear women s size 9 and even though there was still some space for probably half a size length wise they were way too narrow even for me Both upper and sole material is very tough unflexible and as comfy as cardboard I could not walk in these slippers only drag or slide my feet Inside wasn t as soft as in my LL Bean sheepskin slippers On top of that I had to pay to return this item to Amazon there is no does not fit return reason 
Sizing Too Small I order this shoe in a size 9 it fits and feels like an 8 1 2 I wonder what happened I also order the Black and Tan both fit and feel like a 9 What happened 
Love Them These are very comfortable shoes and very stylish I have gotten many compliments on them 
Love the shoes I love the shoes Aerosoles makes a great product I did not like the white stitching down the front of the shoes but it was an easy fix with black shoe polish I enjoyed the shoes so much that I bought a second pair 
Aerosole shoes I love the shoes I ordered I Am a huge aerosole fan and these are no exception They are comfortable and look great I am very happy with them 
pretty boot definitely like this boot it does run small around the calf i have small calf and it fits like a glove Really nice and sexy to be worn with skirt Good quality and pretty boot definitely worth to buy 
Fast service I have ordered this product twice and both times I have been very satisfied with how quickly it was processed and shipped as well as with the product itself 
Great Item Perfect fit This carrying case is exactly that A Carrying Case and has enough space for 3 games + cleaning cloth The LCD protectors are pretty difficult to use but this set for the DS lite is perfect in fitness and price This set is necessary for th DS Lite 
Finally A case my kids will use This is the first case for a hand held game that my kids really use Holds their games ds and has a carabiner they can hook on their belt loops The LCD protector sheet didn t last as long as I thought but the case was worth it 
Great case for the money This case works fairly well Since it s a semi rigid case it helps keep your gear from being pressed on too much when thrown in a bag or backpack I wish there was a bit more padding on the inside and that the corner didn t press on the L and R buttons as much but that s not too big of a deal You can fit two 3 game slim cases in the top pouch and still close the case Three is too snug There is no place for the charger so you ll have to carry that elsewhere All around a well made case for a reasonable price 
better than most I bought the Bravado nursing bra because it is recommended for large chested women It s definitely comfortable and I don t mind the snaps at all all of my nursing bras have some sort of snap or hook because of the support I need The price is a little high but I didn t give it five stars mainly because the snaps are very visible through clothing whereas other closures are much more discreet 
Okay but really not worth the money During my pregnancy I rushed out and bought two of these bras after having them recommended by several people All I can say is I don t understand what all the fuss is about It s basically a very tight sports bra with snaps My daughter is now three months old and I find that I wear the Bravados only when my 12 Motherhood Maternity sleep bras are dirty I love the Motherhood bras though I wear the sleep bra all day long They are much softer easier to get on and off and the cups just pull down instead of snapping Even with the Bravado I just pull the cup down instead of snapping it because it is so cumbersome to re snap I won t be buying anymore Bravados I ll stick with the Motherhood bras or a cheap regular sports bra from now on 
Great shoes just what I wanted These are comfortable durable attactive shoes at a good price Just right for the office I m glad I made the right choice 
pretty good i love the style of this shoe however it is not as comfortable as i was expecting being clarks there isn t much arch support if any and the ball of my foot hurts after about 5 hours of working they are great for milling around on errands but not for long work days still i love the way it looks 
A good quality jacket I was surprised at the quality of this jacket I have always thought windbreakers were flimsy but this one was built pretty well 
Wrong item shipped I ordered a waterproof windbreaker they sent a zip front hooded sweat shirt I needed the item for a trip where I anticipated a lot of rain and I didn t have time to reorder I returned the wrong item and went with what I had which wasn t the right thing either but it was better than what they sent I m not happy 
This is the ultimate in comfort and performance I ve been wearing these shorts for over 15 years and can t say enough good things about them I use them as casual wear while at home to sleep every night to go jogging and for swimming They are quick drying when wet few hours at most ultra lightweight and the most comfortable thing to wear I suggest you order up one full size unless you want a snug fit After the inside mesh wore out some 10 years after I purchased my first ones I can still wear them with underpants Air dry them after washing and they basically last forever 
Just Right The style and material is just what I was looking for in swim trunks not long and baggy 
I am very satisfied The umbrella is everything I was hoping it would be After using this umbrella no other umbrella would do for me anymore Its automatic open feature opens fast despite its big size The layers of silver coating repels the heat and the light from the sun considerably more so than all the other umbrellas I have used in the past I can not leave home without it It easily and neatly folds so it is no hassle to put it inside my handbag wherever I go I am getting 2 more for my children 
amazon com to my rescue It came at the right time I was searching for wallets on line when I decided to check out amazon com Well to my amazement there was exactly what I had been looking for the zippered wallet with a snap closure change pocket inside The wallet is great have been putting a little mink oil on it in an effort to soften leather It would be nice if it had more card slots but overall I am very satisfied Gotten a lot of positive coments on my wallet like the added little security of the zipper closure Anyway thanks again and to think that I all I needed to do was check Amazon com first to locate those hard to find items 
comfort The shoes are a replacement for a pair I had 20 years ago Although a different model they are close to the original For thank I am thankful 
Reebok Mens Classic Leather Shoe Black Great pair of shoes which I find very useful and wear them all the time They even look great when worn with a suit which makes the hassle of dressing up a lot less of a tas 
Great Comfort Have often had a problem in the past with slippers that stretched out too much and or made my feet sweat but these fit well and are comfy without being overly warm So happy with them I bought a pair for my partner who is also very happy with them

Great product great price great color This is a great Beanie nice and short so it just covers your ears but not too short Also great quality and great price too I would buy more if I needed more but this is already my 4th Beanie and so that s enough for now Sam Kochel p s if you see me on the street and I am wearing my Beanie just say Hi and I ll know what your thinking nice Beanie 
Why Buy One Pattern Orvis must employ some high priced copy writers for their catalogues because their customarily high priced clothes need all the sales acumen money can buy and perhaps Orvis passes their salaries on to you Hence their why buy one pattern when you get get more pitch In any event if you can t get a sale item that you like better than this at Orvis com you ll at least feel you got a halfway decent price for this thick warm and surprisingly good looking sweater While not made in Ireland it has that sheep yarn crofter whiskey handmade look and you can lie about its origin with ease THe medium heft fits its design and function and the colors coordinate well You will not look garish or overdressed In short it s one of their few patchwork type items that really works another being the Irish cap For examples of this concept taken to a ridiculous extreme look for the patchwork Madras as just one example While you re at it find the corduroy pants with the dogs on it It s country gentleman on steroids the Hamptons after a few too many ethanol teas But this is a good one you ll like it PLease note two things THe back is not patchwork but a tan beigy solid that s ok and while it s machine washable it s best to hand dry it or dry clean to prevent shrinking and wear 
My 6 years old daughter Love it My 6 years old daughter was so excited when she saw the heelys box My surprise was that she start to heel one hour after she open the box We are so excited just like her 
One of my favorite panties Vanity Fair has a number of nice panties but I like these best There made of a very nice nylon that is soft yet strong and long lasting They are cut full enought so the fit is good and the sizes run true I wish more colors were offered but I still enjoy what they have 
very comfy panty Great fitting panty for everyday wear wont ride up or show lines stays nice wash after wash highly recommend to try 
Warm Bath Robe I bought this gift for my friend and she loves it Thanks again 
Comfortable stylish shirt This is a comfortable shirt I also like the style of it Excellent for either when going to the golf range or golf course 
belts with a little give excellent product hard to find in stores quick delivery great price today comfort tomarrow diet 
Intermediate exercise shoe This is a fun shoe to wear for intermediate exercise such as Pilates It is comfortable provides cushioning like a gym shoe and is much more stylish than a regular gym shoe I also wear them when I want a dressier shoe but am going to be on my feet for awhile 
It s another Sweatshirt but so soft Pretty much two things make people recognize me my headbands and hoodies Both of which are Adidas and always match White black Adidas sweatshirt = white black head band Red white sweatshirt = red white head band orange white hoodie orange white head band etc etc etc At first it was out of practicality exercising etc but with the head band well the story behind that is that I was too cheap to buy a new set of head phones for djing and the speaker of the left side broke off leaving it lose Great for djing but the remnant of the plastic was rather uncomfortable right behind your ear So I had a headband on one day and I got to keep using my old rag tag headphones that I loved so much I ve since stopped being so cheap and got a new set As for why the Adidas hoodies they re just so incredibly soft and comfortable I like them more than the Nike ones and then I think they re just a bit more stylish This though is a great sweatshirt Very warm very soft and pretty cool clors I have the cream red colored one and wear it loads even though there isn t a matching head band for it yet Drawstring s good pocket s big what more can you ask for A bit expensive which is a shame because you know it will be 20 at TJ Maxx next winter But still I like mine 
Excellent shoes enough style for events and more than enough for an office Keeping it short I am very happy with these shoes the style is excellentwith jeans or with trousers and they fit my narrow feet very well They have great support for such a light shoe and are well made I am often complimented for these shoes My only gripe is that the leather is wearing near the soles and at the back noticablly starting to rub out the PUMA marque 
Great for the gym I used to have one of these when they were popular in the 70s and kept my copy of my house key in it when out playing with my friends Now it is perfect for my Nike+ipod and my gym key and money while I am working out 
Great Socks too Love these socks because they fit a women s foot so well Use to be able to buy in shoe store now have to buy online Order was orderly and on time 
I love it and so does my boyfriend P This was my first time ordering something like this and I was concerned that I would get the wrong size since I am also a medium but everything fits perfect for me Contrary to the review below me I personally like the material I find it quite comfortable It s lacy like and frilly and not only looks sexy but makes you feel sexy The shipping was lighting fast as well I will definately order from this company again = 
Not what you think it is The material this is made out of is very uncomfortable my normal size for everything is medium but this is not a medium watch how you size yoursel 
OK It is just fine not prefect for 2nd Gen But must have it to keep out of scatches and damages 
Worth It Do yourself a favor and don t use your iPod Nano until you purchase and put in place protective films I ve used my iPod nano for about 6 months and it already shows the wears and tears of average use I am using the protective films now to prevent any further abuse but I wish I would have used them from the beginning When applying the films it s slightly hard to get them centered If you mess up you can take them off and re apply them however Applying them takes great care cleaning the iPod making sure the films are centered getting the air bubbles out etc If you take the time to do it your iPod Nano will stay beautiful for a lot longer 
Give the 5 0 a hi five I can t say enough of about this beguiling tee What it lacks in bells and tassles it makes up for with simple comfort and admiring glances My favorite item for late night jogs in the hood Laurel82 
The BEST solution to fallen bra straps This is simply the best invention It is simple and comfortable I had to deal with the fallen strap problem for years before I got this item I am glad that someone has invented it 
Must Have Product I ve actually had The Strapper for a few months now and have been using it more and more You don t even know your wearing the thing Can t praise it enough and the price is right too 
A really comfotable sandal No break in comfort from the first wearing I recommend them highly 
Most comfortable slider available I have tried the Columbia Slider the Reebok Slider Sketchers Slider Nike slider and always come back to the Columbia I shop for them on sale year round We live in a city where it s warm ten months out of the year so we live in our sandals I have a pair of these on my feet now and two new pairs still in the boxes in my closet I love these sandals Pros mold to your feet slip ons can be dressy or casual Cons even though they are advertised as having anti smell soles they stink After wearing them for about a month the soles smell awful My family call these sandals your stinky sandals They complain when I take them off because they reeeek of sweaty smelly feet Remedy Refresh RX foot power this stuff will get rid of any smelly foot odor in any shoe I hope Columbia never stops making this slider I just wish they didn t smell of sweaty feet so fast 
great shoe I bought this shoe for my husband who has big wide feet They fit him great No break in required Unique pair of shoes for men 
Very good looking The only thing about this extra cushioned sneaker is that the regular width fits better a narrawer foot I wouldn t recommend it if you are at the upper side of the regular or if your ankle is not that slim The length of the shoe is true to size 
great For a person with metal allergies this ring was a must have I ve received a lot of compliments on i 
Great Watershoe Nice water shoe Made very well Great looking Very pleased with my purchase 
Cudas Hydrosox comfortable watershoe slipper gadabout shoe I like to use aqua shoes as houseslippers but they ususally have black rubber soles that leave ugly marks on the floors I took a chance on ordering Cudas Hydrosox hoping for reasonable quality and fit and non marring no slip soles And that s what I got These are pretty sturdy and they fit better than any of the several other brands I ve had They re extremely comfortable and they look good The soles are durable almost clear latex composition very nonslip totally non marring These are sturdy enough to use when driving I wear them on short errrands the coffeeshop supermarket etc I say 4 stars not 5 only because nothing is perfect whereas I d rate all the other brands I ve tried as no better than 3 stars 
Perfect for Men Women My Feet Are in Heaven My husband bought me a pair of these Minnetonka Pile Lined Indoor Outdoor Slippers so that I would stop stealing his outdoor slippers everytime I needed to take the dogs out smile and these slippers are AMAZING The insides are so soft that it s like being in foot Heaven and they are extremely well made Plus although it says that these are Men s slippers the style is such that it could easily be worn by both men women alike Overall I would highly recommend these slippers to anyone who is looking for a slipper that it s both well made super comfortable You really can t go wrong with these Minnetonka s 
The Skinny Skinny Rails are perfect for those of us who like tight jeans from top to bottom Very narrow at the bottom but fine over sneakers If you re not self conscious about your skinny legs these are the jeans for you Spandex gives them the stretch that make them very comfortable even though they re tight They did not shrink during first wash Great dark color Perfect for the anti baggy guy 
Heavy Duty Footwear Budget Jungle Boots Avalible From Constant wetness is the main problem in the jungle with the need for ankle support and protection from sharp sticks and rocks With rubber soles these boots keep out water from damp ground while allowing the feet to breath through the canvas uppers After wading a river the action of walking squirts water out of special steel vents in the instep The cleats are wide and deep for good grip on wet ground This is very good boots 
Good for work boots My husband wears these as his work boots in the kitchen we had to add some insoles for more comfort but they are holding up well and he really likes the 
Snowboard Pants Poor quality for the price The material was not very water proof and was the type that would easily fray On a positive note the company was easy to deal with and we were able to return easily 
Daughters Favorite My daughter just loves quick silver products and this T shirt brought a big smile to her face It washes well she wears it all the time Thank Yo 
I Love These Hats As before I am NOT A BILLBOARD I want a hat that doesn t advertise just protects me from the sun and is comfortable and this is it Thanks I ll be back 
My Favorite Style for Hats I am NOT a billboard for advertising I want a comfortable hat for everyday use as well as recreation and this is it Couldn t find one hat locally that didn t advertise something These hats are comfortable good looking and practical I ll be back for more in the future Thanks 
I love this dress Hi Im looking for a gold gown to wear to my friends party and this dress is PERFECT I saw a dress just like this on another site for 250 It looks just like the dress Kate Hudson wore in How to lose a guy in 10 days 
I love New Balance 574 Suede I love these shoes They are so comfortable and go with practically anything The are so cute I want to buy every color avaible 
very happy with my new shoes they arrived much sooner than i thougt possible they look very nice very stylish wonderfull to wear and they weigh allmost nothing fit me rerfectly too i will definitively buy more new balance shoes from this seller 
I Love These Shoes I have been wearing New Balance Women s 574 Suede Leather sneaker for the last three years I love them for the variety of colors and for the fact that I don t look like every other person walking down the street I love and value my individuality as well as my feet These shoes definitely combine comfort and fashion 
DON T BOTHER Even though I have no issue with the seller they shipeed really quickly I ll tell you definitely don t waste your money on this garbage I bought a pair for a trip to Tahoe recently and before I even made it to the FIRST RUN the zipper split Got it back together and held for the rest of the day Second day I hadn t even made it up the first ski lift and the zipper broke again permanently this time Nothing like skiing with your bibs open all day Upon returning to the lodge I found out one of the seams on the inside had split too Promptly threw the pants out after that no sense in re packing them for another cross country flight Spend your money elsewhere instead of throwing it away on these pants 
Apepazza Regal Tall Boot Review Sizing seems to be about right although they are a little narrow at the ball of the foot I ve had them for a couple of weeks and they re breaking in nicely and have stretched where they were a little tight at first Being lined with leather helps this They seem to be good quality and are very beautiful Also note they are a little looser around the calf than some still wearable with a short skirt but also workable for putting jeans inside them perfect really I love them 
Beautiful Boots Wonderful price and great looking boots The energy expended going through hundreds of pairs of shoes and boots was well worth the puchase 
Bra I seldom get pulled in by brand names and initally balked at the cost of this bra I ve since bought several more Thankfully with this one there s zero chafing for me That s not the case with others The cross over straps are padded which is perfect for long runs Everything holds in place and there s no squishing or bouncing going on The fabric wicks beautifully If I were to redesign this bra I would bring the hook closure to the front instead of the back 
Comfy Warm Slippers These slippers are thick fuzzy and very warm The cuff folds up to keep your ankles as cozy as your toes They have rubber non slip bottoms so that you can go out for the Sunday paper without having to put on your shoes The price is more than reasonable for this much quality not to mention having a choice of lovely feminine colors I would recommend these to any one 
perfet GOddess Smooth Bridal Strapless Merry Widow Corset Style 710 is a perfet strapless have not seen the type since i have been wearing Strapless is confortable fitted and perfet but the price and the shipping money is on high side if something can be done for the price to come down littel i will apprecate it and i will order all the color of it Thanks Aben 
I like it I really like the dress It stretches and fits very nicely only thing that I didn t like were the panties that came along with it but I plan on getting some to go with it so it still looks cute sexy I have the white one and I will get the black one also I think that its a good buy 
Not made for a plus size Why do some companies seem to think that simply adding more fabric will make something fit a bigger woman It was too short didn t flare out at all in the skirt and the halter part was so long that it sagged and so thin that my chest fell out the sides I specifically looked at the models shown to make sure my chest would fit into it and the model in white showed that it would but it didn t I suggest buying this only if you are flat chested and want something cut to the navel in front which exposes your rear I almost believe this was designed for the sole purpose of making heavy women cry into the mirror It is possible to make flattering plus size lingerie but I don t think this company knows how 
Stay Warm During the Winter This product is top of the line and very warm The quality it very good and the product is very durable I bought it for my 14 yr old son and it is withstanding the abuse that a teenage boy can put it through I am very pleased with this jacket 
Versatile product quick delivery This sleek and easy to install little pouch works great I ll admit I originally tried placing the sensor under my shoelaces Unless you like interrupting your run every five minutes to go searching for your missing sensor the shoe pouch is definitely the way to go The best part is that it s versatile I can move it from my Asics running shoes to my Keen trail running shoes in a matter of seconds Distance accuracy is spot on Service and delivery times from Grantwood were excellent I got the pouch in a matter of days If you re not a fan of Nike shoes and want an inexpensive but well designed solution I would highly recommend this product 
It Works Just like any apple product it was easy to set up cool to use and has motivated me to loose weight I m up to 10 lbs so far 
Works Great The shoe pouch works great on both my asiacs and Pearl Izumis I havent had any trouble calibrating or anything Its also very sleek and non obtrusive 
Too bad Nike ipod didn t just begin the Nike+ marketing with this I have been running for a long time track in high school and down the road today and have never had great luck with the way Nikes fit my feet I was enamored by the Nike+ipod capabilities almost to the point of buying the special Nikes until I saw this product The shoe pouch just straps into your shoelaces It s great to be able to put on the shoes that are most fitting and get the benefits of the Nike+ program as well 
Shoe Pouch For those that don t wear Nike Shoes but want to take advantage of Nike+ and the whole Ipod Nano training thru Nike this is great This pouch enables me to take advantage of the Nike+ system without having to wear Nike shoes It works great I highly recommend it 
Great Product I ve had the Nike Plus Running gear for over a year now and I really hated being restricted to using Nike Shoes This product really works I was a little skeptical at first but the pouch fit right on the top of my shoe and it works as if I was using a normal Nike Shoe Would definietly recommend this to anyone who really likes the Nike Plus Gear but not a huge fan of Nike Shoe 
Great product for the price I had many problems with the Nike shoe this product saved my feet I can use my old running shoes and the pouch keeps the sensor safe and secure I have had no problems with it 
Delivery was a little slow Faster options would be appreciated The service was fine I believe the order was filled quickly but USPS is soooooooo slow Would be nice to have an additional option in case it was needed 
Shoe Pouch Expands Usefulness of Nike+ Sports Kit If you like the Nano Nike+ sports kit but not Nike shoes this is a great product It is easy to attach to any pair of laced shoes and the transmitter tucks securely inside and is easy to remove I would caution however that you don t want to use that method if it is raining The Nike+ kit is a great motivational tool for walkers or runners Now the product is more versatile and thus more useful 
Great product Love the shoe pouch It s the perfect size to fit the Nike Sensor without being clunky and I get great results from the Nike PLUS system when using it Defintely better than trying to stick the sensor under your shoe laces where it can occasionally fall out 
great buy I bought 5 of these for gifts I had them monogramed and they were perfect for bridal party 
Roomy Handy I bought 4 of these totes to use for grocery shopping trips for my husband and I we re trying to be a little more earth friendly and frankly all of those plastic bags were cluttering up our kitchen These totes are PERFECT for gorcery shopping They are a strong and roomy and fit many many groceries They also have a little side pocket which we ve found useful for greeting cards and gum and things like that You can also carry them on your shoulder which makes lugging in groceries much easier The bags have solved other problems we didn t even consider when purchasing them we ve forgotten grocery bags at the store now that we have this self check out but we know exactly how many totes we have so we won t forget them Also I bought 4 different colors dark light blue red and yellow We put refirgerated and frozen foods in the blue bags and the other in the red and yellow our groceries are put away much more quickly At this price I DEFINITELY recommend them 
Excellent Sweatshirt I am in the process of buying a second sweatshirt because these are fantastic quality A little heavier than the usual sweatshirt yet very soft I wholeheartedly recommend this sweatshirt 
Speedo Nylon Stripped Square Leg Training Suit Hey they work for me Shipping was timely and they haven t fallen off yet What more do u need in a training suit 
At last Finally an elegant and attractive solution to carrying too many keys around This little purse allows me to carry ten large keys and car starters on two separate rings neatly close off the set I don t need or both sets if I want and keep those I do need handy Best of all it doesn t look like it will suffer from the wear and tear that quickly causes frequently used keys to work their way out of standard cases and fall off 
Fine Italian Leather I was searching for a leather key case for my Italian Vespa scooter and found the perfect one in the Dionigi zippered key case It has the look feel and smell of fine leather and exhibits beautiful craftsmanship It will be the perfect compliment to my Vespa 
Quality Leather The quality of leather on this key case is incredible It is truly a nice quality Italian leather I highly recommend this product 
Italian leather key case This is a lovely key case It will keep your keys safely together and keep them from damaging the lining of your purse or pocket The leather is top quality and the key chains seem to be securely sewn in the bottom seam There are two key rings so you could put work keys on one and house car keys on the other My sister doesn t seem too crazy over it as it is not the one she wanted but the one she wanted had poor reviews So I told her I would gladly take this key chain back for myself 
bargain cute hat for the price I only needed this for a costume party so 8 00 was the perfect price 
i love this hat it s so light i can hardly tell i m wearing it but like another girl wrote i would be scared to get it wet just make sure you only wear it in the sun and you should be fine it s really beautiful the best looking cowgirl hat i ve seen 
Good hat but not what I expected It is a nice looking hat and it fits me very well That being said flexible straw material is a little deceiving The tag on the hat says 100 paper It is VERY light which will probably be a good thing for the summer and the material is very soft It is certainly not the tipical stiff straw hat in fact there is no stiffness to the material at all Like I said it looks good and fits good but I m really glad I bought it on sale 
Love it I got this hat as a christmas present from one of my friends It fit s perfectly and is very lightweight If you have a large head like me don t be worried I wear a 7 3 4 and it still fits plus it will stretch over time 
Comfortable and Just the Right Amount of Country I bought this hat because it was one of the cheaper more attractive cowboy hats I d seen It s the perfect weight and shape and it fits my head without feeling like it s too tight or like my head ll drown in it My sister liked it so much I got her one too She works at a summer camp and she told me whenever she wears it people ask where she got it 
Great My husband was very happy with this item The shirt is very high quality and will withstand many washings 
Great price My husband bought me these He bought me 1 2 size too small but they are still fairly comfortable They are much taller then I normally wear but comfortable for the height 
Steelers rule A comfortable fit Perfect for lounging around in but a bit to baggy I would have preferred this in black Still a good T Shirt though 
steelers t shirt It was bought as a gift and it arrived in a very timely manner The person receiving the gift was very please 
Very Comfortable but Poor Quality I wore these slippers for about one week One morning while wearing them my right foot felt like the material inside the shoe was twisted I looked down at the shoe to see what the problem was and much to my surprise part of my foot was hanging out the side of the slipper The seam had split where the top and side were stitched together Very disappointed 
Thanks A++++++ These slippers were just what my daughter s boyfriend was looking for They fit perfectly and look like they are very well made Very quick shipping too Thanks 
I think he will love them I bought a pair of these for my boyfriend and they re gorgeous They re very plush and I love the sheepskin lining I m very happy with the quality 
Very comfortable This Sleep T is very comfortable and is the perfect weight I wear a plus size and my favorite style of this is calf length I just love them especially when I can find it in a darker color I buy these 2 at a time They do shrink a little in the dryer though 
Pollie reveiw The pollie open toe shoe is a very stylish shoe that looks really good on 
Great Carry On Wheeled Backpack Highly recommend this high quality backpack Everything I wanted in a carry on in the event that my other luggage was lost Two backpacks in one with lots of storage Removable day pack also has backpack shoulder straps and is perfect for using during day outings while on vacation to carry two water bottles cameras wallets passports swim suits towels etc You will love this durable pack 
Finally I have looked and looked for a bra in a petite size Why is it that nobody else makes one Petite seemed to mean small busted The only petite bras I could find were B cup and smaller Finally a bra where the cups are positioned a little closer together and the distance between the cup and shoulder is shorter than average I was always shortening the straps as much as possible and still it wasn t enough With this bra I don t even have to shorten the straps as far as they ll go 
nice shoe for less price I love the shoe very great price for the good quality 
Great Shorts These gym shorts actually have pockets And they fall right at the knee not upper thigh or the ankles like so many other shorts do I have two pairs and when I need to buy another I m going to stick with this model 
Charlie Brown Classic Tee This is a nice heavy weight t shirt It has the classic black zig zag on front back which I wasn t sure about from the description The recipient loved this shirt 
Happy Customer Everything went right with this order Product was super Shipped fast and the price was competitive A great way to shop Thank you 
label patches everywhere in the picture it shows the jacket plain black with orange inside when i got it it patches all over it saying the name brand that were velcro so when i pulled them off i had velcro patches all over the outside of the jacket i had to take it to a seamstress to have them removed the kind of material would have been easy to damage if i had tried to remove them myself i was very disapointed and will never order from them again 
Great Product Very nice looking suit for a great price Can t beat this deal 
Great For the Price This stadium seat was just what I was looking for It is well made and lightweight It also has a very wide seat that makes it very comfortable even for large people 
Great charging units just OK case The car charger and the wall charger work great and make this combination worth the price But the carrying case for the Creative Zen V while very well constructed and very protective is not designed for someone like me who constantly is switching songs and checking the screen I have to remove the case from my belt to check the screen because there is no swivel mechanism for the belt clip so I can view the screen while clipped on my belt Also to connect the unit with a USB connector you have to unsnap the cover remove the ear phone cord and then plug the USB connector into the unit The case itself looks great however I just wish its utility matched its looks 
Carrying Case Excellent vendor quick turnaround and the case fits like a glove The leather is pretty good quality as well My daughter loves it 
A wardrobe must have These are my first pair of gauchos and I m always leery of buying a new fashion or brand over the internet what if they re poorly made or don t fit me right returning is a hassle but I ve got to say I am delighted with this buy I m 5 4 and they hit at just the right point on my calves although if I was much shorter I might think that they were too long I have an athletic build but large hips and I was worried these might make me look huge but they are very flattering on my body type I also have a friend who has a pair that is quite slim a size 2 and they work beautifully on her too They are ultra comfy and have just the right amount of stretch Because they are mostly polyester they aren t really breathable but they are so lightweight it s not a factor for me They are also virtually wrinkle proof If you re looking to buy gauchos or just a comfy pair of hip pants to hit the town in I would definately recommend these 
Costume party Bought them for a costume party Very high wear at your own risk 
cushiony and comfortable I like to wear these socks for running they feel very cushiony I have bought myself 3 pairs so far They are thick socks though that s why they re so comfortable because they re padded so if your shoes are tight might be hard to fit 
so soft and comfy I bought the short crew version b c I had to reach my 25 max for the free shipping I fell in love with the socks and bought more including this one which is just as soft and comfy with that cushioned feeling 
so cute ncheap cute n cheap what more can u ask for i got these in pink and i love the 
Great Sandals Love Bass sandals These are comfortable even if you happen to be on your feet all day Can t usually say that about any sandals These are cushy and provide support for your arches Not a lot of arch support but more than my other sandals provide Very quality made and cute 
Orlie This is an excellent product It gives great tummy control and there are no visible lines showing through your outer wear I have been wearing this style for years The material is very durable I have had some last for years and still look new 
Sized way too small I loved the design of the shirt but the small was more like an extra small 
Made cheaper than in the past I agree I ve had several pairs of these over the years and they never tore up like they do now Last pair I bought I brought back because they tore up and got another pair well they tore up too Now I need to find a replacement 
Very Comfy I really liked these sandals the fit was great very cushy and the price was awesome for this brand of shoes 7 
Good design for a purse not a backpack The purse size was true to the dimensions listed but the lining not the quality I expected The explanation for the water resistant nylon as opposed to silk lining was that it made it more practical as a backpack however this bag is obviously not designed to be a backpack The leather is high quality and you wouldn t want to be exposing it to the elements for any significant length of time much less trying to put anything larger than a paperback in the interior I really like the versitality of the various pockets and pouches including the interior wallet and the magnetic snaps hold everything together pretty well It is remarkably light even with all my stuff in it The color and appearance shown here are true to the actual product I like the fact that the wallet is at the top of the zippered partition so you have easy access to your cards cash etc without having to dig around All the pockets have zippers and snaps for extra security We ll see how it holds up over time 
the ultimate st patty s day gift for anyone who even remotely likes Napoleon Dynamite I bought this T shirt and got more than a few laughs out of it I mean Vote for O Pedro Nice 
Comfortable and Sexy Stretches to fit you exactly The smooth fabric holds everything in place Contrast waistband and package support make this underwear look very sexy Highly recommended 
The best fit ever These briefs are just a pleasure to wear They look and feel good the fabric is smooth and comfortable the design is superb with a low fit and a full and sexy back The narrow fit between the legs and the comfortable pouch cleverly lift up and shape your bulge looks cool under jeans and I also like the red waistband showing over low rise jeans CK should make a thong version Your best briefs yet CK 
Nice Underwear These are great SO comfortable they keep everything in place and they feel fantastic They re tight but not too tight They re small in the front but there is full coverage for the derri�re which makes them very sexy You won t be sorry they re worth the money 
Awesome Brief This is a really great brief My girlfriend bought me these I have always been a boxxer guy but i tried them for her and they feel so great and make you feel very sexy The red and black colors looks great I wore these to my semi formal dance at school and they are very slim under the suit no bunching Because of this fine brief i now only wear briefs and boxer briefs Highly recommended 
All time favorite fit I love this bra It is the most comfortable and flattering bra that stays put when you move Ideal for smaller breasted women who are happy with how they look It is lined so great under t shirts and the band is superb 
Best bra ever I hope Warner never stops making this bra It lifts but is comfy with NO wires 
Great everything I don t think I have ever gotten anything shipped to me so quickly I do almost all my shopping online and was totally shocked to see the package from Amazon as soon as I did The product was the best deal I have found online or in a store I saved so much money and plan to do a lot more shopping through amazon 
great boot couldn t beat the price Warm dry wore them on a day when it was 20 and was comfortable My only complaint is the sole is a little too slippery 
Sorel Women s Kaya extremely comfortable very warm did not slip at all while walking around with tons of ice on the sidewalks streets also get lots of compliments they are very cute too 
SO comfortable These boots are wonderful Not only are they warm and great for the snow they are also comfortable I have a wide foot and these are cut wide enough for my feet I highly recommend these boots 
Comfort I purchased a pair for my daughter and myself Besides the fact that she thinks they make her look cool she loves how comfortable they are She won t wear any of her other boots now that she has the Sorels Teres 
Sorel Women s Kaya Black They are the best winter boots I have ever had VERY warm and comfortable And fashionable too If you plan to be outside for a long period of time these are the boots for you I had to take them off inside because my feet got too warm Other people made comments on how unique they are I love them 
Nice Warm Boots These Sorel boots are awesome warm and styling I got many compliments and three of my friends ordered the same boots upon seeing mine and realizing how little I paid for such qualit 
The Greatest These are great boots Comfortable warm waterproof easy to get on and off and great treading so you don t slip These boots are fantastic They are true to size 
These are amazing I have perpetually cold feet but these really keep my feet warm and dry They are easy to get on and very comfortable They are nice and wide at the front of the foot so it is easy to accomodate any kinds of socks Only complaint is the fake fur gets tangled in the laces when you try to tie them and they shed a bit But overall that is no big deal The boots look really cute too 
Warm but lightweight boots These boots are cute and comfortable very good for winter hiking in cold climates like New England 
Great purchase This is a great deal I looked around in stores and couldn t find anything like this for less than 36 The silicone skin fits perfectly The armband works well but I haven t really tried the belt clip Order was delivered very fast I would recommend to anybody who wants to protect their MP3 player without adding too much volume to it 
Silicon Skin Good Armbelt Belt Cliip Cheesey The silicon skin was good as was the screen protector The belt clip was confusing to put on no written directions The armband is one velcro strip Overall enough value for your money 
Excellent Fit Finish The rubberized case for the Sansa fits extremely well and protects the unit quite well The belt clip works well The arm band has not been used as yet 
Not bad for price I do wish that the clip on this was the same color as the hot pink cover that I got The cover fit over easily but it took a little time to figure out how to attach the beltclip Other than the fact that the armband came several weeks later in a separate shipment they were out of stock at the time this was a decent buy 
Sandisk Sansa accessories Delivered within good time no probs pink cover is a good fit Armband could have more thought put into it 
Exceed expectations and great features for 13 year olds My son had wanted a new MP3 for Christmas and for a 2GB device you can t beat the price and accessories purchased He has had hours of fun with it and an avid user 
Great Practical Shoes Inexpensive shoes Cute but I would nt do any major walking in them At that price you can buy all the neat colors that they had to offer 
pleased customer These Mary Janes are definitely worth the money They are well made and last through wear tear I have owned many pairs in the past and these are one of the best quality The designs are cute and the materials are good quality Will purchase more I m positive Thanks 
Cute and comfortable I now own 4 pairs of these shoes 3 different colors They are semi dressy and I can wear them eight hours and not have sore feet They are like slippers I love them 
These are the cutest MaryJanes The best ones i ve ever bought Totally comfortable without socks I wear them all the time What a great deal 
Polartec pants Excellent Exactly what I wanted Would like another pair but they don t have anymore of my size 
It doesn t get any better than this I was heading out crabbing while staying with my Mom but had forgotten to pack warm pants other than jeans She offered me these which I thought would go underneath but she was quick to correct me and laugh at my attemp These are the most incredibly comfortable durable and WARM pants I have ever owned Incidentally she gave me the pants and now I m buying another pair I wish they came in other colors though The material is smooth on the outside and soft on the inside The cut is very flattering with a slight flare at the bottom and a nice mid low rise waist I m short waisted and have the over 30 had a baby flab and these hit me at just the right place I can wear these with shorter shirts too because although they are fitted they re not so tight that they re inappropriate I would recommend going commando however as they do show panty lines I wear these whenever I m doing anything outside My Mom wore hers to ski and says they re great You can t beat the price on Amazon com either WOW 
Soccer Tshirt The tshirt is great my daughter loves it Unfortunately it came dirty Upon opening the package we noticed a boot or shoe inprint on it needless to say we were very disappointed Now how can they happen We called Customer Service and received a new shirt but your shipping dept has someone who is willing to send an item like that pretty sad 
Naughty Monkey Pump Comfortable and distinctive Everyone asks me about them when I wear them 
Very Happy I was looking for a specific fleece hoodie Adidas sweatsuit jacket and found it on Amazon com The jacket was the exact one that all of the sporting goods stores carry The jacket is a heavy fleece good for putting on after working out I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a fleece jacket instead of a nylon one 
Comfortable and Cute Got this for a gift for my wife She loves it 
Good Jeans I couldn t find a 7 Husky anywhere These jeans were exactly what I needed The jeans themselves are a good quality product 
Sexy suit I bought this swimsuit with the idea I wanted to cover a little tummy but didn t want to look like an old lady in a one piece This suit was a PERFECT choice It is super sexy very well made but does the tummy cover trick It has these fantastic adjustable sides on the bottom to make it comfortable GREAT SUIT I think I ll be buying more in different colors 
For the most part a very good product I have these scrubs in several different colors and for the most part they are excellent The texture of the fabric varies and one of my pairs is uncomfortable because it is so stiff no matter what detergent I wash them in The rest have been perfect I have been wearing them 6 days a week for the last year in a vet clinic and haven t had a single problem with staining or ripping I would definitely recommend this product 
Cheap sneakers that don t look cheap I bought these for my girlfriend for 21 in November because she needed a new pair of athletic shoes I wasn t expecting much for the money so I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived and looked like they could have cost 3 4 times as much It s a very simple shoes that nixes the frills of the flashier Megaride Gigaride models of Adidas that use the A3 outsoles Instead this model has a lightweight Adiprene foam outsole that makes the shoe light overall You could seriously balance the shoe on the tip of your index finger My girlfriend says they re very comfortable as well and I guess that s what really matters 
Great buy Good quality comfortable shoe I work 12hr shifts as a nurse and before getting these my feet and legs would ache after work these shoes made a huge difference I ve gotten so many compliments from coworkers and patients families Great buy I used 20 off 2 pr shoes 
my favorite lounge wear This pants are so light and comfy and they stay put without being too constraining I thought I would only use them for yoga exercise but I love them so much that they have become a staple of my at home wardrob 
Great business and product After trying to deal with different distributor and waiting over 2 weeks to be told they were out of stock these folks came through on very short notice for Christmas THANK YOU 
Boots These boots look great with both jeans and skirts but if you have a bigger calf be aware it may take some work to get them on Now that I ve got them stretched a little I love them very comfortable to wear 
I love reebok very good quality still better than new balance though the seller sent me a shoes with different colors that what I ordered but still good quality Reebok 
Camelbak the Best I hunt with this pack on steep and slippery terrain The waist belt takes the pressure off my back and all the pockets keeps everything I need handy The water bladder holds enough for a full mornings hunt and is easy to clean and dry Thanks for a wonderful product 
Hubby loves the tees My husband loves these t shirts He says they are the most comfy undershirts he has ever worn I have washed them and they still retain their shape even with wash after wash We have only had them a month or so but they still feel just as good today as they did when we took them out of the package Nautica t shirts are great quality and the price was good too 
Wonderful and entertaining I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them The man junk looks really funny coming out of the Transformer head Like a big nose or something hehehehe 
Not bad for the price These run very small and the manufacturer should tell us that because when you buy these online it s hard to see just how they re going to fit I work with alot of people that love the brand but they also say they have the same problem with them running small 
This has been my favorite shoe to go running in period I bought it at SEARS for 50 bucks a year ago seems its gotten more expensive on here lately and well after visiting a running shoe store and finding a pair that killed my feet after a single run I decided to go back to what I loved the NB 504s Apparently they didn t have my size anymore and neither did any nearby stores so I got the 477s to replace them but don t worry in a few weeks I will be buying this pair from Amazon or somewhere else online to replace my first babies I have flat feet and wear a size 9 5 I am roughtly 180 lbs nowadays though I want to weigh around 165 ideally I have run one marathon and several 12k 10s s but I would not consider myself an expert runner my pace for longer distances is around 12 minute miles which I believe to be kind of slow 
More durable than they may appear They look like knee highs but can be machine washed and dried with no ill effects 
Terriic product for cyclist My husband is a cyclist This is a terrific way to carry essentials such as ID credit cards or cash He no longer has to worry about forgetting these things in his bike pack He absolutely loves it He also has the Nike Nano monitor uses the wallet for it as well The seller I purchased this from was EXTREMELY nice helpful I would gladly purchase from them again 
Less expensive than buying Nike+ shoes I bought the ShoeWallet so that I could use the iPod + Nike insert but with my New Balance 4E width shoes This is a great way to go as not only can I carry the iPod+Nike device but also a house key and my Caribou coffee card 
Shoe Wallet Review What a great idea I purchased this for my dad for Christmas as he is an avid runner With the shoe wallet he can keep a key and identification with him at all times 
Great multipurpose money saver This item was recommended on a review for a similar item on Amazon and I m glad I went with it You can use it for more than your Nike + iPod sensor the other isn t large enough When the weather sends me inside to the gym there s room for my car key fob too The customer service from the Shoewallet company has been fast and friendly 
Shoe Wallet I ordered this item last minute as part of a christmas present I ordered it a week ahead got standard shipping and it arrived on time Thank you so much 
iPod shoe wallet Using the shoe wallet for my iPods Sport Senor Nike has been flawless I am really pleased at the accuracy of the sensor in the wallet It is super easy to strap on off I don t even know the wallet is on my shoe when I am using it 
great invention I hate it when going for a jog and trying to think of a way to hold onto my keys This shoe wallet is a perfect solution when working out or running and need to hold onto your keys and ID The Shoe wallet works great just make sure you strap it tight enough 
Shoe Wallet Works just as advertised My wife is using it with her Nike Ipod sport and is very pleased with it 
iPod via Shoe Wallet I bought the Shoe Wallet in lieu of the 100+ Nike shoes that the iPod Sports kit recommends hoping that I would get the same result So far so good I tested the readings from the iPod on a treadmill with the Nike sensor securely tucked away in the Shoe Wallet The result The iPod readings were in stride pun intended with the treadmill stats I can also put a key to my house in the Shoe Wallet rather than having it bang around in my pocket For me this is proving to be a great inexpensive way to wear my own shoes and still utilize Nike+iPod 
Nice case cheapo accessories I bought two of these cases for my kids Sansas The colors are vibrant they fit well over the machines and they absorb the impact of dropping the belt chip is flimsy as is the armband but it is a good product for the price 
Player is Excellent Movie Conversion Software Problem My 7 year old daughter can operate the player so it is very intuitive The screen is clear and very visable I have found a limitation with the included s w that makes playback from some MPEG formats virtually unviewable For long movie files the s w splits up the file into a number of files and only the first play back correctly All the subsequent files run in slow motion or a very slow frame rate They have told me they will send me updated s w a number of weeks ago and I am still waiting 
Works Well I bought this case for my boyfriend and I We both like that it fits great over the player The armband is a little uncomfortable when you use it over a long period of time The power button is a little hard to use with the cover on but it does not affect the wheel Overall the cover serves its purpose of protecting the player 
Fits nicely Overall I am very satified with this product It provides great protection without adding a whole lot of extra bulk It also fits nicely over the player and doesn t slip around The only problem was with attaching it to you belt or arm The back doesn t support the wieght of the player Meaning it s kind of flimsy and bounces around 
Poor Quality My daughter received this as a Christmas gift When she put it on her MP3 player the silicone skin immediately tore For the amount of money spent on this we were very disappointed in the quality 
Pretty good deal This product came quickly contained all it described high quality however the picture representing the product was a bit misleading The color was different than depicted and the belt clip did not match the skin I recommend looking at other similar PCWorld products to get an accurate idea of the colors 
Serves purpose but not comfortable It does work well but wasn t as low cut in the back as shown in the picture Also I found it to be very itchy around the top Would not buy another one 
Fantastic This set of underwear is fantastic I ve always had a taste for boxer briefs but this set is better than all the others I have ever worn They move perfectly with you and the fabric enlarges my bulge excellently My only complaint is a tendency for the legs to ride up a bit But that s a minor complaint for a majorly attractive piece of underwear 
Incredable I picked up a pair of these a few monthes ago and so far my experiance has been positive These boxerbriefs are incredable They fit great and the waistband and leg bands to loosen after several washes They may be a little over priced but they are worth it 
Fun and colorful This purse is great for spring and summer because it has a fun pattern and is very colorful It is the perfect size for most warm weather activities enough room for sunscreen a bottled drink a snack sunglasses I also like it because it is non leather and so guilt free The only issue with this purse is that due to its flexible material you need to keep it pretty full to maintain its shape 
LOVE EM I LOVE THEM THEY ARE SOO COOL AND AWESOME IF U ARE THINKING ABOUT BUYING THEM YOU SHOULD 
Haven t even worn yet They look great I just tried them on and they are already coming apart It s too bad cause they look great 
Very Comfortable Stylish I was originally a bit hesitant about buying these water shoes but once they arrived I couldn t be happier I slipped them on and immediately noticed how comfortable they are Much more comfortable than my 150 pair of running shoes They ve got a stylish design and are priced pretty well My purpose for buying these are for river tubing general walking around on an upcoming cruise and I m confident now that these will serve that purpose nicely The only downside to this shoe is that the sole doesn t look as nice as the women s version My wife got the same shoe but for women and her soles were clear while mine was black Nothing major but hers looks much better than mine when looking at them both from the bottom not that I ll ever see them from that angle while I m wearing them 
WOW LOVE THESE SHADES THEY ARE GLAMOROUS AND MAKE U LOOK AND FEEL LIKE JACKIE O I WAS CONSTANTLY ON A SHADES HUNT KNOWING SOMEWHERE THERE WAS THE PERFECT SHADES FOR ME NOW I HAVE NO LONGER HAVE A NEED TO SEARCH IT HAS ENDED I VE FOUND THEM IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT CAN T WAIT FOR OTHER VERSIONS TO COME OUT 
A Steal People think I have on Gucci glasses They dont know I only got them for eight dollars 
Perdy Good I really like the look of these shoes but the feel is a little off The heels curve in around the top rim so I got some pretty bad blisters the first day I wore them I ve had them for a few weeks now and they re almost completely broken in If you plan to buy these don t take them for a long walk straight out of the box 
kjs I bought this thinking I was buying a mans wallet when it came I realized a had bought a womans checkbook I bought the black one I am using this as a wallet and it is holding up very good I like the fact it has room for every thing I need to carry it is a little heavy for the back pocket but I like it very good quality 
At last I found them I have been wearing these slippers everyday for 3 years They are a blessing for my cold feet Not to mention the durability I just now realized the sole was broken almost in 1 2 from years of use I was frantic when I looked and looked and could not find them Today is my lucky day I just ordered my second pair 
As Seen in Anthropologie These shoes are the same shoes sold by Anthropologie summer 06 as well as by Neiman Marcus except they are an embossed black leather on top and the ones at Anthropologie were a type of suede Regardless they are a beautiful shoe and comfortable to boot I usually wear a size 6 5 but I ordered a half size up as recommended and they fit perfectly 
Just Gorgeous I wore these tights with my wonderwoman costume for halloween when I had a kids party in my home These tights were just gorgeous and felt wonderful They looked great and made my legs look fantastic I really love them They look and feel like professional dancer tights I highly recommend these tights to wear with costumes or for dance class Thanks Ton 
Attractive Tights I have been wearing this brand of tights for over a decade Because of the shimmer they are very attractive I have had both men and women related and not related to me tell me they like them They are comfortable enough for all kinds of weather even during California s hot central valley summers They last longer than regular pantyhose I never wear regular pantyhose anymore because they are so much more comfortable 
Excellent jacket This is the first Leather jacket I purchased Holds up well And I usually wear it when I ride my Motorcycle 
Cute shoes but definitely not fo rme I ordered these because they looked like very cute ballet flat type of shoes and they had good reviews here and elsewhere When I got mine they fit horribly Uncomfortable to say the least I had the Return label printed the shoes reboxed and back in the mail within 20 minutes of getting the box open Its too bad that they didn t fit me because I really like the design 
n 3b Snorkel Parka Flight Jacket This review was written by my brother for whom the Parka was bought for This extreme weather Parka was everything I expected The delivery was on time from Captain Dave s I will be using Captain Dave s in the near future As I was extremely pleased with the customer service provided Tight lines Icey eyes and Artic mornings John Blevin 
N3B Snorkel Parka Flight Jacket Parka came in promptly and was exactly what I thought it would be I was updated regularly via EMail as to the status of my order and am very satisfied with the product and the service 
Very comfortable and sexy This is the most comfortable thong I ve bought so far and the semi transparent pouch is roomy enough to keep everything where it belongs 
Preference for over 15 yrs and great buy for college students I purchased this ID Holder Key Chain in the green color It is a very nice color green The leather is smooth to the touch I also purchased the more expensive black CLAVA ID Holder Key chain as a gift for a man If color isn t an issue stick with the less expensive The black was nearly double in cost and it is IDENTICAL in appearance and feel I am very pleased with the green color It is a dark green and is very nice It would have worked great for the man I purchased it for had I known what the green looked like I love this ID Holder Key Chain bc along with carrying my keys with it I can carry a lot of things inside such as my Drivers License credit cards insurance cards photos membership cards money receipts etc One of the inside ID holders also has a zipper pocket attached so you can also carry loose change The ID holder also velcros closed which is a nice feature There is also one clear plastic pocket on the outside which works perfectly for displaying a photo of my children I don t think I d use the outside pocket to hold my drivers licence or another valuable card for fear that it may fall out and get lost Also I like carrying my keys with the ID Holder bc I don t have to worry about driving to the store and running in to realize that I forgot my wallet in the car or at home I like the convenience of having it all together This is a great buy Especially for college students I was first introduced to this style ID holder in college and have been using it ever since 
Handy Handy little wallet Front clear ID pocket very loose i d be scared to put my driver s license in there seems like it would fall out 
These are some majorly groovy shoes I ordered a pair in cognac and they look much better in person They are a cross between the pointed toe pump and the kilty look both of which are in fashion right now The heel is a fine height and I can wear these all day without major discomfort A fine pair of shoes 
Hard to find fun to wear Warning These sandals can be addictiing They provide an instant massage to your feet whenever they re on And look good at the same time I m lucky enough to live in Southern Cali where I can wear them 12 months a year They re that comfortable They do wear out after a while though So do like I do and order a couple pair at one time And for what it s worth the price offered here is better than I ve found in local stores 
Men s Adidas not for men only I bought these for my husband but I wear them a lot They massage your feet when you walk I slip them on when my shoes aren t around my husband s feet and my own are almost the same size and wear them around the house and sometimes bring them to the gym to wear in the locker room and around the pool Very comfy 
Great sandals I enjoy wearing these sandals they have great support and look great too 
like walking barefoot I love Birkenstock shoes They are the most comfortable shoes I have even worn I have more than 15 pair so I have one for every occasion 
birkenstocks Birkies are the only sandal I buy anymore They last forever and Amazon is a great place to find them at a good price 
Hair Jewels Worked Wonderfully These hair jewels held great in our hair and lasted all night through a lot of salsa dancing The shipping was wonderful and fast Thank you so much I would definitley purchase again without hesitation 
Surperb As usual Clark s shoes are the best in style comfort and price I buy as many pairs as possible 
didn t recieve my boots i sent my boots back 3 weeks ago because i had ordered a size too small so i had sent them back i still have not recieved my boots when they should have been here if you wouldnt mind could you please give me an update on the boots that i had ordered or please send the 
CUT BUT I ONLY LIKE REAL LEATHER BOOTS SORRY AND FOR THE PRICE YOU CAN GET REAL LEATHE 
Warm feet I bought these for my grandma because she says her feet are always cold She called me right after she got these and told me she had the warmest feet in the state 
Great shoes I like the fit comfort and styling of these shoes very much I had tried on a pair in a store in San Francisco and went back to buy them and they were out So bought them on line They arrived in perfect shape My only complaint is that the dye seems to be rather superficial as scrapes and rubs tends to take the color off fairly easily 
Gripper Gloves a Good Buy I purchased several pairs of these gloves They arrived quickly in the mail I am very pleased with the quality and price We use them as puppeteers to keep a firm grip inside the puppet s mouth Great item 
Hanes String Bikini Briefs I like them They are seamless over the front which makes it more comfortable They stay on the hips with the wide band elastic + no rear crack when bending over Unlike low rise styles with the small round elastic band Only problem over time is corner attach points unstitch tear One thing nice about shopping in a store you can pick though the assorted styles to best match what you like 
Just Right The heel is perfect for mature women but not old ladyish Very comfortable 
Wedding shoe I was looking for the right dress shoe for my best friends wedding SHe is having an outside wedding so we need a shoe that can walk in the grass with out going through the ground I was looking for a cute shoe but with the right price this was jut perfect Thank you Elizabeth Tafoll 
Great feel great fit I was very impressed with the fit and feel of my new spider man boxers Made out of excellent material and great fit around the waist 
AWESOME SHOES Awesome is the best word I can use to describe these running shoes I wore them to the gym yesterday and they are probably the most comfortable athletic shoes I have ever owned I usually buy New Balance which I have always liked buy I might be an Adidas convert now I ve already ordered a second pair as a backup I use my athletic shoes for the gym 50 min on elliptical weights brisk walking and some jogging These shoes even have me excited about getting back into running that s how great they feel 
Best athetic shoes I have ever bought I bought this shoes for my 2 month trip using them for walking not running They are so comfortable and they still look like new after the tough trip My irregular feet didn t even feel sore after long hours of walking 
great purchase product arrived super fast And the price was just right will buy from again 
Great Boots this is husband writing review No breakin period stood in a stream for 5 minues and was bone dry did a 10 mile hike no hotspots I love them nothing bad to say good grip nice support all I did is replace the liner with a gel footbed but I do that with all my boots the ones that came with were fine LOVE THIS BOOT way cheaper than most 
Great boots I m extremely pleased with this purchase The boots have already served me well this winter Although they re not insulated I ve not experienced any discomfort hiking in boot deep snow at air temperatures of 20 F 
awesome Incredible boots accomodating an appealing aggressive style as well as providing great comfort for your feet on all terrain 
Great value for money I bought these shoes for hiking in Alaska Loved the firm grip of it It felt very sturdy I have soft ankles and still I could hike without any worries Recommend it 
Columbia Frontiier Peak boots rocks The boots arrived very quickly fit perfectly and have kept my feet warm I will buy from this buyer agai 
Volcom girls long sleeve I bought this long sleeve on sale at Pacsun and went back and bought all the colors I love the way this fits Form fitting but length of sleeves and waist long 
Pockets pockets pockets These are the best scrubs I have ever found If I put stuff in a chest pocket it falls out when I bend over I m a male nurse and when I wear a scrub top with the two front pockets at the base I feel like I m wearing an apron If I put stuff in the back pocket of scrub pants I sit on it Finally I found my solution cargo pockets I have to deduct points because with these pants I end up wearing so many pockets that I tend to forget where I put stuff And if I run anything heavy in the cargo pockets annoyingly slaps me in the legs all scrubs are loose fitting on my chicken legs But then I gave those points back because of the coolness factor Let s face it cargo pockets make you look like you are ready for anything even if I have learned how to minimize the amount of stuff I needlessly carry around Like most scrubs they re very comfortable The new sandwashed material is very durable and stain resistant I ve washed them many many times and they still look like new Dickies is a great brand and the one I ll be sticking with unless Carhartt starts making scrubs 
comfortable shoes These shoes are very comfortable I have them in other colors that have lasted several years so far Great if you have to walk a lot in your job 
Outstanding Shoe These mules are one of the most comfortable shoes that I have I like Clark products their workmanship is always outstanding This product really holds my foot the leather is soft and your foot is just cushioned on the soles It is excellent Great Buy especially for us that have a shoe size that cannot be bought in a department store 
Perfect These socks really make a difference in confort during outdoor activities I even wear them around the house because they are way more confortable then my everyday cotton crew socks 
Caveat emptor I ordered and received early two assorted pair on a lark good price I like that they gave me one pair of khaki and one pair of charcoal nice Delivery in far less time than predicted Nice However I m not one to quibble over this esp for this price but I know plenty of people who would be outraged They got lucky with me And yes both have some of the knit loops hanging out loosely I m going to take my chances that they don t turn into holes within a few months 
Best runnning shoes yet This is probably my 6th pair of Brooks Adrenaline I love the shoes and they seem to be a great fit for most of the people I run with as well 
great shoe this is one of the best shoes i own very comfortable to wear right out of the box glad i ordered a half size larger thoug 
A real back saver well worth the money I was skeptical at first to buy this item because it seemed like too much money to spend on a simple elastic band with velcro but as my baby got bigger my back hips got progressivly weaker to the point that I couldn t even stand for five minutes without being in horrific pain and feeling like I was about to collapse I decided to finally break down and spend the money on this belt and let me tell you I ONLY WISH I D GOTTEN IT SOONER Like before I had the previous three kids ^ I m not sure what happened with the person who wrote a bad review talking about the band putting too much pressure on the hips I can only assume that either she got the wrong size or was using it incorrectly I have found that I can t tolerate sitting for extended periods with the belt tight my legs go numb so I usually just take it off when I m resting at home for the night But my days always start with this band and I can get SO much more done now 
favorable The item is well made but unfortunalty I am unable to use the suppoert belt at this time I purchased the belt because I have had surgery that requires some support for the abdomine and right now the belt does not fit will enough with out causing pressure on some locations on the lower abdomin I hope to be able to use it very soon Even my doctor says it may help ease some discomfort 
Back saving belt I am a physical therapist When I got pregnant I was concerned about my back and how it would hold up during the pregnancy With the hormone relaxin that is released with pregnancy our joints loosen up and can t support as much as they do in a non pregnant state This is especially notable at the sacroiliac SI joint of our low backs Instability of this joint there s one on each side can lead to pain At about 18 weeks I started having some SI pain I got one of these belts and had relief within 24 hours For about 2 months I wore it every day to support my SI joints I found that if I attached the velcro strap in the front securely but not tight then used the two side straps to tighten up the whole belt I would get the best relief I had to be certain the two side straps were even the seam where they meet in the back was in the CENTER of my back I would then pull them around at the same time and attach them so that the fit was snug but not uncomfortable After a couple of months the baby started getting so big that I started wearing it more as a support for my belly As I ve gotten bigger and bigger I ve pulled the back part upward slightly which continues to provide SI support but also helps hold up the baby When I take the belt off I REALLY notice the difference The support is amazing for such a simple belt wish I had the patent I m due in a month I have had NO back pain since before I used the belt and I continue to work and exercise without problems 
Not bad The heel part is little bit high Thus it is not comfortable at the beginning 
Good value for your money My husband gets set in his ways He likes these briefs and that s all he wanted Of course the store does not carry then anymore Styles have changed etc I looked all over while I was out but then when I got home to my computer I went to Amazon They not only had them but they were priced to sell also Thanks He s very happy for a while now 
Rate of Hanes Classics Bikini Briefs These were exactly what I expected I m always pleased with Hanes products 
Single layer sheild is no defense for the beast These are a very compfortable pair of bikinis Form fitting and soft elastic is just enough to keep them on they are everything you want in a pair of undies but they don t last I ve been wearing bikini style for more than a decade and these are a good economical alternative to the brand that got me started Calvin Kleins The Calvins are the Shangri La s that all others strive for But you got to pay You only get one pair of Calvins for 15 and here you get 3 Hanes for 11 They are almost identical in feel the difference is in the construction The Hanes only have a single layer frontal sheild whereas most other bikinis will double that area up and for good reason After about a year or so your buddy downstairs will be busy making himself a little window and who knows what that could lead to A door or a hatch and then he could bust out and take over I suppose cost vs longevity with the Calvins does balance out They cost 4x as much but last 4x as long But do our partners want us having the same pair of undies for more than 5 years Maybe the Hanes are the better buy because you will eventually have to replace them 
My new briefs I got these new underwear at the request of my girl friend to change it up at night she wanted me in something a little tight and revealing that me regualr boxers even though they are just for special occasions ive found that support and snugness of the briefs is actualy quite comfortable 
Two pairs each for me and husband later I d buy em again Love these sneakers absolutely the best We run and lounge in them and they are real work horses It doesn t hurt that they look good too 
Best of recent model revisions and still the best stability shoe After wearing out two pairs of the Kayano XII I was fortunate to find available a pair of the discontinued XI The XI is far superior as a stability shoe than the new revision I ve worn Kayano since the begining and have found that about every third or fourth version falls short of the characteristics that made this model famous It is durable stable and has a nice feel Now the XI can be found at significant discount The XI is one of the best Asics has made and the XII is probably the worst The XII is much lighter but less of a stability shoe and certainly not durable and not made for a heavy runner I hope that the XIII is more like the XI and less like the XII You should stock up on the XI while they are still available 
The Best Running Shoes Ever I have been wearing Kayanos for several years I like New Balance 999 s almost as well There s just something about Gel Kayanos that really fits my foot type and running style Now it s the only running shoe I buy 
ASICS GEL Kayano is top I run quite a lot about 1600 Miles a year Since more than 5 years i m very happy with the model line of asics gel kayano Also for marathons it is the best shoe 
Great Shoes I have used ASICS for the past few years I trail race and road race with them and they hold up very well considering the usage I put them through 
Wonderful supporting shoes I had tried a lot of different types of running shoes and this one just felt the most comfortable most supportive of all of them For the first time my feet and ankles are not killing me after running I really recommend it very highly It also comes in varying widths so people with wider feet can find the one that suits them 
Light solid and awesome I ve put a lot of miles in these shoes In fact I ve been using them for four months I ve ran a full actually ultra marathon 27 2 did the Lakeshore marathon in them They are so comfortable and light Solidy built The heel back part of the shoe feels like kevlar The sole is extremely padded The shoe fits like a glove around my feet It s unlike the New Balance shoes where you re resting on your toes I used to be a Saucony man but the Saucony shoes would feel flismy after putting some miles in them With the Kayanos after maybe a couple hundred of miles they re still in tip top shape I think they could go for another thousand more Cons the price is a little of a reach but I figured it was a worthy investment because of my marathon running I feel the sole could use a little more traction on wet surfaces 
Cute cute design love the color downside the size is about one half smaller you might want to order the a half a size bigge 
Satin Flower girl dress Beautiful Dress is an awesome compliment to the bride s satin lace and pearl dress 
Elegant First Communion Dress I purchased this dress for my 8 year old daughter in a size 6 She is smaller than most girls her age and typically wears a size 6 so this dress fit perfectly The tie in the back helped to give that perfect snug fit around the waist I love how elegant this dress looks with its capped sleeves and beading This is an absolute bargain for a beautiful dress 
Beautiful Communion dress The dress arrived timely Not wrinkled at all in perfect condition and a perfect fit It is much prettier in person than the picuture on the web 
Very Comfy They are so comfortable and look damn hot on The only thing is that they don t have a pocket for easy access 
Great bag great experience I purchased this bag a few weeks ago very happy with the whole experience Picture represents the products exactly shipped quickly and very happy with the quality of the bag The fabric seems like it s waterproof and made of a jacket like material which is easy to brush off dirt I love it 
Perfect I m 20 year olds male I wear this swimsuit to the lake beach pool etc all the time It s the only swimsuit I own right now and for good reasons It fits great very comfortable perfect I highly recommend it 
Good for lap swimming Style wise it may be judged old fashioned but it allows for great freedom of leg movement quick drying and sturdy tailoring Hard to find in the stores A swimmers suit by a solid company Hope they continue this style at Speedo 
Fantastic Undees They are very comfortable and fit well will purchase more and husband loves them 
Pretty sexy pink shoes The shoes are lovely and pretty sexy They are actually nicer than how the appear on internet not to say the internet presentation is not also sharp and representative of the product I love high heel shoes I have a collection of them My husband through surfing the internet for Valentine s Day found the site What is exciting about the whole thing is I am pretty sure no one will have the same shoes in Ottawa Not having half sizes we ordered size 7 They were too small so we reordered size 8 We will know for next time Spike Angel company is very professional and easy to deal with They exchanged the shoes for the right size in no time 
Very nice This is the second Adidas warm up outfit I have and I like it very much The bright pink is a nice change from my other black one 
Looks very nice I got the black one for my wife when it was on sale at 19 99 Looks very nice on her and the logo and pattern on the back of the top looks really cool The only thing is that the pants are a bit long for her but not too bad 
The most for my money I was skeptical about these boots when I first saw them and the price was so low I thought that they could t be the best quality but I was wrong these are excellent boots I m so pleased and very comfortable I wore them all day as soon as I got them and they were just like my old favorite broken in boots Love them 
Very Fast Thank you so much Very fast service Only one week to get to my APO address overseas 
great shoe This is my second pair of these shoes and I really like them I just hate that they are being revamped Hopefully they will still be a great shoe 
awesome shoes I love these sneakers I keep buying them every time I need a new pair 
Saucony are still the best shoes I ve been wearing Saucony running shoes for about four years now This is my first pair of Grid Omni 5 and I m generally pleased There is a squeak in the heel of the right shoe so I contacted the seller and they re going to exchange them for me First time I ve had a squeaking problem with a Saucony shoe Great stability for a moderate overpronator very comfortable 
Saucony Women s Grid Omni 5 Moderate Fit perfect comfort great Nice look if they wear as well as previous Saucuny I haven t found a shoe to beat them for my needs 
Romance in a bag It will definitely get her attention in the best possible way 
REEBOK MEN S ATR PUMP PRODUCT WAS A LITTLE MORE THAT EXPECTED AND IS VERY NICE FOR BASKETBALL WAS JUST WHAT I NEEDED FITS MY ANKLE SO GREAT LET ME JUMP HIGHER KNOWING THAT MY ANKLE IS SUPPORTED 
Lovely lovely I love these shoes I have a thing for red shoes and these are great They have paid for themselves in compliments already They are not the best walking shoe but great for outfits that don t require a lot of walking around They are even cuter in person than in the picture A must for the summer season 
Awesome shoes I bought these for my husband as a birthday gift and he loves them And i love them because you can change out the color in the stripes so you can coordinate with your outfits it makes it feel as though you got many shoes for the price of one 
awesome adidas you get 7 pairs of shoes for the price of one you can t beat it 
Mine have lasted 10 years I can t believe this shoe is still being sold I bought my first pair about 10 years ago and they still are intact This shoe quickly molds to your foot and are by far the most comfortable soccer shoe I ve ever owned The flat surface of the non cleated sole is easy on your legs to prevent shin splints that occur from running on hard dirt or turf surfaces The downfall is that this shoe was made for indoor use or dry turf so it doesn t crossover very well to wet conditions 
Ultra lite Visor This product is great No pressure on headband and packs easily for travel 
ASICS� Women s GEL Kayano XII These shoes are great They come in wide which is a neccesity for me I really like them The price is pretty high but I think they are worth good running shoes are important I highly reccomend them 
Great shoes for running Love these shoes I only buy Asics For my feet they have always felt the best These shoes are great Very comfortable and easy to run in as soon as I put them on Well worth the money 
Very good comfort and stability decent durability replacing an identical pair now worn out no reason to change a winning formula 
The best all around running shoe Comfort support and light weight make this one of the best all around running shoes I have ever had This is my 2nd pair of this model Best value for the dollar very comfortable Kennett Square P 
Stability plus cushioning for heavier runners It s a comfortable somewhat soft feeling stability plus cushioning shoe for the heavier runner Softer feel than the GT 2110 with similar fit However if you like the GT 1110 this shoe may not work for you because the stability part of the soles is not as far forward Durability has been comparable to the Asics GT series shoes that I have owned 
AWESOME I went to the store with every intention on buying the new NIKE Air Max 360 The store only had it in Blue Silver so I asked for it in my size but I saw this Asics shoe I have never worn Asics before that was in the red color I wanted so I asked for that shoe too I tried on the Aisics first IT WAS THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHOE I EVER PUT ON MY FOOT I was sold I did try on the Nike after seeing all the ads I was determined to get those When I tried them on I was so dissappionted The Nike s were narrow typical Nike hard as a rock no bounce and I could feel bumps in the bottom I excercise at the gym 5 days a week doing 2 hours of cardio I can actually run on the treadmill now because these sneakers are sooo comfortable and they support my foot 
Great Great service great product great price Plenty roomy kept shape well after laundering had look and feel of 100 cotton Will not hestitate to order again 
Tis Toile Cutest boots for wearing out in the rain It s fun to get wet in these as they go with so many things Very unique as I have not seen any like them in stores 
So disappointed I tried this bra on in store The bra had a fancy pamphlet attached that explained how technologically advanced the bra is so I thought it would work really well Wrong I tried on 6 different cup band size combinations just to make sure it wasn t a cut issue For each bra I jumped up and down a few times to see what kind of support I was getting Then I jumped wearing my normal underwire bra I had exactly the same support in my everyday bra It s possible that this bra works well for smaller cups I am a 32D but if they can t support larger busts maybe they shouldn t try to sell in those sizes especially at those prices 
Best sports bra I ve ever had I m really looking forward to getting the impact level 4 I ordered at the same time as this one because the level 2 is fantastic This sports bra offers support and style I ve worn it jogging three times and it feels great No bounce and no pinching It held up great in the washing machine and dried really quickly Everything I ve tried before this wonderful bra was way too flimsy and offered no support For years I ve been looking for something that would hold everything in place while I ran a few miles and jogged up and down a few sets of stairs I think I ll get one of each support level and then I ll get one more of each It even has adjustable hooks in the elastic band around the chest so as you lose those Lbs while wearing this great top you ll be able to adjust it to fit you as you slim down I ll never have to search high and low again I ll know exactly where to turn whenever I need a sports bra that will support my needs Thank you Figleaves you really have a great product I hope that enough women find that these sports bras are a godsend and that we ll never have to wear ugly cumbersome pinching nightmares again 
Great Fit I bought multiple colors for a xmas gift They fit great and great price 
very comfortable All I wear is tank tops I am in Tucson AZ These come in alot of colors and are really cute and priced right 
Andromeda This is a wonderful shoe because the vents let your foot breathe Also it molds well to the foot and is long lasting and inexpensive Very good shoe for class too 
Darling Quality Shoes that are machine washable I grew up wearing these shoes and buy them for my son too They re very cute you can wash them in your washing machine if they get stinky dirty and best of all they hold up longer than any other canvas shoe we ve ever had Unisex cute colors and able to be handed down to other kids make these shoes very popular at our house And they look very cool 
cool accessory I bought a new tote bag to take on a trip Everything was just a modge podge laying in it This purse bright is great Has a lot of pockets helps to find what you are looking for quickly 
great for even small purses Bought 3 mom and sister got one too Fits in almost any size purse Your stuff isn t flying around your purse Very organized 
Christmas 2006 My daughter is delighted with the jersey She wears it often and is looking forward to the Bears and the Patriot s meeting again in the Super Bowl 
Best briefs I have ever worn Munsingwear briefs are the most comfortable I have ever worn For many years they seemed to be unavailable and as a result I have been uncomfortable Am glad they are being manufactured again with quality is as good as or maybe even better than before And they re even available now in colors other than white 
pouch underwear Munsingwear produces a unique kind of brief Instead of the front slit being from top down it is from side to side In my opinion there is no doubt this is a better way to access you know what Moreover the quality of the workmanship is tops They are hard to find because they are not carried by most sellers of men s underware 
nice boot I remember the old Dr Scholls wood sandals when I think of this brand These boots are very nice and well styled What an improvement 
these boots weren t made for walking I love the looks of these boots However they aren t very comfortable for walking more than a block or so Taking stairs in them is extremely uncomfortable as well I ve found Dr Scholl s shoes to be uncomfortable in general 
Excellent service I was amazed of the services and their quick information that they have on their site 
The Shoes That Do Everything These shoes are the best pair ever I can wear them with jeans a skirt I can go casual or I can go elegant or event business Awesome buy definatly worth the money 
Best combination of features Pros you won t notice you have this on after the first 5 minutes strap is right width Pouch is perfect for supporting your boys and keeping everything secure but with plenty of room Fabric is very soft Cut is very low in front and back which is nice if you re not into advertising your underwear preferences to the world This is a great athletic thong get this one Cons Initially feels too tight Fit is fairly tight I ve owned about 8 different kind of thongs and this initially wasn t my favorite but now I am throwing out most of the others besides this one Also try the mesh thong with brazillian back for a more casual roomier fit when support isn t a main goal The silk version of the extreme is ok but the fabric is too stretchy and doesn t offer the support of this cotton Order same size as your underwear 
Perfect design This is one of the best thongs I ve found The back is not too thick as to be bunchy and not to thin as to cut into you The pouch is cut a little large which is a positive you won t feel like you re popping out The cotton lycra blend just feels great too The only thing keeping me from rating this higher is the price a bit too high and there is no volume discount as with some other Undergear products 
very nice These are great On the one hand they are quite ordinary No fancy sticthing exaggerated fashion or overly tight crotch Yet the quality workmanship and attention to detail takes this usual design for briefs and makes it into an unusually appealing item As advertized the waistband construction lies flat and does not roll and the contour pouch gives good but realistic definition that can be appreciated by others Well worth the price 
Good looks and wears great This coutour pouch brief is meant to like most 2 x ist underwear show off your male assets I think this one does that effectively by using the pouch The fit is great there is enough room for everything and although it is cotton it stretches and shapes to my body just as well as the synthetic materials on the 2 x ist X Factor Countour Pouch Brief 7403 do see my review on that product page as well In fact you might like that one better so give it a look 
Good Value This sweater is exactly what my wife wanted I have seen her wear it several times which means that I did ok buying it for her Quality is great 
Jockey No pany line hip brief This is to me the best underwear a women could bu 
good product exactly as described Very good quality product small glitch in shiping but every thing else is fin 
Shipping concerns When I ordered the item I wasn t given any expected date of arrival or any option on shipping speed I had 10 days to get the item before the event and it arrived well after date needed I realize this is an outside vendor but usually Amazon items come quite quickly Thanks Debbi 
so comfortable I totally love wearing this guayabera It was living back in my hometown San Antonio This guayabera is of wonderul quality It washes easily and doesn t wrinkle easily I ve worn other guayaberas and they re itchy This one is just comfortable that you don t wanna take it off and wear it again real soon I ll definitely buy another one for the upcoming summer I m impressed by the quality of this guayabera 
Highly Recommended This is a sexy t shirt bra Great fit for a petite girl like me High quality and worth every penny 
Great Value Shoes arrived 3 days after being ordered looked great fit well I was intimidated by some of the reviews but took a chance anyhow I m glad I did 
Width is smaller than actual by 2 sizes The shoes seems to be well put together for having never been worn because the fit is horrible Why I thought buying shoes without trying them on fist knowing my size and wearing Florsheims is a mystery I will have to self solve These are made in Korea stamped right under the flap on both pairs and the width is as wrong as the makers mark Stay away from these no matter what the price I took them to two shoe makers to have them stretched and they said if they tried the seems would rip apart and the leather would crack Not a comforting thought since wearing them should naturally stretch them anyway 
Review Of The Florsheim Men s Victor Slip on This is a nice comfortable and attractive shoe which I purchased through Amazon at a very reasonable price and with excellent delivery service 
Spanish Inquisition T shirt was perfect Person I bought it for was very amused as he has memorized the movie 
Best Gown Ever I ve been looking for this type of gown forever Finally bit the bullet and bought one I LOVE IT I plan on buying more not for just me but for a relative who is to be a new bride as well It s elegant beautiful and flattering I love the way it feels It s slightly sheer yet hides enough to be conservative on the romantic side The sizing seemed a little big to me but was still okay The detail and style put in to it is very elegant and sexy I ll buy another one in a heart beat if I had the money to do so 
Love this gown so much I have three of them I bought my first one of these gowns in 2004 at a department store to take on my honeymoon The fabric is extremely soft and the full sweep gives your legs lots of room in bed The lace is as soft as the rest of the nightgown not scratchy like it can sometimes be on lesser garments The cut is attractive even if you re not model perfect Since I wore my first gown almost every night for over two years it finally was starting to look a little worn Lady Grace recently had a sale on the gown and I bought two more for me just in case they stop making them I sent another one to my Mom as a birthday gift in October It s so much more comfortable and flattering than any other gown I ve ever owned except another Miss Elaine in a similar style from 1997 that sadly had to be retired after four years I have trouble sleeping without it 
Thick and large seam This may be a good liner for cold weather but is not good for the other three seasons The sock is too thick and the raised toe seam may cause blisters even if worn inside out 
scandalicious I love how this product makes me look and it made my significant others eyes bug out when she saw it Thank 
Coolio I got the womens Onitsuka Tiger s in NAVY BLUE BERRY I cant really say anything bad about em Good quality and they have this awesome retro look to them I dont know about the other colors but I personally think the navy blue berry is the best looking one 
Just what it says My wife loves this visor It stays on doesn t pinch and doesn t leave a mark or indentation 
an excellent product It actually does NOT give you a headache even after four hours 
No Headache Original Visor I ve had two of these and they are great Truly no headache I m here to buy a third 
Best Visor on the Market This is probably my 20th No Headache Visor I love them They are great for the golf course boat or just hanging out in the yard No matter how long you wear them they are truly NO HEADACHE 
Universal Apple iPod USB Charger Kit great product I love the all the options received fast thank 
great item good price and wonderful shipping the charger is better then expected It charges so well and fast for my ipod 60gig 5th generation The rectractable usb cable can even be used on the go for file tranfer from ipod to pc 
Highly Recommended This kit is one that no iPod user should be without The pieces are well constructed and the wall charger beats Apple s own overpriced model Also reasonably priced I am very satisfied with this product 
great priced scrubs great pants large cut allows for shrinkage wash well high quality product at a really low price 
Great work shoes These shoes were instantly comfortable no breaking in required My job requires that I stand on concrete floors all day and these have been great I d recommend these for anyone with foot problems 
Absolutely the best pajamas I have six pairs of these pj s in different colors They are the most comfortable sleepwear I have ever owned They feel so smooth and luxurious and dont bunch up while I sleep No special care required just into the washer and then the dryer and I never notice any static in them They are wonderful for travel practically wrinkle free Light weight and take up minimum space in suitcase The matching robes are equally wonderful 
Vanity Fair Nylon Pajamas simply the best These exceptionally comfortable pajamas also wash and wear like iron They never wear out Opaque but not see thru Light weight and cool in summer warm and cosy in winter Throw them in the washer toss them into a medium heat dryer and they come out like new Leave them in the dryer over nite Simply fold and put in your dresser drawer the wrinkles will be gone in one day What more can you ask 
nice item This is a great backpack for a 10 year old It works great for school The one strap feature is really fast for our early morning get out the door rush I will get another when this one wears out 
Gold Toe Socks Are The Best Do your feet a favor and lose the cotton socks Go for wool whether winter or summer and your feet will stay dry and comfortable OTC is a must because it prevents flesh exposure when you cross your legs and it s the only length that stays up Gold Toe is the only brand I buy because the toe is bullet proof Other brands develop a hole in just a few wearings even with closely trimmed nails 
good enough to wear the product is fine however it you you way too damn long to ship 
Gold Toe Men s Windsor Wool Over the Calf Dress Sock Quite satisified Quick delivery Great quality 
Very good much better than most I ve purchased dress socks from Land s End and Jos A Bank and they re very good but at 25 35 a pair a bit pricey The gold toe wool dress socks are not quite as thick and probably not quite as durable but a great value nonetheless Highly recommended very comfortable socks 
COMFORTABLE FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS I ONLY USE THIS BRAND OF SOCKS THE BEST IN THE MARKET 
Warm ears These are lovely earmuffs The fur is soft They keep my ears warm and stay on my head What more could you want 
Marvellous The Earmuff is just marvellous The fur is so fluffy and keeps warm Recoment it 
Cute and Comfortable It s hard to get both but style and comfort come with these sandles Worth every penny 
jersey fantastic customer service came super fast and when there was an issue with a defect it was taken care of immediately and replacement was sent out before the defective one was returned A VERY happy 10 year old 
Reggie Bush Jersey I ordered this jersey as a gift for Christmas without any problems It was delievered as stated 
Football Jersey The jersey arrived on time and in good condition No problems with this vendor 
Just plain good jeans Pros They look nice they feel good break in quickly and don t wear out very easily The last time I bought jeans they were also Dickies and I ve had them for at least 5 years They still haven t even tried to develop any holes or rips even through working hard manual labor Cons I can t think of any There must not be any if I can t find them in 5 years 
tmi My husband is infamous for going commando style and then getting worn away patches or tears or whatever right in the crotch of his pants Thought I d share Anyhow these nicely uh fill in the gaps shall we say They are so comfortable he often dons a pair for sleeping However they sadly don t fit me very well so not good for stealing away in when I want to go paint or read in the middle of the night 
Great but huge I received this sweatshirt as a gift off of my wish list I had asked for a large thinking it would be a little roomy for me I normally wear a unisex medium and discovered that it was not just roomy but huge My husband was swimming in it I exchanged the sweatshirt for a small which is still roomy but by just the right amount So they seem to run 2 sizes big The exchange took about 2 weeks 1 week to get there 1 week back not too bad I love my sweatshirt so it was worth the wait 
NFL Colt s Hoodie I bought this hooded sweatshirt for my son for Christmas I was very pleased with the quality of the sweatshirt and the price was very reasonable It s difficult to find Colts merchandise in our local area Delivery was fast for being ordered in December 
Not bad I bought a couple pairs of these for the price they aren t as good as the typical pair you d find in a gas station for 5 Shipping was quick These are silver mirrored not smoke black mirrored like the picture with the two pairs shows just be aware 
tres cute i love these sunglasses they are perfect sunglasses for any outfit i completely recommend them to everyone any sex age or style you will love them no matter wha 
Company Keeps It s Promise I searched my legs off had friends looking for the item friend said try the internet don t like buying without actually seeing been burned I looked and looked on the internet found your website and viewed the large mirror sunglasses NEED not just like the big ones instead of in small ones they appeared to be what I wanted so plunged in and bought 3 pair your company PROMISED and DELIVERED by the target date critical since didn t have any glasses left and will wonders never cease the items were as advertised and on time I am keeping your website on my FAVORITES 
quick service good product The robe was exactly as I hoped a twin for my husbands old favorite The service was very prompt 
To Hawaii 3 Islands And Home Again I needed something to carry on a Hawaii Tour that would hold everything I needed then some I really liked all the different sized pockets inside outside I could carry it over my shoulder or lengthen the strap wear it across the front It held on occasion all of my necessities my cell phone our itinery folder camera video batteries plus the video camera It wasn t too heavy to carry even with all of my stuff in it I love this bag 
Great Bag Great Service Just ordered my first Healthy Back bag from AmeriBag and I couldn t be happier The extra small size is perfect for use as an everyday bag carries my wallet iPod cell phone paperback novel and snacks with plenty of room to spare The Grasshopper Green color is fabulous a perfect shade of lime green that is very popular right now Stylish practical and comfortable My only complaints are 1 The middle pocket seen in the photo as holding a bottle of water is a little deceptive This pocket does not comfortably hold a full size water bottle only a 1 2 pint bottle Had I known that I might have ordered a larger size bag And 2 I agree with other reviewers that the exterior arch pocket should have velcro closure to securely hold your items namely a cell phone Otherwise this bag is perfect eBags provided excellent and very timely service I was very pleased with this transaction 
Healthy Back Bag I recently bought an extra small healthy back bag in black microfiber and am amazed at how much stuff it holds wallet cell phone glasses case digital camera address book etc Getting ready to wash it for the first time as the microfiber fabric tends to spot Just bought a taupe distressed nylon bag in quot small quot which is anything but small and can t wait to use it If you re into high fashion these bags are probably not for you but if you need to carry a lot of quot stuff quot around it s great 
Boy Short Feminine Look that is Way Sexy I have to say that after wearing these for a day that they did not disappoint I love the boy short look of these crotchless panties that are made in the USA They are made out of nylon so thin and wispy that it feels like you don t have anything on at all And boy do they look good I just can t get enough of looking at myself in the mirror 
Super speedo My man loves it He feels like he is wearing nothing at all 
Buena ropa de ba�o Para usar debajo del boardshort Las tallas pueden ir un poco chicas 
Solid Dive Suit I think that this is a great suit In my diving class I wear this suit by itself and like the extra coverage compared to the speedo brief In settings where it is not appropriate to wear just a speedo I wear it under my board shorts and it is a lot better than a pair of boxers or boxer briefs 
Nice Shoes These shoes are exactly what I expected from Aerosole s Correct sizing and great comfort 
Black and white earmuffs The earmuffs are warm and nicely made I am very pleased with them 
I love them I had seen these shoes in person but could not get my size I was thrilled when I was able to find them on Amazon They go with lots of stuff and look great Comfy too 
great shoes The shoes are a low heel can t wear high heels any more But are very sassy They fit well and make you feel beautiful 
Try them on before you buy I love these shoes but I had a heck of a time finding a pair that fit I debated buying a pair online because reviews were so mixed Then I saw them at Dillards in a better selection of colors for the same price no shipping fees I wear a size 9 and must have tried on 5 pairs before I found a 9 that fit like a glove Within the selection I was choosing from there was variation within the sizes some 9s were a half size too big some just right A reviewer on Zappos said that these shoes can be better molded to your feet if you warm them up in the dryer for a minute or two and then put them on 
Cuter Crocs I have two other pairs of Crocs but these Primas are my favorites They run about 1 2 to one size large I wear an 8 1 2 and the 8 was comfortable from day one They are also a bit wider than the normal M width They are virtually weightless There is a downfall precious little arch support 
Super Cute and Comfy I agree these DO run large The 7 runs more like a 7 5 to 8 so try before you cut the tags or wear outside The Primas are lightweight and stylish enough to wear while running after the kids running errands around town or walking the dog Would give 5 stars if the sizing was more accurate 
My favorite shoes I love my regular Crocs they are my staple shoe in summer but they re too informal for workdays My fiance got me this Prima style for the holidays and they have quickly become my favorite shoes They are as lightweight and comfortable as Crocs and also breathable Yet they are as cute as regular ballet flats I m going to buy another pair in silver As for the other reviewers complaining about a poor fit I wouldn t buy these shoes online unless you have tried them on in a store first but if you DO buy them try them on at home before going out so you can return them if they don t fit You can t expect every single shoe manufacturor to adhere to the exact same dimensions 
Disappointed with the shoes AND the customer service I bought a pair of the Prima Crocs only wore them for 2 days because the inner lining rubs painfully on my heel and the shoes turned my feet black A friend said Crocs were the most comfortable and breathable shoes she s ever worn so I was shocked with the Primas They re painful and don t breathe I emailed Crocs to ask if there was a way to stretch them out because they re unwearable and here was the reply from their customer service rep The Prima is our one style that is made for looks and comfort This style is not for everyone and if they are not stretching to where you need them with wear they might not be for you There are only 5 holes in the top of this very slim fitting shoe so how much air can get through there in the first place I personally have no problem with this style so I believe it depends on the person If you are dissatisfied you can try to take them back to where you bought them and see what they can do Thank you Cely Adams Customer Service Representative I typically search for reviews before i purchase a product if I had this info I wouldn t have bought them online I d recommend buying them someplace that is easy to return 
Just what I expected The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn t be happier I am going to buy another in a different color 
Great skin This is a great skin for a Treo 700 I have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that As others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc But the thickness gains you considerable protection I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type The function buttons are under the skin but easy to press 
Treo Skin The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to do Solid grip and non slip Would be nice if it was not so thick 
Great protection for my Treo I use this all of the time It gives good protection ease of use and good handling Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock However this is true of any protective skin Outstanding product 
Comfy These shoes are very comfortable The only problem is that now I don t want to wear anything else 
Second pair This is the second pair of these sandals I have bought for my kid They are great he can wear them with shorts or jeans and he is able to run with them 100 safe The material is great and soft and the first pair still looks new even after months of use I had to buy a new pair because his feet grew 
stride rite I used the measuring guide on line and ordered sandles for my son The fit was great the turn around time was impressive and the price was better than the Stride Rite stores Did I mention free shipping I would definatly buy through Amazon again Deb 
High Quality I was very impressed with quality these shoes Very durable and the wheels are easily removable Just use caution the size runs small 
good basic nursing bra This is an inexpensive basic nursing bra It is comfortable and the opening is well sized for feeding not too small or big Good support 
Great fit good value I bought six of these Of all the nursing bras I tried I liked this one the best 
Best bra ever and inexpensive This is my favorite bra I bought 60 nursing bras and grabbed this one on the way out and it turned out to be the best It is soft comfortable has good support great straps a lot of hooks in the back to make looser or tighter and has a perfect sized opening for breast feeding Some bras have too small or too big an opening and make breast feeding difficult This bra is great I have almost stopped breastfeeding and still wear it 
Perfect running shoe for the right feet I had my foot fitted at a running store and this is the shoe they said would be a good match for my foot and gait It is wonderful no breaking in Highly recommended if you know this is the right shoe for you 
Good Quality Product This US Kids product is high quality and perfect for the young golfer who plays in a variety of climate 
Friggin Awesome Shoes Just like the cavase hi top all stars we all know and love only the are LEATHER They have the same look and feel as a Black Leather Jacket I love these shoes 
As Advertised I received my order in a shorter time than expected and it was just as it was ordered No problems whatsoever It was as if I had gone to the store and picked them out myself I highly recommend the product and the supplier I will definitely order this way again LorRae Nelso 
Functional and Cute Nice backpack We bought it for our trip to Disneyland On the ride we wore it backwards so that we could be strapped into our seats without the pack behind us The simple one strap system made it really easy to slip on and off 
RUNS VERY SMALL Runs very small 2x is more like a large Order larger than you think you need 
Moccasins Rock I bought the Moccasins as a gift for my mother in law she has been looking for a pair for a really long time Well I found these Moccasisns she absolutely LOVEs them Thanks for the great gift Michell 
Love this bra I love it I tried so many nursing bras before my friend recommended this one I m even on this page so that I can buy a new one It s so comfortable supportive and a great style There s no underwire and the snaps are great It s worth the money so don t be turned off by the price It s so much better paying a little extra for a super comfortable bra which you really need when you re breastfeeding 
Well made and came on time The ear muffs were delivered in a timely manner and they are great Good quality I love the bag they come in 
Cotton Slip Comfort I have enjoyed wearing it with longer skirts I prefer cotton to nylon and was unable to find 100 cotton slips in department stores so I was glad to be able to purchase this item through Amazon com 
Great transaction The dress was perfect for our wedding s flower girls The dresses run really large so the seller should post the measurements on the site because it did take a little bit of time to get the measurements Once shipped received super fast Thanks 
nice sandal these sandals are really nice and comfortable although the wedge is a little higher than i would have liked the style and color are very attractive and allows me to wear these sandals to work with a skirt or on weekends with capris or jeans 
Absolutely Perfect This dress is everything I expected plus more It s wonderfully soft looks just like the photo and fits perfectly I was concerned that my somewhat modest bust wouldn t fill out the dress but it worked out nicely I can t wait to wear it to prom Daughter of Carl Wyat 
GREAT This jersey is never hanging in the closet My son loved it he would wear it everyday if I would let him Thanks 
small pouch I like the style it fits in the back and the waist band fits well but the pouch is a bit small Because of the seam down the middle I thought it would have more of a pouch 
Best comfort ever Great fit Everything is in it s right place so nothing slips out Really like the stile 
Too wide for Asian people It s a very nice pant However I think it s too wide for Asian people So I decide to get refund However the quality is very good after all So I still recommend it to Ameriacans 
For Christmas My uncle who lives in Vermont also lives in cargo pants During the winter season he wears the fleece lined ones and the other seasons the regular cargo pants 
Barbie Nightgown This is high quality clothing that I will be proud to give as a gift I am very satisfied 
barely there I am getting married in a few months I wanted panty that i would not have a seem This were the right ones 
Bang For Your Buck This ipod accessory is probably the best one I ve bought so far especially considering that it only cost about 10 It was really simple to use just plug and play The most complicated thing you have to do is switch the iPod TV feature to ON how simple is that If you want to view your videos from your iPod on your TV screen accept no substitute I used these while I was deployed to South West Asia and they worked like a charm 
GREAT ITEM You just plug the jack into your iPod and the pins into the Analog Video slots on the TV and in the video sideshow settings go to video out and choose either on or ask Use video out when sending videos photos to the TV and it show up perfectly Great item 
Easy to use The AV cable came quickly The design of the cables are easy to use just tell the iPod you are going to use the TV 
Very pleased The handmade beaded handbag is very well made and I received this item is a very timely manner I would recommed this seller 
Great I would have given this five stars but it seems to fit a little looser than marked 
High quality shirt excellent customer service This is a beautiful high quality tee with a subtle tie dye background and has of course the beautiful artwork on it My family has purchased this type of shirt in the past and they hold up a long time Definitely a recommended product I contacted customer service over an issue that turned out to be my mistake and they were VERY accomodating in trying to correct my problem and when I realized that I had made the mistake they were just excellent and forgiving This company is A+++++++ just excellent Thanks so much Lisa 
Great commuter bag Very sturdy bag Not too big or too small Perfect for the daily commute on the subway 
Great little bag awesome bag I love Timbuk2 This is my 2nd bag and I basically bought this one to have a smaller bag to use at different times when I don t want to lug my laptop around It s made well and looks cool what more could you want 
Bag Review The Timbuk2 class messenger bag is great Holds quite a bit for it s size Very useful and good quality 
Very happy I recently got a 15 MacBook Pro and needed a larger bag to accommodate it replacing my Manhattan Portage 1640 Waxed Canvas Messenger Bag which I loved I ordered and returned several things before settling on this I am very happy It is a durable smartly designed bag and pretty much a perfect fit for the MacBook Pro stored inside of a sleeve case At first I thought I would replace my Manhattan Portage bag which was just barely too small for the MacBook Pro with the bigger version of the same bag the 1635 But that bag was WAY too big the MacBook was swimming in there This bag is a comfortable fit with a little room on either side of the MacBook when the bag isn t too full And there is plenty of room to carry a number of regular books or whatever else in addition to the MacBook It also has an ideal number of smaller pockets not too many not too few for storing accessories For my needs the pockets are intelligently placed and sized so I feel like there is a place for everything and I don t feel like there are any useless pockets Most of the smaller pockets are inside the main compartment on the side opposite the one that s against your body when you re wearing the bag This makes them convenient to access while the bag is on And one problem I had with the Manhattan Portage bag was that the smaller pockets were on the side that s against your body so whatever was in the main compartment of the bag would get in the way of accessing the smaller pockets Since these are on the opposite side the pockets are easy to get to even when the bag is relatively full One of the pockets has a key ring but unlike some bags this one is attached to a long leash so the keys can actually sit at the bottom of the pocket until you need them They don t get in the way when you are trying to get other things out but when you do want them you just fish them out by grabbing the top of the leash A waterproof liner was an essential feature when I was searching for a bag I m paranoid about being caught in a downpour with my laptop and although this one hasn t been put to the test yet it seems even better than my previous bag which always kept the contents dry One problem with the Manhattan Portage bag was that when the flap was closed there were gaps at the top on both sides near where the shoulder strap attaches Although this bag has a similar design it doesn t seem to have the same problem I do wish this bag came with a shoulder pad for the strap but that is my only complaint and I m sure I can purchase one separately And the price on Amazon is significantly cheaper than I could find anywhere else so I can put my savings toward the shoulder strap 
Extremely simple and durable bag This bag is excellent if you re looking for a simple bag to carry anything from books to laptop I did not want one of those bags that had 50 different pockets because the more pockets you have the easier it is to misplace stuff and end up confusing yourself The bag is extremely durable as I have traveled the world with it and it has stood up to quite a beating Actually the bag still looks relatively new for how much abuse I have put it through I have never used it while biking but if you ever visit San Francisco California you will see almost every bike messenger using this bag 
Won t buy any others I just bought these and they are incredible I ve never worn such comfortable boots I ve had a lot of foot ankle pain post pregnancy and it s disappeared I can t say enough great things about them I just ordered another pair A+++ 
Cute These shoes have gotten a lot of compliments and they look great with jeans or capris The only thing is that I had to order a half size smaller than I normally wear for it to fit They do pinch and poke a bit around the toes but this definitely goes away after wearing it a few times and wearing those sandal or toe socks helps with the comfort too in the beginning 
Nine West Women s Bobbette Ballet Flat Very uncomfortable The strap near the toes cuts into the feet and creates severe blisters Very disappointing 
Best socks I ve ever owned These socks are great They re of a very high quality and aren t paper thin like other cheaper socks I can t imagine these ever becoming threadbare or getting holes in them I ordered several sets and will be ordering more I already got rid of most of the other socks I owned 
Heavy Socks Very well made USA These socks are heavyweight good for winter Very generous sizing Good fit I like them 
Gold Toe Weekend Quality I got these socks to wear to work since I work in a business casual environment And I made a BIG mistake when I bought them I should have gotten several packages at the same time They re very comfortable and are holding up a lot better than my department store brand socks ever did One pair of those had a hole after two or three wearings They are definitely thicker than a dress sock and slightly thicker than some casual socks so if your shoes fit very tightly these are probably not the socks you want They are not as thick as a heavy winter wool or hiking sock however They are great with my casual shoes though and work very well with my work shoes I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for socks The colors were very nice too Nice to get some quality socks that aren t shocking white for a change 
Gift I bought this as a Christmas gift and my sister in law and she loved it 
Great Socks These are the best money can buy they wear much longer than other socks 
Pleased Bought these for my daughter She was looking for a lightweight comfortable shoe and this one fit the bill They are comfortable to wear at work as well as around the house she says 
I really like these they look like men s socks should good old fashioned ribbed hose I am not of fan of plain socks for men and certainly not sheers socks they look hose for women These have a comforting old style appeal with a nice mix of contempary colours they go with just about any outfit They are made well of good quality fabric whcih won t let you get uncomfortably hot or cold And the price is very good They last a long time too 
Wide Rib Crew Socks The socks really look great and are offered at a great price 
CHIC I can dance and twirl in these adorable gaucho s The fabric just flows the width of the skirt leg make you dressy and yet you have the security of pants I would recommend these for dressist to casual depending on what you where with them 
ELEGANT I am 5 5 and wear this with my new knee high boots these gaucho s are long enough so you do not see any bare leg which is what I wanted And with a Sweater of any style and color I feel elegant as the fabric just swings and flows I get many turned heads Very easy to wash throw in the dryer no iron and good to go I bought these in the black and brown they are go everywhere gaucho s as you can dress them way up or down according to the look you want plus they travel well no wrinkles Would certainly buy again 
they re Grrrreat I love em I want more I wish they came in some different colors and next time I will get the shorter boxer brief from them Other than that they re Grrrrrreat I love the fit and feel 
To my exact measure Doubt to buy footwear without measuring it but using the timberland charts was the best thing The footwear is perfect its finish and presentation It is a little I joust at the beginning but it molds quickly to your foot They are of good material but something delicate and suceptible to be strea 
I love it I bought this shoe for my sister It looks great and she was amazed with it light wieght as if she is wearing nothing she said it was comfortable and its weight made her wear it with every suit she wears Go for it the BRAND Merrell is one of my greatest brands so I wanted her to try it and feel what I experienced with Merrell shoes 
Clarks sandals These look good and are comfortable but I wish they sold them in half sizes 
Simply the best tennis shoe made ever period Long ago far away when I was on multiple tennis teams both for schools and private clubs I happened upon my first pair of Stan Smiths It was of course at the behest of my far wiser than I then knew or appreciated tennis instructor but I nevertheless relented and purchased a pair Not only were they the best pair of tennis shoes I had ever worn but they were also the most comforable They still are to this day and in an era where shoes are become more and more of an esoteric item it is immensely satisfying to see adidas still making these classics such as the sambas for soccer and such as good old canvas chuck taylors for basketball In any case I still wear these to this day when not traversing about in brogues and I cannot recommend them highly enough Do yourself a favor and get a pair You will not regret it 
Great underwear Me too I needed an underwear like that SO BAD Very comfortable and fits me perfectly 
Oh Yeah Just the photo makes me want to rush out to buy this item 
white scrubs Pro s I got my package within three days I did recieve what I ordered The size charts were a big help and the pants fit pretty good Con s On the description it says the scrubs have a high thread count and our made of non see through material That is wrong The pants are soo see through that you can see the color of my legs and my white undergarments 
put it out there boys These are the male equivalent of the lift and separate bra Helps you proudly display your belongings if that s what you want 
Absolutely Love these Shoes These shoes are wonderful The comfort of a sneaker that you can where to work with no one the wiser I highly recommend these to any woman who wants comfort at work and away 
I was skeptical like when I buy anything of these but they are SOOO comfortable They do run big for example I m a 7 5 usually but I bought 7 s and I wear them with thick socks and they aren t tight so buy a size smaller if you re in between They are amazing though I was really impressed at how cute and well put together they are 
A great fit I gave these boots to my daughter for Christmas She loved them and they fit really well They run larger for their size which is good because my daughter is a size 11 They do run big but fit her great They also are a great quality And they are very much in fashion Great choice 
Great Service I had multiple questions and this vendor was fast in responding to my concerns The delivery was reasonably quick as well 
Boots It was awesome It got to me quickly and are very comfy boots I was very impressed Great job 
just what I expected I love my boots They look just like they did in the picture and they are very comfortable I would buy this brand again and I would use Amazon again 
I love these pants These pants are very stylish made well and cozy My only complaints with any drawstring pants during pregnancy is they have a tendancy to slide down throughout the day thats my experience anyway but it doesn t change my 5 star rating because I think its just inevitable that happens with drawstrings and pregnancy and overall these pants are really great A little pricey but worth it 
Excellent Quality Speedy Service Carhartt is a well known design for rugged outdoor work type clothing but this jacket is soft to the touch as well as warm from the thermal insulation I am confident I will have many years of wear from this jacket Also I would like to comment on the speedy delivery eventhough it was during Christmas time I received the jacket before expected or estimated I highly recommend this item 
Inside Gear is In to Stay This is the second pair of clothing I own by this manufacturer The pants are comfortable to wear and roomy Not really cool to wear on a hot day There seems to be a double layer of nylon that traps your body heat in the air pockets but hey who wants to wear pants on a hot day right 
very versatile My husband is the wearer of these pants and wears them often now He likes the versatility of the pants and he gets lots of comments about them They are made of parachute type of material and they are noisy pants when he walks swoosh swoosh noises His only complaint is that somtimes they tend to be a bit hot so they don t breathe well And when they get too hot for pants he turns them into shorts voila 
Best jogging bra ever As a 36C runner this is the best bra on the market After trying at least 10 15 different sports bras I will say definitively this is the best bra for running The bra flattens out the breasts to prevent bouncing No discomfort at all No soreness after a run Best bra I highly recommend it And I recommend in general buying one size smaller than your everyday bra for a tighter more secure fit Happy trails 
Not Bad For Just A Shirt Not bad for just a shirt Very durable and matched my teams colors perfectly Its just a shirt but it helped my team and I go on to greatness 
nice looking Great looking pair of shoes The elastic on the big toe is a little too tight May be after some time of ware it will be better 
Excellent sandals LifeStride Sue Slingback sandals are the best buy for the shoes I ever made Soft comfortable long lasting and washable I highly recommend them 
Women s Shoes I don t know about you but I just love women s shoes I have at least 7 pairs 
Good quality These shorts are really nice my son loves them They fit him well and are very comfortable Even though they are not a name brand I see no difference Would buy again Thanks 
Look a bit goofy but they work great They do what they re supposed to do no more no less I think you might want something a bit warmer if you live somewhere very cold They are a bit insulated but when it gets chilly I can feel it Mind you I live in Atlanta GA so if you re colder than that get warmer gloves or some good inserts 
I did not receive the merchandise I cannot comment nothing therefore I did not receive the merchandise It would like to know when I go to receive the product 
What a silly thing to write my first review about but As a person who hates to wear pantyhose I love these They re are incredibly light you might feel like you re putting spiderwebs on your legs Apologies to the squeamish reader But they do for your legs what a great foundation will supposedly do for your face even blend and match your natural skin tone When I wear these people don t know it I ve gotten compliments on how smooth my legs look even when they re positively hairy And yet I don t feel at ALL like I have sausage legs I don t know how they balance this mix of delicate non obstruction and flawless color blending but I sure am psyched about it As you can tell by the fact that I wrote my first Amazon com review about them 
Great Coats This is a fine lab coat It meets all our needs in the lab coat area 
Venditore OK Spedizione da migliorare Tutto ok per venditore e prodotto La spedizione internazionale dovrebbe comprendere il corriere espresso La posta normale tende ad abbandonare l articolo sulla porta di casa con il rischio di un furto da parte di un malintenzionato Inoltre i tempi di consegna troppo lunghi non permettono di pianificare eventuali regali Ho acquistato l articolo per regalarlo a mia moglie ma purtroppo � arrivato dopo San Valentino sigh 
Great Dressage Rider s Bra I started wearing the Shock Absorber Support Level 3 sports bras when I lived in England As a Dressage rider competitor sitting a big moving horses trot can cause a lot of stress and damage on a woman s body I find that this bra helps minimize the bounce and associated stresses Since moving back to the USA I continue to buy mine through Figleaves and was not aware of any differences between USA or European versions of this bra Anyway if you ride horses and want a good riding bra that can is still comfortable to wear all the time this could be a good one for you 
not the prettiest bra but does the job Controls bounce without compression stays in place no chafing or strap slippage great for anyone who prefers a hook in back style to the pull over the head contortionist models BUT the seamed cups look really retro and not in a good way under thin cotton knits like t shirts Think 1950 s bras and Madonna s cone bustier phase 
just another average sports bra Don t waste your hard earned dinero on this one I like to consider myself very athletic and well endowed This bra doesn t absorb any shock so to speak It s a gimick Also I have had this contraption for a lil over a month and it s allready ripping I actually avoid this particular sports bra at all costs Just my 2 cents 
Triton Swim fins These fins were just as good as the speedos with the price savings being the factor in my selection I would highly recommend the 
Pleased Great Quality These are just like the ones our kids used at YMCA swim lessons Nice flexible rubber Seems like great quality The kids love how flippers really increase their swim speed 
Awesome I have been wearing these for a while These are the same as you would pay 50 00 or so if it had the big name Quality is A1 I sweat a lot and these help with that 
Awesome handbag My husband bought this bag for me for our anniversary I love it I want it in some of the other great colors I love the pockets on the inside It does not look or feel like a big bag but has a lot of room on the inside Overall a great buy 
Fantastic Handbag My Mother bought this for me on my birthday and I must say that I absolutely love it It s solid and thick but not too heavy There s plenty of room inside for organizing I especially like the 2 side pockets on the inside good for cell phone pens gum or whatever It also has a zipper pocket inside like with most handbags You can fit enough stuff in here like it s a large handbag but the overall size still looks like a medium sized one 
Nice socks I mean they re socks and I ordered them on a whim from Amazon Beats the hell out of shopping and they arrived on time So 5 stars for giving me what I wanted at a good price without wandering a mall 
good item I bought this for my brother to keep in his office and it will be perfect for that It seems a little cheap but it actually works great for what it is I gave it to him with a tie in it already and he really liked it a lot 
Business travelers this is a must You will never have to worry about your ties when traveling again Wildties Tie Winder is complete You know which tie you are grabbing by the clear plastic The ties stay wound and come out without any crinks or knots or any other damage It is easily workable both in winding up and taking the tie out This will keep your ties looking professional and crisp 
High quality at low cost I was very pleased with this outfit The pieces were all lined which is very rare these days The pieces were well made and very attractive I will be buying more from this clothing line in the future 
Exactly what I wanted I bought this jacket for my dad He liked the old classic style which it was not easy to find right now This jacket was exactly what he wanted and it was very good for late spring and early summer I gave this jacket a five stars 
very nice well made I wasn t too sure about buying a jacket online because of sizing variance but this one fit perfect Thinking about getting another one in a different color because it is a great 3 season jacket just not warm enough for cold days during winter 
HOT HOT HOT I bought these last year for my Boyfriend as a Christmas present WE love them They fit him well they re soft and close fitting He describes them as nice and comfy from a male US Marine that says alot LOL He likes them so much he shows them off to all his guy friends running around in his underwear calling them his European man underwear They re great if you want your man to look sexy or if You want to look sexy MUST BU 
bike shorts very happy with quality of shorts delivery took nearly two weeks however 
My daughter picked these out and loves them The sunglasses are exactly what my daughter wanted As a parent I am not that concerned with the style but I appreciate the large lense area which gives reasonably good protection from UV rays 
wear for all occasions These are comfortable make your foot appear smaller and they are just as good with jeans as they are with a dress The leather detailing is unusal and attractive Wear them and you will recieve compliments 
I m a satisfied customer I previously ordered the men s capris from this company and I loved them so much I decided to buy these Like the capris these pants fit perfectly This is a great company I ll probably do more business with them in the future 
Lily Padz I love the convenience of the Lily Padz I was a little hesitant to spend that much money on something that sounded too good to be true but they have proven to be well wrth the money They are easy and quick to use and can be worn under anything As a new mom I barely have time to get dressed half of the time so searching in the laundry for a clean bra on short notice isn t always an option Lily Padz take maybe 30 seconds to apply and then I m good to go 
Excellent mostly As a breastfeeding mother it s important to me that I keep my bras dry and leak free not to mention my clothes I ve been using my Lily Padz since my daughter now nearly 4 weeks old was a few days old We had latch on problems initially so I used washable pads until my nipples healed I really like this product It s smooth under clothing and it clings pretty reliably It isn t perfect but it doesn t claim to be When I have a gushing let down nothing will contain it not Lily Padz nor cloth breast pads That s a little disappointing but I suppose it s to be expected I only wish that the tackiness held up a little better I have tended lovingly to my Lily Padz following instructions on washing and drying and what not In fact I only wear them during the day At night I wash them before I go to bed and leave them on the domes to dry over night using the washables at night Despite following the instructions on Lily Padz maintenance very carefully I feel they ve lost their tackiness and I worry about their effectiveness So far no big problems but I d feel more secure if they did not appear to have started to wear out already Still they re totally worth the investment and I may just buy another pair so I can alternate and keep wear to a minimum 
Wonderful but These are so great but I just wish the stickyness would last longer I have no complaints though I do have to say that at first I did experience a little itching but I m pretty sure that was just due to the fact I was putting something new on that I d never felt before It went away within a few hours And they do work well to prevent leaks but just to be sure check every now then to make sure milk isn t building up too much in there I had to release some build up milk every now then 
great breast pads I wish I would have had these right after giving birth They are great when you have to wear pads all of the time in the beginnning Disposable pads are thick and show through your clothes These feel really good on sore nips if you refrigerate them They did not work well for me when I had to go longer at night without feeding They leaked the first couple of days my body was getting used to 5 or 6 hours without feeding I will now give these to every breastfeeding friend as a shower gift 
love love love it Why did it take so long for someone to think of this I wish I had it for my other baby It works fantastic never a leak never an infection never a problem And I produce milk like crazy since my son is only one month old and I have not regulated yet Best buy yet for me FYI be sure to clean them properly use white vinegar be sure to use the lowest setting if blow drying them and be sure to attach them fully to avoid leaks If there is even a small area that is not covered your milk can accumulate there and even leak if left too long 
LOVE IT I loved these I used them for the 6 months breastfeeding and they worked wonderful I was very sensitive to anything and these were great for avoiding friction of the bra and no leaking I recommend these to every breastfeeding mother out there Wash them with soap and water in the shower and put them back on when you get out That simple God Bless the person that thought of these ame 
No Wet Stinky Breast Pads Here I absolutely love this product I have been nursing for over 8 months now and have been using THE SAME BREAST PADS No not just the same brand but the very same two breast pads I brought to the hospital when I gave birth These things are the coolest things As long as you keep them clean they will adhere to the breasts and stop leakage just as the description promises Furthermore these are also great if you are planning on returning to work while pumping continuing to nurse They are very thin and the profiles are smooth so you won t have to worry about that bulky obviously nursing look which ruins many a beautiful blouse At first I had a little problem getting them absolutely clean but I then I used my body glove to scrub them while I was in the shower and voila I have not been tempted to write another review of any other products I have but I just can t believe more women have not discovered the wonder of these things Another possible drawback is that the pads by nature don t allow for air circulation I suggest removing them for as long as you can for a few hours a day so the skin around your nipples can breathe Removing each pad after a feeding works well for me but you will know what works best for you In any case take a look at the price That s all I have spent on pads in 8 months What a bargain and an even bigger convenience Kudos to the makers of Lily Padz A great shower gift too if you know someone who is expecting to breastfteed 
Nice shoes For dance play or to wear as dress shoes these are very nice They fit well and my daughter loves to wear them They are comfortable to her The heel tends to slip off a bit but a half size smaller might fix that I doubt these will last a super long time but that s because they are at the mercy of a three year old 
the best This is the most comfortable brief you ll ever wear Unless you like the feel of shifting tugging and binding these are the panties you want They stay in place and stretch all ways for a perfect fit no matter what your particular shape Love em Wish Sears would have kept the line going but I ll buy them from anywhere I can get them 
The most comfy panties ever Bali has always been a good name in ladies underwear but I was actually surprised that these panties are SO nice I bought a certain brand of panties from JC Penney for years and then they discontinued them so I ve been trying out new brands The Bali are the best 
Possible the best wearing shoes I ve ever owned Comfort is the number one consideration when I purchase shoes and I most always go for the comfort brands This was my first pair of Earth Shoes but I will be purchasing more I highly recommend them They wear great 
Just Fun I can t give you a professional review on these but my daughter is 7 and she hasn t taken them off since Christmas she dances as she walks in the kitchen and to her room She wears a size 1 and I got her a size 2 they are a little big but there are pull strings to form them to your feet so they snugged down nice 
Great socks These socks are so comfortable I play a lot of golf when it is HOT HOT HOT Received REALLY QUICK 
Great Water Shirt I bought my fair skinned red headed husband one of the these shirts to have for a cruise to Mexico He wore it snorkeling swimming and SCUBA diving He loved it It protected him from the sun It dried quickly and looked good in and out of the water It isn t as tight as the rash protection shirts so it wears more like a t shirt but my husband preferred the more loose fit The fabric is perfect for water He even wore it on our cruise ship to dine at the buffet table after a swim since it looked so good We liked it so much we bought one for my father who also has fair skin He said it was his favorite gift If you need sun protection but still want to be active in water and sun this is a great shirt to have You do have to hand wash it and hang to dry but I just soak it in cool water with Tide then rinse and hang It s a snap We re avid swimmers SCUBA divers and snorkelers This is one of our must have s in our gear box 
A Very Nice Shirt This shirt is 100 crinkle cotton It has a slightly rougher texture because of the crinkle but is not stiff or uncomfortable It seems to be well made and the colors are very bright It will shrink in the wash unless you do all cold but it is fairly true to size if not a little on the large side It s also not too short which is nice for those with longer torsos In the blue color the shirt looks nice enough to be worn as a semi dressy blouse It s good enough to wear to the office 
Black Belt with White Cross I got the black belt with a white cross and a black buckle I really like this belt I wear it with my paramedic pants It is easy to adjust the size and it looks great with my black pants and white shirt my uniform 
Excellent product This demi bra it s an excellent product because it fit s very well and the materials are very resistant to the wash machine and the time 
Almost Nothing It s like wearing almost nothing at all Tired of wearing the same old boxers or briefs Then you should think of buying this kind of underwear Nice to wear them in pants or jeans but I suggest you wear them while you sleep naked 
Great value I needed a specific style of sneaker and I was able to type in the description and get it without running all over town looking for this specific one Yippee 
rainboots I love my anchor rainboots They are the talk of the town Last week it rained all the time and the boots worked like a charm Also delivery was quick and that always rocks 
A+ review for boots These boots are sturdy comfortable and warm Great purchase and quick delivery 
Great deal The bags are great AWESOME price too The material is a little stiff but for the price I can deal 
Style and Grace Shipping was excellent The shoe wears well Very stylist for pants and suits 
Great shoes Very impressed with the shipping and the delivery of the shoes They are exactly as the ad described them and they are very comfortable It s hard finding shoes in 13EEE or 14 I ll definitely order from them again 
An excellent value shoe and comfort too I have had this pair of shoe for almost 8 months now and I must say that it is my most comforable pair ever I have owned everything from Rockports Hush puppies Bill Blass and Payless and these have the most support and cushion of any of them and they have been durable Although I can t say that I have owned any fitted italian leather shoes A couple of pairs of dress shoes I have bought have run around 120 to 150 this is significantly less and has held up better and more comfort I bought mine at a larger retailer on sale for 30 and I commonly see them on sale here at Amazon or at som retail outlets in or around malls These shoes are a great investment for everyday use and my job does involve significant walking and the shoes will help you the Kentech system in them is outstanding and cool looking as well So this is a great purchase for value comfort and overlooked because it is not the name brand 
Best playtime fun This costume is high quality and nothing like what is in the stores The handcuffs are a little cheap but the costume in top notch Its something he continues to play with after Halloween is over The photos are priceless looks like the real thing 
Halloween was a hit This costume was awesome I got compliments each time my son wore it this year It is the most authentic police uniform style costume on the market Complete with gold buttons removable epaulets and a shoulder cord holding a whistle attached so safe for little ones The hat also was designed just like a real police uniform hat I bought the size 4 costume for my 3 year old and since it was a little big I got different pants to match the navy blue shirt I stitched on patches from the PD that my husband and I work for over the patches that came on the shirt though they would have been fine too I also sewed a little gold badge over the badge patch that comes on the shirt I tucked a small flashlight in the holster and hung handcuffs out of his back pocket He was so excited to dress like us daddy especially and the photos are priceless Only negative The handcuffs that come with the set are flimsy metal and appear they could cut a child I just bought a different cheap pair in a set with the small badge at a toy store You can t go wrong with this costume very authentic My child will be able to use it for dress up for several more years 
Naughty Monkey Women s Motor Psyche Boot Brown These boots are just as they appear but I should have bought something that looked a little less like a motorcycle boot which the title pretty much tells it all They are comfortable and the color was just like the description Well made boots Shipped very fast 
These boots are hot but with drawbacks I ordered these boots because I wanted something comfortable and edgy flat to wear with skirts and cropped pants These are perfect in style The leather is decent quality for the price and they look absolutely fantastic on They are very comfortable I can t be any more pleased with the way they look and the feel The drawbacks however were disappointing I have narrow calves anyway but these boots shafts are so wide they flap around my calves like sails I can literally stuff my fist in between my calf and the boot without stretching the boot The straps and buckles aren t adjustable so I m not going to be able to wear them with skirts as I had planned because they ll look pretty silly like I m stomping around in my grandfather s waders or something They are also very wide in the heel even with socks my heel slipped up and down If you have very wide calves or don t plan on wearing them with anything other than long pants I can t recommend them enough Like I said they are decent quality well lined and they look great on I just wish I d had warning about the width before I ordered them 
Love them I bought these boots in black and love them No break in period and they feel so nice You can put your jeans in the boot and on the way you go The top of the boot is nice and roomy I am going to buy them in brown as I really love these boots 
Beautiful bag Just a beautiful bag I bought it for use with my 15 Powerbook The powerbook just barely fits but it does fit so don t use it with anything larger The flap fastens with magnets which seems mostly to just keep it from flapping around it does not keep the flap closed very securely But the material is top notch and it looks fantastic Highly recommended Update 2 or 3 months after getting this bag the leather which binds the shoulder strap to the main bag split making the shoulder strap unusable However the seller has been extremely helpful in taking care of the situation and the manufacturer is looking at the stitching in their design to see if it needs to be strengthened I look forward to getting my great bag back 
Storia Leather Messenger I purchased this bag in classic dark leather a month ago The rich brown color shown in the pictures is not fake the bag looks gorgeous It needs no breaking in but will become softer after use The bag is thick enough to feel substantial but not stiff as to feel uncomfortable I ve found it to be the perfect size large enough to carry the items I need for school without being bulky Given the high cost I would have liked the bag to come with a longer warranty It is only 1 year If you are looking to purchase this bag you can do so at a slightly cheaper cost directly through the US distributor at Marcopoloni com 
A nice little tank This tank is pretty with the lace accents and the red is very vibrant The fit is snug 
choosing a the right fit If you are used to Levi s or the regular Wrangler jeans here s some help in choosing a the right fit for this This jean is the slim version of classic Cowboy Cut jean that Wrangler has been making since 1947 Among the Levi s jeans the fit of this jeans is most similar to that of the Levi s 512 but it is cut slimmer in the seat It doesn t have as much orange stitching as a Levi s the back pockets sit higher It has a zipper fly The so called rigid denim looks a lot like the shrink to fit rigid denim of the Levi s button fly 501 when new and will lose a lot of indigo dye on the first wash but that s where the resemblance ends The 501 shrinks about 10 but the Wrangler shrinks less than 3 because it is Sanforized So you should buy your correct size erring on the side of slightly larger if you are right on the border Compared to the regular the Wrangler Cowboy Cut the this slim Fit is quite a bit skimpier The slim fit seat is smaller and the legs are pretty trim it s more of a boy s cut If you are really on the thin side it may work for you but many men will find it too constricting in the waist and seat Wranglers stonewash finishes are pretty mainstream compared to some of the more exotic things Levi s is doing now These definitely are not so called destructed jeans You won t find whiskering or abrasion the way you will on the stonewash Levi s Overall these are very solid well made jeans that offer a nice alternative to the more popular Levi s models Like Levi s they are well made and indestructible 
Great Robe for a Great Price I bought this robe as a Christmas present for my girlfriend She loves it It was a lot more plush than I thought it would be and it s been keeping her warm through the cold New England winter 
Never play without it Heat gear is great I use it when playing box lacrosse When playing in an arena in the summer you really need to wear clothing that is comfortable and helps to keep you cool especially with all your other safety gear After wearing heat gear once under your pads you will never play again without it 
Save your money avoid C in2 buy something well made Uncomfortable Poor quality Bad Customer Service Nice box advertising I purchased 3 of these different colors never having owned this brand I purchased from another online retailer not Amazon One had a tag that read Medium which didn t match the size on the box or the size ordered which was Large Upon calling the online retailer all of their stock in the color gray was the same situation Returned it and received a replacement pair size Large which was significantly bigger than either of the other 2 pair which were supposed to be size Large I called C in2 to express my dissatisfaction with the initial stock mix up of all gray pair received no response Lastly the sling advertised sounds better in theory than it is After a couple of minutes the sling gets uncomfortable feels like a paper cut 
Speedo All about quality I have owned this drag suit for about six months and it is still as nice not discolored in the slightest as it was when I first bought it Six months is not an extremely long amount of time but when you consider that it lasted through a three month swim season with two hour practices 6 days a week in a pool filled with chlorine the quality is undeniable The Speedo company has proven that it designs quality products and this drag suit is no exception 
Cute shoes These are comfortable cute shoes Didn t require any break in time Toe does turn up a bit but I really like the look 
very cute very cute that i own two pairs they require a little breaking in but then they re good to go good for work or play 
Perfect Pumps Comfy and pretty these are like the PERFECT shoes I get so many compliments on them Shiny leather low ish heel make these ideal 
Another pair please I bought 4 pairs of this shoe in 3 colors in Macys over the last 3 months I LOVE THIS SHOE I have been in search for my size and there it was on Amazon It goes with almost any outfit and is super great when you have to wear heels and work retail 
Very Cute Shoe I just received my KC shoes yesterday LOVE THEM Pretty color in style and I can walk comfortably in them Perfect with any pant or even jeans on a Friday or Saturday night Love the rubber grip on the bottom keeps you from slipping sliding Only drawback I wish they had a higher heel but overall they are great shoe Would order again from Amazon 
Very comfortable This was my first pointed toe and heel of this sort and I was concerned it may not be comfortable I was happily surprised The shoe was very comfortable I wore them twice on all night affairs and there were absolutely no problems with fit 
goggle reading glasses The reading glasses are both fun and functional but the service and people make any purchase with this company well worth trying I would recommend checking out goggle just for the service 
You should list under artwork Reading is fun again I love them send me 8 more pair 
Very very cool and comfortable Had my glasses in 3 days and love them I wish I would have ordered 2 pair 
socks outstanding product but peculiar pricing on some of the colors would have been a 5 but for that 
Comfortable I never wear socks I bought these because I needed a pair of white socks for something They are so soft and comfortable I will be buying more in different colors 
XL Crew cotton socks The best crew socks on the market for men with large feet I wear a size 13 shoe and most socks are not big enough These socks fit great and stay soft after many washings 
Great Boots I love this boot They are cute warm and comfortable After reading another happy customers review I did decide to order a half size larger the boots do run small 
Warm and toasty These boots are great I work outside and they keep my feet dry and warm 
WARM COMFY STYLISH I bought these boots to go to Idaho this Christmas I was born and raised in TEXAS so you KNOW this southern girl is not used to SNOW I wore them on the plane and everything getting to Idaho Well they did not get the snow they had last year when we were there but my toes sure were nice and comfy unlike last year They kept my feet nice and warm they are comfortable to wear and they are not heavy I LOVE MY PURCHASE 
Warm I wish it would snow already These are nice they seem to run a tad big so if your an in betweener like me then go with the smaller Seem like they are good quality and hope to be able to put them to the test soon 
Love these boots Great value These boots fit perfect they re warm and they are super cute Great purchase 
The best cheap rain jacket I originally got this jacket as a just in case jacket It s extremely lightweight and it feels kind of like Tyvek But here s the weird thing The dang thing works It doesn t have vents or pockets or anything but manages to keep the rain out and not get super condensed on the inside with sweat It s the one rain jacket I took with me on my 2500 mile Canada to Mexico ride along the Great Divide The first day it poured and this jacket did great It s never leaked and I ve used it a ton in rides around my home turf of the Pacific Northwest After 10 months of pretty hard use the jacket did develop some little tears and if you aren t careful you can rip the material So for a day in day out jacket you might want something stronger and pricier like a Burley or a Showers Pass jacket or Rainshield s pricer nylon O2 jacket but at 35 this jacket does better than a lot of jackets costing 4 or 5 times as much And it really is light and packs down very small so if you re a minimalist at heart this is a great jacket for you 
Very nice I bought this shoe to replace my Nimbus V and I m very happy with it It s lighter than the previous version but that also means it s thinner so it can be a cit cold for winter running but I just wear two pairs of socks and look forward to being cool in the summer 
snug but very comfortable These pants are very stretchy and comfortable They are a bit more form fitting in the butt and thighs than I like but wearable because they re so darn comfy 
Wedding Corset The corset is exactly what I thought I was buying The quality is good and it looks great on Delivery was very prompt Very happy with this item for my wedding day I will be buying with you agai 
Awesome comfy sandals for littles My daughter is about to get her 4th pair of these and her little brother his first pair They are confortable breathable and cute My daughter will choose these over all her other shoes We tried to put them up for the winter but she wants to wear them anyway She s got wide square feet and these adjust nicely with the velcro The perfect summer sandal for little ones 
Hide Away Pocketed Adjustable Panty Gaff For Crossdressing I love it it make it look realistically smooth crotch area 
Bought this as my wedding dress OK I found my fiance online why not my wedding dress sounds easy in comparison right Well after three months of looking offline too I was ready to give up We re having a very small relatively casual outdoor May wedding and I couldn t find anything that really fit my idea of what I want to wear Then I found Tension Dress bad name on Amazon I bought the ivory in one size larger than I usually wear XL even though generally I m a 12 since it looked like juniors sizing and I m 5 10 It fits perfectly and since the back laces up you have a little wiggle room in the fit I m planning to have it shortened to tea length the only adjustment I ll need to make but even at my height the full length is just right with a 2 5 heel The fabric looks and feels nicer in person than in the photos on the site I actually ended up ordering it directly from gojane com s site since they had more size and color options than were showing up on Amazon Even with expedited shipping I ordered it Sunday night late and it was here by Thursday afternoon the total was less than 100 Not bad for a beautiful wedding dress I couldn t be more pleased And after the wedding maybe I ll dye it and wear it for other occasions Although at this price I could even buy one in another color 
great dress I just received the dress You can t beat the price and the dress is beautiful I bought the dress for my young daughter for a pageant and the XS fit her perfectly The shipment was also very fast Will do business agai 
THE CUTEST DRESS EVER Thank you GoJane Tension dress is so beautiful I just got the dress today and I m so happy I cannot believe that such a very cute and beautiful dress of a very good material is only less than 100 I am small It s very difficult for me to get a wedding dress of my size I bought my wedding dress last month it was much more expensive than Tension dress but it was still a little big for me and it s nothing compared to Tension dress in terms of cuteness I bought ivory Tension dress x small and it fits me very well and looks really cute on me Thank you GoJane You save my wedding when I almost give up looking for a cute wedding dress of my size 
adidas hoodie I bought this for my husband and he is satisfied with the quality and fit He likes the fact that the hood is lined so he doesn t get fleece fuzz in his hair 
As expected A great sweatshirt all around Had it a year and still holding up very well 
awesome i love hoodies but i am very picky they have to be perfect i have many of them but my favorite was adidas so i went on and go this one so far i am very happy with it 
addidas does it again Great construction and overall appearance there s some spandex added so it feels and better as a fit material feels like it would last very long time great sweatshirt 
Great boots I love Columbia These are very nice and super comfortable shoes They are cushioned inside so they feel like you re wearing running shoes I highly recommend Columbia brand hiking boots They are on the small side though I had to get them half a size larger than I normally wear 
Good product idiot shippers bad customer service I ordered three pairs of Southpole jeans for my son s Christmas gifts The price was phenomenal They arrived fairly quickly in terrific shape except whoever pulled them for shipping didn t bother taking off the security tags first I contacted the seller via telephone about 2 weeks prior to Christmas and was told all they d do was send a UPS tag to me to send the products back for security tag removal I explained the time issue that I d ordered them in plenty of time to arrive before Christmas and that they likely wouldn t make it back to me in time if they went UPS ground to Florida and back to Oregon She told me that was my only option I asked if it were possible to send them back and forth faster than ground and she told me it would be on my dime Since it was their error I expected better but didn t get it I ended up getting the security tags taken care of locally but it was a huge hassle and it sucked up a lot of precious time at an already chaotic time of year 
Simpy the best Awesome pants for yoga climbing working out hanging out at the beach pool or just bumming around IMHO these are probably the most comfortable pants ever designed I still wear my first pair of gray ones These pants ROCK Although a bit pricey you definitely get what you pay for a great product that will last a VERY long time we re talking YEARS 
good sturdy tote This is a good sturdy tote bag Roomy and love the flat bottom Also the key ring holder is a nice feature I don t have to fish for my keys at the bottom of the bag Fun color 
Very Comfortable Very Durable High Quality Cuffs stay snug but not tight so they never slip or droop even after laundering many times 
My favorite sports leisure socks I buy these all the time The quality is so very good They are cushy soft launder perfectly I use these for running around the city or lounging around the house 
good idea but the bag is not very deep so doesn t hold as much as I was hoping also even empty the zipper is very difficult to operate I wondered if security would be able to rezip it had they opened it 
Poor Mandy Spike Poor fit What you see is not what you get Quality not good Very disappointing Will not buy anything from the shoes manufacturer agai 
For my sister I purchased this for my sister She loves the gown and when I saw her wearing the gown she looked really pretty Great quality and beautiful gown This gown would have cost twice as much at a retail store in the mall Thanks for the good deal Susan 
Lovely gown I purchased this night gown along with another one as a gift for my mother She absolutely loves both of them They are exactly what she was lookimg for I m so glad that I was able to find it 
Smart and Sexy At first I was surprised when I opened the box and saw what appeared to be way too small trunks After slipping them on I was pleased to discover that it had perfectly contoured to me Nice design and streches for an exact fit Since it is part cotton it is cool and breathes well 
Easy to use On day one my son had problems balancing however he used any available adult to walk him around the house just to balance himself By day two he was gliding a little on his own On day three I was most impressed he had it Now I have to beg him to take them off 
Gold Toe Socks I always buy different styles of Gold Toe socks because they are extremely comfortable and last a very long time They are great 
Great Socks These are the best socks ever made They are of medium weight all cotton They come in both Black and White I wish many more colors These sock also last a long time even with constant washing And you are never itching the ribbed part if you know what I mean because these socks are made with mostly cotton and a bit of nylon They fit well in summer with any type of casual shoe or sneaker and are great for boots in the fall spring and even winter I love to wear them to sleep at night on those cold nights or just use them to walk around the house in with or without slippers As you can see I love em 
Great bra Good investment I ve bought this bra many times over the past four years Even as my weight has fluctuated I purchase the appropriate size and it never fails to work like it s supposed to My sizes have ranged from 36C to 38D to 36DDD and it s done the job like a pro I like that you don t get a uniboob look when wearing it which actually helps lessen the bounce tendency You re also not suffocating from having too tight a band The size runs true to the size to what I wear in Victoria s Secret Body by Victoria bras It also accomodates the wearing of a heart rate monitor strap around the ribs I highly recommend this bra 
I was disappointed with another brand but these are great I had purchased another name brand and had trouble with my undershirts shrinking to the point that I couldn t even tuck them in I ve had the Jockey brand for several months and shrinkage has been minimal Good job 
Good service Got what I ordered on time and delivered directly to my niece Would have been nice to have gift wrap option thoug 
Great accessories and great price I bought these accessories for my wife for Christmas and it has proven to be very handy I recommend highly 
Great Fabulous No more cheap plastic stays that warp in the dryer and make your collars do strange contortions no matter how much you iron Nicely made and packaged Would make a nice little gift for someone 
Very disappointed in this item I bought several tee shirts for my son I washed them in cold water and put them in the dryer on a low setting They shrunk at least one whole size Also the stiching around the neck puckered From now on I will stick with product lines I know like Hanes and Carters J Duncan Arizon 
All aprons should be made this way This is the most adjustable apron I have found One continuous tie or loop makes it fit perfectly no matter what your height or size 
Never received This item was due to ship right after Christmas but did not arrive It was then set to arrive 2 weeks later and still did not I had to write to find out that the order was cancelled due to lack of inventory 
support and comfort I needed a good sports bra after a recent surgery I was looking for both comfort and price This fit the bill on both counts 
Warmer than I expected I was looking for one of those gaiters that stretches and wraps every which way This one is not one of those in case you re looking for one like that Information like this would have been useful to me before buying the product I could have saved even more money by purchasing this product at my local camping store if it was really what I wanted It is a good product nonetheless It is not however standard military issue which I think was actually advertised The other type I described is 
neck gaiter I bought this for a friend and she says she likes it I wish I had purchased one for myself 
warmth The items were fine but they were all shipped individually and arrived and different time spread out over a 4 week period The item was not what i expected though and i returned them The return was hassel fre 
Very Pleased This was purchased for my daughter to wear in my wedding it was a hit She was beautiful and the dress was stunning I actually ordered from this seller again 
She Really Twinkled This dress was everything it promised to be and more It was beautiful and has held up very well Food got on her dress all down the front the second time she wore it but it washed up well and is no worse for the wear you can t even tell My daughter loved this dress She felt like a princess The off white is not as stark as plain white and it works well for multiple occassions It s a perfect dress for the little girl or bigger girl who wants to look a little more grownup and elegant but still wants that princess dress feel We love the dress and will recommend it to you highly 
Twinkling Rhinestone Dress I purchased this dress as a gift and she LOVED it It was perfectly princess like for her birthday Thank you 
love em I love these They are made very well and are extremely comfortable And I think they look great too I bought a bunch of these and they are really my favorites now I wear them mostly under jeans but I also work out sometimes and at home only in the boy short style 
My daughter loves them My daughter loves them Great fit clean she just loves these 
Best runner s bra I have three of these bras so far and love them I am not so large but definitely felt that the majority of jog bras out there were leaving a lot to be desired My typical bra size is 34C but in the Fiona bra I get a perfect fit by sizing to 32D I was initially concerned that I might chafe where the velcro strap doubles back but I don t notice it at all As a bonus the velcro allows you to stealthily remove the bra under a shirt after running I did not notice any pilling that another reviewer mentioned They are also showing a great deal of durability as I wash and wear these with great frequency So I feel this product really delivers and is definitely worth the cost 
great workout bra Whew Is it ever tough to find a workout bra when you have a DD chest Moving Comfort is one of the few companies making a sports bra for larger chested woman that actually work No smooshing or flattening or uni boob A very comfortable bra My only complaint is the pilling I wish they would change the exterior material to something that doesn t pill BUT just having a bra to work out in is BLISS 
BEST RUNNING BRA EVER I am large chested 38 C D and have been running my whole life I finally found the best running bra The band is adjustable to 3 different lengths I bought a 36 C to really keep locked and loaded The shoulder straps are adjustable from the front You don t have to take off the bra to tighten it up The velcro straps stay secure so you don t end up with chaffing Love love love this bra 
Woodland Desert Digital Tru Spec BDU s Bought both pairs of digital BDU s the fit was perfect It washes great with very little shrinkage or fade I was a little hot in the desert digital s 118 degrees when I was on the desert floor but as soon as I finished climbing to top of the mountain 9 000 feet and changed into the woodland digital that s when the BDU really paid off Going to buy both digital s in 100 ripstop cotton and do a comparison 
Fantabulous I have owned Bali before and I am quite difficult to fit when it comes to this type of intimate apparel This bra fit perfect from the moment I tried it on I would highly recommend it to anyone especially if you are hard to fit 
NB Cross Training Heaven The black NB cross trainers look unfeminine but once you wear them you realize that they look very stylish with your work out gear and the comfort level is 2nd to none for cross training shoes 
Natori Underwire Sports Bra I have used this bra for many years playing tennis and working out in the gym It is well constructed has great support and is very comfortable with a soft cotton like fabric 
Great sports bra I ve bought this bra many times over the past four years Even as my weight has fluctuated I purchase the appropriate size and it never fails to work like it s supposed to My sizes have ranged from 36C to 38D to 36DDD and it s done the job like a pro I like that you don t get a uniboob look when wearing it which actually helps lessen the bounce tendency You re also not suffocating from having too tight a band The size runs true to the size to what I wear in Victoria s Secret Body by Victoria bras It also accomodates the wearing of a heart rate monitor strap around the ribs I highly recommend this bra 
comfortable I liked it You can t tell from the picture but the straps are adustable 
Love this bra I am a 38DDD and have the hardest time finding sports bras that fit I bought this one on a whim and it is great I needed something that was pretty supportive for riding horses and running and this one works beautifully I will definitely buy more 
Good for running I ve always had a problem finding a sports bra that actually fit and came in actual bra sizes instead of small medium large I also hated struggling with the kind you have to pull over your head The Natori one is great It comes in real sizes so I never feel like I ve wrapped a rubber band around my chest It stops movement while I exercise even running jumping without strapping down my chest It has a good shape that I even feel comfortable wearing it under my regular clothes I love that it hooks in the back so its easy to get in and out of The straps are wide enough that they rest easily on my shoulders and still provide support It wicks away sweat And they last forever The only thing I ve ever been annoyed with is the metal clasps for adjusting the straps because they fall right on my shoulder blades and sometimes dig into them when I do sit ups on a harder surface I definitely suggest this bra for any larger chested women who move around a lot when they exercise 
excellent bra I LOVE this bra This bra is THICK 100 cotton with underwire It s completely supportive During exercise the breasts stay immobile For everyday wear the bra remains comfortable keeping the breasts in place while the cotton keeps cool for the summertime 
Tumbling Shorts Could not locate in store Too early in season Went to Internet and chose Russell because have always liked their product Shorts came fit and feel so good Thank you 
This is my review hurriedly prepared at Amazon s insistence The shirt seems great The service was a little slow in mailing from this company But if I hadn t been forced to turn in this review before I washed the shirt and then could tell about shrinkage discoloration etc I very well may have given a 5 rating for the item itself No 5 from me because Amazon rushed me for this rating 
love these shoes These are so comfortable and stylish I want them in every color 
A good quality sweatshirt I received the sweatshirt and was surprised at how nice it was It s a good quality shirt that will get a lot of use nice heavy fabric 
Color fades quickly I would like to confirm the previous reviewer s comment that the color on this suit Navy Blue faded very quickly In addition I also found that the shape gets stretched and baggy fairly quickly in spite of rinsing with fresh water after every chlorine exposure In general this doesn t seem up to Speedo s usual quality but for the price 17 it s a good deal 
Nice style but color fades too quickly I liked the men s stripe nylon suit for several reasons it had a nice fit the material was very comfortable and I liked the color However after about 2 weeks of use swimming every day for about 1 hour I noticed that the color was already starting to fade I made sure to follow the care instructions by rinsing it out after every use and I never hung it out in the sunlight So far I must say that the material is keeping its shape and elasticity just not the color 
Again messed up sizes The size 52 is like 38 or 36 I had to send it back 
Great place for tons of CDs I in the middle of transferring my vinyl LPs onto CDs and I needed a transportable storage case This fits the bill nearly perfectly I very much need the binder clips to easily move and rearrange the pages The only drawback is the CDs start slipping from their envelopes when you carry the case by the handle on the binder back As long as you remember not to use the handle and transport with this in mind everything is great 
Better than Quick Lock but Case Logic can do better I originally bought the Case Logic Quick Lock 320 CD case as soon as I got it home and loaded it up with CD s I knew it just wasn t going to work moving pages around was a huge hassle you had to remove EVERY page first and putting them back in wasn t easy So I went with this case It s binder style so at the very least I knew I would be able to organize pages easily This is a good case overall The zipper seems good the binder seems strong but the handle is a flimsy piece of rubber stitched to the nylon I bought this case is for storage and not hauling it around so that doesn t matter too much I filled it to capacity and to my surpise there is no room to add pages Also as with any large capacity binder flipping pages is not a smooth action you have to guide the page up and over and it s hard to flip over any more than 5 pages at a time In Summary Pros stylish built well good quality pages the CD never has to slide over plastic Cons No room for additional pages hard to flip pages flimsy rubber handle I did A LOT of shopping around for a CD case I m satisfied this case is better than all the rest I ve looked at but I just think it s possible for all these companies to build a better CD case 
This is one hot shoe Not only is this shoe sexy it s comfortable too I had to loosen one of the straps on top of my foot then I was good to go It s hard to believe such a tall shoe would be so easy to wear but this one is I have high arches but the shoe did not interfere with them at all You will enjoy this shoe for all it is 
US Navy Peacoat Bought this coat for a very reasonable price compared to other places Delivery was very speedy and is a very nice product If you need a warm coat that is nice looking this is one to buy Only down side is the sizes run a little small Otherwise very exceptional product for the money 
great shoe What a bargain I bought this shoe on amazon for 29 99 Very unusual shoe I get a lot of compliments on it I like the lace to toe design and is easy to get in and out because it s round shoelaces 
Comfort for Cheap These shoes are probably the most comfortable shoes I ve ever worn Compliments about them are not short in supply I m considering a second pair I also got them at an awesome price Very very good shoes 
tsubo shoes The quality of tsubo is excellent but know they are made a little long I should have ordered a half to a whole size smaller 
Tsubo Tenax shoes guarenteed to get compliments Cool shoes Every time I wear them I get compliments People ask where I got them I tell them I found them while traveling in Europe a lie The quality is great something you might expect from an Italian shoe not Japanese The only complaint I have is that the laces keep coming untied because they are the round nylon type I would suggest replacing the laces if you buy a pair Overall I would give these shoes an A 
dickes workshirts Dickies workshirts are hard to find locally This is the only kind of shirt my husband will wear to work he loves them Thanks Amazon 
What more could you ask for I have to tell you folks if you are looking for a sweatshirt hoodie type of clothing this is it The hoodie came with a place for my head and arms and the name hoodie is not a misnomer It had a fully functional and attached hood Studies show that we lose 70 of our body heat via our heads Well just put the hood up and you can keep all that heat Yes with this hood you too can do your part to stem the tide of global warming If the hood is too big well there are strings that are included that will allow you to close down the hood good and tight In fact you can go overboard and be your group of friends very own Kenny Mumble away in the warmth of a Russell Althletic Men s Logo Sweatshirt This pack also came with a t shirt that had many of the same features as the sweatshirt It is a great way to show off your support for your favorite sports team or the sports team your state has made the only college that is acceptable to root for Typically this is done by placing an ever pretentious The in front of the name of the university You also need to over emphasize the The as well But enough about that You go buy this product 
Decent for the Price I ve had the t shirt sweatshirt combination for a couple of months and they are holding up well to use The sweatshirt appears to be good weight but the t shirt is a little light I would buy these again 
Comfortable even in the longest runs I bought these shoes for running a full marathon my other shoes were getting old and they are very comfortable even after 25 miles 
The item is fine but east bay I sent more than 5 e mails to east bay regarding this purchase and never received any reply from them It was the worst experience through the internet ever 
Fantastic light and flexible running shoe I use a bunch of athletic shoes and I find that Asics Gel Nimbus is the pair I pick most of the time These are light and incredibly springy shoes that provide the right amount of cushion These are much superior in my opinion to NB and Saucony The price is the one thing I am not happy about but all manufacturers are the same in terms of pricing for specialized shoes 
sporty but still classic polo This shirt is very soft and breathable as it is 100 percent cotton It has two raised dark blue lines across the chest that gives it some personality compared to most polos My husband got a large like most of his other polo shirts but it is bigger than most larges He kept it at that size although he could have gotten a size smaller He loves the soft feel of it and that it is sporty enough for weekends but still classy enough for his job 
HORRIBLE QUALITY save your I was excited to get these flats and I had outfits already planned for their arrival When I opened the box I found them to be of the cheapest quality material and the metallic paint was SPRAYPAINTED on It flaked off the second that I took them out of the box and made a mess on my table The toes and bow were already scratched up from the shipping and that was inside of a box so just imagine what one day of wearing them would do I am returning them today and getting a full refund These shoes are cute in the picture but don t be fooled they are of the worst quality Dont waste your money 
Too big This skully is way too big for the average person I am 6 3 and 230 lbs and it is still too big The only way to make it fit better is to pull it down over the ears which is not the way most people will want to wear it 
couldn t live without it a completely necessary item underneath ANY type of helmet for any sport playe 
Gorgeous dress I bought this dress in black It is absolutely gorgeous The quality is wonderful I was nervous about buying this dress online because I need it for a red carpet style party at work I can t afford anything expensive but didn t want anything that looked cheap It s perfect They shipped the dress out quickly as well JUST BEAUTIFUL If you re thinking about it buy it One feature that I didn t notice in the description that was actually a very beautiful surprise was that the dress has slits that go to the knee on each side in the front It s very very elegant and sexy looking 
Best one I ve found I have bought several of this bra it is very comfortable holds up well after repeated washings hanging to dry and offers good support and shaping I don t wear ultra low cut tops but do have some that are fairly low cut and have had no problems I guess it depends how low do you go I don t know about D and up but for C and under I think it s a very good choice I would highly recommend it and plan to purchase it in the future 
Great Product ok Service I had to return this product for another size The service at Maidenform leaves something to be desired My advice is Great Bra just be prepared to wait if you need a replacement 
Good Pair for Light Hiking I bought this pair for it s price style and brand did not want to shell out 90 bucks for a pair of Merrell It is a very comfortable pair of shoes with sure footed lug soles and protects feet in the Western Mass Berkshire trails I this pair suggest without any reservation to someone who is looking for style and value Only one negative so far the lace keeps coming loose may be its my personal preference to tie them little loose 
Another Good Columbia Shoe I purchased this shoe to replace the Columbia s I had before and am very pleased Good comfort fit for my feet All feet are different but you tend to find certain manufacturer s seem to consistently work for you If you ve had Columbia s shoes before you probably know what it will feel like on your foot Good experience purchasing and wearing the shoe Nice to avoid having to go to the store 
Great shoe These shoes are broken in right out of the box Comfortable enough to play or work in all day long This is my second pair and I will buy another when the time comes 
TRAIL SHOE This is the first shoe that i have purch online The shoe was everything i expected from the information given at the time of purch i am wearing them right now 
Light weight hiker Perfect for day trips or walks light hikes Well cushioned in all the right places Not a shoe or half boot more like a 2 3 hi top sneaker but beefier Great outdoor sole very breatheable uppers Sizing seems about 1 2 size small 
Lee Jeans I had been looking for these jeans in local stores None of them carry them in petites anymore I was so glad to find them at this source Very good quality and the side elastic is perfect for my fit 
Awesome for working out These are terrific for working out and playing sports Keeps the hair out of my face 
Great fit comfortable shoes It seems somewhat meaningless to write a review of shoes since what fits great on me might not fit on you at all and vice versa Nevertheless for what it s worth I really like these shoes It has not always been easy for me to find shoes that fit me well and although they were not a perfect fit brand new out of the box after a few days of wearing them I can safely say that these shoes fit me great and are very comfortable If New Balance happens to be reading this please keep on making these shoes and other similarly good products 
Come on 5 Stars I Mean come on lighten up My Grandfather has cancer and I don t Take this offensively Because everyone has a Live Strong Bracelet and it gets annoying after a while So you get a live wrong bracelet to be different Duh 
Oh come on now Every rubber bracelet that has been introduced since the original yellow LIVE STRONG is just a testament to how smart that idea was That said I pay tribute to a brilliant idea that benefits a good cause by wearing only the Live Wrong version People it s just a piece of rubber I know one of the copyright holders and he is a great guy This is the ultimate in capitalism Those that wear this version do NOT neglect the meaning behing the original Wearing the Live Wrong shows that you are aware of the orig but CHOOSE to wear something different And as far as contributions are concerned I got mine for free and have sent money to a cancer charity Sent more than what I paid for the black bracelet 
What a laugh I think I had more of a laugh reading the reviews for this than the bracelet could ever give me I also find it funny that someone can give a review on a product that they ve never used I will be purchasing one of these so my review is justified Does this bracelet take away from cancer funds you could say yes but then again buying soda does the same thing Its called frivelous spending Is it mocking the livestrong band well yeah but then again we have weird al and bumper stickers that have been doing that for years With some reviews i swear i should be nexy yo some of them wearing the i m with stupid t shirt Its a joke people lighten up Oh and all of you that are worried that people should donate money to a cause should ask themselves on how uptight can they get with this Take it this way I can donate and not care if anyone else knows but the people that are the most uptight are usually the ones that go up to people and raise thier banded arm in front of people and go i donated yes i did and got this cool bracelet which means i donated This is a fad and the ones that are the most uptight about this are upset cause they didn t think of it first So get over being scrooge and livewrong 
Excellent Negative reviews aside mostly because they stray from good common sense and any semblance of a sense of humor this s a pretty eye catching bracelet It has been a conversation starter but mostly it has been a way for me to say something about myself in a rather innocuous way I recently broke one that was given to me by a friend I wore it daily and liked the sentiment If you can t enjoy life why bother living it Then again if you aren t enjoying life are you really living LiveWrong doesn t take anything away from the good work that many are doing nor does it fall into the category of all the pseudo charities who are jumping on the band wagon It is what it is a funny idea that has probably given the guy who came up with it a fairly good side income Good for him I will be replacing mine as well as buying a few for friends What s amazing is how few books have review sections this long Perhaps two words is simply easier for most people to digest and have an opinion about 
It is what it is Good quality bracelet with no flaws Arrived promptly A little pricey but one of a kind 
Amusing I was amused by both the bracelet and the reviews Such outrage over something so silly Even more amusing was the spelling and grammar of the reviews Such cheap entertainment 
Please Get Over Yourselves Ah The anti statement statement bracelet Nice Here s a thought to those who find this in bad taste instead of spending your time criticizing others or wearing a cheap bracelet that supposedly speaks to your COMMITMENT to various causes why not volunteer your time at a hospice Or send a care package to some of the people serving in Iraq or Afghanistan Or maybe just find someone who needs your help and HELP THEM Nah Too HARD 
Get a grip I initially clicked on the infamous Live Wrong bracelet because I thought it was something my 26 year old son would think was funny and fun to wear I ve probably only read three reviews in all the time I ve been shopping on Amazon I don t remember why I started to read these reviews but once I did I was hooked I am 52 years old fat but not a stupid moron I ve lost 4 people that I love to cancer I am a cancer surviver I think these bracelets are exactly what they are supposed to be funny I believe they are a personal statement as is every other colored band that is sold What I think is wierd is the uproar this has caused on both sides The truly offensive people are those who feel they can judge a person by any bracelet hat or car While I drive my SUV I wear no bracelets of any color I have taken the advice of D L Hereford and D Ray conspiracy theory and send my chairitable contributions direct I contribute time as well as money to what I believe in and time slipping a bracelet on and off doesn t count I have a daughter in law who does relay walks and other fund raising activities while she wears her yellow bracelet I think she considers the bracelet less important than the rest I think Silent Bob would approve Brent Freakin Wilson your anger over this is way overboard I sense other personal issues See your pastor The emperor of ice cream needs to write a book maybe he could call it I M SMART SEE Or perhaps a Geraldo type talk show would work better Then he could allow people to view his impressive intelligence first hand Lovestory 27 quite reading romances and grow up By the way there are t shirts that have money going to charitible causes too Why allow the evil doers to put live wrong on a shirt Doesn t anyone realize this is Amazon com not a political forum All the bands black yellow pink or aquamarine are more club membership cards than anything else don t make them more important than they are I m buying some I joined in on this damn thing I am officially over the edge 
Stupid Stupid Idea C mon now those of you who are making fun of the fad and are simultaneously jumping on that same bandwagon by buying this piece of the fad and paying triple for something that really is pure profit should look up the word irony in the dictionary I agree that people should give directly to charities but if impulse purchases at the checkout counter and the web lead to more money going toward charities from people who wouldn t normally directly donate I m all for it It s called taking advantage of people s desire to be part of something and using it for some good Gee what an awful idea huh 
Great Shorts The Men s 1 2 Split Shorts from Eastbay are great shorts They are very comfortable and durable I m a college student and I wear them all the time now when working out playing sports running etc You ll notice the difference that the freedom of movement rather than restricting movement like some shorts provides 
Eastbay Shorts The 1 2 split shorts were exactly what I was looking for They have the right inseam and they have a liner brief sewn in Just perfect 
Everyday shoe Great shoes great price I love the grip of the sole I don t have to worry about slipping and they comfortable plus nice looking 
Great quality and wonderful color I bought these shoes for my husband s Christmas gift He loves them and is particularly pleased at the color mix of brown and black very tastefully put together and can equally well go with both brown tan and black trousers The service from the seller was excellent 
My Favorite Shoes Now Available at my new favorite shoe store Excellent shoes and at an reasonable price 
Great shoes good value My husband was so pleased with this shoe the fit the look and the color was as described He could not believe I ordered it on the internet 
NEVER be caught without a pair of Sperry Topsiders Terrifically comfortable shoes I wear mine to work in the office I am a physician in private practice 
Comfy good support These socks are just the right thickness and good support for your arch Thick enough but not too bulky Good for lots of walking too Gold Toe is great 
decent price decent bra you get what you pay for This bra is better than another cheaper version that I have tried Not the easiest latch unlatch feature on the nursing cup But other than that it is comfy 
Just what I wanted Looks just like the picture even on me Not super soft but soft and perfect for my beach wedding 
Comfortable and Sexy Stretches to fit you exactly The smooth fabric holds everything in place Contrast waistband and package support make this underwear look very sexy Highly recommended 
White Mountain Boots Are The Best The quality and comfort of the boots were excellent Usually when you get a pair of boots you have to break them in or they hurt your feet for the first couple of times I do a lot of walking and these boots felt great from the moment I put them on 
very cute i ve got these in tan they look really cool and are comfortable They look great with jeans and skirts I love that they are not to tall i am very petite and this keep a perfect proportion Just one thing they kind of make feet look larger so i wouldn t recommend these if you feel your feet are too big already 
great this is a great product and a great price from a great stor

Great Bra but delivery was wrong The bra is beautiful and fits great unfortunately beall s sent it to me in white and not blush and when i called to return it they said i needed numbers i didn t have so i just kept it eventhough it isn t what i ordered 
Maidenform 7909 bra I bought two and really like them because they are comfortable and wash well 
pleasantly surpried for the price I haven t worn these shoes I just bought them to wear for my beach wedding in May They are beaufiful even though they are a little pricey 
Excellent Wedding Shoes I bought these shoes for my wedding I am having an outdoor wedding and can t do the heels thing these are so comfortable bouncy and cute I recommend them to anyone 
Quality Socks We buy these socks every year for us and for relatives who live in the snowy mountains of Colorado 
Comfy Versatile Good Quality I bought this DKNY Short Sleeve V Neck Tee over a year ago and liked it so much came back here today to put a couple more of different colors in my cart They cost a little more than a year ago but they are a very good quality and have lasted through many washings They are very comfortable light weight and fit loose around the ab and waist area which I prefer to something clingy The fit is short but not too short hitting just below the waist I wear it often and found it versatile enough to wear with low cut jeans for sleep yoga and working out The color grey did not fade much with all the washings but I did find that after a while it lost it s shape just a little and sometimes it came out a little wrinkled from the dryer dried on low but usually smoothed out by hand when I folded it It did not wrinkle during wear except when I slept in it and it did not shrink at all I liked the loose fit the comfy cool feeling of the fabric and the quality enough to order a couple more for the hot summer coming up I usually wear a large in most tops but I usually go for an X large in short tees so it just hits a little lower and is a little looser And by the way Bare Necessities the store I purchased this tee through was very good with packaging and prompt delivery It a great buy Happy Shopping Lauri 
The most comfortable pair I gave my husband these shoes for Christmas and he said they were the most comfortable pair of shoes he has ever owned The shoe is exactly as described Thanks 
Etnies My granddaughter loved these they were one of her christmas presents and with the price and quick shipping they were perfect 
I woud love to order another pair HI I would likr to order another pair just like the pair of puma s that I had purchased a few months ago I need to find the exact pair color 
Great storage unit This is much better than the zip around cases I use it to store multi disc DVD sets and it frees up so much shelf space 
Getting more Finally a CD case without the tacky zipper that goes all the way around This one looks like nice enough to display in a bookcase or entertainment center There are two different kinds of sleeves in it to hold both CDs and DVDs I used the DVD sleeves to store CD booklets as well allowing me to throw away hundreds of jewel cases of course you will want to save some of the cases from your more cherished CDs You won t believe how much room you save by doing this Mine held about 80 CDs but that included a lot of booklets so just a couple more of these albums and my whole collection is tucked away in a fraction of the space it used to be in 
iPod HardCase This product was really terrific And you get FOUR So now you can match your outfit your mood whatever 
One quirk I bought a four set of these for my daughter and me to share We d had a bad experience with a stick on unit and wanted something that actually gave some real and solid protection These units are GREAT They fit very well they hold the pod solidly in place and they re strong We ve both used them exclusively since they arrived There is one quirk that I m experiencing by Hannah isn t I may have to try one of the other colors to see if it s just the one I selected or a design issue The tab that holds the two shell halves together protrudes slightly and when the pod lies flat on a surface this tab tends to pop open The one I ve been using loses it s tension over a matter of days and the unit pops open unexpectedly I ll try a different one to see if this is just a quirk on the one I ve been using I d also likely file the protruding tab down by 040 or so to help prevent the table contact These things are good enough that it s well worth my effort to examine the engineering and find solutions However in the overall I find these to be really excellent covers for our use and style 
Cute as can be This is a very well made onesie It is a good material and loast through many washes so far The only reason I gave it a 4 is because the arm holes are a little tight The don t expand so if you baby has bigger arms this outfit may not work 
Adidas Country II I used to wear these when I was a deep sea diver in the navy back in 77 81 We ran 10k 6 2 mi everyday I went through 2 pair back in the day These shoes feel like a custom leather glove once they re broken in and look very cool w straight leg jeans They carried me all over the back alleys of Europe Can t believe they are making them available Word to the wise Mine just arrived Go up a half size 
A true classic of function and durability I bought my first pair of Adidas Country running shoes in 1977 when I was on my high school cross country team I ve tried a bunch of other shoes over the years but nothing comes close to this shoe for comfort and durability In 27 years I ve managed to wear out three pairs and have just bought my fourth and that s wearing them and running in them almost every day in all types of weather and conditions 
A nice revamping of an old classic My father has worn the same pair of adidas country shoes since 1977 when my mother bought the very last pair she could find after they were discontinued To see his old faithful reviatlized and put back on the market for a younger generation excites me not only as much as it does him And the new model proves as stable as the old which have stood the test of almost 30 years A solid investment that could prove to last a quarter of a lifetime 
amazon sweatshirt I bought this for my husband and he is very satisfied with the quality and fit 
Teddy Bear boots I bought these for my son He is 22 months Can t tell they are for girls He loves being able to take them on and off himself So do I 
Cute and comfortable These boots are very cute and seem to be holding up well through gentle use My son has worn them about 4 times They are nicely and deeply treaded on the bottom Since we use them only infrequently I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars since I can t comment much as to their ruggedness I bought them a little larger than his regular size since their main purpose is for puddle jumping and fit is not that important I d just as soon put an extra pair of socks on him now and get another year of use out of them LO 
Sized Correctly I followed the reviews stating to order a smaller size than your child wears and was very disappointed to find that they were too small I had just had my child s foot measured at Nordstrom about a week before ordering these His foot measured as an 8 I was planning on ordering a 9 but followed the advise of the other reviews and instead ordered an 8 When they arrived they were too small Now I have to pay twice as much in shipping to get the correct size which defeats my savings of ordering them on here in the first place I d recommend NOT going smaller 
All the right pockets This is a great alternative to the higher priced Jewelry Portfolio from Red Envelope I highly recommend this product as it has all the right pockets a roll for your rings and a perforated strip for all your post earrings 
Very comforable May need to get larger size depending on how tight you want it to fi 
Great shoe Very comfortable shoe and easy to slip on and off I would recommend this shoe to anyone who has an active lifestyle 
Extremely Comfortable Shoes Ordered this brand and size without prior exposure to product They fit perfectly and are great quality Not as sturdy as Keen s but more aesthetically pleasing Great for walking or exercising 
Its Awesome The length and size was perfect It was crotchless which I did not expect but was kind of hoping for I love it and my wife wears it often for me The price was the best part anywhere I have gone for this was at least 20 plus shipping and handling 
Right on time style I ordered this as a baby shower gift and I was sooooo pleased that it arrived on time it was really really beautiful The proud mother really loved it The colors were very vivid and I will definitely recommend other mothers to shop with you Thank U so much for having such wonderful products and services 
I would purchase this product again These were very soft and comfortable they feel great and keep my ankles warm 
Leg Warmers I like the warmers I use thewm when it get really cold here in OR The only thing I find wrong with them I can not keep them up on my upper leg Other then that they are great Mr Rodger L Hedg 
Comfortable soft cotton jersey This are well made very comfortable and soft I really like them 
great look These sunglasses fit perfectly if you are second guessing if you want to get these or not don t There great And they look good almost like the real thin 
gorgeous If you like real leather bags that are classic and stylish without screaming one particular trend or label then I d suggest this one I just got it in a true red and its gorgeous I will probably get myself a white one for summer It is even prettier in person and doesn t look as wide or bulky as it appears here It falls just between your chest and hip which is perfect and lays nicely against your body Don t let this photo fool you it s not a clunky looking purse as the picture would suggest Also I got mine at a TJ Maxx for 49 99 
Don t leave home without it I have enjoyed Reef sandals for years due completely to their comfort In recent years I ve started enjoying them for their functionality as well Last year I bought a pair of the Reef Fanning s which integrated a bottle opener in the heel Well this year they took it one step further and integrated a flask into the heel I love these sandals Not only are they comfortable with or without liquid in them they also have the added flask function Of course it s mostly for novelty in my case because it s not often I need to carry around 3 ounces of liquor in my shoes but for those times when I do or just want to for fun it s great that I can 
Comfortable shoe I would recommend This sandal is quite comfortable and pretty cute I would recommend it 
These Shamrock Hose are Great I have to say I was a bit skeptical The hose fit well although they have lost their stretch They looked great Quality of the hose is sa bit less than I would have wanted but everything else is great They fit well and the shamrocks were a great shade of green Really a great novelty 
Great Product I love them Much better than the plastic stays Reasonable price Excellent product 
great product First my only complaint is the key chain type holder for the stays keeps coming loose and they fall all over Other then that the stays thmeselves are great Customer service from the company was 5 stars 
Good Quality Excellent Customer Service The collar stays are very nice 2 pair each of the 4 sizes Mine were apparently lost in the mail to begin with But when called their customer service they sent them out to me via FedEx and I got them in couple of days They were great to deal with 
collar stays these are cool i like them better than plastic stays and i prefer the shiny metallic finish to gold or bronze color i just with the pack came with more of the 2 5 3 0 inch stays instead of the 2inch stays p 
Great Shades These are the second pair of Fossil sunglasses I have owned The first were great and these seem to be of the same quality You definately get your money s worth with any Fossil product They have the look and feel of much more expensive glasses at a fraction of the cost 
leather belted coat excellent value for the money buttery soft leather I would definately recommend this to anyone looking for a warm winter coat 
I Love the shoes I really iuke the products I have purchaced and will continue to order I have also showed my teenaged sons some of the items and they will now be ordering I am so pleased with the products Ican not express how extremely pleased I am with every order I have placed with 
thank goodness amazon Unable to locate this item locally Amazon shipped promptly and always makes it easy Great customer servic 
Sweaty Feet Improved I have sweaty feet Using standard cotton socks I had to take my shoes off every day while sitting at my desk at work otherwise my feet would become wet and athlete s feet would develop This is my second purchase of these socks because they have helped I still have to remove my shoes on a bad day nonetheless the socks wick away the moisture quite well and they are comfortable Note If you wear a size 11 12 consider the XL size unless you like your socks very snug 
Can t do better My husband loves these socks They fit well Are just light enough to wear every day all winter and just warm enouh to keep the chill out 
Superlative Socks I bought my first pairs of Ultimax Cool Lite Crews over a year ago as athletic socks In the meantime I have worn them for days on end working construction landscaping and lawn care jobs They have been bushwacking through brush and been pelted with sawdust from a chainsaw These socks have been everywhere and they still look pretty much like they did the day I bought them Well the white ones have dirt and grass stains but the fabric is prestine The elastic is just like new These are the toughest most comfortable everyday socks I have ever owned 
Polo Wallet Shipping is a real rip off Almost 20 for a wallet I bought two first and last 
I love this bra Very comfortable and flattering just wish I could find this bra in more colors 
Great fit with modesty If you are looking for a bra that somewhat minimizes provides modesty and doesn t look like an old lady s foundation this might work for you I am really a 34DD and finding bras that fit and look good is tough This bra has 3 sets of hooks and fits very well Not too much cleavage and it looks great with t shirts sweaters and professional wear Underwires maintain shape without digging straps provide good hold without jiggling It fits your shape without fitting you into theirs 
Nice shirt runs a little bit large This is a very nice quality shirt for the price It runs large through the shoulders and neck area Other than that I think it is a great comfy shirt It may shrink after washing which is what I am hoping because I do like the shirt 
Traditional Style with Quality Materials The 3 4 length sleeves traditional stripes make this cotton blended item from Bealls Of Florida a wonderful addition to any woman s wardrobe The stripes go well with kacki s as well as a faded pair of jeans for a trip to the mall or grocery store or entertaining friends in the garden area of our backyard These are a must have as they are fall spring esentials to everyday living 
Very warm and comfortable Prompt delivery in great condition This is really really warm and comfortable especially during cold temperatures I ordered several of these shirts and they have become favorites I love this shirt 
Very warm sizes run small I got this Under Armour long sleeved tee and the matching pants last year for running during the winter They are excellent for warmth and wick away sweat very easily The clothes are thin enough to fit well under other articles or clothing as well They are terrific for doing any outdoor activity in the cold especially running since they are sleek and wicking My main complaint with the clothing is that it runs small I usually wear a size 6 and medium blouses The medium for this set was very tight to the point of being too tight especially on the top The medium pants fit well in the waist but were too short for my 5 8 
Very pleased The costume was received in less than a week after we ordered it It was exactly like the photograph and of good quality and condition It does run large but worked well even on my seven year old son We were very satisfied with the shipping and the costume 
Vadonna This shoe is stunning and Amazon offered it at such an amazing price I couldn t be happier with the sparkle quality quick shipment time the bargain price I paid A 
Alia Pull On Pants Wonderful dress pants Very affordable and easy wash and dry They are also very comfortable Thank You 
Short time shoes These are incredibly comfortable shoes from 6 00am until about 12 00 pm then the elastic ties start getting tighter and tighter until I just can t wait to get them off at 5 00 pm These feel as soft and comfortable as mocasins just as long as you don t have to wear them too long 
Rolf s Nylon Tri fold Wallet This wallet was what I was looking for and couldn t find in local stores It is a great wallet and I would recommend it to anyone I especially like the velcro closure 
Rolf s Black Nylon Trifold Wallet I was looking to replace a two fold velcro wallet which was given to me as a gift some fifteen years ago It never went out of style and only recently started to fray Rolf s wallet was the closest likeness I could find It has eight inside compartments which is fine But I m using four of the compartments and it s already difficult to close I would have preferred a two fold wallet and if I find one Rolf s would be replaced by it but only because the required pocket space needed would be cut in half It s a great wallet just too bulky for me 
A Happy Husband My husband had a Rolf Nylon Trifold wallet which he used for 20 years It was pretty well used and he needed a replacement I was very pleased to find on internet that I could get an exact replica of the original I bought it through Bealls via Internet Now I have a happy husband thanks to Amazon Bealls and Internet He hopes he has this one as long as the first one He is 84 years old Jean 
Great little workhorse of a wallet I love these nylon wallets they are tough and durable If they get grubby you can wash them They never get as battered lokking as a leather wallet will They have room to store i d cards stamps notes and coins There is even room for extras like chewing gum sticks and condoms could you seriously ask anymore 
it worked for what i needed oh you should have seen it the indian guy was so scared i bought this mask to rob lucky mart haha he wasnt so lucky when he saw my tech nine i got about 280 from the register plus i stole a sobe no fear energey drink too so that was cool From Jess B 
Helping Masked Revolutionaries smoke their stogies Incognito since 1967 I live up in the mountains in a state that is ferociously cold when Winter roars in and it has been doubly so in the last month temperatures have dipped down into the subzero icebox range to the point where I feel like Nanook of the North tempted to bundle up with a balaclava buy a sled hire a team of huskies and go mushing across the frozen highways and streets I don t mind it Actually as a refugee from NYC which post 9 11 and the Bloomberg anti Smoking Nazis is not half the brazen City it once was I chose Utah because of the snow the mountains the free easy gun laws fewer people and skiing But what I don t dig is the Arctic temperatures especially because I have an evening cigar outside every night and it dampens the delights of cigar smoking to have your face and eyeballs freeze What to do I took a page from the strategy book of Chiapan Revolutionary mask wearing bandito SubCommandante Marcos who wears his hairy woolly black face shrouding balaclava wherever he goes I dig the SubCommandante dig his style dig his stature dig his designer AKs dig his Listening Tour about the country taken on a black motorbike a kind of 21st century homage to Che Dig all if it Comrade you know But what I dig most of all is his ability to light smoke his stogie through the little mouth hole in his black balaclava He does this all the time there s SubCommandante with his stogie and he s got it sticking out of the little mouthhole puffing away on it merrily So I figured if it works for El Jefe down in Chiapas where it s 105 degrees in the shade it probably will work wonders for me up in the mountains of Utah where it s 5 below zero beneath the moon Ya venceremos Sure enough I m digging it I can go outside smoke my cigar to my heart s content and have a toasty face that doesn t freeze splinter in the subzero frore winter blast All well good even though after a few heady puffs the little mouth aperture gets a wee tad bit stinky but oh well that s what a washing machine was made for Also the ski mask is well made solidly sewn and no doubt would be awesome for a cold weather counterinsurgency That said there is one big drawback every time I wear the thing I have an urge to carry out guerilla warfare against the bourgeois pig McMansion owner over the fence JS 
Great service I received my order in lightning quick time and the product is exactly as pictured I couldn t ask for more 
great shoes I like the style of the shoe they fit well and are comfortable to walk in 
These are awesome I have worn boxers for a number of years now and I was looking to try something new so I decided to give these a shot I was pleasantly surprised with their comfort and support I also found the material to be very strong despite its lightweight I would definitely recomend these bikini briefs for anyone who is looking for something other than just boxers or briefs 
Great I found this for a costume I was meshing together and I love it It s a great quality in perfect condition I was expecting a pick or two on it from the travel and it got here very quickly The company kept me updated and I never had to worry about it being late This is a really great product 
Shiny With Class I found this tie as a Christmas present for my brother The tie speaks out and says Hey I m cool It is well designed and is an eye cather Thank you for having it available Sherry L Schloss from Mtn Home I 
Oh Mario We loved this hat Was purchased for a halloween costume It looks fabulous and was a great value Seller was prompt with delivery too 
boy s tux shoes The shoes are very nice quality fit well and are the crowning touch for the twins tuxedo oufit for our family Thanksgiving cruise A++++++++ transaction 
Very nice The shoe looks very nice for a dress shoe It s the perfect shoe for a little boy to wear to a wedding or any dressy event I recommend purchasing a size smaller than the child is currently wearing because the shoe runs large 
Fits everything I got this bag for school it fits everything It has an inside sleeve for your laptop or binders It s waterproof and the straps are cushing so they are very comfortable Very happy with this bag 
Four months later and no wear yet Very Good Bag Spacious Perfect for the College Student on the Move Probably should have gone with a different color since green is a little easy to get dirty but I still like the colors I m particularly fond of all the storage space though I have a tendency of forgetting where I put things inside the bag 
High Sierra Swerve Backpack This backpack is great It s waterproof so my school stuff doesn t get wet in the rain The straps are cushioned so the weight on your shoulders doesn t feel as heavy It was a great find 
Great Shoes I have owned a pair for 18 months and I am buying a new pair Very durable have used mostly for gym work outs and around town wear I am a big guy 6 2 220 and the cushioning is just starting to break down Other shoes I have spent in 3 months I would highly recomend these shoes My pros and cons Pros Durable comfortable good cushioning last forever Cons Kind of heavy the mesh on the shoes lets in a lot of cold air in the winter 
great running shoes I am on my third pair of these and they are great I jog about 12 miles a week so I normally get a new pair every year Since the old pair is still good I simply keep them as walking shoes The 587 is light and very breathable not good for cold weather Cushion is enough but I would like more It is also durable I could have wearing them for over 2 years easy I used to get those inexpensive running shoes and once I go with the 587 I am not going back As a matter of fact it is time for me to get a new pair 
Big guys best bet Best shoes I ve ever had I can t give them enough stars If you re a larger than average person do your feet a favor and get these shoes 
A great all around shoe I do a whole lot of walking in the city where some places it s just quicker and more convenient to walk to certain places If you do a lot of running or walking you ll notice a difference in the feel of these shoes compared to other brands There s no gimmicky air bubbles or springs just comfort and support with a style of shoe that goes with anything you wear It also comes in wide sizes 
Comfort cool class Love these shoes They are too cute They look great with capris shorts summer dresses and this may sould odd but they seem to love and cradle your feet They come in different colors so you should be able to find the pair for you 
Privo Privo Privo Shoes arrived very quickly and I am estatic with the price paid one quarter of the amount other places and catalogue s were asking This was truly a GREAT deal I got 2 pair of lovely shoes for almost half the price on 1 pair 
WORST PIECE OF JUNK I EVER BOUGHT TOO BAD THERE WASN T A RATING OF 0 STAR THIS IS THE WORST PIECE OF JUNK I EVER BOUGHT FIRST OF ALL WE WERE LOOKING FOR A BRAND CALLED SPORTS AFIELD THIS ITEM FELL UNDER IT WHEN WE DID A SEARCH WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS SOME OFF THE WALL BRAND THEY WERE PAPER THIN BUT THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WERE WARM BEING IT WAS FROM AN ARMY AND NAVY STORE WRONG THEY SERVED NO PURPOSE AT ALL WERE NOT WARM AT ALL WE WASHED THEM PER DIRECTIOS ON TAG AND SHRUNK SO BAD I DON T THINK A 2 YR OLD COULD FIT IN THEM DO NOT BUY JUN 
Great all purpose sock I ve ordered a few different pairs of socks off of Amazon Gold Toe socks Tommy Hilfinger socks but so far these Adidas socks have been the highest quality They re nice and thick and fit well to your foot they won t slide around and bunch up They ve held up well for the first few washings and have stayed quite bright I like em 
pleased with lollipop briefs I was very pleases with my purchase of the looipop legband briefs They are very comfortable 
Lollipop Legband Brief This is exactly what I wanted I haven t been able to find them in the stores lately so I was so happy to see them here Great product 
Redefine Style Chuck Taylors are all about the redefinition of style This shoe does just that Not only that but it also magnifies the features of the All Star shoe It enlarges the signature patch the canvas the shoe laces the eyelets as well as the racing stripe along the sole It s also comfortable I m adding the Royal Blue ones to my collection next Thanks Lastpairs you guys rock 
Beautiful This shirt is beautiful and of fine quality The delivery was also excellent Thanks 
Great Flip Flops Durable soles very comfortable I wanted all black straps and fairly thin ones and I got what I want I will buy these again when these wear out 
Won t hold keys The quality of this key case is not up to par While leather and snap closure for the case is good my keys will not stay attached The portion of the key case that a key attaches to pulls off the key case often while driving or when I first open up the key case 
Rolfs Key Case Having owned cheaper keycases I have to say this one seems sturdier than most It is a bit harder to insert keys initially but if this makes them more secure it is worth it Be aware that this case is larger than some cases in fact it is almost like having a second small wallet in your pocket But the extra length helps to contain the longer car keys that are made these days My car key used to stick out of the end of my old key case and would wear a hole in my jeans pocket Not a problem with the Rolfs case The quick release feature may become a weakness after some years of wear and tear but so far after 2 weeks of use there have been no problems with keys falling out 
Very solid feel I ve gone through lots of these I ve only had this one for a week or so Hence I can t tell if it s going to last but it does feel much more solid than the others and looks great Also it arrived promptly 
Just what we ordered The case arrived in time for Christmas and was just what we ordered It was a gift and the recipient was please with the quality of the item 
more keys The Rolf key case is nice It has hooks for 8 keys They are a little hard to spread open and one broke Otherwise it is fine 
Rolfs key case The key case is a comfortable size 4 x3 closed and has room for 8 keys I carry 6 keys which it accommodates without a bulge It appears to be nicely made and looks very nice 
Walter I have been using Rolf Key Cases for many years I can t find any key cases in the stores now This key case works very well The older Rolf s key holders do not fit in this key case as the new openings are smaller This key case holds 8 keys This makes it bigger then my old key case I would prefer it to be smaller so it would fit in my pocket a little easier I checked the Rolf s web site and they had smaller cases 
Rolfs Key case I think this is one of the better key case holder around for the money Rolfs key hooks are more dependable than the others found The other type of key hooks that you have to manually lock tends to open therefore you can lose your keys Buy it you will like it 
Great Key Case Find I have used key cases for years and have been looking for a good replacement for some time when I decided to use the Net Low and behold I found one here It was exactly what I was looking for and in my hands within a few days of ordering I would recommend the store for prompt service and good product 
Goes anywhere I am very happy with the Doufold Insulayer Top I have worn it while hiking in the Shenandoah Virginia and also while dogsleding on a glacier in Juneau Alaska It can keep you warm when it is cold and soaks up sweat when you re getting too warm Also it is comfortable and looks good enough to wear all by itself It s not formal but there s no reason you can t wear it while around the house or visiting a nearby pub 
Great shoes Shoes arrived in good shape in a timely manner They are very comfortable They were relatively inexpensive and I was quite pleased 
Very Comfy I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort of the shoe It looks much classier on than in the illustration I am buying a few more pair in different colors at the low price 
The Slipper Shoe Ever felt that your feet are killing you and that you want to throw of the offending shoes Yes for most women I am sure but not with the Merrell Primo Chill Slide Since my discovery of Merrell s Primo Chill Slides walking driving and popping out have been a joy It s not just the easy slide in no laces it s the warm inviting interior and cosy fit with a no slide sole I have lovely feet and with these stylish Merrell s I don t have to spoil them for fashion which I never would but these Merrell s have made it easier 
Bowling Shoes Upon receiving the shoes and giving them as a gift to my husband he fell three times consecutively while bowling He brought them to the pro shop at the lanes and they used a drummel and sandpaper to roughen them He s bowled 6 games since and is just now able to bowl without being hesitant that he is going to slip and hurt himself He says the shoes look great and the size is perfect I would purchase another pair in the future I would just be very careful breaking them in 
Dancing sneakers I have two pair both white and black that I use only for dancing The black are a simple design with minimal decoration I even have a backup pair just in case Dancing about 6 nights per week they are super comfortable I have a hard time finding real dance shoes in size 11 wide Their sizing is accurate they fit beautifully and the best bargain in dancing shoes I have been able to find 
punisher i am a big punisher fan it just so cool to have this tee shir 
Call me The Punisher This shirt has already gone through 4 washings and it looks as great as it did when it arrived Great quality print on a soft but sturdy shirt Well worth the 
Great item great price I bought this shirt for my crew practice just to have something on to keep off the chill but not get caught on the oars Great texture and whicks off any sweat fast It s not exactly under armour but for the price you re paying it s pretty damn close 
My Camera Really Loved this Outfit I Did too I ve been taking photos of women in sexy clothes and no clothes for a long time so when I got a chance to shoot my twin sister and three of her sexy friends in various kinds of sexy undergarments how could I refuse There were lots of sexy things thongs bras see thorugh nighties at the party but I think the real hit what my lenses loved the most was this set There is just something about the idea of Wonder Woman that is just so hot Put a girl in these and she just looks like dynimite and you can wear these everyday You don t need a guy around to look sexy for you can do it just for yourself 
Wanna Attract a Super Hero Wonder Woman has always been a favorite of mine so I was predisposed to like this cami and panty set I just love strutting around in these Well I wouldn t strut everywere just in the house because though one wouldn t think it these are just as sexy as all get out with a good cottony feeling too so if I did my strutting outside well can you imagine I d be attacked arrested arraingned and who knows what else But hey maybe I d attract a super hero 
Just One Look and My Guy Wanted to Strip em off Me Oooo Weee I remember the Wonder Woman TV series Linda Carter just looked so hot in that outfit Well maybe this cami and panty set won t cling to your body the way Linda s did and maybe the ordinary girl isn t as busty as Ms Carter but let me tell you you ll feel pretty wonderful as you climb into bed dressed up as that woman with the golden lasso And you ll look good too I don t know I really thought my guy Jack would like these undies but son of a gun after just one look at me in these and he couldn t wait to get em off me Oooo Weee 
Happy happy happy It arrived today and fits perfectly My boyfriend likes it too 
poodle skirt I love the skirt It arrived on time and in excellent condition I got so many compliments on it when I wore it to a 50 s party It s staying in my closet in the hopes that I will get to wear it again It s felt fabric with an elastic waist The applique stitching is well done 
Love these shoes I bought these in black at a store in Chicago and found them to be incredibly comfortable When I saw Amazon s amazing price I bought them in brown and white They look great with pants and skirts 
DONT BUY IN Baby Ultimate Children s Boutique IGot this sailor out fit for my baby and I was very disappointed on the quality I guess they import from Hong Kong because it s very very cheap material Therefore I decided to return I call because I was concern in the amount was not the same one I paid and this rude woman called the manager star abusive verbal my answer machine she was rude mean and no class She said she was the manager and she said she was the boss and she was so unprofessional I cannot believe they stay in business In addition she brags she did so great and more lies 
Sunshine Shoes I was first attracted to these shoes because of their cheerful color Secondly I was attracted to the general style of these shoes which when worn with long pants gives the appearance of a pump without flying of my foot like pumps do The crowning feature of this pair was its five inch heel Therefore for style and color I would give this shoe five stars Unfortunately I was disappointed by the way the shoe balanced It required a lot more concentration to walk in than most five inch heels This is due to its very thin stiletto heel Also it is rather painful Albeit most five inch heels are very painful Therefore I would not recommend wearing these shoes for extended periods of time nor on slick surfaces Luckily the clasp on the top of the shoes did not dig into my leg as I expected it would Overall I would give these shoes a three star rating as far as comfort is concerned I have ordered items from this seller numerous times and have been very pleased with them They ship quickly and their items are always good quality I highly recommend them Ravenov 
Wolverine Hikers Boots I received my order very promptly It was exactly as ordered It was in new excellent condition 
awesome summer shoe durable these tevas are great i bought the same exact ones for my daughter last year She wore them in the lake in Texas at the beach in New Jersey and hiking all over they are a great all around summer shoe and are very durable When we first get them i usually wash them cause they are a bit stiff my son has exzema on his feet so they are scratchy he has blue teva hurricanes other then that i dont see anything bad about these shoes 
Have Kids Need Tevas I have four children I have bought multiple pairs of these sandals for each of them I had one pair that actually made it through three children They are so great because they do not slip off like flip flops and give better support yet they are waterproof and comfortable for them For our home they are a must have for each of the children 
Great for narrow feet I love these shoes My daughter has really narrow feet and they fit her just right with the velcro straps at the ankle and by her little toes They hold up really well and don t even stink after a summer of fun and winter days at the beach 
They re pants Got these for X_mas I like them I could do without the pockets down by the ankles 
Leather Key Chain Wallets A good product at a good price though the shipping was a bit high 
Great running shoe for the price My daughter runs high school track and has used several pairs of these shoes They run slightly small as she normally takes size 8 but needs 8 5 in these She has low arches 
The perfect workout shoe I originally bought this shoe for running on a treadmill but after I tried them on I loved them Now I where them everywhere I go They are so comfortable I have really high arches and had read that these worked great for those kinds of feet They do for awhile but after a long day of walking in them the top of my right arch began to ache from rubbing on the tongue of the shoe thats why I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 Other than that I just love them they are stylish comfortable on the soles of your feet and just what I was looking for 
Best running shoe value I recently retired my ASICS 1110s after racking up 300 miles These shoes are by far the best value for runners I used to wear Nike but read in Runner s World Magazine that the ASICS 1100 was the Editor s Choice for best overall running shoe so I thought why not In the past I ve dealt with shin splints knee pain and plantar facitis a k a sore feet but my ASICS 1100s kept me healthy and comfortable and relatively stylish I now own ASICS Kayano running shoes which cost 135 considerably more than the 1100s and truthfully I find no difference between the two pair of running shoes except for the price I ran about 15 20 miles per week in these shoes enjoying superior comfort If you run short or medium distances lt 25 miles per week this is the shoe for you 
A fine sock Appearance and comfort were acceptable Kept my foot warm in cold Great Lakes winter Would give five stars but I only rate socks that high until after I ve worn them for a full year first 
The most comfort out there These are my single favorite pair of underwear Not your typical jock but much more comfortable and stylish I m in the military so at first I thought thongs are not for real men but after wearing these I found they are and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize I wear these for every day activivties sports work and leisure There isn t much fabric so they re great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy After wearing them for a while it s like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it If you ve never owned a thong I think you should give these a shot I definately recomend the RIPS J 
bad boning I recieved this corset as a gift I wore it for about an hour when I started feeling something poking me in the side The boning was coming through on both sides I have other corsets that I have worn over and over again and never had a problem Never have I had something brand new fall apart like that I am waiting for the return email from fifi 
Think Pink I bought these for my 2 college daughters Nice girly and they appear to be well made Lots of room inside for papers etc 
Practical Rolling Laptop Case I purchased the Olympia Rolling Computer Tote to alleviate shoulder pain from carrying my laptop to and from the office every day It has suited my needs very well although it would be nice if the case were just a bit larger There is room for my laptop and my wallet a couple of file folders and little else One more outside pocket would have been nice but at this price the case more than meets my expectations 
cute pants i love these pants the shape is adorable on my son they are so comfortable to wear around the house but cute enough to wear out also i highly recommend these pants 
exelente disculpen que tarde en escribir este review pero no me di cuenta que no lo habia hecho puedo decir con toda propiedad que esta gerrera es muyyyyyyy buena no he tenido problemas de ningun tipo con ellos cuando lo pedi no tardaron nada en enviarmela y me enviaron exactamente lo que pedi y tambien la guerrera es de una calidad inigualable estoy pensando en comprar mas para venderlos entre mis amigos en mi pais jejejeje ha lo unico es que viene con cuello mao pero esto me parece exelente 
nice boot I am glad i read the reviews before purchasing i wear a size 10 5 so i ordered a 8 5 They fit perfect After wearing them around the house for a week to break them in they feel great Great value 
Looks like the same as those made a few years ago Came as scheduled and they fit Had some like this before Hope they last as long as those did 
Finally got one to fit Quality is excellent fit is perfect but is two sizes smaller that the boot I normally wear I went from a 13 to and 11 1 2 Never had this problem with Rockports before Somehow they are oversized Had to pay return shipping on two pair before these but was worth it because of price and quality 
Great shoe worth the money I go thorugh a lot of shoes Basically other than the winter boots and summer sandals I wear the same pair of shoes everyday to work and after Ken Cole has made a great pair of shoes I normally stay around 60 for each pair so I went a bit further and it was definately worth it Hold these oxfords and you can instantly see the quality put into them These will last for a long time As far as comfort the gel soles in them work fantastic The leather does take a little bit of wear before it forms to your foot meaning the top edge around the ankle especially the heal rubs into you for about two or three days This sometimes happens with any new shoe Anyway I would definately buy again 
Easy Purchase Product is fine no surprises It is exactly as described good fit good quality 
Bali Wire Free Soft Cup Bra 3351 Good support without that awful underwire digging into you Not many wireless bras are available for larger sizes Comfortable even after a long day 
Zana Di Belted Button Pockets Jeans DARK DENIM These pants are very comfortable and stylish Many people have asked to borrow them from me 
Just thought I would add At ShoeBuy here s what the reviews said Customer Reviews of Kenneth Cole Reaction Flex Along of Reviews 6 Overall Customer Rating 4 1 2 out of 5 stars Shoe Size 100 of people said that this shoe Felt true to size Shoe Width 100 of people said that this shoe Felt true to width Reviwers said I already have a pair and I love them so I wanted a backup pair The design is great though the heel is a bit high Soft sole very comfortable even from the first wear Personally I like them I wear them to work 3 4 times a week Hope it helps 
Don t believe this I was very disappointed with this product I was mislead when I read in the product feature section that these shoes were Made in Italy That s not correct They re made in China The bottom is that these shoes are very uncomfortable 
Should have stuck to my guns The sneakers are great and they arrived from vendor in time for Christmas but I wanted one size and someone called from company before they shipped and talked me into smaller size and now these 55 00 sneakers don t fit my daughter Of course she wore them for an entire day on vacation with aching feet so can t return 
No Worries This was a difficult item to find in the stores in a size three I found it easily online and it arrived in a timely fashion for Christmas My daughter couldn t be happier Helped ease a bit of the holiday stress 
warmth The items were fine but they were all shipped individually and arrived and different time spread out over a 4 week period The item was not what i expected though and i returned them The return was hassel fre 
Good comunication Good communication from seller regarding delay arrived well packaged and within reasonable time prior to X mas Will Return 
Great beginner shoe I ordered these dance shoes for my toddler who loves to dance but has not started lessons yet They are a soft sturdy well constructed shoe at a price that is easy to digest Having real dance shoes has helped to continue that spark of interest in her She wears them daily and they are holding up well They also stay on even with all the twists and turns on both hard floor and carpet I would buy these shoes again and recommend them to anyone with the same needs in a shoe 
very nice polo I bought 1 of this for my girlfriend i must to say that she love it in right time to saw it ir s very soft and look very good the green it s a little bit intense than the picture but not to much just a little bit 
It s Bostonian What would you expect Fit construction looks are excellent as always with Bostonian 
Beautiful and according to hubby comfy too My husband LOVES these shoes He needed new dress shoes so I got these for him in both colors He said they are the MOST comfortable dress shoes he s worn in ages I think they look wonderful too Thanks Amazon 
if UGGly was another word for comfortable then thes boots are hideous i love ugg boots a while back i had 2 pairs that i wore so much they were practically black i would put them on first thing in the morning and even leave them on as i went to bed sometimes the are so comfortable on the inside its like walking on a fur blanket 
Awesome Boots These boots are great and comfortable they look great with everything you wear and are convenient to just slip on and go 
Clarks clogs I have many pairs of Clarks clogs many needig replacement now after sev l yrs wear I have purchased a few pairs recently and do not find them as well made conmfortable as my original pairs of 3 5 yrs ago I wonder if they changed their fit style manufacturing I still wear them as they are better than other brands so far Overall love Clarks Am recently disappointed 
Awesome Shoes I love these shoes they are so comfortable I wear them at work I could run in these shoes if I needed too I highly recommend them 
PLEASED I haven t received this order yet as I ordered it today 
nice hat i like it a lot i wear it as a beret type thing not as a ski hat its cute 
Wonderful lid silly reviewer I just don t understand why the original reviewer came down on this manufacturer when it s obviously a problem with mail I own this Kufi and get nothing but compliments on how well it s made and how well it fits my pointy noggin I love it and am getting ready to buy more from them 
Perfect fit for my melon A great beanie for late fall and early spring weather They are knit in a way to offer enough ventilation and springy enough where it won t stretch out to quickly 
Good beanie for the price I bought a black and a brown one and am pretty happy with them The only flaw in my mind is that it is kind of tight around your forehead but it is a minor thing 
EXCELLENT PRODUCT The product I recieved looked just like the picture It shipped very fast and when the product wasn t exactly what my husband was looking for he is kinda picky The company had no problem with refunding my money I reccomend the seller to anyone Very easy to work with Thanks a bunch 
Rainboots I have been buying Kidorable rainboots for my grandkids for the last several years They are well constructed and made I will continue to buy them in the future 
Exactly what I was looking for I wasn t able to find these socks anywhere else I knew exactly what I wanted and Amazon had them They looked just like the photo Very comfortable However I wouldn t recommend these to anyone whose feet are bigger than a 6 1 2 My feet are 6 1 2 and they just fit perfectly I purchased the white pair and they were WHITE I wanted them for my wedding and I was very glad to see they were true white I had ordered other items from other websites for my wedding and when I ordered white I received cream ivory or off white Not very pleasing I was very pleased with these anklets though 
Excellent product and prompt delivery I initially ordered Under Armour long sleeve tops that were really warm and an Under Armour pair of gloves that also fit very well This pair of tights just completed my collection of thermal clothing because warmth is a priority for me especially during cold weather I would suggest ordering a size larger than usual 
Pretty good I bought this armband a few days ago and it works pretty well It does a nice job of holding my nano and it s easy to control and adjust It s kind of small though Would buy again 
I love it I just received my armband for my iPod NANO and I am very happy with my purchase It is really lightweight comfortable and easy to adjust The Hot Pink color is perfect with my workout sweats too It stays put on my arm while working out and I am easily able to adjust my tunes I will definitely bookmark this website for future NANO purchases 
Pretty satisfied I really like it because it s very soft But the sizes are a bit too big 
Love this pair Clarks Liquid = comfortable plus weather proof The perfect outdoor footwear for my Chicago life Looks great also A++ 
my little girl loved it My daughter wanted some Heelies but her feet are too small So these worked out perfect for her little feet She s 4 and absolutely loves them I plan to get a pair for her little brother when he s old enough 
You will want to buy more than one pair I bought these pants in black and I love them I wear them at least once a week so I had to buy another pair in the khaki They hold up well to washing and remain comfortable to wear 
Hasn t shipped after 2 months update these slippers finally arrived last week It only took about 3 months for them to arrive That said they appear to be of very good quality I ordered a pair of these on November 13 As of January 16 they still haven t shipped Would be nice to know if they ever will be shipped 
Comfortable to the max This is a wonderful slipper It s warm cozy and fully padded on the bottom It s even hand washable It s just the thing on crisp cold night after a day on your feet 
If you ever get them I ordered these over a month ago and Amazon still hasn t shipped them Be careful if you need them soon I have spoken with customer service at least 5 times and have not gotten a straight story 
Good Value These slippers are very comfortable Warm and soles are non skid I love mine but they run a little small 
Snowflake I really liked the style It is one of the better ones they have had in years If possible it would be better if exact sizes were available i e 6 1 2 7 7 1 2 The product is very nicely made 
Alia microfiber pants size 10P Delivered in a timely manner in excellent condition The fit is great I m under 5 feet tall and have a hard time getting a good fit The fabric is nice too and comfortable I m very pleased with this purchase 
Nautica V Neck Tee Shirt They are really soft and comfortable I bought some for my sons and liked them so much I bought some for myself to use as nightshirts Perfect weight Love them 
Jacket This is a high quality jacket and if and when we need more will be ordering them from this company 
Great Deal I purchased 12 of these shirts for Xmas gifts They came several days ahead of schedule Also found buying this way was much cheaper than other web sites offering the exact same product 
Not Quite the Same Shoe I Bought in the Department Store The two pairs of Deer Stag Times Dress Shoes I purchased in department stores were both extremely comfortable from the very first time I put them on my feet The shoes I received recently were equal to those first pairs as far as the insoles were concerned but the uppers were much stiffer and cut into my ankle around the sides and tongue area This was a disappointment as I can no longer find these shoes in area department stores and was really excited to find them available online 
super comfortable and feel like I am wearing slippers Order the shoe on 5 Feb and received on 13 Feb Great feel and good looking shoe Only problem is there s a fold on top of the left shoe that doesn t look normal 
Incredibly cool belt buckle This belt buckle will guaranteed catch people s attention at parties and other social gatherings where there is beer It s easy to attach to the belt and stays in place The only reason I m not giving it 5 stars is because the tooth for opening the bottles with should have been placed at the bottom of the O since it s hard to open bottles and easy to spill beer on yourself the way it is on this one 
Great Bra I really love this bra It is very comfortable and supportive My only problem is I ordered it too large in the band so I can t use it for running nice for wearing around though 
sexy and sassy When I received the robe set it was even prettier in person than on the screen I wear it every nite I am a breast cancer survivor and when I wear this I feel sexier than ever It is so comfortable also If anyone is thinking about it I wouldn t even hesitate It washes fantastically I may even get it in another color 
Excellent product and service I love this robe set the colors are beautiful and vibrant and the material is very soft and comfortable 
Simply the BEST Love this case Offers the best protection with the same detail as nano itself I highly recommend it 
Very good jacket Attractive and good quality Great jacket A little less warm than I thought but perfect for spring or fall and mildly cold weather 
Good quality This robe and it s gown really are the essence of luxury I love it 
sexy I got it early and when i put it on it fit perfect I m a dress size 3 and ordered the small it s really sexy very flatering on your chest it made me look at least a cup size bigger because of all the bunched up material the only thing i did not like was the skirt is made of some wierd plastic material and was all wrinkled when i opened it But i put it in the dryer for like 10 minutes and everything came out looking perfect my husband had NO complaints whatsoever 
Great robe and fast shipping Very nice terry robe and received early Will buy from this company again very soon 
Great Gift Idea this is my 2nd purchase from Spa Resort and my 3rd hooded bathrobe I received this new purchase quickly It will make for a great Christmas gift 
This T is way cool I looked at hundreds of soccer T shirts on line This one stood out My niece loves it too the colors and the design It is well made with beautiful colors I wish I d gotten one for myself 
comfortable These pants are hugely comfortable They are low rise However the material will grab any thigh or butt flaw you have and put it on display If you have thunder thighs or a larger than average butt these probably won t flatter you at all Size reference I m a low 10 high 8 The medium is snug on me You should probably go a size larger than you think because a larger size is less likely to be unflattering 
Shoe Skates We gave the Supergirl roller skates to our daughter for her 7th birthday in December These are her second pair of shoe skates she grew out of the first Bratz pair She wears them frequently and enjoys skating inside the house around the basement playroom only or outside on the concrete sidewalk or asphalt driveway The skates seem to do well on most surfaces They are durable not too heavy appear to be well made the rollers open and close easily Very nice retractable shoe skates The service at Amazon was great We would not hesistate to purchase another pair 
what I was looking for This suit is really nice from the standpoint of it is exactly what it looks like online The leg openings have elastic around the openings that helps keep deter creep up the legs The zipper is in the back so extra care must be taken while zipping The material is very smooth and will pick when in contact with a rough surface like the pool edge The fabric is very thin so if show through headlights bother you a sports bra underneath will help that and the fact that there is not a lot of bra support The purple is a really pretty color 
Works great for me No shoe or brand is going to work for everyone but I m convinced the New Balance 587 is the best one for me I m a big ol fat boy 6 2 210lbs with feet that are stupid wide 13EEEE I started running in my late 40s and ran my first marathon at age 49 and I haven t used any other running shoe for the past several years When I hit 350 400 miles I get a new pair convert my running pair to my walking pair and throw out the current walking pair 
14 x 14 Photo Album Truely a beautiful album I bought mine a few months ago and have been completely impressed Before I was lucky enough to find this album online I spent a few weeks going from specialty shop to specialty shop trying to find an album with high quality yet still not too flashy If you like the way that this album looks but are not quite sure if it will be good enough worry no more On top of the great product the seller is a very nice person who I would recomend to any person I know I would HIGHLY suggest to buy this album if you are in the market for such an item 
A Moc Much Like The Ones Our Native American Grandmas Wore I have seen pictures of moccasins much like these while researching Ojibwe Chippewa history so decided to order a pair They have the soft sole and a foam insole for comfort they are a medium width but work well for a somewhat narrower foot because the tie is adjustable They seem to be very well made of good quality materials at a reasonable price They are very comfortable they were promptly shipped I am 100 pleased with this transaction 
Nice Shoes I like them a lot but they run almost half a size larger These are my second pair of Skechers and I had the same problem with the first ones I m a 9 5M but the 9 0 fit better 
new shoes These shoes are exactly what I have been looking for although as usual I waited until the stores no longer carried them in stock My only regret is that I could not find them available the brown in my size but the bronze will do very nicely The service and price were excellent 
Comfy This is a great shoe It s actually very cute in person and very comfortable for standing walking all day I love being able to wear heels all day and not have my feet hurt when I get home 
Five Stars From my Wife My wife loves this shoe s style comfort and durability This is why I have confidence in buying an additional pair for her birthday gift My wife is an exacting connoisseur of quality and so this is high praise 
Great Shoe The first time i saw this shoe i thought to myelf this is a unique shoe I decided i had to have it but when i got it that was another story I loved the shoe so much i started wearing it immediately Everywhere i wore it to people was just staring and saying how much they love it The shoe is very comfortable the feeling of soft leather pressing against your foot is never more welcome I love it wouldn t trade it for anything else 
Loves them My husband loves these shoes and they look great They do run about a half size small so I d recommend trying some on before ordering 
Wife lokes it Given as a gift to my wife She is happy with the shoes 
great comfy boots but they re not white These Women s Winter White Short Rubber Waterproof Rain Boots are great They re really cute comfy slight heel slippage but that s probably an issue with the shape of my feet and don t look cheap However they aren t white as described or shown in the picture They re definitely a creamy off white color Luckily I like that better than pure white but some people expecting bright white might be disappointed 
Great Value I hadn t been skiing in over 15 years so I didn t want to spend too much money outfitting myself for a weekend trip I definitely got my s worth with this purchase it was great The versatility is nice it was a fairly warm day which made being able to wear the jacket w o the fleece perfect The only drawback for me is the hard edge of the hood visor which I imagine might be quite practical when stored in the collar it s a bit uncomfortable 
so nice I love my new jacket It is so warm and totally wind proof The fleece itself is very warm and it s awesome that you can wear the fleece and the shell in combinations looks sharp fits well good buy 
Love those boots These boots are the best 3rd birthday dress up fireman boots ever My 3 year old loves them I m sure they are great rain boots as well but we live in a dry climate The boots came with a few little mars on the stripes didn t have time to exchange them or I would have 
Fireman boots My son got these for his birthday in Feb and he wears them everywhere school store outside and they are holding up very well Thanks so much 
size Great product and fast shipping Only trouble is the size I found the chart hard to read and when they arrived they seamed to run big BUT I have to say they seem like they are sturdy boots and will last MY SON LOVES THEM 
Cute boots Very cute well made boots and this was the best price I found for them 
Great item for kids who like to dress up Which is the reason that I got these boots for my friend s son He has a fireman s costume and the boots were necessary to complete the set He loves them The boots are sturdy and attractive and could be used as functional boots if necessary Great item 
Fireman child s raincoat These are great raincoats and the children who received them absolutely love them I recommend them to without hesitation A word to the wise I did not buy a fireman s helmet did do the boots and my Grandson really did expect to see a helmet 
Western Chief Kids Fire Department Rain Boot Love love love I cannot get them of my son s feet 
Very Satisfied I was very pleased with this item I also purchased the raincoat and hat to match I purchased these items for my grandson for Christmas and he immediately put them on The items shipped ahead of the expected date and I was really happy that I did not have to worry about having them for Christmas 
CUTE AND FUNCTIONAL I bought these for my son at Christmas so that he could have them to wear during playtime outside at preschool He LOVES them I bought a size up so that he could wear them into the spring I love them for two reasons they protect is feet in a fun way AND they stand out so he has no problem finding them among 30 other pairs of rain boots Definetly recommend these 
Awesome I purchased these boots to go with my sons fire fighter costume he has been squeezing his feet into frog boots two sizes too small to have firefighter type boots They are great quality and very durable He has worn them everyday for over a month even to bed 
Comfy yet fashionable I tore my plantar facia a couple of years a go and have worn Clarks ever since I like these shoes because they are comfortable but still look good 
What are the extra buttonholes for After years of wanting some overalls my wife got me a pair for my 35th birthday She says I now look like the 5 yr inside of them But what are the two extra buttonholes in the bib pockets for I figure one of them is for a pen or pencil but I can t figure out what the other is for They are comfy spacious and have plenty of pocket room for tools and nails nut and bolts A must have for any man though they are much sexier on women 
good quality got just what we ordered came timely and were very good quality would definately do business agai 
Great quality for a low price I needed these tap shoes quickly and couldnt afford to spend too much money I got them within the week and payed a lot less than i had expected to pay I reccomend discount dance as well as all purchases through Amazon 
Uncomfortable but functional These shoes work well but are very uncomfortable I wouldn t recommend them if you have to wear them for more than 15 or 20 minutes I use them to practice with my daughter they work fine for that 
Gold Toe Women s Tressis Sock is Great I ve been searching all over for a black sock to wear with dress loafers I ve worn pantyhose with the shoes but frankly socks are more comfortable DKNY used to make a good sock for this purpose but they discontinued it I don t like knee highs or bulky fabric or a sock that is constricting at the top bad for circulation This sock is perfect It s soft and resiliant and the height is just right a bit below mid calf I feel like I could dance on air 
poor quality even poorer service The order was processed slowly it was shipped days after it should have been The website said it was in stock yet an employee told me it was not in stock after they already had my money Of course I paid instantly for it with American Express When the pants finally arrived AFTER the vacation I ordered them for I was very disappointed with the quality of the elastic waist and the very poor design of the pockets I have purchased higher quality clothing at Walmart for 1 3 the price They refunded the postage If they had shipped them overnight as soon as they got them or if they refunded the shipping and their profit margin I would have been pleased and impressed It was a disappointing experience with expediency shipping quality price and service At least nobody was rude Dr B dallas texa 
Knit Hood Hat Keeps you nice and warm in cold weather Wore it in 58 inches of snow and it worked great would recomend this to anyone who lives in cold areas nice neck warmer als 
I love these shoes I wear these shoes all the time because they go with everything The only problem is that I go through them so quickly I often run a hole through the sole and they don t always stay buckled so sometimes I safety pin them classy But I still love these shoes 
Velvet May Janes Shoes are cute I expected a plusher velvet but they are nice anyways 
snazzy cool shoes love the bowling shoes they definitely stand out in a crowd gee they might even make me bowl better teehee they are a little stiff and hope they soften up but all in all LOVE THEM 
great bag I am delighted with this bag It s the perfect size and has numerous pockets and zipper compartments The leather is soft and pliable Highly recommended 
My Tignatelli handbag this is the kind of bag I ve been looking for and couldn t find in the stores I m very happy with it 
Snow shoes Kept my feet nice and warm in the snow and had good traction on ice Great price 
Great warm boots These boots are great They are very warm no more freezing feet when walking in snow True to size maybe a bit larger than normal I ordered my normal size and still have plenty of room even with thick wool socks 
Good buy Look sharp at the gym Kind of squeeky when wet I throw them in the washing machine to clean them I liked them enough to give a pair away as a gift j g Staten Island N 
Superb The order was smooth the item was shipped out promptly and recieved much earlier than expected However the most striking thing was that I found a hole in the inseam after one washing I reported it a month later and they sent me a new pair no questions no charge I need to note that such a hole is just my bad luck it is in no way common with this company I love this company and as I have already told them I will look here first the next time I need to purchase anything 
Amazing Shoes Just wait a bit more and everyone will be wearing them I m the envy of many of my friend 
Great It s so hard to find seam stockings and these were a great pair They were exactly what I was looking for There sexy and perfect for the night out or with a trendy suit 
Lovely backseam pantyhose I don t quite understand why backseam pantyhose and nylon stockings are not more popular with females Backseam pantyhose are not especially easy to find but the allure of a backseam in pantyhose or nylon stockings is very sexy I enjoy wearing this Hue Black Sheer Backseam pantyhose as it is comfortable sensual and sexy Keep in mind though this pantyhose has a control top that is not sheer Therefore it would be best not to wear this pantyhose with quite short minidresses and mini skirts I would like to see more backseam pantyhose offered especially in beige 
Awesome no more hot lap I am now able to use my laptop Dell Inspiron 8200 HOT for a few hours without sweating or feeling any heat The laptop stays cooler than actually being on my lap My lap desk also came with a sticker indicating which side the laptop is supposed to lie on The laptop surface is hard and is covered in thin sturdy fabrics while the lap surface is cushioned I frequently use my laptop on my lap with my knees bent up so the non slip surfaces partial on top an full on bottom make it convenient to do so 
Works Great Unlike the prior reviewer mine came with a sticker instructing me to put the laptop on the rigid surface with the soft surface sitting on my legs It works great No problems with my laptop getting hot and I an actually sit with it on my legs for a couple of hours without feeling any heat The only caveat is that it s a bit bulky to travel with great for home I purchased one of their Chinooks which rolls up for flying and am extremely happy with it also 
Rockport Prowalkers Received what I wanted and wear all the time I like em 
you get what you pay for I was looking for a compass to put on my daughters bike and bought a couple of these It does not work very well wether it is on the bike or away from the bike 
great transportable fun Helps make my son remember to practice Quick light easy to move around Love how it is collapsable Much easier to commit to from a space perspective than the big hockey goal big pitchback thing big basketball set up and other sports materials that have taken over our garage which cannot be dis assembled when not being used Plus I think the smaller size of these goals is a plus in working on accuracy in aim in kicking goals or passing I highly recommend this and it made a great birthday present when combined with a few toys 
Japanese flavor All things Japanese seems to be big right now Being a huge fan of the Japanese culture I like this These shoes are comfortable and stylish Flats with an ankle wrap and your very own Guardian Dragon They can be dressed up down and anywhere in between The fit was perfect 
Really comfortable I ve had it for 8 months now only problem is that the lace below the hooks is starting to tear I think they will prolly be trash after a year but they have been great for now 
I love this bra I purchased this bra through Birth and Baby when my son was a couple months old As I knew that Goddess bras are sized differently from most other bras I was in contact with the owner and got tons of wonderful help picking the right size for me Her advice for sizes was perfect At that time I was an I cup in most bras and she was a great help in getting me in an H cup in the Goddess bra I usually hate to wear bras as they dig in everywhere and are just plain uncomfortable This one I could wear all day and still leave it on when I get home After loosing weight I m now looking to purchase new bras and I will be getting more Goddess bras Even after my son weans I will be looking in to Goddess bras they have made a life long customer with their excellent bras 
tracy This is a wonderful bra Yes it does run in a larger size but if you get your fit right its the best bra you could own I have a very large chest and i have never found as good of support as this bra gives me I would diffently buy this bra again and again and again 
My favorite nursing bra for full figured women If you are full figured and looking for a good nursing bra I HIGHLY recommend the Goddess Cotton Soft Cup Nursing Bra 511 It has great support and has a secure clasp that is also quick to open Its all I wear now after trying several styles and brands 
Misleading advertisement The bra is advertised as 100 cotton there s only 33 cotton in it it is not soft whatsoever you can feel it And the fit is all wrong Completely useless I m returning it and very mad at the misleading name Cotton bra 
Not Totally Accurate According to the write up a 46 inch belt should comfortably fit a 48 inch waist This is not the case Apart from that an attractive belt 
Quality Boot These boots are both comfortable and provide good ankle support Unlike some boots with toe protection the toes are not cramped by the toe cap Side zip allows the wearer to put the boots on quickly while laces permit adjustment when needed Good looking boot and with pants over can be worn to town Very lightweight but appears to be solid Converse qualit 
LOVE IT I LOVE THIS PRODUCT I VE PURCHASED THE JEANS ARE NICE I WILL BUY FROM HERE AGAIN AND AGAIN I WISH THE SHIPPING WAS FASTER BUT BESIDES THAT I AM VERY SATISFIED 
Good choice for a V neck shirt Very nice shirts thin but firm provide ample space for your neck and don t strangle the throat Very happy with them A little pricey though 
Grandson loves NBA Shooting Sleeve I purchased this for my Grandson s 9th birthday He loves wearing the NBA Shooting sleeve while playing basketball 
Love It This is truly the first shapewear product that I can comfortably wear all day and not feel like I have to rip it off the moment I get home The material is soft not rubbery like other products It fits like a second skin but it s breathable It feels snug where you need to be like in the tummy area and relaxed where you want it to be like in the waist and crotch areas I m hooked 
Best Buy Ever I have been on a relentless search for a product like this Other shapewear that i have tried is either very uncomfortable or has no control Finally I have found a product that is both very comfortable and very supportive I truly look ten pounds lighter when I wear this You will get your money s worth with this product I have gotten the hight waist brief the full control body suit and the camisoles They all work like magic 
Dickie Jacket Great jacket and easy to order on line and received before Christmas You are great Amazon All my purchases were great Jacket was exactly what we ordered right size color etc Thank yo 
Very comfortable I love the shoes I was a little nervous about ordering them from reading the other review of them but I guess everyones feet are different Definitely a 5 star produc 
The best high top basketball shoe of all time I will never understand why Reebok discontinued the original BB4600 high tops they were simply the best ever made PERIOD Hopefully Reebok will start making them again soon These high tops especially the ones from the 1980s early 90s were far better than comparable shoes from Nike Puma Pony and Converse not surprisingly they go for impressive prices at online markets like Ebay 
Reebok Men s 4600 High Great reissue by Reebok of a shoe immensely popular in the early 1990 s It would be nice to see this trend of recreating classic styles from the past continue forward The 4600 High could come back in more color schemes with some colors vintage and some others contemporary Perhaps more real hi tops could be brought back by Reebok and other companies as well 
World s Most Comfortable Hi Tops I ve owned several pairs of the Reebok 4600 s and the newer 4600 Ultras over the years There just is none that can compare for support and absolute comfort As for support they can almost qualify as boots rather than sneakers but yet they are as softly padded as slippers I wear them without socks laced snug comfortably all day long So if you would like to go sockless in hi tops go with the 4600 s These babies are it 
Where have they gone I grew up wearing high top reebok shoes I have a problem with my foot and these are the only shoes that offer any support Years ago I have been forced to purchase other shoes due to the fact that I was unable to find these shoes Now that I have found them they dont have my size avalible 
Light t shirt soft and comfy Soft and comfy lightweight t shirt The only problem is that the neck does seem to get stretched out more eaisly but perhaps that s just because it s a fairly thin t shirt 
Sweet boots but be careful of sizing These boots seem to be very well made and I have yet to slip on ice due to the super grippy soles Of course they look awesome However I bought the smallest size that Demonia makes 6 and they are too big all around I m generally a size 6 sometimes 5 1 2 but these feel closer to a 7 or 8 I can t make my toes touch the end even if I try Also the boots stay up because they are stiff but they are also loose on my calves and ankles These are not designed for small and slender people 
A Chair is a Chair This stadium cushion is easy to carry it folds and snaps closed is very lightweight and looks great however if you are larger than about a 34 rear you are not going to be comfortable in it the cushion is smaller than most and the straps on the sides guarantee only smaller people will fit 
Perfect Undershirt The 2xist Touch line is so soft and fitted to just brush against the skin rather than tenting like most other undershirts They are extremely hard to find anymore 
Intimo Men s Classic Silk Knit Tank Top I love my Silk Tank Tops I wear them to work under my dress shirts and the feel is very nice Much more comfie than the Hanes cotton tanks The quality is very good for the price The initial fit was just a tad snug but stretched out just a bit after a couple of washes wears and is very comfortable now I tried wearing one on a hike but i find the coolmax type active wear handles sweating much better than silk But for casual wear or sleeping at night I love them 
nice fit This is a great fit for a silk shirt I thought it would not be a close fit being silk but I was wrong This item fits snug and looks great on Both alone and layered I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank 
Nice and sexy If you have the body to show for it by all means wear it alone 
Very silky and wearble I bought this top for my 18 year old son thought it looked comfortable to wear under shirts etc It is He likes wearing it but he says he would never wear it alone It is a wee bit too feminine to wear on top Would I buy another one I don t know I think for him the basic cotton tank tops are more versatile 
Definitely different from Speedo s other suits Some information I d like to share with future customers Not a drawstring waist Not an elastic waist either The waist is the same type of stretch seam as the legs so be mindful of which opening is which when putting this on Fully lined front and back with light skin tone 100 polyester The shell is labeled as given in the product description 78 nylon 22 Lycra elastane spandex Because of the polyester lining this isn t a competition i e very stretchy very tight suit Go ahead and order your regular waist size you ll get a recreational fit Remember there is no drawstring or elastic in the waist so be cautious about jumping a full size upward 36 is a Large but 34 you might go Medium instead Wears fine as active underwear with no visible seams under running tights and no discomfort during dry workouts in the gym or the great outdoors 
The Gentlemens thong For the sophisticated man I rated this product earlier I bought these thongs a couple of years ago directly from speedo Now older and wiser I strapped them on once again Still love them More appropriate for private use not recreational More beach friendly than they seem are very comfortable and sexy to wear The speedo thong has become more user friendly for pool parties believe it or not and beaches OR as underwear support for your regular speedo they are not competition suits More fashion wear since the last time i bought them they have become much more form fitting since Alas they are tighter obviously the waist has shrunk and and back strap is more snug or i am fatter than i was 3 years ago Which i doubt well not really knowing speedo they were discontinued for a while anyway i was in miami for christs sake the more bulge the merrier anyway if you are a guy and a not sure get one and wear it in the shower or tub at first if you re not sure like i did go a size up and u will thank me they roc 
hot its a good looking suit i ware a small in all things but not this it should have been a m think of getting a size biger than what you war 
every man has to have this is my favorite swimsuit when i go to the beach all the girl check me out cause what im wearing is hot and sexy and the girls love it 
Just look at it I want this suit so much I have the speedo brief that has 1 inch sides but this suit is way better I can t find it in any sporting goods stores so I guess I am going to have to buy it off Amazon Just think if you buy this suit you will be the only male with a thong swimsuit in the pool I swim at recreation center I cant wai 
Not a 12pack Only a 2pack I bought this product because the description read 12 Pack but I actually received a 2 pack 
She walks like an angel These pants combline beautifullly with other items from this vendor for adorable outfits I combined these with the pink bubble shirt for a fun time to take this little doll from summer into fall The clothes are well made wash like a dream and don t fade with color safe detergent This vendor will call you to verify your order if they have any problems They will assist you through other selections and shipping options Excellent 
Great for Spring These yoga pants are great for Spring The dye lot matches the other items I ve purchased from The Children s Place True to size and comes in different colors 
Great Shoes This is the 4th pair of Rockports I have owned These are great This is the only pair of shoes I have been able to put on brand new and wear the entire day and not make my feet hurt 
Very happy customer I had similar shoes to these before I bought these Theses are my replacements They fit perfect and were shipped out quickly I have no complaints 
excellent shoes and price It s almost impossible to find shoes that fit when you wear 11 1 2 narrow But luckily I ve discovered shoes without having to order from Macy s or Nordstrom s and at a reasonable price 
Men s Reebok Ex o Fit Hi 1538 I made my purchase less than two weeks before Christmas The shoes were a Christmas gift for my brother and I wasn t certain they would arrive in time All white hi tops in size 14 are difficult to find in stores in my area Well they shoes arrived shortly after my order and my brother loved them I will definitely order from this company again 
Sharp looking shoes Combines the Clarks comfort with a sassy heeled sandal look as good with the little black dress as with jeans 
Great shoes I got these simply because they were on sale and I needed a new pair of casual kicks These are awesome Comfortable excellent quality all around a good investment for the 35 dollars I paid 
Great quality This is my first pair of Steve Madden shoes and I was anxious to find out how well they wear I was very pleasantly surprised by the comfort level The only minus is the fact that the leather does show creases very easily but other than that it is a very nice casual all round shoe 
Great shoes These are great shoes for driving and around the house The only negatives are the soles are very slippery if wet on smooth surfaces and the width of the design stitching are obviously different between the two feet I love these shoes for driving and everyday around the house 
Good value for the money I bought these shoes for my boyfriend for Christmas He loves them The leather isn t the best quality but they are stylish and comfortable and he wears them all the time They look very nice 
nice and comfy I bought a pair in black They fit perfectly and are soooo comfy The bottom of the shoe is zigzag so it flexes easily like you re not wearing shoes I gave it four stars cuz I had to cut off the tassel since it looks like worms hanging off your shoe which was real easy and the bottom of the shoe is not completely covered with rubber part of it is suede so you can t wear it near water Otherwise very comfy and cute 
Elegant Pump I bought this pump in brown for my wedding It matches perfectly with my brown and lilac dress But it does runs small I m a true size 9 but ordered a size 9 5 And even the 9 5 fit a little snug on my feet at first but loosened up within 1 2 hour of having them on They could be worn with jeans and a nice top as well 
COMFORT for your feet I bought these slides from Adidas about a week ago and I absolutely love them I usually wear Crocs because of their comfort level but these slides are like walking on air I guarantee you will not want to wear anything else 
Review of Microfiber Shorts I am very pleased with this item I have not been able to find this brand of shorts in my shopping area The item described was as I expected and it arrived promply I would order this again 
nice shoe but VERY wide I ve been wearing this shoe for several months now and my only complaint is that it s a very wide shoe So wide you d think it was unisex sizing The problem is the footbed itself Even though you can cinch the upper and the shoe is secure on your foot you can t cinch it up so your foot can t slide sideways inside it Otherwise it s easy on off secure tread never slipped on dock yet And it would be fine for women w wide feet who would ordinarily buy a men s athletic shoe Also seems very durable 
One of the greatest shoes ever This purchase was a gift for my husband He and I have owned Keens since the day they came on the market WE LOVE THEM This pair is his 3rd pair and he could not be more happy with them They are the perfect shoe for everything from river hiking to dry land hiking to a day in the city to a day at the park They are comfortable and oh so reliable Keen Newport H2 s are a must for just about everyone can you tell I really dig these shoes hehee 
Wonderful Rainboots We love these rainboots They look so great with the matching raincoat and work really well in the rain 
Quality Shoes Glad I found these shoes They were what my grandson was looking for They seem to be of very good quality and the fit was exactly in the size offered I would recommend ordering this shoe or others made by Adidas 
Short Term Review I just got these sneaks recently I am going through the wear in phase of the shoes So these opinions are based soley no pun intended on my time with them so far Originally I had gotten a pair of the Jordan Hoops Low I loved the style and got a good deal on them Well I found out that 13 in Jordan is more like 11 or 12 in other shoes So I had them returned for a 14 I got the 14 s and they were long enough just not wide enough It was then that I found out most of the Jordan b ball shoes are pretty thin width I told the guy that I am willing to look at what they have in the store to just get something that I can try on I ended up trying the KG A3 and they felt nice I tried on these T Mac 6s next and they feel better than the KGs overall The KGs felt better on the heel but that was the only place Everywhere else the T Macs are more comfortable and it is the perfect width Just on the shoe they are hurting my feet just a bit but that is common for me for the break in period I am overweight and flat footed so it takes a while for me to get my shoes comfortable They are also warm inside I am just wearing normal cotton socks right now not my new Jordan dri fit socks which wick better I notice that there are no ventilation holes on the the shoe like most have None on the toe area none on the tongue and none on the sides There is also no meshy fabric to help ventilation either One thing I worry about is the stability system on the bottom of the shoe Long term it seems like it would be like the Shox system My local shoe expert says he gets many returns for Shox that have been torn or worn at the Shox part prematurely but never had any T Macs back yet I guess we will see 
Mike Demeusy Top notch I have been using custom shoe arch supports for the past year due to lower back problems I usually purchase other brands of shoes with size 11 wide 2 4 The T Macs come in regular width so I purchased size 12 They fit great I now have four pair of the T Mac Series and I can wear them comfortably without the arch supports These shoes have style and comfort Can t wait for next line of T Macs 
Review of Carhartt Shirt The shirt was the perfect gift for my father in law He loved it He is an old farmer who freezes all the time The shirt was a great gift The product was in great condition and was the color and style I ordered 
Nice Jersey It was a christmas gift for my 11 year old cousin who loves tiki he was so excited with the present and has wore it every day since 
Love these boots This is the first pair of boots of this type I ve owned They re amazingly comfortable look great and have terrific traction We had a very snowy winter and these saw me through Good buy 
Sorel Women s Ahnah Black 10 M Love the product Excellent Quality size was too big will order a smaller size 
The Best First let me say that my order was delivered to me in no time I acutally had to return and order a size down and received my new order in a couple of days These boots are very very warm and comfortable They are great for the snow and ice They have great grippers on the bottom to help prevent you from falling I ve ordered two pair for below the price of one seen on other website Very happy with my purchase 
Furrry and Fun I brought these boots before I went to Michigan and I had them sent overnight just so I could wear them on my trip To be honest when I first got them they arrived at my mom s house and when I took them out of the box I was very very disappointed but my mom LUVED EM I dress really different anyway so it kinda blew my mind that she would LUV EM She convinced me to keep em and I did and she also said how cold it is in Michigan and I would need them over there and trust me I did I got alot of compliments from people in the airport and that boosted my liking of the boot a WHOLE LOT Now I m gonna buy them in the winter white They re warm very very comfortable and cute wide like the other comment said but that s what makes them different from other boots and stylish I highly recommend them 
A fun boot Bought these boots here on Amazon because of the fabulous bargain price and I was not disapppointed They look absolutely marvelous on and are so comfy like wearing a big soft bedroom slipper They are very warm and also waterproof so they can withstand most any kind of weather I almost always wear an 8 in boots but in these an 8 was way too large This boot does run a little roomy So I got the 7 5 and am very happy with it One caveat these are not lightweight boots The pair weighs a little over 3 lbs which is slightly on the heavy side for long walks but I don t plan on walking miles in them For looks and weather protection they can t be beat In the picture the foot looks slimmer but they have the wide foot look of a mukluk style Still the cute fake fur tops make them very stylish Also the suede straps around the boot are for looks only don t try tightening them I ve heard of several cases where people tried to tighten them and they broke 
Great Boot Great Price I just received the boots last night I love them The fit is a bit snug I ordered a 7 5 but have a slightly wide foot but have plenty of room at the heel I ll just wear medium weight socks There is a thin adjustable black top above the fur Handy to keep the snow out but the photo doesn t show that Great value for the money 
My new favorites The Rockport Men s Brooklands Waterproof Oxfords are outstandingly comfortable I don t even bother to take them off after work Totally waterproof and yet your feet don t sweat in them at all I like the black leather ones that can do work or casual duty I am particularly pleased with the classic plain and simple styling no square or pointed toe no weird sewing pattern or cap toe either simply a beautifully formed one piece toe that says quality workmanship all over it Indeed the craftsmanship in this shoe is second to none and the cushioning is more than adequate for long stints walking on concrete Buy them you ll like them 
Great everyday shoe at a great price I ve been wearing these Waterproof Rockports for years but this is the first pair I ordered directly from Amazon They are terrific everyday shoes Very comfortable and very practical waterproof They now come with Vibram soles I believe for the first time The price from Amazon is significantly less than what I have paid at local discount retail outlets in the past 
These shoes will make you melt Fellas beware if you buy these shoes for a girl because once she puts them on it is all over for you It was for me They are much hotter than could ever be described here In fact they are too amazing to even be given a vocabulary Do yourself a favor and by your girl these shoes You will not regret it I know I didn t A girl can never ever had too many pairs of shoes but if she had to own just one pair I would pray to God it was these 
Cute Boots I really like these boots they re cute and good quality and the heel isn t too high Unfortunately they re way too big on me I usually wear an 8 or 8 5 and there were no 8 s available so I ordered the 8 5 They re too big and I m returning them Otherwise I would ve been very happy 
Georgialee This was a gift and he was very pleased The quality was good and he really liked i 
Satisfied Great tote for the price Strong attractive and exactly as described Thanks 
Nice shirtdress This shirtdress design looks nice and trendy but I had to adjust the waist line cause it is a little loose in that area Great to be worn with leggins because it is a bit transparent Because of these 2 reasons I didnt give it 5 stars 
ooh those legs I bought these for my adult daughter for Christmas She asked for funky knee highs as she wears boots and also rides a bike for excercise and needs high socks She loved them 
babies for the digital age Food is input poopies are output and what stinky output Sometimes the input device is even an output device and when it s time to take a temperature sometimes the output device is an input device So confusing Your geek friends with new babies will really chortle when you present them with this cute tee for their little digital babe 
A Great Sexy yet Comfy Summer Sandal The shoes just arrived They have one adjustable strap and the sole bed is comfy and supports the arch of my foot Great Shoes girls Get a pair in more than one color you will be wearing them all the time Put some leather water repellant on the shoes before you wear them Clark s Shoes Rock 
Great Skirt This is a lightweight skirt that fits great The red color is so vibrant and I like the contrast of the white piping on the side Great addition to any tennis player s wardrobe 
Incredible Bargain If you re anything like me you re losing shades almost as quickly as you buy them I ve been hooked on wayfarers style since the Blue Brothers were the 80 s equivalent of the New Kids on the Block but the price can be prohibitive There are cheap knock offs out there at low prices but the quality shows in the cloudy eyepiece and dull plastic in the earpieces Not so OC Shade s Classic Wayfarer Sunglasses The quality is virtually indistinguishable from similar brand name styles at many times the price I was so pleased with my initial purchase that I ve laid in a small supply of these sunglasses stocking up on both smoke black and tortoise combinations Some people have complained that the glasses are smaller that similar big name brands not so I ve uploaded a picture of the OC shades compared with a similar big name brand that cost me over 100 I defy you to tell the difference well if you know where to look for the obscured logo you can figure it out But other than that there s no difference I advise you to buy as many pairs of these glasses as you have people in your household who wear and lose classically styled and great looking shades Preferably before OC Shades realizes that they re sitting on a gold mine and raises the prices 
Extremely high quality These are extremely high quality sunglasses regardless of price The fact that the price is so low makes them even better I also like the fact that they come in a small cloth bag to protect the glass lenses from scratches Considering how many times I ve paid more money for sunglasses that were worthless junk I m more than happy with these The lenses do produce a slight amount of blurring and some slight halos around bright lights But again less than the average pair of sunglasses The frames are of the rigid variety which means you can t twist them unmercifually the way you can some newer frames without breaking them But they are exceptionally strong and have a very solid feel to them I m going to order a few more pairs of these to put away so that when the first pair wears out I know I can replace it 
My absolute favorite bra I have bought at least eight of these bras since I first discovered it It is very flattering and comfortable Even though I have other bras this is the one I wear the most by far 
Great Bra for the money Great bra for the money and very durable I gave it 4 stars because the comfort straps need to be improved The straps tend to be sharp in certain areas making it uncomfortable and even a bit painful I do have very large breast so I know that makes it worst Overall I do recommend For smaller breast it may be perfect 
Playtex Bra with Comfort Straps Nice bra comfortable with good support I just ordered another one 
A Classic The Playtex 18 Hour Original Comfort Strap bra is a classic amongst bras especially for those of us who wear larger sizes This bra is both comfortable and uplifting It is nearly impossible to find bras in the size I require anywhere but online Ordering via Amazon was quick easy and my order arrived sooner than expected 
Best Bra ever This is the best bra I have ever bought Being a bigger size its very hard to find the perfect bra because none of them ever seem to fit right or give much support This bra fits perfectly and provides the support a full figured woman needs I really recommend you try one of these its well worth the money and its the only bra I will use from now on 
Good quality for the price This is probably one of the best bras I ve owned I like the wider straps They don t dig into my shoulders The material is smooth enough to wear under most clothes if you don t wear anything that s too tight My only complaint and I have this problem with most bras is that I don t think they can get by calling it an 18 hour bra Every bra I wear and I ve experimented with different sizes seems to eventually ride up in the back and sag in the front It s like I either have to wear more than one or change half way through the day For the price though it is good 
Great Quality I am pleased with the quality of the product I was worried that I would receive my order is bad condition but I was wrong I will be ordering again for the convinence and quality that I received 
lo mejor uno de los mejores pares de zapatos que he comprado en mi vida muy comodos a pesar de tener suela dura no pierden la forma y la linea es muy elegant 
Saw one had to have it I had seen other BuiltNY products in catalogs and actually owned a bottle carrier but had no idea they had these nifty little lunch bags until a new coworker showed up with one she uses as a purse I was hooked It s roomy but not too big for my lunchbag needs The material is flexible enough but not limp the bag stands up on it s own It also feels really neat It seems to be well made and simple enough that if necessary I could do some repairs I looked at other colors and was tempted but I simply HAD to have this fun stripe I like the other BuiltNY stuff I ve bought a couple of items but this is my favorite 
Great Comfort I ve tried many different jocks out there and always find the pouches to run really small and doesn t provide much breathing room for my package I usually end up feeling smashed and confined What I like about this jock is there is a little stretch to the pouch so once I put my package in the pouch I m able to pull on the material and create more room I would still prefer a little more room in the pouch but it is better than most What is great are the straps I like the way they wrap around your cheeks rather than strap across What I did not like was the rubber Jocko tag on the front side I think it kind of cheapens the look 
Garrick Slingback Sandals Good quality comfortable fit I have several pairs but needed this color and ordered from Amazon 
Very cute shoe I ordered the Garrick in Black and Dune It is a cute sandal and it runs true to size but is wide I usually wear 8 5M but I had to return these because they were too wide 
Naturalizer Shoes These shoes are pretty comfortable although they did leave a sore on my left foot but perhaps it was just to get used to them The price was definitely right Half of what I would have paid in the stores 
Great Price I looked all over the net and found that Amazon had the best price on this product I would use again 
So soft The nicest and softest among all baby bodysuits I own Very comfortable snap Looks beautiful on the baby 
Best buy for babies So easy to put on no hassles and the baby can grow with the outfit Wish I had a dozen 
Good Value For a price that is lower than what most stores charge for a tie this vest offers another option for colder days 
A customer s satisfaction Actually delivered earlier than estimated product was of great quality and savings were substantial 
Husband Loved These Very nice shoe Husband loves that they are very well made and can be worn inside or outside He threw out his other pair when he got these Worth the money 
Husband loves these slippers My husband got these slippers for Christmas this year and he loves them The leather body is very soft and the fuzzy interior feels nice and keeps his feet warm He likes that the soles are substantial enough to run the trash out to the curb or pick up the mail without slipping or having the chill seep through 
Oh Boy Are These Good Ones Felt I finally deserved a decent pair Have always worn those cheep 5 00 silppers and tried to save a buck Finally gave in and purchased a good pair They are super durable soft warm and so comfortable Undoubtedly takes off that evening chill without a problem Rubber soles so you can make that trip to the garage or mailbox that s if you can get out of your easy chair Somewhat high priced but mine say Hush Puppies on the sole I guess I paid for the name but as they say You Get What You Pay For Money well spent 
quick shipping I was very impressed with how quickly my order was filled I live three states away and my order came within 24 hrs Thank you 
wonderful service Was very pleased with the service I had a slight problem with the product and it was addressed and taken care of immediately Would certainly order from this company agai 
swim fins I need to exchange my fins I have received an XL 10 11 but i need an XXL 12 13 size How can I return this item for a bigger size I need either a PO Box number or address to send the swim fins back I need your assistance as soon as possible Thank you 
Easy and fun I like them because you don t have to take them off climbing aboard your boat I lost my long fins because I had to take them off first when I tossed them on board they fell in the sea I could not retrieve them fast enough With Speedo I find everything comfortable easy to handle and giving my legs a much better workout 
Comfy Very nice bra and well supportive for its size Very pretty and its pink 
Satin Black Corset I wore this for a 50th birthday party for a Pirate theme Everyone loved it and more so I loved how it looked and felt This is a great corset 
Pretty Good shoe upon receipt not for wider feet I bought these for my husband and althought they looked great he tends to have a wider foot the shoes didn t fit well the fit is more the long and narrow foot which personally I think is an adidas product trait I m a big fan of adidas Should have gotten a wide but I thought it was worth a shot Hopefully this helps someone I thought it worth mentioning 
Good quality nice fit I found that this product runs pretty true to size Im 6 about 200 pounds and I found that the XXL is a bit too large I got this since other reviews said that it runs a size small however I ve yet to wash to see how much shrinkage there will be T shirt definitely runs true to size its so big I use it as a sleep shirt 
Nice looking but be sure to buy two times larger size Purchased it as a Christmas gift for a teenage nephew He s typically a Large Bought him an XXL size just to allow for shrinkage and lotsa washings Thought it would be huge on him but in actuality it just fit perfectly So be careful and order two sizes up from what you think you need these are nice but cut much smaller than you d expect especially since all the teenagers I know seem to want sweatshirts and T shirts oversized to begin with 
Cute shorts but run small These shorts are pretty cute however they do run a little small I bought them twice because the first pair was much to tight on my son but I liked them so I wanted him to have them 
Good product recoment this product Because it have good quality and good price buy it 
Nice Item Love the item and the price but after buying it we were like can we actually take our son out in something like this withouthaving his grandparents or others wondered if we were out of out mind Maybe I ll give it as a gift lo 
Fun Soft Cute Good price We all got a laugh out of them lines 
I Am Satisfied with the Product I received the merchandise in a timely fashion I was quite satisfied with the product and would purchase from this seller agai 
Comfort These shoes were comfortable from the first moment I put them on There was never a break in period I normally wear a 6 5 shoe and these felt a little big when I first tried them on However when I tried on a size 6 shoe I knew that was too small I ended up buying the 6 5 I just wasn t used to having a shoe that fits AND allows me enough toe room to wiggle my toes Merrells are great for people who need a little more room in the toebox but who don t have feet wide enough to move to a wider shoe These shoes are not waterproof so you will need to treat them if you plan on hiking through wet weather I recommend the purchase of insoles after you have worn these shoes for a few months The insole they come with is rather thin and doesn t offer a whole lot of support Overall if given the choice I would happily buy these shoes again I would also say they run true to size for most people 
DA BEARS p II This is my Baby s first Jersey and what a jersey it is As I mentioned before the Super Bowl patch was not as big as I thought it would be on the jersey but I love it still

Romance in a bag It will definitely get her attention in the best possible way 
This shoe is a must have I love these shoes They are pretty and feminine while still being comfortable The style lends itself to dressing up or dressing down which is a plus for my lifestyle I get compliments on them everytime I wear them 
So prompt This was exactly what I ve been looking for and it was sent to me very quickly 
Great item Just right when you need it This is a really good product I have gotten 8 rather than 6 uses out of it The cups really stay put unlike other stick on bras I ve tried plus it enhaces your cleavage They do run a bit small so if you are a larger cup size move up one for the best coverage I will definitely purchase again Well worth the price 
Zen V Wall Charger Charging my Creative Zen V by computer with USB cable is very slow Needed a wall charger Got this one Cheap Works well Charges quickly End of story 
Tsubo Review Maybe because the sizing is over seas but these shoes were too small for me not comfortable I was very disappointed Returned not exchanged because I would try shoes on first 
nfl replica jersey It was great doing business with you great service and fast shipping 
Nice Fit I like the looser fit for outdoor activities and the collar line is just right 
Sparkly heels I bought these in silver and absolutely love them I am wearing them for a special occasion but wouldn t suggest them for a casual look as they are very sparkly gorgeous 
Cute Dress I bought this dress for my winter formal dance It was cute and I liked wearing it My only compaint would be that the size chart was pretty off and I bought a dress that was too big Other than that it was a well made and constructed dress Enjoy 
Very nice shirts These are very nice shirts for bigger and or taller guys They fit well and look very classy The necks are expandable with elastic built in which is a very nice feature These would get five stars but one of them started to fray in the front The others have worn well though and for the bigger or taller guy are highly recommended 
Very Nice I was very pleased with this outfit The pieces were well made and very attractive I will be buying more from this clothing line in the future 
Fantastic Deal This was the best deal on the internet for these underwear BUY SOME TODAY YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT 
Fuzzy inside sweatshirt This sweatshirt is sooo nice inside It IS a little stiff but it stays fuzzy forever because it is made out of the same kind of material as those fuzzy velour type blankets My boyfriend loves his It is also very warm I have heard 
Nice pants These are very high quality wool suite pants They have a have leg liner for comfort and the ruberized piping on the waist band helps keep ones shirt from coming untucked JAB offers a long and a short rise in the seat A short rise will give you a nice close fit to your bottom This may not be to your liking if you carry your wallet back ther 
Very Good Outdoor Shoe I love it Its light and felt like you re wearing a tennis shoe Very Comfortable This is the best shoe I ever puchased online 
Good socks at a reasonable price Look and feel great Fit my size 11 feet very well While many dress socks are too tight and uncomfortable these seem to take the shape of your foot and cradle it Never thought I d have much to say about socks pro or con Wish I d known about these before I retired 
The new IN style for tanks Overall I rate the 2 x ist Men s Cotton Sergeant s Tank five 5 stars They fit well and are very comfortable to be in I recommend buying it 
Well constructed stylish tank top Versatile tank top and equally stylish for the gym or dress up Well constructed with quality fabric The reinforced shoulders give the square cut g unit look tank look without looking too similar I m eager to try out the other colors and materials that this tank comes in 
very cute These boxers are very cute I was very satisfied with the product and the service 
nice jeans comfortable I went down to a size 8 in these nice but they have polyester in them Ruins the way they fit as you break them in I prefer LEVI 515 s BOOT CUT 525 LEVI BOOT CUT MY FAV S CALVIN S LOW BOOT CUT THE BEST THEY ARE WORTH THE PRICE All cotton not polyester and some spandex THESE can bag in the butt or you need a belt with them This happens because of the polyeste 
A great fit on my curvy figure I purchased these jeans recently and they ve quickly become my new favorites I find it hard to find jeans that fit me right because I have a small well defined waist but more generous hips buttocks and thighs most jeans that fit my lower half have a large gap at the back of the waist When I tried these jeans on in my usual size 8 they were a bit too tight but when I went up to a size 10 they fit quite well There is a slight gap at the back of the waist when I wear this jeans but because the fabric has a hint of spandex they fit my body well enough to wear without a bit The spandex also makes these jeans extremely comfortable they hug my body nicely without feeling the least bit tight I also love the low rise which falls an inch or two below my belly button just where I like it and the boot cut which gives my short legs a wonderfully long lean look I m just shy of 5 5 and the 32 inseam is a bit long on me but I prefer my jeans on the longer side these days so the length seems just right Overall these are a great pair of jeans at a great price highly recommended particularly for pear shaped gals like myself 
Good but a bit flimsy Delivery was prompt fit is good and I like the shelf bra The fabric is quite thin and has already started to lose its elasticity but for the price I feel it was a good purchase 
Squeak Squeak I bought a pair for each of my twin girls The younger one likes them and loves to squeak who isn t walking yet My old twin took them off We will have to see what happens The girls are 14 months 
Wanna smile My 2 year old niece LOVES these shoes She is at that very independant stage and throws a fit every time we try to put her in a shopping cart These are perfect When she walks in a store we always know where she is The best part is that walking in to places everyone looks around to see where the sound is coming from People can t help but smile when they see her squeaking along Beyond being fun these shoes are terrific They have a nice wide toe box and they are easy to put on They are very sturdy and a great value considering many discount stores sell shoes that are higher priced for less quality and that is if you can find the shoes These are absolutely the best combination of good value for the money 
squeak These are so cute Soft roomy and comfortable with a flexable sole Just be sure you re OK with incessant squeaking It s like living with Spongebob It s really cute to see them trying to walk loud or tip toe without making any noise As an added bonus these shoes are great for knowing where your kids are at all times 
Wig and Scarf A great piece for the costume I added some braids beads and dreadlocks to make more identical but the base is good Scarf color is lighter and more shiny than in the pics but was dulled easily with light spray and magic marker graphics I couldn t have been Capt Jack without it 
When your baby has to look their coolest and be UV protected We got these glasses for our two month old and they are certainly cool looking on our little cutie They are a little large for her but still fit with the velcro on the adjustable band just barely connecting on her little head 100 UV protection por los ojos es muy bueno 
Love these We started using these with our twins when they were about three months old and now they re 8 months old and don t mind wearing them at all They stay on great and we get tons of compliments on them too So cute 
They stay on We bought these sunglasses for our 14 month old before a beach vacation They stayed on unlike the last sunglasses we tried for him Thank goodness A quality product and they worked like a charm 
Best sunglasses for babies I did a lot of research on what to buy for my son now 11 months and baby banz are the best you can buy They stay put and with only a little coaching he leaves them on all the time now Wherever we go people stop my and ask where I got these sunglasses that actually stay on They are especially great in the pool Very stylish too Great investment you won t be disappointed 
The best value for the money After trying several brands I purchased a pair of Noisebuster s more than 3 years ago and I have to say that they are still the best value headphone when you want to disconnect from the outer world in noisy places I usually wear them at the office while working which allows me to listen to music at the same time at a good quality I mean connected to a computer music system you get very decent sound I also own a pair of Bose QuietComfort which I bought on a later date which work prety well too The Bose are superior if you want to listen to music in a better quality system I own a Harman Kardon equipment and Bose speakers but all in all I consider the noisebusters of better value for what I paid and very very close to the Bose on reducing the external noise In net I am definitively purchasing a new Noisebuster pair to replace my first set which is already showing signs of aging and would recommend the NB to anybody

I Love These Boots I purchased these boots in the middle of January thinking I could use them this winter because I live in Colorado and often visit the mountains When I received them I was disappointed because they were too small but I thought I would try them anyways After about two days they started to stretch out and now I am in love with them

Flannel Lounge Pants Good quality and very comfortable however ran a little larger than expected 
Fluffy and Super Soft Okay I m a woman with a sock fetish Fuzzy socks must be fuzzy soft socks must be soft and colorful socks must be colorful And I expect them to remain that way through many washes Those aren t big requirements but I ve had a hard time having them met That said I LOVE MY SOCKS I received several pair as a gift and have washed them several times inside out and in cold water Still fuzzy Still soft Still colorful I have happy feet and would recommend this product and this store if you re a woman with a sock fetish or love a woman with a sock fetish You ll have happy feet too 
great socks The socks were a gift for a friend They really enjoy the comfort and cozy feeling of the plush socks They are a great buy 
Great for Wearing with Crocs or for sleeping in These are a few dollars more than the socks I can get locally that say they are the same fabric When I got these ones I was shocked This fabric is 100x nicer that the ones I have This is just a wonderful sock I like fleece ones but they have heavy seams These ones do not have that I love these socks You will not be disapointed this is sheer luxury I got some other colors also but will be ordering more black ones I am sick and these things are a great comfort for my daily wear Match them to the color of the croc so the cros are more subtle and the color that shows throught the holes is the same color of the crocs These socks are loose but not too loose Just perfect 
comfortable I bought these shoes a while back and I wear them for everyday work on occasion or just whenever I m out shopping They re easy to get on and off no hassle just a straight up shoe made for anyone I m glad I bought them and plan to take them to college this year 
Great robe great service I ordered this robe for my son on Monday the day he was to be released from the hospital following surgery To my surprise it was delivered the next day beautifully packaged and accompanied by a hand written thank you note The quality and workmanship of the robe are outstanding and having the terrycloth on the inside works well under the circumstances as does the lighter weight It is a substantial robe but not as heavy as velour for instance I laundered the robe before giving it to my son and it came out of the dryer looking as perfect as when it went in not a thread out of place and no distortion I m very pleased with the product the value and the service and look forward to becoming a return customer Oh yes my son loves the robe too 
it s very comfortable i wore it without socks and it s very comfortable i would like to buy another one 
Nice shoe The one thing I can say is that the shoe squeeks each step I take That gets a bit annoying My sister bought these shoes in a department store for probably near double what I did and her s do not squeek I don t know if it s possible to get lesser quality with the price you may on Amazon but I wonder Once I get past the squeek I love them They came quite fast as well five stars on that department 
great for fuller figure great bra runs big in the cups I am small in the back but this the cups not for me anyway Had to return mine even though I did try it on in a hurry purchased the bra and had to return both I am a 36 DD very nice cups run big I am a 36 DD in all bras this one not to good Fav bras Bali new comfort bra awesome Bali t back bra Gap full coverage lace and my very fav Champion everday bra wonderful perfect fitting in each style So beware 
great bra for full figures I wear a large cup size with a small band size which can make good fitting supportive bras very difficult to find but this bra does it all It gives me smooth attractive shape and great support If you are a large cup size and need good support this is the bra for you When ordering you should know that some sizes are slightly off I am a 38GG but waer a 38G in this bra 
Great Solid Pants for all occasions Solid materials and great quality It s very hard to get winkles on these and comes with folds like on slacks If you re going for the slighty sharp preppy look these are for you 
Not as advertised I was very excited by all of the write ups of this product I ordered one thinking that if it was as advertised I would order many more I regret ordering the one I did After the first hand wash the underwires popped right through the area that holds them in The support is minimal as well I was very disappointed with the quality all together and if I could have returned it I would have 
Value tux I got tired of renting tuxedos but at the same time I knew I wouldn t be wearing one much more than once a year This is perfect for that type of person This won t rate the quality of a 500 set up but then you have to ask yourself if a once in a while wear is worth spending the bucks In the long run this is a better deal than renting Notice they mis spelled luxury in the title and that should give you some idea of the minor but not noticeable corners that were cut 
Good Customer Service When I ordered the product it was mistakenly advertised as 100 Wool A gentleman from the vendor contacted me immediately to inform me that it is not 100 Wool He offered and provided a refund While I did not eventually purchase the product I do appreciate the excellent customer service I would consider buying from them in the future Also it appears that they have since corrected the advertisement

Great Shoes My daughter loves these shoes They are well made and a great price I compared these to the only local shoe store Payless that carries tap shoes And these are much nicer and cheaper My daughter said these were more comfortable There sizing was right on When my daughter outgrows this pair I d definitely buy these same shoes Happy Dancing Happy feet 
Great shoes My daughter loves these and if your child is like mine she will want to wear them everywhere This is not a problem with the low cost of these shoes and well made to boot 
Good interim weight loss bra I m in the middle of a drastic weight loss and didn t want to invest in bras that would not fit a short time later Someone suggested these bras and I love them They are comfortable and easy to wash and will be with me for while until I m ready to buy real lingerie 
One of the better Men s colognes I bought this cologne for my boyfriend now fiance I first tested it out using a tester at the cologne counter at a high end department store I had never used any Burberry products before yet I was not disappointed This product is perfect for any man that wants to smell like a man this product does not disappoint at all in that it does NOT smell at all like a woman s perfume It is ALL man It is also not overpowering I don t know about the ladies out there but I hate it when my man wears overpowering cologne that takes my breath away This product gives just the right amount of manly exuberance to make you pull your man closer Definitely recommended 
combat ballets I purchased they about 3 months ago along with the Madden Bee s Ballet flat They are holding up much better than the Madden flats These are pretty comfy and I have replaced my old pumas with them My only complaint is that there is very little arch support but I remedied that by buying a pair of Dr Scholl s arches 
Excellent I am very pleased with my ordering experience It came very quickly and was exactly how it was pictured 
It s So Cute I love this iPod case It looks really good with my green mini I also like that you can use the belt clip with the case on The cut outs are pretty much where they need to be though sometimes they are a little off I also like how tight it fits 
A great iPod mini case Although it took a while to get this case a couple of weeks and no free shipping of course since it didn t come directly from Amazon I have to say I don t mind it s a great little case I do wish it had the option for a belt hook but otherwise it protects my green mini and looks very stylish There s an opening for the clickwheel and the screen is protected by a plastic layer The top of the case has a space for the headphone jack as well Unlike other reviewers who are basing their review on fulfillment of their order and not the product itself I can tell you that this is a great little case it s just as cute as it looks and does exactly what it s supposed to do I would give it 5 stars if if were less expensive but it seems like all the iPod accessories are more expensive than they should be 
a girl I am happy with this choice it matches my green mini so well i do have to say that the cut out for the wheel is a little off but everything works just fine i like the cute cut out for the headphones it also closes with magnets at the bottom which is nice you can access it very easily 
Hottest shoe everrrrr Went to a fashion show and after party in Ft Lauderdale Miami and got raves I almost never wear heels only when I must at parties and such They were as comfortable as heels can get and of course very stylish If you can t afford this seasons IT Christian Louboutin s like me P this is a wonderful alternative 
Nice robe wrong color should have ordered black Very warm I m too messy for a light tan robe The robe came through the wash perfectly no stains or shrinking 
WOW I m Pampered by myself Bought this for myself after returning a microfiber one at Macy s that was given as a gift Most of us like plush and soft After a tough day its nice to shower and wrap yourself in warmth comfort and security The atmosphere of innocence and contentment the time before we were aware of the complexities of life This robe can lead you on your journey to that state Buy it Don t hesitate Its GREAT Its long enough big enough sleeve length is good color is good and price is perfect And trust me you won t find anything softer 
An out of shower experience I received this bathrobe for my birthday last year I had placed it on my wishlist Warm and absorbent the robe s soft cotton cuddles a wet showered body Its touch is sensuous So why only four stars I washed it The softness remains but its out of the box appearance is diminished through minor pilling Heavier more absorbent robes can be bought for not much more money but those are not this soft 
Soft luxurious thick and did I mention Soft So soft and comfortable I feel like I ve gone to one of those exclusive spas every time I wear it Well worth the money Get one 
Really nice Had this for about 6 months Soft luxurious Only problem is that with it s large amount of fluffy cotton it likes to shed a bit And will shrink in the dryer if dried on high heat Far and away the softest robe you will ever buy Puts every other robe to shame 
Wonderful Soft Cotton Bathrobes Color We ordered 2 bathrobes one Espresso and one Chino colored The Espresso is a very dark brown and the Chino is a beautiful natural cream color Of the two colors we both prefer the Chino color The dark brown is slightly more of a cooler toned brown than a warm brown tone Quality The robes are very soft medium thickness and fluffy The stiching is well done Nice tag inside stating made in Turkey Packaging Arrived in a plastic zipped bagged nicely folded Size We are both a normal weight range 5 6 These are a one size fits all robe so as always they are bit large but we both like them that way The sleeves reach to my knuckles but the stitching is such that the robes look finished even with the cuffs folded back Content These are looped 100 cotton just what we wanted We were searching for 100 cotton bathrobes that we could use in winter to get to from our hot tub Polyester bathrobes don t absorb water and you end up wrapped but cold Company We ordered these near the holidays and the company included a hand written holiday card signed by a few of the staff thanking us for ordering And the robes arrived within 4 days No arguing with service like that 
Cute but not as well made as the apparel My daughter got this set for Easter last year and just adores it esp the umbrella which she uses any possible time she can I wouldn t say it s cheaply made but it s just not as well made as the raincoat The little button on top to finish popped off within a month and can t really be glued back on It doesn t affect the umbrella s use but it s just one of those annoying things 
Kidorable Umbrella Although the umbrella was very cute the second time it was opened the seam ripped I stitched it up as best I could for my granddaughter rather than return it and pay shipping charges 
Good product Works great for postpartum I have rated this product 4 stars because it won t fit if you are plus size No use buying it unless you are NOT in the plus size category 
Post Delivery Girdle Belt Maternity Belt Post Natal My wife is using Post Delivery Girdle Belt Maternity Belt Post Natal and she likes it 
Can t wait to try this I purchased this for my post partum recovery I m still pregnant I think it will help but it looks a little cheap This one is very wide so it should help tighten up all the skin around the abdomen and sides Target sells a Medella brand maternity belt that looks like it will hold up for a longer period of wear than this one But the Medella one is only about 6 inches wide so it looks like it doesn t tighten everything that has stretched I still can t wait to use this belt after I delivery to see if it helps with my recovery 
these shoes These shoes have a really good feel The bottoms are perfectly made and they last pretty long If you are looking for an old school feel with new school comfort then buy these They are not like the huge puffy shoes that you see and they are not like wearing converse they are right in the middle I would highly recomend these shoes to anyone who skates 
Couldn t have breastfed without it This cream was a lifesaver for me A friend of mine recommended it while I was still pregnant so I bought some before my son was born and took it with me to the hospital This cream was what got me through the first 2 weeks the most crucial time of breastfeeding My nipples were so sore but this cream really helped and I didn t have to worry about washing it off before my son nursed The more I used it the better I felt it is a MUST for new moms who are planning on nursing 
Brooks Men s Beast Running Shoe Silver Trnish Wht Rd 11 5 M For the last several years I have been purchasing the New Balance 2000 and 2001 running shoe I do not do really any running at all but the comfort of those shoes really help with my ankle problems I decided to try the Brooks Beast to get away from the high price of the New Balance 2001 I have defiantly got my money s worth in the comfort of the brooks shoe 
Best Running shoe Ever I went through every brand of running shoes I am tall and have a large frame and I tend to go through running shoes rather quickly When I discovered Brooks about 4 years ago it was Heaven sent Yes these shoes are expensive compared to others but you get your moneys worth and hey spend money are your feet We abuse them everyday They suppport my whole foot and I have not lost any toenails as with others I now run for fitness and not races These shoes last me about 6 months So if you are in searching mode I HIGHLY recommend these shoes 
Best shoes ever I m not one for hyperbole so when I say best shoes ever I really mean it Definitely the best shoe purchase I ever made These are by far the most expensive shoes of any kind I have ever bought and they were totally worth every penny In fact I bought a second pair of this same model because the first one was so good Normally I d get five pairs of running shoes for the price of these two I d love to get these at a deep discount but just haven t found them anywhere They take a lot of wear and tear I have run and walked well over 1 000 miles in these shoes and they are still practically like new just a little worn in the center of the front sole Which is doubly amazing considering that I weigh over 250 pounds Usually I blow out a pair of shoes after just 300 or 400 miles Aside from being slightly warm they are amazingly comfortable I can wear them all day at work or for a fifteen mile walk and not have any discomfort The fit has been perfect and usually that s a problem area for me These are snug without binding and have all the right support in the right places No appreciable wear has occurred on the interior lining of the shoe Brooks has been a very good brand for me and these are far and away the best of their line that I have tried Compared the best stuff from New Balance Asics Saucony Mizuno and other good brands that I have used The Beast is on a completely different level 
Great for problem feet I have had problems with my feet because of over pronation and these shoes have been a great help 
Best Support of Any Shoe At Any Price You may not have heard of them but Brooks makes some of the best most popular running and walking shoes that you can buy I was instroduced to the brand a few years ago while working in an Amazon warehouse where I walked 10 20 miles per day picking customer orders I haven t purchased another brand of walking running shoe since then The Brooks Beast Running shoe provides the best support of any shoe on the market I have flat feet with no arch support which makes it more difficult to walk on hard surfaces for long periods of time This shoe makes the task so much easier Honestly it s the best most comfortable shoe that I ve ever owned AND it has a fresh hip design that those of us in the MTV generation can wear with pride 
Consistenly Good Performance I have worn Asics GEl DS Trainers for many years and they have consistently been a good choice for me giving me the stability I need in a running sneaker without the added weight 
great shoes well first of all thank you for sending them to me i m in Iraq and i do lots of running these shoes feel so good on my feet i ve invited all of the soldier in my unit to log on and try these shoes again thank you in a year i know i will buy at least 3 more pair MS ESTELLA ABDULLAH USA ARMY 
rare and ready to go The pele puma is a good product because its not something evry1 has and they dont sell them in any stores ive been t 
Yuck Thin cheap fabric barely represents flannel Additionally the waist has a button on the hip Who puts a button for a pair of PJ pants on the hip I returned them immediatly Not worth the price at al 
Soft and warm I love my new flannel pajamas they fit very well and are very soft and comfortable 
flannel pajamas I received them as promised for Xmas The old lady loved them Thank 
Totally satisfied The PJs by Carole were an excellent choice I had checked around for PJs that were light weight flannel and attractive at the same time The two sets of PJs from Carole fit the bill entirely I ve been using them every night since they arrived And they can be thrown in the washer and dryer and still look and feel great They are the most comfortable PJs I have ever owned 
Great Fit These pants make your legs look skinner Yippie The tall was a little too long for my 5 7 1 2 frame 
Wonderful surprise I love this dress It is so pretty and light weight perfect for summer The seam edges were turned under then sewn Such a small detail but so important This was so much more than I expected and the price you just can t beat it 
red sox mock turtle shirt came almost immediatley was very happy it fit and is very comfortable very satisfied customer and will order more real soon 
cute baby hat sweatshop free labor This is a very cute comfy little infant hat Unlike many others though this brand according to claims is made using U S regulated labor made in the USA and supposedly sweatshop free A hat is a hat but this one comes with some good karma too 
I love these and the gown too These and the gown are my favorite items to wear during the day and at night It makes nursing so much easier It was perfect for my hospital bag 
Love em Great nursing PJ s the fabric was so soft and great quality I love the 
Stride Rite Little Kids Angler Sandal This sandal is quite comfortable and easy to put on for little ones My six year old seems very content when he can just run and slip them on 
Poor She was not as long as one is in the figure I had to cut it to make a bracelet because she was very short for my neck the metal is bad nor of silver is I give one star them by its good service No era tan larga como se muestra en la figura tuve que cortarla para hacer un brazalete porque era muy corta para mi cuello el metal es malo ni de plata es Les doy una estrella por su buen servici 
The best I ve tried Johnston Murphy Rockport and Cole Hahn in trying to find the perfect shoe I have chronic back trouble so I m finicky about my shoes The JMs and the CHs started falling apart within 3 or 4 months I ve had a pair of these for a year and a half and they re like new I ve already bought a second pair I ll never wear any other brand 
cute comfy flat this little ballet flat is great it doesn t offer all the support in the world but it is very comfortable adorable and will go with anything i don t think i ll need the help of bandaids with these i d get them in more colors if they were available totally recommend them 
very pleased this was the first time purchasing something for myself at Amazon I was VERY pleased with my shoes and the price was great I will definatley shop again 
Anne Klein Women s Tave Ktten Heel thong Very cute shoe very comfortable true to size Looks great for casual occassions or with a jean skirt 
AK Anne Klein Tave Kitten Very comfortable shoe True to size Order was received very quickly and I was very satisfied Wish they would have had my size in black as well 
horrible do NOT purchase unless you want a headache and nipple show thru this dress and company are HORRIBLE the material is ridiculously cheap and see through i returned the dress and the company said they would refund my money immediately i sent the dress back and a month went by before i called HotFash they told me they refunded my money and they NEVER had i was on the phone for over an hour with amazon and with hotfash to get my refund it was a nightmare 
this dress is hot The material is stretchy so it s flattering even on less than perfect figures The only thing ladies you may have trouble finding under garments that don t show up through the material because it gets thinner the more it stretches 
boxing shoesThese were excellent boxing shoes I bought them for remedial purposes These are excellent boxing shoes I bought them for remedial purposes Turns out like all boxing shoes they have no heels And the heels were what I needed as well as the high tops So I had to return them which was done with no problem Thank yo 
my husband likes them My husband likes his slippers although they did turn his socks orange at first I think that got better the more he wore them 
amazingly warm for cold weather running I just bought these tights so I could start running in very cold temperatures 10 20 degrees sometimes subzero These pants do an amazing job of keeping me warm on my run They are somewhat thick to keep you warm but they do not weigh you down or restrict movement They are designed to wick away moisture but my legs do not sweat much so I cannot comment on that feature They are also very tight and I believe they are meant to be layered underneath a pair of warm up pants At least that s what I do I am 5 3 and the legs are a little long they are probably ideal for someone between 5 5 to 5 8 
Stride Rite hiker shoes Nice shoes My son age 3 has flat feet and since he has started wearing these shoes at the advice of my pediatrician he has stopped complaining of his feet hurting 
Good solid shoes It is a good quality shoes For our toddler wide size would ve been better 
Durable and good fit My son wears shoes out fairly quickly and these are holding up well to all an almost 3 year old can dish out The velcro also makes it possible for him to dress himself which he likes and provides a good fit 
Best shoes for tots with EXTRA WIDE feet My son was born with fat feet girth and width I have only found one shoe brand that he seems to be comfortable in and that s Stride Rite They have wide and double wide widths They are well worth the money you pay to have your tot s wide feet comfy and not squished These shoes have also withstood toddler torture of rain mud and general wear and are still well put together Even from being washed 
Kid s Legwarmers Finally we found a source to get legwarmers for our six year old They come in various lengths and colors too Had to have Navy blue for school uniform compliance Thanks to Amazon our little girl s legs won t freeze this winter 
leg warmers great legwarmers they re perfect and they arrived before i expected them to 
answer of the purchase I want to thank for the products that I buy in its page are products of quality and to good prices and I hope to be able to continue buying in its stores and that every day the relation is better and than products a little can arrive but fast I am not safe if the products already arrived at the new direction where it requests that me they sent them since the old direction was changed because the company was changed and changed of name anyway I thank for its preoccupation and I to him them agradeceria its information encuanto ah if the merchandise I arrive at the new destiny thanks 
It s almost perfect This is a very comfortable sleeping bra to wear at night The only problem with this bra is that you need 2 hands and the lights on to snap it back up after nursing Forget about fumbling around in the dark while holding the baby It won t work I do love the snug fit and the soft cotton though and it was the perfect bra to wear before the baby came 
everyone should have one extremely comfortable but difficult to open and close with just one hand this is the only reason it didn t get 5 stars it is the best thing for the early weeks when you are sore and uncomfortable excellent to sleep in i am recommending this one to all my friends 
Love it I ve hated every nursing bra on the market and I think I ve tried them all I m not huge or hard to fit mind you just average But every bra was so dang uncomfortable or the peek a boo part was too unwieldy for one hand A friend from London gave me this Emma Jane bra and I went bonkers trying to find it stateside Thank goodness for Amazon 
Awesome socks I had been searching for socks I could wear with my jeans and replace the old athletic socks I was always wearing These are the most comfortable socks I ve ever owned It s like wearing slippers I think these socks are spoiling me to the point where all socks will now be compared against these I m afraid I m becoming a sock connoisseur 
Wigwam Merino Comfort Hiker Socks The socks are well constructed very comfortable warm keeps your feet cozy dry they work for me 
I m with Johnny I also have several pairs Yellow are my favorite SUPeR I also use them for quot bird quot watching My whole soccer team also has several pairs GO Johnny go 
These are not just pants but a new ticket to a better life I love these pants they re about all I wear to go birdwatching now I have two orange pairs and one yellow one Anyway the pants are wicked bad especially with the new flip flops I got at the drugstore yesterday I don t wear shirts except at restaurants and places of businesses that require them so usually I m pants and flops and that s all baby It s a great ensamble and I would highly recommend getting at least seventeen pairs for your whole soccer team Oh that and a penguin clock everyone s gotta have one of those But I m really into birds so maybe it s just me 
Very Cozy I bought these for my son when he outgrew his size 2T and he loves them They keep him warm at night which helps with my piece of mind Would recommend 
I got what I expected I was looking for warm fuzzy pj s for my son and that is exactly what I got and it came in a timely manner I do believe that you can buy these exact same pj s at target without the shipping cost though 
Perfect I got exactly what I ordered in good condition and pretty fast considering it was December Thanks for a great way to shop 
Great sports bra These Climalite sports bras are great They come in an array of colors with availability of the basic and tried and true white and black colors It fits well and wicks moisture off as effectively as any other product on the market I have not had any chafing or other issues with these bras One word of caution they do run a tad small so if you are on the edge between one size and another I d suggest getting the bigger size 
I like this shoes I really recommed these shoes they are very smooth and comfortable if you buy a pair you ll really appreciate it 
Husband went nuts I bought several pairs of these My hsband I were going out to dinner but as I donned my pantyhose heels and walked out to ask his opinion well we never made it out Who woulda thought thanks I have ordered many more pairs the first pair well ruined but gladly lo 
Lovely sheer to waist pantyhose I am selective about the pantyhose I wear and I have been disappointed for various reasons in some of the pantyhose I have bought over the years Hue styles in Lacy Sheer to Waist pantyhose Age Defiance control pantyhose and Clear Control pantyhose all deserve 5 star ratings from me These pantyhose are also relatively inexpensive I bought this style pantyhose in tan and I like very much how it looks on my legs and thighs when wearing a dress or skirt While in recent years I often need for the sake of an appearance to wear control top pantyhose this style is among the most comfortable and nice looking sheer to waist pantyhose I have worn I highly recommend Lacy Sheer to Waist pantyhose to all persons who sometimes or often want to wear sheer to waist pantyhose to go with their mini dresses and mini skirts 
Love Them I am on my third pair of santiossages I am a woman who wears them even though they are mens and I love them I live in them from about april through late september in New England They are the most comfortable shoes and last a long time 
Makes All Other Summer Shoes Obsolete The Adidas Santiossage Slides were the most comfortable pair of sandals I ve ever owned The bottoms massage your feet and the straps are easily adjusted They re perfect for the beach or any other casual occasion They can even be comfortable enough to walk long distances when broken in properly They can easily make any other pair of summer shoes obsolete 
Earbud Cord Management I would say out of the few colours the white colour is the best as the rubber molding for the white one seem to be different than all the colour ones I can tell the white colour is better produced Not sure is it due to different batch of stock 
Very pleased I am very pleased with the Warner bras I have worn Warner bras for many years and was distressed not to find them in the Department stores where I shop But I did find them on line which was terrific 
Embroidered 2 Tone Sexy Bikini Panty Complete set is reasonably priced cute sexy and this company really cares about its customers 
Surprisingly comfortable These boots look so hot on I m not one to wear heels much and was worried that I wouldn t be able to walk in them but found no problems at all My honey was drooling 
My comments on the above product My son is 1 year old I ve bought a 24 month robe which is already his size he will not be able to wear it for more than 2 weeks too bad 
Great product I bought this for my husband who is going through Chemo to cover his head when his hair comes ou 
Absolutely fantastic top This is one of my favorites It is light weight can be dressy or casual and it fits so nicely I got the light pink top first then bought the black top later 
Absolutely wonderful So light weight and comfortable This top is so comfortable and fits very nicely It is light weight and can be used for a casual or more dressy occasion I highly recommend it I got the light pink top then ordered the black one later 
Lovely nightgown I love this gown It feels like silk against my skin and is very well made I ve washed it in the machine in the regular cycle it comes out looking as nice as new no kidding The fabric is a high quality and doesn t snag or pick The lace trim also is high quality I will order more Hope there s a robe to go with it 
STYLE AND QUALITY Sunglasses were of great quality and looked like Nicole s A High Quality version of this style is not east to find These sunglasses made my Sister s Birthday 
perfect these sunglasses were way better than i had expected them to be i love them they re just like nicole s = 
Just like my old boots I m an Old Corp Marine and need a pair of jungle boots to replace my old ones The new boots they have in the military didn t suit me and was happy to see these boots at a really good rate I couldn t find one my size and order them through Amazon They arrived by UPS and after breaking them in they work just fine 
my favorite shoes These are kind of dressy but funky really need the right outfit to pull them off but they make your legs look tall and they re quite pretty sexy 
Comfort and LOOKS These boots are the greatest find ever I always buy Harley Davidson products and will continue to do so because of the quality and fit BUT I wanted a less expesive boot to wear once and a while just for a change basically I wanted a different color and texture I couldn t find in Harleys products I was tremendously surprised at what showed up The boots are beautiful well built and comfortable just like Harley products at 1 3 the price The only difference is that there is no Harley label or insignia I will buy these boots again if they ever wear out My harley boots lasted 6 years I would be happy if I got 2 years out of them because I am very hard on my shoes At the price of these boots you can buy 3 pair for the price of Harley boots and have a new pair on your feet whenever you choose for those special occasions 
Love the Boots I bought the boots for my husban He loves them and so do I Thanks Karron D 
Adidas Missy Elliott Remix Boots Black 9 5 The price I payed is higher than the price on the receit I received 
Racerback The racerback took a little getting used to but once I did I fell in love with it With my other bras no matter how much I readjusted realigned reglued lol the darned straps were always falling down I don t have that problem w this bra I m going to throw out my other bras order a couple dozen of these 
Nice set but sized a bit small I purchased this set for my husband It is very nice looking and we are happy with it On the downside the arms on the sweatshirt are on the short side he is 6 1 has to push the sleeves up to look OK and the neck is a bit tight with the hood pulling it back I figure to stretch the neck after it is washed And I agree with another reviewer that it is sized a bit small I ordered an XL which is usually quite roomy on my husband but this has no extra room I will never be able to put it in the dryer If I were ordering again I would order the XXL I hope this will be helpful 
neat I ve never owned silk underwear before but I liked the look of these I wanted something red sexy and brief that s what I got great fit feel great Would really like to get in touch with Ryan Eckenrode 
daring and comfy The fabric and fit of this underwear is comfortable and generally stays put The back is slightly modest but still flattering The front pouch is also well designed Some may find this brief to be more low cut than desired Generally this an essential for anyone who likes variety and silk 
modest and sexy For anyone who likes variety this is an essential brief I like the moderate back to this brief it stays put and is quite comfortable The front pouch is well cut and allows for plenty of movement Also consider the silk extreme thong a more daring alternative 
Internet wigs are a no no I already knew it would be a pretty bad idea to buy a wig online but i didn t expect they would pack it up as badly as they did It was totally mangled and mashed when I got it They get four stars though because the wig itself is amazingly good once you restyle it yourself Though I m still having trouble with the spikes at the back of the hair 
Very good glasses I bought these sunglasses for my husband for Christmas They fit him well and look good I wish they came with a sturdier carrying case rather than the cloth bag 
Perfect No Show Socks Hey These are pretty cool They are very thin but they make great socks that don t show when you are wearing sneakers Some people have even asked me if I am wearing socks However I would not recommend these for running because they don t offer much cushion 
Almost Perfect The purse is great I love the color and size It s not the best quality though The inside pocket zipper broke within the first week of owning it and the front seams had threads falling out for about a month If those tiny details never happened this would be a perfect purse 
good addition to my shoe fetish i love shoes i love doc martens great quality great long lasting shoe 
SO COMFY I love this bra It is so comfortable and I never find myself having to adjust it like other bras It stays in place and after a while I forget I have it on I will say that it is not really very flattering but hey its a sleep bra I wear it around the house and it is just great 
Nice and comfy for sleeping This bra is a great bra for night time wear with easy pull aside access 
comfy for day and night I love this bra It is a sport bra style but doesn t give enough support to really use as a sport bra The thing that I like about it though is that it is super comfy it separates and does not have underwire or any tricky clasps to deal with a bonus for when you ve got your hands full with a baby Great to wear during the day or at night Highly recomend 
Outstanding slippers Most comfortable slippers in the world which is why we purchased this second pair for the privacy of the office Also great service and delivery of the product 
Great item I love this gauchos I got mine yesterday It fits perfect I can t wait to wear this in summer I plan to buy another sometimes soon 
Excellent Perfect O I am quite happy with the purchase it fits well and what can I say I am very happy with the purchase Although I am not sure if there were other colors beside black but the long of the short if you are lookng for Gauchos this is great I would get another one for sure if I had the O 
Very comfortable material I m very particular about the feel of a material especially my sleepwear and this product if perfect Its very comfortable and the material is breathable which is what I like I do however think that the length could ve been a little shorter but that s a choice thing I guess 
Very Nice Quality for Price This item is a very very nice quality especially for the price 
Great Carry On I just bought this item and am quite impressed with it I bought it because it conforms to most airline s carry on requirements It s 41 cubic inches I was worried when the box arrived because it was only 4 inches thick I thought they sent me the wrong pack because it was so thin I would find out however that this is part of the genius of the design The bottom of the suitcase is flexible with the wheels side acting as a pivot point Thus if you do not need to fully pack the case it will remain ultra thin If you pack more the bottom folds out to accommodate the material So if you are only going on a weekend trip you will have no problem putting this under the seat in front of you If you pack more it will easily fit in the overhead bin on the aircraft The zippers are thick there are lots of pockets for toiletries so it s easy to pull them out at security in their little plastic baggie and documents and it seems to be coated with plastic to make it waterproof The wheels are also well placed and are made of rubber which makes them quiet and sturdy but the handle extension bars could be a bit thicker however I m tall so I appreciate that the handle extends to a comfortable length which allows me to walk without having the thing bump up against my feet all the time So it s a well designed nifty little carry on that I m quite happy with 
IF IT S GOOD ENOUGHT FOR JERRY A WHILE BACK I HAD A FRIEND WHO WAS DOING WARDROBE ON A MOVIE WITH VINCENT GALLO AND JERRY LEWIS I ASKED MY FRIEND TO SEND ME ANY JERRY STUFF HE COULD GET HIS HANDS ON SEEMS JERRY LEWIS CHANGES AND THROWS OUT HIS SOCKS 4 5 TIMES A DAY SO I GOT A BAG OF SLIGHTLY WORN YET AFTERSHAVE SOAKED WIGWAM KING COTTON CREW SOCKS I VE BEEN BUYING THEM EVER SINCE WOULDN T YOU LOUISXX 
I didnt get what I should be getting OK Either it s me or it s this thing I bought I didnt get any fun and I am unhappy Now whom should I blame 
Happy feet I finally found the shoe I wanted it had the strappy straps great heel support not too high and just right crystal decoration I loved these shoes They were comfortable and I didnt even break them in I was very happy with this purchase The grass stains wipped off very easily I had it done the very next day using a warm damp cloth I love shoes and I ll wear beautiful ones even if they hurt but honestly I wore these all night and didnt want take them off Because they had the right the support I felt confident walking in them and the straps were just the right amount of sexy 
Nice I usually go through dress shoes like paper but so far these seem to bee holding up to 6 day 10 hr work weeks quite well Good quality good price 
Love These Things In the 70 s my best friend and I used to buy these sandals They were sold in the drug store then We loved them I lost track of them for several years but started wearing them again recently and love them all over again The heel is about an inch and a half I am not a small person and I have no problems walking in these and find them easy and quite comfortable I also think they are great looking with pants 
Great Fit These shorts are perfect for the woman who needs a little extra give in the waist but cannot go the next size up without sacrificing a good fit in the rear They wash and dry beautifully The hidden elastic in the waist does not bunch the fabric you cannot tell by looking at the shorts that there is elastic there at all But you can sure tell it by how comfortable you feel 
Love them Perfect No inch Love how soft it is I have a couple colors of the same Nightgown 
Sleep Shirt Evaluation Well she loved it and said it was very soft an comforting and would recommend it to others 
excellent buy for the money This was actually purchased for my youngest daughter who already has one child and she had complications due to her stomach muscles It would not tightened up in the lower region of her stomach which caused an excessive movement in that area This was recommened because she had tried many others that would not work She loves this 
Couldn t survive without it I m 6 months pregnant and if it weren t for the bella band I don t know what I d do I have a hard enough time finding regular jeans that fit let alone maternity jeans I m going to use this with my regular pants as long as I possibly can and recommend ANY pregnant girl to have one 
A must Cool Jacket for the Kop Nice and cool jacket with very comfortable fabric I really love this jacket because it reminds me the day of Champion 
Great Rain Boots These boots are really great and colorful When I wore them to the drs office it was raining hard outside The dr came into where I was and commented that he really liked my boots and wasn t I afraid that the rain would ruin them When I told him they were rain boots he was really surprised Everyone who sees them comment on how cool they look They can t believe they are rain boots They are very comfortable to wear 
Good boots pretty and practical I actually bought these boots for a friend of mine for Christmas The boots arrived in good time which is very useful as I live in the UK and the ordering process was hassle free The report back on the boots themselves are Fabulous Highly fashionable piece of useful kit for any rainy day 
My favorite white top This top is so convenience for work or to wear casual I love it because is front zip 
I ve really tested the waterproofing I just bought the shoes last week They ve slogged through rain snow hail and sleet No I don t work for the post office They stay beautifully dry are comfortable and have great traction I m very happy and I like their look too 
Nice boot at a great price I ordered the camel color and I love these boots They are comfortable and look very attractive with pants or a skirt I got them at a really nice discount too when ordering through Amazon Thanks 
camel pelle moda does not bleed dye I purchased the women s easton western boot in three colors camel brown and black and the camel boot is the only one that does not bleed dye from the boot onto my leg and into the pants I am wearing It is unfortunate as the boot fits well and is attractive 
The best Merrell Sandal yet I have just about every pair of merrell sandals they make This by far is my favorite And considering how comfortable the others are that is saying something They are AMAZING You will never take them off 
Best Sandals Ever I ve always had a love hate relationship with my sandals Love them when I first set eyes on the must have shoe hate them when my feet are suffering from breaking them in I bought these sandals for a vacation that had a lot of walking involved From the first day I wore them they conformed perfectly to my feet I did an amazing amount of walking in them the first day and not one blister These sandals formed around my feet as if they were already broken in So basically i did not have to do it I highly recommend these sandals as a must have for any women s closet 
Romance in a bag It will definitely get her attention in the best possible way 
CLARKS SHOES BEEN WEARING CLARKS FOR 45 YEARS MY SON TOLD ME ABOUT THE NEW LINE OF SHOES NOT ONLY ARE THEY STILL COMFORTABLE BUT STYLISH ALS 
Givenchy Style 575 These are the best nylons for me I was so happy to find them on Amazon 
Love these boots I like these boots so much my mother ordered a pair really cute with jeans or dress pants really comfortable and well made 
Anne Klein boots I am extremely happy with the fast delivery The boots are very comfortable as well as stylish I think the price was fair 
Excellent Product Very satified with purchase It was exactly as stated and of good quality Search was easy to understand and ordering was a breeze 
item is not as represented If you wear a B width shoe you will likely find this is too narrow for you It s more like a narrow width boot 
Anne Klein Desi boot This is a sharp pair of demi boots The wedge heel is just the right height to wear all day I think they run a half size large so the size 7 my regular size slipped a bit at the heel Wearing a heavy pair of socks with them helped immensely I really like this pair and will wear them often 
Great gift I bought these as a gift and I am happy to report that he loved them They are gorgeous with french cuffs 
Love it Bra is very comfortable I would prefer back hooks instead of pull over but once it is in place it s great 
Great fit As a petite person I ve had quite a problem finding a 32A strapless bustier bra to wear with my wedding dress and with a bridesmaid dress for another wedding This bra fit perfectly and is quite comfortable Shipping was very fast less than a week and product was well packaged 
nice goodies arrived quick it was exactly how it looked in the picture it blends seamlessly with my wedding dress 
Overall a A B+ There are several features I like about this product Most importantly the bra supports and yet has smooth lines under silky clothes and the front dips below the waist so you don t have that sausage roll effect where the abdomen bulges when the bra stops Another plus is that it comes with clear straps you can use for extra support I only have 2 negatives First I believe the ad said it came with both clear AND straps to match the bra but when it arrived only clear was included I didn t pursue this However the biggest negative is that the cups are not just lined but padded I personally find that makes the bra less useful and can even disturb the lines of some clothing Sometimes less IS more 
Beautiful Shoes Beautiful Shoes my favorite pair You can t find these everywhere so take advantage of getting them delivered to your door They were a bit sore around the heels when I first wore them but I guess I broke them in You ll forget all about that when you look at them They definitely make whatever I m wearing look even better Go ahead and treat yourself 
BALLERINA FLAT Really pretty and well made shoe but I thought I had ordered a narrow Filled in with a shoe pad and all is ok 
Really cute shoe runs small This shoe is VERY cute I get compliments on them every time I wear them They run about a half size small though 
High quality gloves I use these gloves for photographic work handling processed film but they could be used for military dress purposes also They are very good qulaity 
Beautiful Material The material is beautiful even though it has a lining it is still light weight What a great price for such a classy item 
Nice Shirt Bought it for my father for Christmas and he loved it Hey if he s happy with it then so am I 
Booties There were and are very cute Booties and I needed to return them for a different size it was quick and easy Very nice to deal with Would recommend 
AFI Sweatshirt My daughter loves it and someday she will grow into it Need junior size 
Thermal underwear EXCELLENT Lady Morgan s After having tried Lady Morgan s thermal shirts I decided to replace all my other brands inferior thermal underwear with Lady Morgan s I ordered long john bottoms they were just as excellent as the shirts They fit well under anything I wear don t twist and become uncomfortable causing me to stop everything to adjust them when I m doing physically twisting things They don t climb up my legs like other brands do They stay where they belong I feel like I m being embraced by a warm fluffy cloud when I wear them They retain their original softness even after many washing machine dryings They don t snag run or get stiff uncomfortable and they keep my body very warm but they never feel damp or sweaty These are far above all other brands but are not as costly as most of those inferior brands I threw all my other thermal underwear in the garbage where they belong after trying Lady Morgan s thermal underwear Excellent price for an excellent product I highly recommend Lady Morgan s thermal underwear for anyone living in a cold climate I m willing to bet that the men s version preforms equally well 
T shirt ordered for my grandson s birthday Good quality shirt affordable price and delivered in a timely manner Pleased with the product and so is my grandson 
Very comfortable These are made of top quality cotton with a little stretch Better fit and feel than typical undershirt or tanktop 
Very Large Bag I didn t realize how big this bag really was until I received it It makes a nice gift though 
good time will when i was in iraq this was a mean and cute trick i played on my husbeen thank 
Flattering and comfortable I think this dress is fabulous Its great support means I don t have to wear an uncomfortable nursing bra to bed anymore I m now a 38D fitting into a medium Comfortable and cut to allow for a post pregnancy belly My husband calls it sexy and I feel great in it That s something I can t say about much of what I wear lately I highly recommend this dress for lounging and nightwear I might even get another one to wear out 
Carhartt Canvas Shirt Jacket Flannel Lined in Midnight X Large Tall This shirt is a lightweight jacket but warm I bought it as a gift for my dad that worked in areas without heat he found it very useful and comfortable and plus he did not have to wear his heavy coat to work 
G Unit Polo I ordered this shirt to go with the adidas and the combo was nice I will order more in the futur 
Best fitting baseball hat I ve found I discovered Dorfman Pacific ball caps about five years ago when I bought a great American flag logoed cap in Chatham Mass in a high end men s clothing store I have tried to contact the company to purchase more hats but apparently they sell only to retail distributors not individual customers I wear baseball caps often and these fit perfectly The brim is strong and the hat doesn t ride high on your head If you care about how caps look and feel I would strongly suggest purchasing a Dorfman ball cap 
Great shoes Great Price We love these shoes Baby took his first steps in these 
exceeded expectations We love Stride Rites for our boys because of the quality fit and comfort I bought this particular model because of the sale price I wasn t sure how well these would stay on because there is just one thin strap and less velcro compared to other models They fit very securely however and were quite good looking better than my impression from the photo My son loved them and wore them daily They were still holding up well when he grew out of them I am ordering another pair in the next size up 
Great buy for the money I usually buy my daughter Stride Rite shoes and she loves wearing them These were no different As soon as I got them she wanted to put them on right away and they are her favorite shoes Stride Rite is one of the few shoes that are made in wide sizes Amazon also delivered the shoes amazingly fast and during the holiday season thanks Amazon 
Love These You can t go wrong with Stride Rite shoes for your baby especially these I got the pink pair for my daughter and they are super cute They go well with almost all of her little outfits I love the fact that you can order wide widths on Amazon Highly recommended 
amazing backpack purse I noticed this bag at lunch with a colleague I immediately ordered It arrived today and all I can say is it surpassed my expectations I used to carry a small backpack when traveling but this is stylish and light enough to be used daily as a purse Excellent exterior if you abuse your bag Wipes off no problem I ordered the extra small because I m short but definitely would consider the small if you are taller than 5 2 
perfect for snorkeling I wear a size medium but I bought a large based on the previous reviewer s experience It fit perfectly not loose and not too tight The collar is effective and comfortable as well It gives sun protection but also protection from rocks and coral when you re snorkeling There s a convenient loop on the bottom front where I attached my u water camera too I did stain it with some greasy food during my two weeks in Hawaii but it came right out later when washed in cold water I couldn t be more pleased with this rashguard I ll use it anytime I m in the sun and water for any length of time It was shipped from Oahu so I might have saved the shipping cost by buying it on the island when I arrived 
Great quality runs a little small I ve worn rashgaurds for several years now It s great to not worry about suncreen and the dark colors help keep you warm if it is sunny but the water is cold This particular one has a nice quality feel to it though I think the sizes run a teeny bit small You obviously want something that is close fitting but mine is a little too tight around the biceps and I don t flatter myself that they are particularly large I m 5 8 150 lbs and got a size medium but maybe a large would have been more comfortable Responding to another reviewer I think they re called rashgaurds because they protect your chest when paddling on a surfboard but I m not a surfer I haven t ever gotten a rash by leaving it on wet either and it seems to dry pretty well to me 
great running shoes hese were the best Hurricane s yet the grid 8 are nothing compared to thees I used mine for a full season of adventure racng and triathlons and still use them to walk around and work in 
Wonderful walking shoes These shoes lived up to consumer report information on comfort and foot protection specially in the heel area After walking I no longer have pain in my feet which was the case previously Would absolutely recommend them 
Liz Shorts Liz Twill Walking Shorts are great just wash and dry Fit the shapes of older women 
Denin skort I was very impressed with the quality and style of this skort It fit perfect and I would order this way again 
Really Awesome Spikes are great for jumping But for sure order half a size or one size bigger These shoes overall are really good Just dont let anyone spike the top of the shoe it leaves a hole 
Leather Credit Card Holder I found the product to be all the promotion said it would be The leather is nice and it holds and displays all my various credit card sized cards nicely Good product 
Good Deal Have yet to break the product in Looks well and delivered in a timely manner 
Sweat Pants This was a great company to deal with They kept me informed about my order from the time they received it to the day it was shipped The pants are very light weight and soft my husband loved them Donn 
Excellent Workout Gear I love vintage looking clothing This is super soft and comfortable Great style at a great price 
Uplifting The Carina bra by Le Mystere is an excellent bra with smooth cups It does not show under clothing This particular bra defines each breast separately and the cups gently mold to each breast The straps are fairly narrow and are cut in a rick rack fashion They can be adjusted by moving the back hooks closer in or further out The one disadvantage this bra has is that when putting it on the straps sometimes come out of the slot where they are hooked You sometimes have to readjust them 2 3 times when putting it on Once on this bra will certainly define you and give you a nice shape and uplifted bosom In fact you could think of it as your bosom s buddy An excellent bra 
pleased Does what it is made to do What else can I say I m pleased 
Not the Product Advertised The picture on the advertisement for these earmuffs is a different product than that supplied If the postage cost less I would probably return them The picture shows a fluffy set of earmuffs with a large thick strap that is surrounded with leather or sheepskin The product mailed to me is a generic set of earmuffs with a cheap looking coiled plastic band connecting the earmuffs Given this misrepresentation the price is too high and the advertisement is very deceptive 
Delightful I was born and raised in a tropical climate so when it gets cold up here in the northeast I really feel it These ear muffs have surpassed my expectations in terms of warmth I ll never have to experience frozen ears again They look quite stylish as well The texture of the sheepskin appears to be much more even than what is shown in the picture My only gripe is that the band is not covered with material as depicted here If you don t mind that I highly recommend this item 
Great socks for walking while on vacation I bought Thorlo socks after a trip to Disney World In spite of wearing cotton socks and well broken in sneakers I developed really painful blisters on both feet The trip was ruined I read about these socks on line and decided to try them on my next vacation They are really comfortable and I haven t had blisters again even when on vacations that involve lots of walking I use them all the time now not just while on vacation They may be a little pricey but I think they re worth every penny 
Just as described I bought these boots for my son at Christmas He was very satisfied with them They look great and he has worn them almost daily I would purchase this item again and recommend it to others 
New Favorite Boots I have had these boots for a few months now and I absolutely LOVE them They are so warm luxuriously soft and the removeable inserts insure a perfect fit I ve also had a pair of the short popular sheepskin boots you know the ones that start with a U for about a year now I have enjoyed them too but I wanted to purchase a tall pair However I think everyone else did too because they were nearly impossible to find The Warmbats are very similar to the other brand except the shape is a little bit less clunky and they have a very cool design on the back of the boot I have to say I actually like these better They are of equal or better quality and you get much more for your money they came with another pair of inserts and a bottle of sheepskin cleaner I m very impressed with these boots and I m glad Amazon recommended them If you re tired of waiting for your size in the other boots try Warmbats they definitely won me over 
Warmbats I love these boots They re warm and comfortable and at the price cannot be beat I m rating them a 4 because they re my first sheepskin boots and there might be some better out there 
Best boots I have 2 pairs of Warmbats and they are very very comfortable They re better than Uggs for sure They keep your feet warm and very comfortable definitely worth the buy 
wonderful and cheap This product is a great alternative to the 30 cases I ve seen It has a belt clip that doesn t pop off It s soft and the cover flips over to make a little kickstand that holds the player up I highly recommend it 
Great Product case fits the player well just wish it had a lil stand on the back so I can prop up the player and watch video 
Great buy for the style and price I love these shoes Steve Madden had a pair that I was eyeing exactly like this but they are about 50 more Definately a good buy for the money The inside has a nice cushion and is very comfy 
Annoying but your little one will love them When I first got these shoes in the mail and put them on my 1 year old and heard them for the first time I thought that I was going to return them immediately because they annoyed the heck out of me That day happened to be my childs first birthday party so I decided to keep them on him for the day and return them later first I have to say that he has never laughed so much before that what he would when he would walk in them and hear them squeak he LOVED them Second EVERYONE at his birthday party and we have a big family and church family too LOVED them all of the other mothers wanted to know where I got them and how they could buy their kid some Admittedly they are incredibly cute I bought the USA Red ones and my child DOES seem to love them plus I always know where he s at Needles to say after that day I decided to keep them and now they ve grown on me though I wouldn t recommend them if you or your child can t tolerate constant noise because these suckers squeak every time your child MOVES 
Pink Sketchers The shoes came in perfect condition and I am very satisfied The only thing that disturbed me is I purchased the same shoes in black and white online from Bealls for 29 00 and I paid 48 75 for the pink ones 
10 Stars I love these shoes I have 3 pair and now I m going for a fourth Very comfortable and cute My feet are very sensitive and I usually get blisters etc but these shoes have never given me a problem I can wear them with socks or without and they are extremely comfortable no rubbing pinching etc I d give them a rating of 10 stars if that were an option 
Skechers Bikers are the Best I d highly recommend this shoe style to anyone who desires comfort I now have four pairs in different colors since they are great for work weekends and whenever you want something that just feels comfortable 
I LOVE these shoes I have 3 pairs of Sightsees and want more I have a narrow foot and need arch support to the extent of wearing orthotics in some of my shoes These shoes are NOT narrow yet not wide but because of the Velcro strap and arch support I am able to wear these And I don t need the orthotics They are extrememly cool and comfortable suitable for being on your feet all day Because of their slight Euro look they go with almost anything In other words you can wear them with dresses or with gauchos or to the gym I ve found them in bronze and silver and lots of other great colors They aren t cheap but a great shoe at that These are probably my absolute favorite shoes I live in mine and would wear them more often if I had more colors By the way I m in my late 40s and a grandma though I don t look like it I get tons of compliments on these shoes from college students and other moms and grandmas 
Very cute and sporty I love the pink combo The style is great and the color is a soft light pink but not quite pastel It s very comfortable like wearing the Skechers Step Up The only caveat is that if you have wide feet you may get a little gap on the sides and the heel is a bit slippy Everybody in my office wants a pair now 
classic leather and hip lining i ordered this wallet for a christmas gift i was very happy when i first looked it over the lining is throughout the whole wallet no nook and cranny unturned the leather is soft and a beautiful color the gift was for a young man 26 years old new yorker with a unique yet classic style he really loved it however the downside was its SIZE it is ulta thin but very wide i recommend wearing it in a jacket pocket 
Great wallet I just recently got this wallet and I just love it Very stylish yet functional Looks great and no one I know owns a wallet that looks like it The coin compartment is a big plus because I don t like having loose change jangling around in my pocket The price is pretty good too I ve seen comparable items leather wallets handmade in Italy at department stores for a helluva lot more 
Cash is king I own a black version of this wallet and I like it because it has a big coin compartment a convenient ID window and ample space for banknotes and business checks and receipts The number of credit card slots is kept to a minimum 3 which is perfect for a check card a business credit card and a personal credit card I like to pay cash flash my ID when I go to a bar and actually use the change I get instead of collecting it in a big jar I used to have a smaller wallet and was afraid that this would not fit in my front pocket It turns out that this is actually a bit slimmer and its larger dimension is still short enough to comfortably fit in a low rise jeans front pocket The wallet is really handmade in Italy and looks and smells great Even comes with the warranty directly from the Italian artisans This is definitely not for those who carry and regularly use lots of credit cards 
Best mid priced jeans These are the only jeans that fit my figure and I love the long length too I ve tried every single brand of mid priced jeans and I was so happy when they fit Unlike most jeans that I ve tried on these don t gape too much in the back The sizes run big so try on a size or two smaller than you normally wear I would say these jeans are good for women who A are tall B have an above average hip waist ratio C have a booty and D like stretch and comfort 
Long legged women rejoice I really like my jeans because not only are they long enough they fit everywhere else too A rare occurrence in the purchasing of jeans online Gotta love it De 
Yankee Polo Shirt I purchased this shirt for my husband for Christmas and he loves it Great quality material and just overall nice shirt Would recommend to anyone and would reorder from this company again 
Great carrier but should have skipped the sun shade We ve had this carrier for 7 8 months and have only used it to go hiking our intended purpose a handful of times We used to go backpacking a lot in our childless days and I would not say this carrier is quite as comfortable as the pack I used for that a Gregory but then again my Gregory pack has always just ridden quietly on my back and doesn t throw its weight around and yell in my ear I think the wiggle of the cargo accounts for the difference in comfort and the difference is not that big Still I have never hiked more than 6 miles with my kid in this and I can t imagine going much further than that I m willing to admit this is due more to my going soft than poor pack design though We can fit all his diaper supplies in the attached backpack if we use disposables tie a few toys off the loops on the carrier and stuff a sippie cup in the holder in back and it makes for a nicely contained baby unit for a day hike What I have found this pack to be unexpectedly great for is to use in place of a stroller where strollers are a hinderence such as historical sites or for walking around the mall or grocery store My kid has reached this point where he hates to ride in the shopping cart and tries to climb out but for some reason he is happy as a clam riding up high on my back in this pack Generally happier than when in the stroller even Never fights to get down My husband and I can both use this pack comfortably I am about 5 4 and use the pack on the second from the smallest setting he is 5 10 and uses it maybe 2 settings bigger I think there are about 8 settings in all so this could certainly work well for a wide range of people From a kid perspective my boy is about 30 pounds 35 or 36 inches and he s riding with the seat in the middle of 3 adjustment The only thing I don t like about it is the sunshade rainhood which is included with this model but makes this model more expensive than the next model down which I think is called the Journey We just never use it because it wigs my kid out so we should have saved the money I also looked at REI s child carriers Baby Trend and a lower priced Kelty Base Camp I think and the suspension just didn t compare The Pathfinder line is just much much more comfortable I don t even understand why Kelty puts out carriers like the Base Camp My only regret is not having gotten a frame carrier sooner I overestimated at which point he d be ready for one 
Mt Rushmore Black Hills Gold I was impressed with the quick delivery the package arrived in tacked and the person who received the item was delighted with the gift I highly recommend them for your purchases Thank you Mt Rushmor 
A Beautiful Ankle Bracelet I really love the ankle bracelet I gave it as a gift and everyone who saw it thinks it s beautiful Great craftsmanship 
Great Handbag This bag is much larger than expected It is very spacious with two interior zip pockets one on each side The bag smells of fabulous genuine leather every time you unzip it The handbag came with an authentication card and a dust bag for storage 
This bag is NOT canvas It s a beautiful bag but I purchased it for daytime thinking it was red canvas It s red Leather Suede with Navy Blue straps I thought they would be black 
Cute and comfortable These boots are very cute and seem to be holding up well through gentle use My son has worn them about 4 times just for puddle jumping and playing in the mud They are nicely and deeply treaded on the bottom Since we use them only infrequently I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars since I can t comment much as to their ruggedness 
Cushy and comfy They are cushy comfortable and they don t slide on your foot The soles are grippy and great for walking outside My wife surprised me with these Packer slippers I love em 
Extended Size Belt I was pleased to find an extended size belt at a reasonable price through Amazon com My husband has a hard time finding belts his size that are simple and go with everything Although I wouldn t expect the quality to last a lifetime for the price I was pleased with the product The price of the belt and the shipping fit easily into my budget and I highly recommend this product and will very likely purchase another belt in the future 
Don t Let The Price Fool You These socks are just outrageous I bought these to go with my crocs What I like about the socks is that they are soft and stay soft and yet are strong and last a long long time You get what you pay for They are cushioned and thick but breathe I have worn these socks to Disney World in the hot summer 
wow I had ordered these for my husband but in my haste ordered the wrong size so they became mine and I m glad for the goof up on my part These are excellent so warm with lots of cushion I have sensitive feet and I m always looking for socks with extra cushion on the heel and soles so this was a happy accident that I ended up with these of course I had to come back to order the correct size for hubby 
What a difference I have severe neuropathy in my feet and legs Thorlo was recommended by another patient of my neurology doctor I don t know what I did before I got the socks 
Amazingly Comfortable These arrived on the same day as my Nike Airmax shoes never thought a thing about the socks thought the Nikes were the most comfortable shoes I have ever had Then I wore the socks with some uncomfortable boating sandals they too felt the most comfortable ever This has happened with all my shoes It is astonishing to me that socks can have such a wonderful effect A luxurious feel I can recomend them 
Great Shirt Overall great shirt Sizes fit right Looks great Looks good for Night Life or a day at the office 
EXCELLENT i m very impressed by what i received from the amazon for the good and honset service they did for me i will be a permenant custmor for the amazon 
My most favorite running shoe EVER I ve been a runner for about 15 years now and I ve tried just about every brand of running shoe there is The Asics Gel Nimbus is my absolute most favorite of them all They have amazing cushion and bounce I will NEVER buy another shoe again 
Gel Nimbus Actually in error I ordered a size too small and could not wear them Did try exchanging them for my size but they did not have the shoes available in that So actually I never got to enjoy them 
Great Shoes This is my second pair of Asics Nimbus shoes and I love them I bought them because they are supposed to be good for people who underpronate have high arches 
best 100 bucks i ever spent these sneakers are so comfortable but supportive without cutting off circulation or pinching anywhere they are light and breathable and let in a lot of air as you run initially i was afraid to buy running sneakers so squishy and comfortable because i thought they wouldn t be supportive enough but they are and have a great gel padding that supports as you run sizes seem to run a teeny bit smaller than most other brands which worked out great for me 
Nice Thong I have a few thongs but hardly ever wear them They re generally not my thing I prefer bikinis But last night I had a dream that I was in a competition with some guys who also don t normally wear thongs to see who could wear thongs the longest Although I m not competing with anyone else I m still going to have the competition anyway This is the first pair I wore in my dream so it s the first one I m wearing now The pouch is second to none Roomy comfortable and keeps you in place The strap is hardly noticeable at all unless you want it to be I m giving it a 4 because even though it looks pretty good it certainly isn t the best looking thong nor the most comfortable one either The winner in both categories for me is the microfiber contour thong by International Male Undergear 
returned item These were a gift that ended up being too small for the recipient I sent them back to the company for an exchange but since they were out of stock they refunded my money The customer service at this company was exceptionally helpful and polite The refund came promptly with no problem whatsoever 
Love my clogs Hurry and buy these while they are under 50 I wear Birkenstock clogs and sandals most days My foot is also rather wide and these fit well with a light sock If you run a medium to narrow width you could wear a thicker sock and be fine The shipping from Midwest was super fast as well only 2 days 
Super duper walking shoes I was in Copenhagen one fine spring day that turned pretty ugly I was caught at the far end of the main shopping street during a downpour Surprisingly my feet stayed dry and warm in my Betula sandals as I meandered back to the train station I ve never traveled without them since 
Birkenstock shoes If you have never tried Birkenstocks I would highly recommennd them After being a waitress for 25 years you can immagine the problems I had with my feet I bought my first pair of Birkenstocks on the recomendation from my daughter in law well after that I was hooked I now own 15 pairs have not worn any other kind of shoes for 7 years Am I happy you bet and so are my feet Birkenstocks are better than going barefoot 
Review of ASICS Men s GT 2100 I purchased recently ASICS Men s GT 2100 and i have to say i am very satisfied with this product i really enjoy it every time i go to the gym I can only recommend to people to use this product 
Good as ever I ve been running in Asics shoes for more than 10 years The GT series continues to provide good fit and comfort 
Asics Running Shoes The GT 2100 shoes are the best running shoes that I have ever used The fit cushioning and quality are the best My only regret is that the GT 2100 is no longer available 
Great Shoes These shoes offer great support and cushion for tired aching feet I purchased these shoes for my bad knees and back and love the relief I get I highly recommend them to anyone needing that little bit of extra support 
Asics most versatile shoe I ve been using the GT 2000 series shoes for about 2+ years now and I can honestly say they re the most comfortable running shoes for my build This is one of Asics best if not the best selling shoes because it offers such a wide variety of fit for most foot types These shoes are mainly designed for the moderate to heavy over pronator when the feet roll in too much with low to medium arches but I ve met fellow runners with the same shoe who have medium to high arches I myself am flat footed but use orthotics This can be a major problem for me when buying shoes because I need something with a wide enough heel to allow my orthotics to fit and these work great Don t worry if you don t have a wide heel because there is memory foam embedded in the heel that forms to your foot over time The heel and forefoot also offer a good amount of stability and support The shoe is designed for medium to large builds but again I ve come across other runners who are much lighter and use the same shoe When I first began running I weighed 300+ pounds now at 216 pounds the shoes still work well I ve bought newer version of this shoe as I ve worn the others out The Upper the top parts of the shoe are really comfortable It s made of a mesh material that allows a maximum amount of air and circulation into the foot while allowing all the heat moisture sweat out The shoe is so comfortable you could easily run in it without socks which I have done only a few times The 2000 series are versatile they re well priced and they come in a variety of sizes widths and colors so chances are they ll fit you This is by far the best running shoe I ve used up to date and would recommend it to anyone who is just starting or a long time runner 
After Reading and trying this is best After Reading and trying this is best I ve just got new one now they can be found good price I go to gym and this shoes are very good I don t really feel any jump and shock while running or working out wonderful techonology I highly recommand it 
best shoe around The GT 2100 from Asics is a phenomenal shoe It provides the best support of any stability shoe around and has been voted the best running shoe in the World by Runner s World Though not made for heavy over pronaters this is a fantastic shoe for those who do not or just slightly over pronate It also provides fantastic supposrt for those with weaker ankles or knees An all around fantastic piece of equipment 
Good shoe for larger athletic runners I weigh in at around 200 lbs and tend to pronate I run frequently at medium distance 2 5 miles a day and this shoe has been by far the best I ve owned Only drawback was initial stiffness of shoe but this subsided quickly after breaking in 
Soft and Cuddly My husband loves these slippers They are just like the ones he bought years ago in Brooks Brothers at 1 2 the price They are one of the few models remaining that have the faux fur lining for warmth They are as advertized 
Lightning speed Slippers The L B Evans men s deer slippers I ordered as a Christmas gift arrived in a remarkable three days The recipient found them both comfortable and luxurious remarking that they looked nice enough to wear to town 
Evans Imperial Deerskin Slippers I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my brother and he told me he loves them 
great shoes I made the purchase and was extremely happy when I got the shoes the styling and comfort were all that I expected I am happ 
Wonderful padded panty This is the padded panty to buy It truly does look natural even under light weight fitted pants or drapey pants You will not detect the padding outline like some other padded panties The material is durable and well stitched The fit is firm and fabulous The only downside that I could find with this garment is that the rise is a bit high the waist band hits at the natural waist making this panty not very useful under low rise pants 
Good for a while I liked this bra for a while it had nice shape and support but after a while the underwire broke through which didn t feel too good I did like it while it lasted it was cuter than most 
terry wrap Thanks for your prompt sending of the product It was just what my husband wanted and enjoys using 
Perfect Although the shipping was more than the item they are reliable Thigh Highs They feel great and not scratchy and they look great One size does fit all or most people up to 190 lbs i think it says I couldve went to a lingerie store for these at a cheaper price 
NICE PANTS FOR WHEN U WANNA HANG LOOSE THESE PANTS ARE REAL COOL CUZ THEYRE LIGHT WEIGHT I WEAR THEM WITHOUT UNDERWEAR AND GET A NICE BREEZY FEEL LOVE THESE PANTS 
Great I enjoy my sandals very much They did hurt my feet because I wore them on vacation I can t really blame it on the sandals because we did alot of walking I really think they are great and they came in the mail very quickly in time for my vacation 
These sandals are awesome I don t like thong sandals but these sandals don t feel like there is anything between my toes I was very surprised how comfortable they were right out of the box and the more I wear them the more comfortable they get 
Great Sandals Stay on your feet These sandals are great They stay firmly and securly on your feet and don t flop when you walk The wide sizes are ample and accurate The bumps were weird at first but now I don t notice them at all I ve gotten 2 pairs allready and planning on getting more 
Color Problem The sandal web site offers a variety of colors however each color sample cannot be accessed I chose rose and when the shoes arrived the color was Shocking Pink While the sandals are well constructed and attractive I had to return my order Make sure you know exactly the color shoes you are getting 
Confortable Excellent sandals comfy true to size Look sort of like Birkenstocks but not as costly they are just as well made and the sole is flexible yet supportive 
Teenylion from Minnesota I LOVE this sandal Fits to size and very comfortable Excellent camping sandal and perfect for on the go 
The best toddler shoe out there We bought these shoes from my son when we was wearing a 4W We loved them so much that we continued buying them in all sizes up to 8W My only complaint is they don t make them bigger He is already in the 7W and gets to wear them only one more size These are the most rugged and long wearing toddler shoe I have ever bought 
GREAT Toddler Shoe We buy one pair of shoes at a time for our little guy so we look for shoes to last until he moves up to the next size Stride Rite never disappoint These shoes are adorable AND rugged He wears them everywhere and they just keep going and going 
Great shoes I love these shoes They fit my son perfectly Besides looking good they are also very durable and since my son is learning to walk that is a plus 
always stride rite This looks very cute for my one year old son matching most of his outfits Very supportive and soft for his prewalk feet I will always buy this brand for him It is simply the best 
HOT DEAL You really can t beat this deal Not only is it an AMAZING price for a pair of Stride Rite shoes but they are adorable It is so hard to try and find cute things for my son Boy s just don t have as many options wen it comes to shoes and clothes as girls do I am beyond happy and am stocking up and buying them in 3 additional sizes 
Nate s Mom This shoe is very cute and I had no prolem with the actual quality of the product however my son s foot is a little wide but usually fits in a regular width shoe The regular and wide did not fit his foot the were too narrow Finally the extra wide fit his foot Just be aware the shoes do run small so I would suggest selecting a wider size if your childs foot is at all wide 
Great Shoe Goes with everything I am very happy with this shoe We get complements all the time The shoe is very cute fits my son great and goes with almost everything I wish I would have bought another pair to last when he outgrows this pair 
LUV IT Best pair of shoes I ever purchased for my son He walks like he has no shoes on And the shoes look just like the picture You cant beat the quality of Stride Rite at Amazon prices AWESOME 
Beware of leather belt The leather or whatever this is that the belt is made of smells so bad and strong my whole closet ended up with a foul odor I finally had to set it outside on the porch because it stunk up whatever room I put it in There is no way I could ever wear it I am totally displeased with it 
women s belt I am very satisfied with the women s belt I purchased I received it in a timely manner The quality is much greater than the cost The style color thickness are exactley what I was looking for 
Very Nice Suit I have purchased the silver blue pinstripe and burgundy suits All three have a look and feel of a much more expensive suit I brought each of them to my tailor and each time she has commented on how nice the fabric is A true 150s look and feel I will continue to buy these suits Plus you can t beat the price 
Good enough but not as portrayed As far as shorts go this is not a bad purchase However they are a bit baggy and not as the picture shows what is Overall it is a good buy and they will not shrink 
Nice snug and attractive look These do a great job of enhancing your best feature These definately fit snugly If that is not your preference you will need to get one size larger They will sit a little lower on your backside than other underwear The only area on these that is not transparent is the pouch These underwear wil make you look great 
Not Bad Overall Overall they good and served their purpose as a men s lingerie item The wife enjoyed them She liked the look and feel If I were to order them again or recomend them I would definately order 1 size LARGER I have similar items that are great and have a snug fit but these are just to tight and even wearing them for just a short time was not very comfortable To really enjoy wearing them for any real lenght of time get one size up And yes I of course realize they are not for everyday wear and am not comparing them to that Other than that they re great 
Nice suit This is a very nice bathing suit and it arrived in a very timely manner It fits well and is very flattering compared to those horrible dress suits people normally like to put pregnant women in I particularly like the way the halter top is adjustable with slides like a bra However I only gave it 4 stars because when I went to the vendor s actual website I found it was listed for a cheaper price 
confortable easy fun These shoes weigh nearly nothing and are easy to slide into and fun to wear around Looking for something different Give these a try 
Best Walker I ve used a lot of different brands of walking shoes and different models within brands and the Propet Stability Walker is head and shoulders above the rest I walk 5 miles a day every day and need a good shoe They are more comfortable right out of the box they provide excellent support and hold up under heavy use I have used them for years and they have kept me pain free from plantar fascitis 
Stable Shoes These do promote a more stable stride especially on slick surfaces I only buy Propet for walking shoes They are quality made My only disappointment was the sizing They run wider in the heel and toe than other shoes I ve purchased from them in the same size 
Great shoes I love these shoes They re great to kick around in Would definitely recommend them 
Skeechers shoes This individual pair of bikers shoes was a tad smaller than the other 2 pairs that I own of the same size However am able to wear them 
Great with jeans cords khakis anything I just bought these in chocolate and black after having the stone navy ones for about 5 months These are so very comfortable They feel like ballet slippers They do not have much rubber under the front half of the shoe but have a decent amount under the heel They are easy to slip on and off and i have gotten a good amount of complements on the stone ones 
great coverall This item has really good coverage It is large enough to protect my kids clothes during messy meals and art projects and It will wipe clean quickly 
boxer briefs i wear them and am proud i think they offer a great amount of support and they are really comfortable the longer leged ones tend to be more comfortable for me i have had no problems with being made fun of in the locker rooms for wearing them i think these are worth buying 
FAST SHIPPING I have been looking for the perfect swim suit for this season and I was pretty sure that I was going to have to spend about 100 which may not be much to some but for me ouch This company had amazingly fast shipping I am absolutely awe struck It was here within a week even though the predicted time was that it would be SHIPPED in like 2 weeks The product is super cute good material The only thing is I had to kind of guess on the size they didn t really give a swim suit sizing method but if you think about it whenever you buy online it is a guessing game Great shipping affordable price and not a cheaply made product It s an adorbable swim suit and I ll most likely check here first for next years swim suit 
It does its job I was thinking about getting one of those fancy motorized tie racks with a gazillion features and then read all the bad reviews and decided to stick to the bare basic design I bought two all the ties hang nice neat in the closet and if we move or change closets I don t have to worry about anything especially the batteries dying 
Perfect This is perfect for Gigabeat 30s The black is really nice and I love the armband and clip 
Nice Product Good fit good price good quality and good protection This kti came with some nice features kick stand belt loop belt clip arm band I plan to purchase a more protective case As case fits snugly I can leave this on the unit all the time I tend to drop things cameras cell phones as I pull them out of the case The case adds additional grip to prevent it from slipping out of my hand and protection should I accidently drop it 
Una prenda inteligente Cuando eleg� est� franelilla lo hice talla M Yo soy M de medio rellenita por eso cuando la recib� y me encontr� con una prenda realmente estrecha me asust� Pero la fralenilla es de algod�n y est� hecha de una manera en que su tejido se expande al ponerla sobre el cuerpo El resultado fue incre�ble se ajusta al torso resaltando el busto y la cintura y como es para talle largo no deja al descubirto la pancita y adem�s no se sube se queda en su lugar Es s�per fresca y la impresi�n del logo de SuperGirl est� hecha para que no se da�e con esta expansi�n de la tela Una prenda realmente inteligente y c�moda Dice que es para dormir pero yo jam�s la usar�a para eso unos jeans una chaqueta y a rumbear con mi franelilla 
Croco purse I love this purse It is exactly as advertised It is different from others I ve seen and very durable I have gotten several compliments on it also 
Nice classic comfortable Bass shoe I bought my pair at a retail store during a sale but I love my Bass Courtney s I have them in the Burgundy to wear with navy and khaki pants In dim light they look black because the burgundy is very dark They were a little tight at first and took about 3 days of wearing to break them in and to not rub the back of my heel I don t have a callous there so any small amount of rubbing causes great pain But once they broke in they turned into fantastic shoes They have great toe room I can freely wiggle my toes and there s no rubbing on my little toe I m going to buy a pair in black now 
nice for practice or beginners I m taking a beginner s belly dance class and don t want to invest in an expensive hip scarf for an 8 week class These inexpensive hip scarves are just what I needed 
smart buy These are great for beginners Yes they are irregular and some make more noise than others but for beginners and for practicing they are great It is a good purchase for the price If you do not mind the irregularities you will be happy with these scarves 
Perfect for what I wanted I wanted a scarf to practice with and this is perfect 
Terrific buy If you are a belly dancer this is a terrific scarf for lessons practice sessions Sturdy fabric coins sewn on well attractive You can definitely tell when I m doing a hard hip shake 
nice hip scarf Just got my hip scarf in the mail today It is very pretty I love the way the coins sounds Tho the scarf looks cheaply made what do expect for only 9 99 It is a bargin Most scarfs are 30 dollars are more I think it should be okay if you keep it in good shape I just started belly dancing having the scarf makes it even more fun 
A Bargain My teenaged daughter and I just started belly dancing classes and after paying for the classes I couldn t also afford two of the thirty dollar scarves our teacher was selling I found these and they are just perfect Beautiful bright colors and can t beat the price 
Picture does not do it justice Great scarf great price It has three rows of coins that really jingle None of the coins have fallen off yet I ve used a little bit doing a video and practicing shimmies The scarf is WAY better in person Very pretty No complaints 
Best hipscarf for money Obviously for 10 it s not a performance scarf but it is exceptional quality I ve already worn it about 5 times and no coins are falling off no thread is ripping and it is very durable Very good buy I ve bought more than one 
Pretty good So I just started bellydancing and wasn t sure if I was really commited to it yet This was just what I needed Be careful the beads do come off especially if you sit down so you can t just wear it around where ever Keep in mind it does look sort of cheap compared to the nice velvet ones with multiple rows and very detailed beadwork but it works well and doesn t fall apart so easily It is a rectangle shape not quite as nice as the triangular ones but it still looks good 
not bad I recently started belly dancing and I didn t want to have to borrow my friends hip scarves anymore so I found this and thought it was an awesome price Well after trying it out I m not 100 impressed because the coins don t reach around completely so it doesn t make as cool of a jingly sound as I wanted But other than that it works great and the coins aren t threating to fall off 
Great walking shoes I get compliments on these shoes all the time which is a bonus since I bought them to be comfortable I walk allover UMASS Amherst campus in these and feel that my feet and back are well supported In fact these shoes look even better when they re a little scuffed up Definetely worth the money 
great purchase Fast delivery sooo comfortable fit excellent color muted enough that it goes with everythin 
Good Quality Thin Wallet My husband is a cordura fan Greene wallets but we were unable to find a replacement for his old one so we tried this He is happy with it but he had to lessen the number of cards he can carry at one time 
I m so glad that I bought them I bought three of these bags They are perfect for my weekly food shopping Usually all my groceries fit in those three bags they are quite roomy I always feel that I am doing something good walking out of the supermarket with my three cloth bags thankful that I do not have a rediculous amount of those thin stupid plastic bags Buy them once and use them for life No more piles of plastic bags laying around Also take out the trash less because there are no plastic bags to throw away Do something good for yourself and the environment 
All Around Great Bag This bag is gorgeous soft leather with a tough black nylon lining It is very roomy it fits my large laptop with room to spare and has lots of pockets of varying sizes Highly recommended product and seller 
Excellent boxers soft and durable These boxers are perfect for a coca cola fan They are not only stylish and bold but soft comfortable and very durable My spouse can not say enough nice things about them since unwrapping them under the tree 
Perfect for kids I bought this for my 1 1 2 year old to wear while we were in Hawaii on vacation It provided lots of sun protection for his face head ears and neck It also stayed on with the tie srtaps even though some days were quite windy He now wears the hat each time we go for a walk It is a good substitute for or in addition to putting sunscreen on It is a high quality hat 
Comfort comfort comfort Great fit for a great price The cotton ensures they are very comfortable I especially like the fact that they have a very slight rib effect which makes them a bit stretchy This is nice since it prevents the cotton from getting baggy which cotton tends to do after it has been worn Buy these you and your buns will be happy 
sucked see through I don t wear it because it is so thin it is see thru maybe a darker color would of been better but this powder blue sucked 
The Best Tank Top I have Ever Worn I love tank tops sleeveless shirts and wear them pretty much all the time outside work I have worn dozens of different brands of tank tops including brands from popular sellers such as Banana Republic but this tank top is is the best and in a league of its own At just over 10 it is a bargain It is so comfortable to wear It has a great style that blends in with the body I have no words to describe how much I love this tank top So much that I have already bought one dozen of this tank top to stock up for future fearing that it may run out of stock The only downside is that it only comes in a few colors Andrew Christian please make this tank top available in all possible colors I would be the first one to place order for aother dozen if you can provide more colors Please make this tank top available in Size S also 
Good Product This thong fits well and the material is comfortable However after many hours of wearing it the thong began to become too constrictive 
Jeans Vs Genes Ever since I owned this pair of jeans the cool people at school will talk to me Although it is still to say I am a freak and Go Away I find when I where these I have some sort of acknowledgment rather than just the usual running away and screaming she says good bye and I say GOOD BUY 
Nice piece of cloth Really like the short leg style and the low rise It s very comfortable and the fit is just O K 
Great Stuff They are exactly what I was hoping they would be I love the contoured front pouch All the web sites I saw and read about them said you may want to order 1 size larger then normal I would agree with this unless you want a more snug fit My wife loves them as well and was quite pleased with the look and feel I ordered 4 different pairs of Unico s and they re all good quality and look and feel great 
I Hope Ryka Keeps Making Them As a group fitness instructor I have used many aerobics shoes most of which have been discontinued through the years We are now at the point where high tops are harder and harder to find That is why I was thrilled to purchase 3 pair of these N Gage Instructor shoes They have all the qualities I need lightness but good support a wide toe box and a supportive heel as well Ryka please do not discontinue manufacturing this shoe 
Very cute and affordable fast shipping This product is adorable and my daughter loved it especially the hula skirt The price was great and the shipping was fast Thank You 
fancy feet Comfy slingback with great heels can wear from daytime to party time nice color and style 
So comfortable my son kept them on all day These shoes were a terriffic deal at the sale price My son had a soccer tournament this weekend and did not even take them off in between games 5 hours 
awesome everything about the transaction price delivery time quality of item was great I wouldn t hesitate to purchase something again from this seller 
resonable price It seems that this pair of soccer shoes is quite simple nothing special designed But it is not expensive though 
good shoes This is my second pair lost the first one in moving It s a really good pair of shoes 
GOOD BUY Great kick around shoe To the store to the bank to the PTA meeting cute convenient COMFORTABLE shoe 
Great Robe Great Price When I pulled the robe out of the box I was amazed at the weight I put it on as soon as I hit the door It has nice details such as the turned back cuffs being stitched down you will not have to worry about them flopping into the bathroom sink Inside ties are sewn into the seams as are the belt loops I m a short 5 2 and most robes drag the floor This one hits just above my ankles perfect It s soft and the word that best describes the terry is dense I priced a lot of robes before picking this one Similar quality robes sell for up to 100 more I will probably buy another one and put it away for when I ve worn this one to death 
Denim shirt This is a very nice shirt with no pockets Nice for us women The material is nice and soft and it is well made 
Great shirt Great service I was a little hesitant after reading the other review but this compnay must have made great strides to improve The shirt was exactly as described and it got here in two days 
Slow moving I had a horrible experience with this company I never received my order for an entire month I e mailed them to find out what the problem was and never got a response I finally called to cancel the order and then they shipped it out late that night 
Excellent seller great all around I was pleased with the e mail response shipping packaging and the price It was all to my liking Thanks for excellent service 
Good Buy Great fit Still look new after many washings Will definitely be buy more of these 
Nice At this price I thought they might be seconds but these are very nice quality panties And the store selling them were very prompt and nice to deal with My girl was very happy with them 
Disappointed I have to say I am rather disappointed with this item Considering its price I was expecting a firm control garment It s not that it isn t well constructed and it is very comfortable but it isn t anything approaching what I would call firm control I don t think it would qualify for the title moderate control either Much too expensive for what is essentially a light control briefer 
cute comfy shoes I loved my shoe purchase They match my wedding dress perfect and will be super hot for the big day I am used to wearing 3 inch heals so they wont be a problem the day of the wedding but anyone else might want to go with a smaller heal LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM 
Intimo Men s Classic Silk Knit Tank Top I love my Silk Tank Tops I wear them to work under my dress shirts and the feel is very nice Much more comfie than the Hanes cotton tanks The quality is very good for the price The initial fit was just a tad snug but stretched out just a bit after a couple of washes wears and is very comfortable now I tried wearing one on a hike but i find the coolmax type active wear handles sweating much better than silk But for casual wear or sleeping at night I love them 
nice fit This is a great fit for a silk shirt I thought it would not be a close fit being silk but I was wrong This item fits snug and looks great on Both alone and layered I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank 
Very silky and wearble I bought this top for my 18 year old son thought it looked comfortable to wear under shirts etc It is He likes wearing it but he says he would never wear it alone It is a wee bit too feminine to wear on top Would I buy another one I don t know I think for him the basic cotton tank tops are more versatile 
Perfect fit These are my leggings of choice just enough support to be helpful with enough elasticity to be comfortable Good all around leggings for workouts go outs anything 
My other new pants Very nice quality pants They are very form fitting and leave no room for misjudging your size order a size up if you want a loose fit These are authentic Danskin pants and based on past purchases they will hopefully last the test of time 
Outstanding Base Layer This garmet forms an outstanding base layer for cool to cold weather activities It is comfortable and insultating Highly recommend 
This is the best bra I have ever worn I have 2 on order because they didn t have my size and I m teling you that you hardly know that you re wearing it except that you suddenly feel secure without restricted I have extremely sensitive skin this bra doesn t irritate it one little bit it s simply fabulous 
cute shoe This is such a cute shoe and would be very comfortableb but it runs small 
Son loved it It s very comfortable my son loves it and even after having outgrown it he still loves wearing it to be 
Moccasin Boots Loved the boots just ordered the wrong size Have told a lot of people about your website 
Good item I think i ll use these pair of boots until next winter but I like them and for the price I think it was a good choice 
I love these boots These are wonderful boots True to size very well made and stylish I am looking forward to winter again so I can wear them 
Best running bra I am a US Army Soldier This bra is perfect for my active lifestyle I do not feel the 36Ds when I run in this thing It rocks 
does the job well comfortably holds up after many washings I can understand that the other reviewers with D cups and larger would have trouble getting this on off as it is pretty snug over the head arms even with the hooks undone but for this full B cup it s perfect No bouncing no sliding up out from under the bust and a nice smooth look under t shirts and tank tops I was worried that the elastic bands would chafe scratch but the bra stays in place so well that it s perfectly comfortable And maybe also because I m not terribly generously endowed it doesn t create a uni effect for me 
Worked for me NO BOUNCE Having reduced from a 34E to a 34C this bra gives me NO BOUNCE comfort without looking like a uni boob Great for high impact running I am very satisfied worth the money thanks 
Very Good Bra I bought this bra for skiing and it works great even on moguly steep slopes I had a comment to the woman blessed with abundance go check out the level 4 impact bra by the same company it comes in large sizes like 40DD I m sure it s as good or better than this one Cheers 
love it I absolutely love this sports bra I have a very hard time finding sports bras that fit i m a 32C and most things are still too big around the rib area But this bra is perfect I love that you can adjust the side straps for an even more comfortable fit I would recommend this bra to anybody and will definitely be buying a few more 
I love this bra I bought this bra a few years ago at Victoria s secret for 15 dollars It was the best bra investment that I have made I m constantly on the look out for it It supports without flatting or underwires 
Support sox Very comfortable and effective men s support sox At 9 per pair they are the most inexpenive I have seen Cost 12 at JC Penny Free shipping made them even more attractive 
great socks I am totally satisfied with my Gold Toe socks They give great support to my legs and feet 
Oh so warm Since I ride a motorbike I needed something very warm and soft I have had other types and this was the best yet Even though I ride in cold weather I am not cold with this product 
The best bra ever I have worn the same bra for 6 7 years I m a creature of comfort habit I finally decided to try something new and I m so glad This is the most amazing comfortable bra ever I m now addicted to this one Plus Olga offers satisfaction guarentees on their products can t beat that 
VERY COMFY I have trouble finding bras that don t dig into my skin Even after wearing it all day long this bra does not dig I love it Highly recommend it to those that have sensitive skin The reinforcements on the side are great too 
Vasque comes through again My last pair of boots were purchased in 2000 They just recently wore out beyond repair My feet have gotten very sensitive over the years for medical reasons and I wanted to stay with the same type of boot and manufacturer as my last pair These fit wonderful with no problems in comfort Quality made and good looking too 
love my boots These boots are great I purchased them for a trip to Colorado and was a little worried about them fitting loose I just wore a thicker pair of socks and they were so comfortable My feet never got wet or cold in 20 degree weather Not to mention how cute they are even my guy friends complimented how they looked Love them 
great warm boots These were a great deal Very warm and comfortable though zippers are a bit less work to put on 
Grocery Totes Arrived very fast Double stitched in stress areas of handles Looks very sturdy Am happy with the purchase Thank you 
Very nice So far this is the second item I ve ordered from Summit Fashions and I am very pleased with the company They are so quick with their shipping and I even got a discount for my next purchase for a limited time Everything fits fine I m a medium but the skirt is a little tight around the thighs hips Other than that I love this item and I look and feel great wearing it = 
Better than the photo Summit Fashions has great merchandise I ordered this outfit and it fits and looks great I plan to buy from this company again in the future and I urge you to do the same Also Summit Fashions has the greatest customer service EVER 
Firm Control I am very happy with this brief It fits like a second skin Holds my Hernia in very well 
Great product if you get a smaller size I have bought two different sizes of this product I initially bought the large since the size chart says for a 175lb person they should by a large extra large brief Not True That size felt like regular underwear Luckily I tried the Medium size and found it provided much better support and slimming I did not drop a dress size but I definitely look slimmer and neater in my clothes since no rolls and bulges show through They are also very comfortable to wear for extended periods 
Exactly what I was looking for If you are wanting a garment that will cinch you down a few sizes this is NOT for you If you are looking for something that will smooth you out under your clothes and not make you sweat all day this is the PERFECT item for you It does not roll down even after wearing it all day You do not get overheated in it I love it to hold that flabby skin tight After having kids my stomach moves with each step and its very uncomfortable Lipo in a box keeps me all together It really is a superior product as long as you are not expecting it to drop you two dress sizes 
Lipo in a box This is the BEST control brief I have Bought We do not have this in AUSTRALIA and it is just the most comfortable item I wear the control is unreal and with the top going under your bra my roll has gone Can not understand why the first review is so bad I have now bought 5 pair and love all of them THEY ARE THE BEST PRICE COMFORT and CONTROL 
Excellent buy This is an exceptionally well made jacket at an exceptionally low price I get lots of compliments and am more than satisfied 
Perfect Boys Brief My son asks for this particular brief There is no itchy tag and no elastic touching the skin This is the only brief he wants to wear 
Love it This shoes are awesome I really like the style They are very comfortable and easy to wear I live in Alaska and we get all sorts of bad weather but these shoes keep their look no matter how long you have been wearing them Good leather and the blue stripes are really bright 
jackie robinson tee shirt company was fair priced delivered quickly very courteous when i had a question and the items were good quailty have subsequently purchased from them and plan to agai 
Whoa this stuff is great Ok take it from a lady This stuff is heaven I can t get over how great it smells 
Refreshing and totally alternative Just to look the bottle you d think So Whats the difference from all the other designer colognes The difference is that little something that makes the members of the opposite sex physically stop and turn to see who s wearing that spicy fruity aroma Think Cool Water but dreamier then imagine being able to wear it anytime of the day or night Imagine being the subject of an investigation in a shopping que as to who s wearing that smell and having women sniff your neck and compliment you on how nice you smell Jackpot Baby you just stood out from the crowd in one easy step 
Kenneth Cole Briefcases Leather Flap py Gilmore Double Gusset Brief Black Only I have given this brief case to my husband Keith as a Christmas gift He was so happy to receive this present I have given him a Kenneth Cole briefcase in the past with different design which he is still using for the past five years It is an excellent gift for a company executive 
Warm and Toasty While getting ready for a camping trip this September I realized that I did not have any warm thermal underware I have tried the 3 99 Wal Mart specials of those thin white materials but have never had much success with staying warm Therefore I decided to try something different Reading the reviews for this product I immediatly bought the crew neck top and the long john bottoms Wow Warm and Toasty I even used the top as a regular shirt while trapsing around the snowy mountains The only two quibbles I have about this material is one it smells strange almost like plastic and I cannot get rid of that smell and lint balls or whatever you call those balls of material that you need scissors to remove after washing show up everytime the material is cleaned Just wish they made the bottoms in the female style 
amazon review i had seen the shoe s at a major department store but they did not have my size i remebered someone telling me to check the designer s name on the internet and when i did i found the exact shoe at a much smaller price i was totally satisfied with the purchase of my product i will continue to use amazon any time i cannot find a product i am interested in buying at a major store 
work great Just as advertised and just what I wanted I wore these out dancing and had no problems at all 
Good This bra exactly what I am looking for It sticks as it saids even though I had a C size But for those who has sensitive skin should be cautious when chooing it 
Must have for Summer styles I LOVE this It holds up to it s promise It will stay on until you take it off then you just gently hand wash it with some soap and water let it air dry and then it s ready to be worn again 
The Skinny Nice and snug through seat and thigh Perfect slim straight cut leg 1 Spandex gives it a very soft comfortable feel not stiff or rigid Skinny guys not able to find jeans that fit as well as these especially at this price 
Great sweatshirt note on color I bought the Texas sweatshirt + T shirt 2 months ago and love them When the sweatshirt first arrived it was slightly darker more brown than I expected but it s high quality very comfortable and actually I like this color better than what was shown on the website The t shirt s great too Very happy with them 
Great deal on two high quality items Paid 20 for this set awesome deal My 16 year old daughter loves them and she is VERY hard to please with clothes Good quality Didn t tell her I only paid 20 for them naturally 
Wool Peacoat I am very disappointed with this product The quality is extremely poor within a week 2 buttons fell off and 3 are loose The seams on the shoulders and back are crooked as is the hem There are already holes in the pockets The wool is a very poor quality weave that started to pill as soon as I wore it the first time What s worse is I don t even wear this coat every day I can only imagine what it would be like if I wore it on a regular basis This jacket was a waste of money 
Awsome quality peacoat I recieved the jacket quickly and on scedual Product exceeded my expectations and is of supurb quality design Very warm too 
So cute My daughter says They are so beautiful I have the red pair and the golden pair I like them so much I want to kiss them I say They are really spectacular looking 
Great shirt I love the shirt Very well constructed and has a great feel Nice design too Made in Hawaii 
So Much Fun For My 6 Year Old My daughter selected the yellow Disney Cayman They arrived much sooner than we expected and she loved them instantly She said they were very comfortable which I did not really expect I had no experience with these shoes so I was also not expecting them to be so light they really do seem like they would be fun to wear I might get a pair for me as well 
Comfortable and attractive shoe I really like this pair of Vaneli shoes However the stays that are designed to keep the ankle strap lying against the shoe are tiny It is very difficult to get the ends of the straps through them I have only worn the shoes twice because of this difficulty I had to use a pair of tweezers to pull the straps through the stays the second time and it was just too much trouble

Great summer slide I love these shoes the heel is perfect for capris I bought the Champagne and they are perfect with almost anything 
Graet stuff These are incredible I am a big guy and sweat a lot these shirts make you a whole lot more comfortable Great price as well 
Olga Bra Good qulity item arrived as ordered The price and shipping cost were well in line I reccommend Bare Necessities 
perfect fit and perfect price These t shirts are a great price and a great fit too I was able to buy the purple shirt and now its my favorite it was shipped fast and I was thrilled with this product it does not shrink in the wash and the colors dont fade I am back to buy myself another 
Expose Every time I order a pair of Carlos Santana shoes I am like a kid in a candy store about to purchase some sweet treats I have these shoes in Champagne and love them The style the stiletto heel they way they compliment my legs I simply adore his shoes 
wanna smile My 2 year old niece LOVES these shoes She is at that very independant stage and throws a fit every time we try to put her in a shopping cart These are perfect When she walks in a store we always know where she is The best part is that walking in to places everyone looks around to see where the sound is coming from People can t help but smile when they see her squeaking along Beyond being fun these shoes are terrific They have a nice wide toe box and they are easy to put on They are very sturdy and a great value considering many discount stores sell shoes that are higher priced for less quality and that is if you can find the shoes These are absolutely the best combination of good value for the money 
Thank you This was a present for my nephew s birthday He is an avid lacrosse player and though I found it late I thought he would like it better than what I d already purchased for him The shirt arrived on time and it was just as described He loves it 
loved them sent these to my son in michigan and he has not had a chance to wear them a lot but he likes them very muc 
rainbowzzz 11 1 good stuff shipped fairly fast and feel awesome after that initial week of discomfort 
Excelente Zapato Compre dos pares de estos zapatos marron y negro como regalo para mi padre en navidad y puedo decirle que quedo encantados con la comodidad y calidad de los materiales Por eso los recomiendo con 5 estrellas 
Nice I got a good deal on these so I might be biased by that They are extremely well made and just a little bit fashionable looking for a basically conservative style They felt extremely comfortable for new loafers like most loafers on me they pinch a little bit in the arch but less so than almost any others I ve ever bought A good buy 
Straps where they belong Do your bra straps end off your shoulder and halfway down your arm Mine did until I tried this bra and now they stay UP It took a little while to get used to the t back but once you do it s very comfortable I just ordered two more Congratulations Wacoal 
Tidy Whities Rule Great product great service Would definitely buy through Amazon for our Jockeys again 
Jockey Classic Full Rise Brief 6 Pack Underwear 32 White Excellent product very comfortable and an exceptional price 
High Quality Style and Functionality All In One This is not your typical lunch bag for several reasons This bag is very large and accomodating of all your needs male or female It is indeed very roomy and I would classify it as a daybag or travelbag because it isn t as limited as most lunchbags but still great for days at the office For those of you that are troubled by coworkers borrowing your food and drinks from the company refrigerator your troubles will be over with this bag Tons of room to include cooling packs to keep at least a long day s worth of food and drinks chilly The top of the bag has a seperate section that will hold all your other daily needs whether it be reading material including full size magazines you won t have to roll up or to fit in medications keys cell phone PDAs and what have you The other compartments will accomodate you further Conveniently there are compartments where you can keep things hidden so that personal items or valuables don t have to be displayed at any time unless you choose to do so This bag appears to be really well made nothing cheap about it or ill planned The zipper pulls alone tell the story large heavy and solid accomodating for the smaller hand all the way up to very large men s hands The stitching appears to be very well done and not prone to come apart easily The dual handles at the top will allow for carrying with one hand or clip on the adjustable strap for a more hands free tote The thickness of the insulation is more than adequate much thicker than most of the off the shelf type insualted bags it is what you would expect in a premium bag The fabric is quality denier that looks like it will be able to hold up to heavy use and easy to wipe clean like most denier I would not be surprised to see a flight crew carrying this insulated tote as it has the style of simple elegance that you usually see with their carryons suitable for even a daybag phobic male but sleek enough for a woman to feel as though she hasn t just joined a brown bagger construction crew This bag doesn t look out of place in the office or at a worksite the beauty of classic neutral design for the causual person or professional It has enough capacity to work for a picnic bag for several people My mother was eyeing it for use to carry all her copious amounts of makeup on her trip to Vegas with keeping all of it cool in mind That plot didn t succeed it has not yet seen Vegas but nice try mom lol The sticker shock for this bag may seem high if you are used to throw away bags from mass retailers but this is a worthwhile investment for those needing quality and more space Overall value very high and more than worth the money Hey just what the coworkers swipe in a month s time might pay for the whole bag by itself 
Cute sneaker Very comfortable soles great for standing as they stay comfortable for extended lengths of time I have narrow heels and find that the rub a little when walking if my socks are thin but this is a pretty specific problem that I have with most shoes probably not their fault Very comfortable and I get lots of compliments on them 
AWESOME FOR BALLET These handy little things are great if your daughter is in ballet and needs to have a perfect little bun It makes it looks so pretty and perfect with a little hairspray and a pretty ribbon or srunchie it looks great and stays in until you take it out A++++ 
Awesome These are some of the best briefs ive ever worn I highly recomend these and they are sexy to 
Clearly the best push up boxer In the category push up suspensor boxers these are clearly the best They work as advertised lifts and gives you a great profile both in front and in back and in addition they are very comfortable to wear But I have two advices 1 By one size larger than you normally use 2 Buy white or black I bought a mint green pair which turned out to be in a girly light blue color certainly not the color advertised 
Super looking Sandals I love the color combinations of brown and orange I price shopped for months before finding the color and price I wanted I receive compliments everytime I wear them I walk alot at work and kept them on all day Points for comfort 
Very Uplifting This beautiful bra by Chantelle is ideal for the bustier It not only offers good support it is attractive and has strong straps that will ensure good support It comes in a creamy ivory and a beautiful black This bra is good for most women it works well for modest to ample bosom Chantelle products are long recognized for their longevity you can count on 200 300 washings for Chantelle products It is strongly recommended that this bra be washed with a delicate lingerie soap such as Ovacion and never repeat never put in any dryer This bra will last a good long time and provide good support as well as being a darned attractive bra I love it 
Great Product Best show I have ever worn Wear them 14hours day every day Water proof warm in winter cool in summer Best price I have ever found was from Amazon 1 3 off regular price 
Old Faithful No reason to even try a different boot I have had several pair of these over the years and you just can t beat them for comfort and durability They fit perfect right out of the box I got a really good price on these have paid as much as 120 for the same pair in previous years 
Good Boot Overall a good boot The Gor Tex lining is super and the boot itself provides a great deal of stability Comfortable but be prepared for a 50+ mile break in period My only gripe is some irritation against my skin at the top of the boot but it seems to be lessening with break in For the money I paid I d buy again 
nice boots took a while to break in nice after that Too bad they now make them in China used to be made in US 
Sometimes being Radical is a good thing I have 43 years of hiking backpacking and peak bagging experience In recent years I migrated like most people from all leather European style mountain boots to lighter fabric leather combination boots They seemed to work well for a while but two years ago I started experiencing significant pain in my toes instep and heel I concluded that my lightweight boots from a well known outdoor supplier were a contributing factor if not the root of the problem because they didn t provide sufficient torsional side to side rigidity Danner s advertisement for the Terra Force boot support system convinced me to buy the Radical GTX two years ago The first thing I liked about the Radicals was the roomy box toe area that eliminated occasional rubbing problems caused by my prior boots smaller toe box There was also plenty of instep space for my high arch Unlike many boots that now come in a single width the Radical s multiple widths allow a wider fit in the ball of the foot while retaining the snug heel fit that prevents blisters The Terra Force torsional support has not diminished after 250+ miles of hiking Besides day hikes and 2 3 day backpacks I ve used the Radicals with good results on off trail scrambles to summits in the High Sierra and North Cascades occasionally crossing snow steep enough to require an ice axe Despite offering much more support than my prior lightweight boots the Radicals are hardly heavier my size 10 5 EE s weigh 52 ounces Best of all after switching to the Radicals my toe and instep problems ceased almost immediately and my heel problems have gradually diminished substantially all of which I attribute to the superior support of the Terra Force system In my opinion these boots have too many seams and different pieces of leather and fabric but I m not marking down my rating because that s how virtually all lightweight relatively inexpensive boots are made these days 
Love it but I choose 3 6 months size and looks like a 9 months size Is too big 
Cute I think this shirt is adorable I just wish it came in purple too 
Jacket Bought this for a friend s dad who is not a little feller and is outdoors all the time around engines and such Jacket fits well and it was a great buy 
Great Socks Being a plus size woman I have a terrible time finding knee socks that will fit my legs I wear knee socks all winter for warmth here in Western NY I discovered that over the knee socks have a wider top because smaller women wear them up to their thighs and they stay up These socks were so nice when I received the two I ordered I quickly ordered two more pair I only wear them up to my knee but they fit wonderfully and keep me warm all day I bought a pair for my niece who is a tiny thing and she wears them over her knee and they fit her perfect too because while the tops are stretchable they snap right back so thin people can wear them also The price is good too and I received them just days after ordering Great product and a great company 
return policy I thought I had reviewed the return policy prior to my purchase and it stated that I had 30 days to decide When I got the suit it states right on the receipt that there is a 25 restocking fee and that I was resposible for the shipping both ways The suit did not fit and I didn t wear it for what I bought it for It s now just hanging in my closet It was a 60 00 suit It cost 11 00 to ship it to me If I sent it back I would have been paying over half that amount for nothing I won t buy from another company on line that would cost so much for something that might not fit 
Birks are Best I am delighted with my new Birks They are the same excellent quality as any Birkenstocks and cost considerably less Whenever I need new ones every 7 years I will get again get them through Amazon I am on a small fixed income What a deal Thanks 
Birkenstock Milano Birko Flor I managed to ruin my feet into plantar faciitis for a time and these really helped the healing Blessings to Amazon I love you 
Great shoes They look great feel great Very pleased with my purchase Plan on purchasing another color 
Chic AND Comfortable These are great to wear at the gym if you are not doing high impact exercise They look so much better than those big huge clunky sneakers These are not cross trainers but are similar to wrestling shoes and sneakers body builders use I get so many compliments on them I went to the Walking Shoe Company store in my local mall and tried them on first These are not for people who have arch support issues However arch supports do fit nicely Would buy in every color wish I bought more since the price went back up to double 
Great pair of shoes This is a great pair of shoes comfortable cute and casual I get compliments on these all the time 
Outstanding customer service I placed an order with Shoemall and they were out of stock I then gave them a bad review for advertising shoes they were no longer selling The company called my home to apologize for the inconvenience I was really impressed with their customer service and I went ahead and placed 2 more orders The shoes are so comfortable and I got them at a great price This is a top rate company 
Comfy These are great shoes They aren t as supportive as other tsubos I have but they are good enough for a short day on your feet They re cute and hug your feet like slippers There isn t much arch support so if you re looking for arch support try Merrells 
Great Underwear CK has always made the best fitting underwear there is This classic model has been going for ages and I have been wearing it since They are perfect under a suit on sport active conditions etc You can t go wrong with this 100 cotton makes it cool and light for hot days There is a reason why is the most famous underwear in the world And for that price you ll never find anything even close to this 
Comfortable AND Fun I was very surprised by how comfortable these socks were when I first put them on Usually themed socks come with a less than desirable feel but I wear these all the time they are so thick and perfect for wearing with hard uncomfortable shoes 
So Cool These are fun hard to find but they delivered fast can t wait to see what else they offer 
Not very impressed Socks are not comfortable to walk in due to the wire batteries are heavy and only last 6 hrs before you need a new battery for each sock Not very practical 
Princess gloves child The gloves were just as expected and even arrived prior to Christmas after ordering at the last minute I was very pleased with my purchase Thanks 
Couldn t ask for better service or product When they say fast shipping they mean it I have bought a lot off amazon and other sites and I have never actually received and item from the west coast so fast The apron I bought is excellent quality and I would recommend this seller to anyone looking for a high quality item at a great price Will do business with again Thank you 
great product awesome shoes shipping was fast great seller i d definitely buy from them again 
converse shoes I purchased these for my daughter She loves them and I love the very reasonable price that I paid for them 
great for playing the clima lite tec really works i used this shorts at the gym and to play basketball and feel really great and comfortable especially if you sweet a lot i would buy another pair 
worst leg warmers ever These legwarmers don t stand on your legs they slide down to the ankles as you walk They should be called ankle warmers 
great shoes these shoes were everything i hoped for from the picture and more only thing is that you have to wear them a few times to stretch out the straps around the top of your foot b c they are fairly tight and secure but all around great shoe and my boyfriend loves when i wear them 
Cheap Looking It s a waste of money They look so cheap and very bad quality This must be worth like a dollar or less mass produced 
Great buy Couldn t beleive the quality for the price Glad I purchased it Go Gators 
DRAGON FLY UMBRELLA My wife being a dragonfly FANATIC was absolutely enthralled with your beautiful product She was very impressed with the high quality of the fittings of the umbrella absolutely loved the elaborate design on the covering the only problem is she hesitates in taking it out in the rain because she doesn t want to get it wet Thanks again for a beautiful quality product I couldn t recommended it highly enough Regards Steve Clagget 
CUTEST SHOES EVER This is a great shoe They fit pretty true to size they re comfortable for walking and they look adorable too Only thing is I ordered a 9 5 and got a box that said 9 5 with 10s inside However it s a good thing because the 10s fit perfectly I d either order your true size or go up a half size if you re worried 
Comfy for walking not standing If you plan on walking afetr a short breaking these are great but for standing my feet started to hurt after about 45 min 
Great tights I am glad I found these They wear well and wash well They do not last forever but the price is right to buy more and not feel like it is a waste 
Great Slippers wide width misleading The Deerking slippers are wonderful to look at and they are very well made I was really impressed with that part Also it was nice leather that you know will become butter soft Unfortunately I needed a wide shoe a 9 triple E and it wasn t even close to being wide enough so I had to return it So all in all it looks like a great slipper but if you are a wide foot person it may not work 
Deerking Slippers For my money these are the best slippers available I have worn them for many years now They are comfortable attractive and long wearing What elso could you want from a slipper 
good fit My husband normally wears a 4E width These fit him quite well in the 3E and his normal shoe size Very comfortable and look very nice 
Really pumped The shoes are a great fit They arrived in time for Christmas I am very pleased with them 
Pumped The shoes arrived when promised They are very nice but turned out to be too large I will require information on how to return them for a refund 
polo larger than i expected but we will grow into it great colors for spring and summer fast deliver 
good hat I dunno how big the other guy s head is but this beanie is on the larger side for what I m used to and I thought I have a pretty big head It covers well and keeps my head warm nice simple design too 
Great hat for small heads I know I was taking a chance buying a beanie online but it was a great price so I rolled the dice The quality of the beanie is great it looks like it would last for a long time and I really like its looks And I do have a decent sized dome 7 1 2 in fitted hats But this lid fit my one year old son s head better than it does mine It kind of sits on my head like a yarmulke barely covering my giant bald spot So if you re concerned at all about it being too small it probably is If you ve got a smallish noggin this would probably be a sweet beanie 
Cheap Plastic Loops on Straps Break I wear a large cup size This is such a comfortable bra and molds to the bosom so well and minimizes so nicely that it is truly a great pitty the cheap plastic hoops and strap fasteners break apart and ruin the bra so you can t wear it anymore Also for large sizes the bra would be perfect if it had softer straps and a wider band and more rows for hooks in the back This could be one of the world s greatest minimizer bras if Bali the manufacturer upgraded it as stated Unfortunately the life of the bra is too short to make it worthwhile buying because it just falls apart 
bad bra This bra should be called fit to be tied The shoulder straps are too short it runs small there is no lining to the thin nylon fabric and the band slips up every time you move And I am small I am a big fan of the Ice Flowers wire free bra which really fits and stays in place and this bra is no comparison If you re looking for comfort and fit don t buy this bra 
InternetShopper This bra is labeled as Frankly Fabulous but is really the Fit to be Tried bra I have been wearing the Fit to be Tried bra for many years My old ones are getting tattered so I needed some new ones The bra offers good shaping and support My only beef is that one of the three bras I ordered squeaks It looks like they have replaced the metal connectors with plastic pieces and I think the plastic is what is squeaking not sure of that though 
Great Product These pants are very durable The buttons make quick removal when necessary and allow for maximum ventilation 
Please send my exchange when possible The pants were really nice but they were too large for my son I requested an exchange same style color in size medium To date I have NOT received the exchange Could you please look into this for me Thanks Bonnie Cutle 
Great Product These denim bib overalls are very good quality We ve bought them before and will again when needed They are very durable and the color stays quite well even with hard use These overalls are a good product 
Birthday present a success Great product delivered just in time for my boyfriend s birthday Thanks 
well made and good looking I got a pair of these from amazon a while ago They are well made and rugged 
A Sure Fit I bought these shoes to wear at a friend s wedding I danced in them all night and they didn t even hurt I was surprised and pleased to find a dress shoe that was both comfortable and beautiful I ve since bought two other pairs of shoes by Kenneth Cole and I love them I would buy these again 
Attention orthodic wearers These runners are great I wear custom made hard orthodics and the insoles pull out of these shoes and fit full length orthodics and are deep enough to where my heel doesn t slip out of the back of these shoes good for serious runners 
Adorable Headband Cute little accessory for the price My slave boys have purchased Me one in every color Comfortable too no headaches 
Your Baby Will Love This I bought this hat for my little boy and he loved it It s inexpensive but well made I highly recommend it 
Nice simple hat great price This was a great fall hat for our newborn It came in so many cool colors was lightweight but still cozy and fit perfectl 
awesome this hat is super cute and hip good quality and very stylish all of my friends want them for their kids now
