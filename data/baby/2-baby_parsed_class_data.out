2 0 Very cute collection but skip the mobile I registered for the entire Locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it I love the theme but the mobile was a big disappointment It didn t fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available he just couldn t attach it safely and we ended up returning it Also although the mobile matches the theme I found that the colors weren t very stimulating We bought the Tiny Love Symphony In Motion Mobile instead and although the colors didn t match our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it 
2 0 Doesn t fit our crib Alas we have the entire Locomotion set but the cute little mobile won t fit our sleigh style crib I called Babies R Us to see about some sort of conversion kit but there s no such thing I ll be returning it this weekend and getting some crib toys instead 
1 0 dangerous hook broke off and mobile fell on baby We bought this when our baby was born 6 months ago only used it a few times until recently He loves it now to get him to sleep The problem lies in that at 4 am my husband and I awake to hear the mobile playing scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it We go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off causing the mobile to fall on the baby He thought it was the funniest thing in the world he was okay thank God But the little plastic hook piece was in his hand If you have a 6 month old child you know that they eat everything they can find I thank God that he didnt put that in his mouth It is a great soother for the baby but be sure there are no defects every day Like I said before other than this it has been great 
2 0 Mobile wont fit my crib I think the mobile is very cute but there is no way it will fit onto my crib properly I tried attaching it in several differnt places I am going to return it 
1 0 Won t fit my crib I ve contacted the manufacturer for an alternative way to hook to crib They were less than helpful I am thinking about returning the entire set I m so disappointed 
1 0 Smell is very strong I don not like these washes at all The scent is very very overpowering I had to mix only a little of one with another unscented brand and it is still too strong I do love the case though It is sturdy and has lots of room 
1 0 Hope you don t mind NO PRIVACY In order for a cordless monitor to have any privacy you need it to be digital and use digital spread spectrum DSS technology 900 Mhz is the best frequency for a baby monitor though Here s why It is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house that it cannot share the same frequencies at any other 2 4 Ghz devices This includes baby monitors and cordless telephones The correct arrangement should be Baby Monitor 900 Mhz Digital Spread Spectrum DSS WiFi Netowrk 2 4 Ghz Cordless Telephone 5 8 Ghz Digital Spread Spectrum DSS 
2 0 Lots of problems with the receiver We have had nothing but problems with the receiver We have it in our kitchen and it s no more than 30 feet from our son s bedroom Any time we walk near the receiver it beeps from loss of signal The beep is very annoying because it won t stop until you move out of the way If we open the fridge door it beeps also We ve tried all the frequency combinations with no luck It is also very subsceptible to interference and makes loud crackling sounds even at low volume until you change the frequency When it works the sound quality is very good although it is hard to lower the volume enough so at night you are not awakened by your child simply rolling over or babbling in their sleep We recommend the Angelcare Movement Sensor and Monitor by Bebe Sounds The sound quality is great and it comes with a sensor pad that you place under your baby s mattress It senses each time your baby takes a breath If there is no movement it sounds an alarm Great insurance against SIDS 
1 0 Very poor range This monitor is only great if your house is smaller than our Tokyo apartment Although the monitor is sensitive and clear moving the receiver any more than 15 feet away from the transmitter results in intermittent and loud beeps indicating a loss of signal 
2 0 Keep searching We live in a 1 5 story home where the master is the only thing upstairs my husband runs an ISP from home LOTS of computers in the house so we had to find a good monitor that would drown out the static of the electronics outside world but allow us to hear our little pip squeek clearly At first I was thrilled the Sony when I used it downstairs during her daytime napping loved that I could set it to voice activated only hear it when she s reallllly awake But that night when we used it upstairs it kept picking up interferrence in the form of a loud static chirp after several hours of silence even though it was on voice activated mode I tried moving it several times but finally ended up going back to the old FP sounds lights one we had which really wasn t any better AND having to run up down the stairs to try all the combinations of 9 channels on the receiver transmitter of the Sony was a royal pain The next day I went to Target found The First Years Digital 2 4ghz Monitor what a difference It was about the same price as the Sony but it searches for a clear channel like your phone does I was afraid it would interfere with out 2 4ghz phones but after a week no problems we have NO static interferrence It s crystal clear no matter where in the house hubby even took it into the computer room was able to hear her wake up just fine I know everyone s environment is different but the Sony definately didn t work for us 
1 0 NOT A SAFE PRODUCT This product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child Not only does it give additional padding that was not intended nor tested with your safety seat but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat NHTSA National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that after market products should not be used It also does not meet FMVSS213 standards as stated in the manufacturer s description 
1 0 Daughter screamed bloody murder We had to buy a new pack n play because our other one was coming apart I chose this one because of its features and colors My daughter hated this and screamed every time we put her in it We tried for days to get her to use this but she never would So we returned this and got a different that she absolutely loves 
1 0 einstein didn t have a babyplus I wore the baby plus with my first pregnancy I will say our child is a bright out going 8 month old now but in the beginning she WAS colicky and a terrible napper I thought this was a brilliant idea but began to realize that many of the bright gifted children I know didn t have exposure to this system It is loud to wear and not so comfortable You are instructed to wear it an hour at a time and can be quite maddening Good luck if you choose to purchase but just think einstein was fine with out one 
1 0 only 2 months and not working I love this swing because it goes side to side she can sit when awake lay down when asleep and once you put her in she is out cold After 6 weeks of using it I thought the battery was going but when I changed the battery the music was still slow and I still had to keep the swinging motion on high two weeks later it just stopped working I VE ONLY HAD IT FOR TWO MONTHS AND HARDLY USE IT JUST A TOTAL OF 3 HOURS A DAY GIVE OR TAKE A FEW 
1 0 DON T BUY IT Horrible Design Leaking slipping can t use over the kitchen sink Horrible Design 
1 0 Safety Last Leak O Matic Bath Station The Leak O Matic fully lived up to its name As a new parent I don t have time to do things once forget about doing things twice I need simple and reliable the Leak O Matic is neither It worked OK for the first few times then I partially filled the tub and put all the items nearby necessary for bathtime By the time I returned with baby in hand the Leak O Matic had dribbled all over the laundry room counter soaked all my other items on the counter water ran down onto the floor under the baseboard and dripped from the upstairs landing onto the downstairs foyer floor The Leak O Matic is the Hindenburg of all baby bathtubs It is too bad that I cannot give it zero stars There are many people who say that you just have to assemble them correctly but judging from the number of irate mommies here I conclude that it is either too a complicated design or just plain crappy engineering Think about it the number of people with young children who took the time to go online and tell everyone that this thing is a piece of cheese The cups on the feet stick to the countertop so you are unable to positon the tub once it is attached The fabric mesh incline allows the baby to slide down into the water so you re always repositioning the baby I m surprised that this thing didn t come with a built in toaster for added safety I did not research every single item on the registry I figured that if the big stores carried it then it must be at least OK Back it goes If you buy this thing then good luck to you and don t burn the toast 
1 0 DO NOT BUY DANGEROUS FOR BABY BOYS WORST PRODUCT EVER Safety 1st should recall this item if they have any sense at all I d like to smack the so called engineer that designed this infant tub My 10 month old son pinched his little privates so bad it gave him a blood blister Yeah OUCH The stinkin bar that goes between the legs slides in and out of place when the baby moves SNAP It pinches their private part Everything was just fine and then suddenly my son looked at me with such panic and then screamed and cried I realize what had happened and quickly moved the bar OUCH It still makes me grit my teeth when I think about it Horrible product especially for baby boys 
1 0 Doesn t hold water I m not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product My wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory Unfortunately because of the collapsible design this bath tub does not hold water it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together There is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in but it is useless The sling is useful for bathing an infant and the removable ring does it s job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit Unfortunately by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk I guess they call it Safety 1st as your kid can t drown in a dry bath tub 
1 0 What s up with the bump I bought this because I love all the other Fisher Price Aquarium stuff we have But we haven t been thrilled with this tub The hammock can only be used until the baby is 10 lbs if i m remembering correctly well our child was over 9 lbs at birth so she used it like 2 weeks Even so the hammock sags onto this HARD BUMP in the middle of the hammock so the baby s back rests on this bump Never seemed comfortable Then we used it with the hammock attached only at the top like the instructions say but our daughter outgrew the infant side because her butt would slide right over the bump that was supposed to support her but she can t sit up to use the other side There are better tubs out there 
1 0 Aquarium Bath for tiny babies only I am just writing to say that I LOVED this tub until my baby was 2 months and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere Also the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out wet Mommy and Daddy So it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we ll use it when she can sit up but I m thinking we ll just use the big tub when she can sit up 
1 0 1YR Can Remove Tray Table This high chair was great to start but after a while the tray table would come loose on one side during meals I thought it was me at first not latching it correctly but we soon realized it was my 9 month old releasing the clasp Reluctant to change chairs we persevered and now 3 months later she can remove both sides entirely and send the tray and its contents crashing to the floor I am worried that she will either trap her fingers as the tray comes loose or bruise her legs as the tray falls to the ground If you are looking for a chair to last you into toddler hood and your child learns quickly don t buy this one I am looking for a replacement before my daughter hurts herself 
2 0 Not Worth the Money for me I bought this chair because of the great reviews I hesitated at spending so much but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years Pros I like that I can roll it around to the table or to the sink to clean up after meals The height adjustment is easy and convenient The cons Folding it up didn t quite work as I thought it would It didn t lock into the folding postition and didn t really save that much space I would prop it against the wall and hope that no one knocked it down We finally stopped folding it up The toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger by the time he was older I didn t really need them The battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it s been running for a while He did like it but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger My son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher so we don t use that He s 13 months now and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair I washed the seat cover per the instructions and half the time did not use the dryer even though it said it could go into the dryer and now the seat is bubling and cracking I have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son s legs If I had not spent 90 00 on the chair I would not be as disappointed but he s only used it for 7 months

1 0 Good swing but has its problems I received this swing as a gift I really liked that it was more of a cradle swing that the tray was removable in fact I never even put it on and it was great and the fact that it swings side to side like a crade or front and back like a normal swing My baby loved it the music the mobile etc In the early months it was the only place that she would sleep without me so I loved the few moments of sanity that it gave me What I didn t like about it was 1 it uses a zillion batteries if you use the mobile regularly and 2 the speed control was pretty stupid I thought since all the speeds were the same no matter which setting you have the swing on But if you can live with these complaints then this is an awesome swing

1 0 Too little stuff for the money I bought this item for my daughter and it is not worth the money The items are cheap plastic and some are even cardboard This would be a great deal if offered at the dollar store Pass 
1 0 Not a fan We ordered one it didn t work well It seemed great but it was a bear to fold when there was a little bit of wind based on all the reviews we thought we must have had a defective one We ordered a replacement but it seems to have the same issues Very disappointed 
1 0 Good while it lasted I have had this swing a little less than 2 months I bought it for my 5 month old because she wouldn t sit in a traditional swing and I thought this looked like a comfy place to nap It was a lifesaver til a week ago and and the motor burned up I called Fisher Price and the part is on backorder til mid May I guess I just got a lemon because everyone else s seem to be fine I am TRULY disappointed in Fisher Price They usually exceed my expectaions I paid 150 for this and it lasted til the water got hot and thats about it 
2 0 Volo review My almost 3 yr old daughter needed a new umbrella stroller she s tall but still gets tired sometimes especially if I take her shopping I researched the options and picked the Maclaren Volo My first stroller before it was Chicco Capri and it always bumped against my legs which was annoying and uncomfortable When the canopy broke I got rid of it and decided on buying a new one for plane travel and local outings The Volo seemed great light handsome convenient and highly rated by parents I ordered the stroller and upon unpacking it was quite pleased with its appearance I read the instructions and learned to use it The stroller seemed sturdy well made and easy to maneuver not to mention chic The washable seat was a good idea I thought I liked how large it was perfect for an older child and how easily it moved When I took the new Volo around the block I noticed that one of the double back wheels was not aligned properly one was higher than the other and did not rotate which caused the stroller to make a scraping sound Then the other set stopped rotating when one pine needle got stuck in it I had to carefully remove it with my hands in the middle of the street Needless to say that s not the quality I expected since every parent I know raved about Maclaren The canopy kept sliding off the rails as well something you would NOT want at the airport with your toddler and luggage and the car seat in tow When I got home I looked at the wheels closely and tried to adjust them but to no avail They were flimsy I could dent them with my finger if I wanted to way too small and just poorly designed I immediately packed up the stroller and returned it to Amazon I was very disappointed One would think that for such a high price the wheels would be usable after all they are the most important feature of any stroller I will stay with Chicco and order a C6 At least I know that the wheels are great and you can t beat the price 
1 0 extremelydisappointed I usually love The First Years products I already had the fisher price healthy care booster seat and loved it I wanted to leave that one at my parents and have one to travel with so I thought I d try this one I was expecting to love the swing feature it was the one thing I thought was missing out on the fisher price one Well I returned this chair w in 24 hours and bought a second fisher price one Here are the reasons why The base of the chair is hollow and wobbly it is also very wide and didn t comfortably fit across a normal kitchen chair You have to attach the straps yourself when purchased and they are also too wide At their tightest level they were still way too loose to be secure Thought the swing out feature would be great but when the tray swings out and then you wipe baby s hands as you re putting your hands under his pits to lift him off he s already got his hands in the leftover mess on the tray The back of the chair comes off every time you fold it down You have to take the chair apart to adjust the level And when folded up it s not as compact and portable as fisher price s model Do yourself a favor and splurge the extra 5 for the healthy care booster seat 
2 0 Great concept but This seat is a great concept it just doesn t stay together very well I took it back to the store and they marked it as defective For a few dollars more I got the Healthy Care Booster Seat from Fisher Price I ve had much better luck with it 
1 0 My 8 month old son lost his front TOOTH on this item We got this for my son We had it for 2 months When he would get excited and try to Bounce he would end up hitting his head on the hard Toys Last week my son hit the play bar hard enough that he loosened his top front tooth It was the scariest thing that has ever happen to me Nothing is worse than seeing your helpless baby bleeding from the mouth Over the course of a week he was crying and not wanting to eat much He lost the tooth on the 8th days When he hit the play bar it cracked his tooth just below the root Now he will be with out a tooth for 4 6 years Please choose another product for your child It s not worth the risk 
1 0 Unsafe and dangerous I bought this seat for my fifth child She loved it at first but then about the second week we had it the plastic at the top of one of the legs snapped as I was putting her in it Luckily I had not let go of her yet because the whole thing fell apart on the floor The rattle ball also broke off within the first couple of weeks Upon investigation the company only offers a 15 day warranty and that does not cover material failure I will not buy anything else from this company Not only are their products poor they are down right dangerous 
1 0 bad purchase This product just doesn t have much variety My baby s both are completely bored in it and have only used it a handful of times They are 5 months and 1 year She like noise makers and squishy toys but these are all hard boring toys at least to my kids 
2 0 Not well thought out I bought this for my 4month old for Christmas I liked the pretty bright colors and the sounds the foot pad would make she was a little small when I put her in but nothing a thin blanket tucked around her for support wouldn t fix and a pillow under her feet She wasn t heavy enough yet to push the foot pad to make noise all of those things she would grow into though The part I couldn t over look though is how close all the toys were to her head and how hard the toys were She tried to chew on the see saw teething everything goes to the mouth and it was too hard and hurt her gums so crying she jerked her head back and bumped it on the mirror behind her It was a pitiful sight Poor baby I don t know why they didn t allow just a little more tray space and curved that silly bar out more so they wouldn t bump their heads I think a little more thought put into the product and it could be a great toy but as it is now I think it s just a little too rough around the edges I took mine back to the store and then bought an Evenflo she fits in it much better and so far she LOVES it 
2 0 Sleepless nights For all the things we had heard about it being a suffocation hazard at a later age it actually had potential even in the very beginning Our little one actually used to slide down it as the night progressed leaving her in between the wedges by the time she would wake We tried tightening it to her as much as possible and she still scooted down it After a few too many attempts of this we stopped using it altogether Maybe our baby was just too squiggly but honestly I just found it dangerous I think it is a great idea but the product needs some work 
2 0 Didn t work for us Our daughter kept sliding out of it and the wedges wouldn t stay in place I love the idea but it just didn t work for us 
2 0 He slides down every night I got this as my older son 8 had the regular type of wedge THis one doesn t keep my new infant from going from a side position to his back nor does he stay at the same height on it Every night he slides down from his head being towards the top to his head being between the wedges This to me is a tremendous suffocation hazard I was very excited to get this as a gift and had even registered for it but have been very disappointed with it s performance Also the foam lost its bouyancy after less than a month THere s an indentation where I laid my son 
2 0 Doesn t fit my crib I read several of the reviews on this site to choose a new mattress for my babies room I have a great crib from USA baby and I noticed how the first review stated that she didn t buy the super expensive mattress from USA Baby 160 00 which I did for my first baby and it was great It was a super snug fit in the crib and now in her toddler bed it still is a perfect fit I decided that for this baby I didn t want to spend as much for a mattress because it did seem silly HOWEVER this mattress didn t fit snug in my crib nor did it have the firm feel This is a medium quality mattress for a medium price I bought it yesterday and took it back today I am going to go with the expensive mattress that I know fits and is perfect for long term use 
1 0 Poor Durability We received this mattress as a babyshower gift 4 years ago I was registered at Babies R Us My first child used it for a little over 2 years My second child has used it for nearly 2 years Neither child is big in fact one is rather petite Even though the mattress was not abused it cracked and ripped in numerous places I m currently researching the lifetime warranty policies from Kolkraft I don t recommend this mattress 
2 0 tore after only 3 years I bought this mattress 3 years ago for my first child and it already tearing on the tear resistant cover material All she does is sleep on it 
2 0 Not highly recommended We had a really cheap monitor before we bought this one because it was just so noisy so we bought this one thinking it was going to be quieter Well it is ALOT quieter than our monitor but like others said it makes this awful beeping noise It has gone off twice in the middle of the night before We also have another digital phone so it is constantly switching channels as well trying to find an available channel I would look elsewhere for another monitor The beeping is what gets to me I dont like being woke up by a very loud beep in the middle of the night 
1 0 Beware We had the Fisher Proce sound and lights monitor and decided to go digital This was the one we picked in our price range We had it for a few weeks and absolutely loved it until there was some weather changes Every time the weather was not clear the monitor could not find a signal and made a terrible beeping sound Buy the sound a lights for 15 and save the extra money 
1 0 DO NOT BUY This monitor is awful I have had it for 5 months and it has only worked properly for 1 It makes loud beeping noises at the oddest times like 2 am Do not buy this monitor The onlt thing it has going is it is nice looking 
1 0 Can t see how the Mfr thought this was worthy of release After a concerted effort to get this monitor to work acceptably I returned it This is one of the few products I ve had that truly made me ask What were they thinking The monitor gives off a loud out of range beep whenever it s not in good communication and there s no way to shut it off Compound that with the fact that it will intermittently think it s out of range even when it s just in the next room and it is completely unusable when parents are trying to sleep But that s the least of it The voice activated mic clicks loudly in and out when it decides to transmit or not This is annoying but all the moreso because when it decides to transmit seems to have absolutely no correlation to when there is actually sound in the room And finally the transmission is absolutely unintelligible it s marred by a lot of what sounds like digital compression artifacts that garble the sound speech absolutely cannot be understood over this monitor In short in no respect is this a functional product 
1 0 TERRIBLE This is the worst monitor I thought being digital monitor it would be great I was TOTALLY wrong I couldn t even get it to work Don t waste your 
1 0 Save your money This was the worst monitor we have ever had and we have had several with our kids It says the range is 600 feet but it doesn t even reach 200 Our cordless phone reaches twice the distance The light makes it very annoying at night It beeps loudly for no reason and cuts in and out frequently 
1 0 do not buy this monitor makes random beeping sounds so lould that we thought it was the smoke detector We even replaced our smoke detector thinking it was broken only to find it was this stupid monitor Do not but this 
2 0 SO FAR IM MAD OKAY FOR STARTERS I DID LOOK AT THE VARIOUS OTHER REVIEWS AND THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE MY CHANCE IT SEEMED THE GOOD OUTWEIGHED THE BAD UNTIL I BOUGHT IT AND AM TRYING TO INSTALL IT AS WE SPEAK BUT GOT IRRITATED SO AM TAKING A BREAK TO WRITE THIS WHERE TO BEGIN THE LOCKING MECHANISM SEEMS TO BE FINE IF YOU CAN GET IT TO INSTALL IN THE FIRST PLACE HOWEVER THE MANUFACTER ONLY INCLUDES SCREWS FOR WOOD WALLS WHICH MEAN IF YOU DONT HAVE WOOD WALLS YOU HAVE TO GO BUY OTHER SCREWS I HAVE DRYWALL AND THE SCREWS ARE NOT RELIABLE SECOND I BOUGHT THIS GATE WITH THE EXTENSION 24 THE ONLY ONE THERE IS BECAUSE THE TOP OF MY STAIRS MEASURE 44 1 2 INCHES THIS GATE IS SUPPOSED TO FIT THAT WITH THE EXTENSION IT DOESNT I HAVE TRIED FOR OVER AN HOUR TO GET IT TO FIT AND IT DOESNT FIT EVEN WITH THE EXTENSION IT WOULD WITHOUT THE EXTENSION HOWEVER THERE IS ABOUT A 5 INCH GAP FROM THE WALL TO THE BOLTS ON EACH SIDE AND THAT IS WITH THE BOLTS ALL THE WAY UNSCREWED ALSO NEEDLESS TO SAY IF I WANT THIS GATE TO WORK I HAVE TO GO TO MY LOCAL HARDWARE STORE AND BUY NEW HARDWARE SO THIS WILL MOUNT SECURLY OR I HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE STORE AND FIND SOMETHING ELSE UNLESS I CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE IT FIT HOW IT IS THIS GATE HAS BEEN A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MY MONEY THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 2 STARS IS BECAUSE IM SURE IT WOULD BE JUST FINE IF I HAD WOOD WALLS AND IT FIT TO WHERE I CAN INSTALL IT NOW I HAVE HOLES IN MY WALL AND CONFUSSION TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT FIT IF ITS AT ALL POSSIBLE DOESNT LOOK LIKE IT IS THOUGH 
2 0 Bravado bras are better I agree with Rebecca Bravados are more simple more flexible and more comfortable 
2 0 not useful once baby arrived I got this bra when I was pregnant and wore it confortable until my delivery After my delivery the bra was too small With the engorged breast after delivery and just carrying mature milk afterwards it is just too small I wasn t told that my breast would get even larger after delivery I thought they were big just before delivery I decided to go w bravado bra It has worked out much better It is comfortable to wear day and night And as the milk comes in and out it is comfortable either way The sizes are more flexable then medela The strap support is better then medela I have packed up the medela bras and will just use them during pregnancy if i have another No use for them when i am not pregnant or for breastfeeding And breastfeeding is their main purpose 
2 0 Medela Nursing Bra This bra is very comfortable once on Getting the bra on however is not always as comfortable since it goes over the head It rolls together and is hard to get adjusted correctly over your body As far as function it is not easy to resnap one handed which with a baby is all you usually have to work with The star rating is only for comfort 0 stars for function 
2 0 Reasonably priced but needs improvement I like the idea of all this in one case and it s hard to complain at this price but some of these things would be better bought separately We ve either traded up or found a substitute for most of the things in here Here s what I found Item 1 The case is fine but things do fall out all the time 2 I haven t used the tweezers yet but the magnifying part sounds nice 3 The nail clippers were WAY TOO SHARP We cut my daughter s skin more than once but one was serious enough that we considered a hospital trip Now we use my regular clippers and I haven t gotten her skin since The soft grip thing actually make them slide around more so it was tougher to cut where you wanted to Trust me it s easy to clip skin on fingers that little 4 7 The emery boards are very handy but any emery boards would work 8 We got a different thermometer this one was too slow Faster ones are more expensive but they re worth it for a sick squirmy baby 9 I haven t used the medicine dropper but the one time she did need one I actually asked at the pharmacy desk at a grocery store and they gave me one for free then later I found out we had this one 10 11 The brush and comb are nice I m sure they can be purchased separately from the kit for less 12 My daughter s only 7 months old and has no need for a toothbrush for awhile since there are no teeth and even when there are I believe you wipe them with gauze not a toothbrush for awhile Basically although this kit had tons of things that could be helpful and it wasn t very expensive we have either gotten an upgrade on the things we use thermometer or have found other things that would work just as well regular nail clippers free medicine dropper I m certainly not saying that you shouldn t get one because I d hate to say that and then have you find that you needed it If you get it for a shower gift great if not you can find substitute items just as easily 
2 0 Be practical I have seen this product and others similar to it As an RN we encouraged prospective parents to refrain from being drawn in by the cuteness of items that are geared only to be sold not to be useful Although each category of item in this kit is certainly useful and some essential it is far better to spend your money on the items purchased separately In this way you can check for quality and longevity Put together your own kit 
2 0 Averge Products Poor Casing This was given to me as a gift and although I have used it it would not be my first choice in infant care The nail clippers are mediocre at best I understand they shouldn t be sharp for an infant but I have to exert tremendous pressure just to clip my son s nails The syringe is too hard of a push to administer medicine and the tweazers couldn t pull a hair out of my head they have absolutely no grip I have never used the brush comb or toothbrush I have others but they do make for good entertainment when diapering The case is cumbersome and of poor design Everytime I open it everything falls out 
1 0 Have to agree with overall opinon I have small hands so I actually can t grip this product with one hand It slips right out because there is no hole The items are okay really don t like the nail cutters though and they don t stay in there places I m sure there are better kits out there 
2 0 Sounds good but not really The nail clippers hairbrush and comb are great but I did not care for the rest It would be cost effective to buy the items seperately from this company 
2 0 Useless Nail Clipper The thing you are likely to use most is the nail clipper But it is very blunt And the special cover on the clipper makes cutting the nails impossible unless baby s nail is very very long If I wait until the nails are long enough to cut by this thing my 3 month old would have scratched his face and head I end up buying a new baby nail clipper with a big handle and magnifying glass from nearby pharmacy That worked much better 
2 0 NOT WORTH IT THIS ITEM IS TOO SMALL I KEPT PUTTING IT ON THE BACK WINDSHIELD BUT IT KEPT FALLING DOWN EACH TIME I COULD NOT SEE MY BABY IN THIS TINY MIRROR NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL 
1 0 Shipping issues I will never order an item like this again as it came destroyed They need to repackage items like this for shipping It it the second and the last item of this type I will order online The other was a bassinet and it also arrived broken with the box destroyed I have complained before but never get a response too bad too as I like Amazon 
2 0 Fits Large Opening but Cheaply Made This was the only gate on the market that I could find that would fit the 12 foot doorway between my livingroom and dining area It stated easy to install but when the screws kept breaking off inside my new woodwork and I kept having to redrill holes I was a bit angry I suggest predrilling your holes The hinges also won t stay on and the swinging gate doesn t line up You need 2 hands to close the gate which as a busy mom of 5 children you don t always have 2 hands free By the end of installing this gate it was about to be throw out 
1 0 Don t waste your money I bought this to puree my 6 month old daughter s homemade baby foods You put the blade at the bottom of the cup load the food in then put a protective plate and finally put the top piece which contains the motor on top The concept seemed good and it is a compact size CONS 1 The cup holds less than 1 cup of food if you go over that amount any liquids in the food start to splatter through and make a mess and sometimes causes the motor to stop running guess it shorts it out and I have to wait until it dries out before I can start again If you re trying to make enough to freez cubes of food you ll have to puree several batches 2 You can only run the motor for short periods of time up to 20 seconds max or something like that for some foods This is fine for soft foods but if trying to puree meats for example it sometimes takes longer than that and it becomes a hassle having to grind wait grind wait 3 the motor that powers the blade is way too slow cooked chicken or beef ends up being too lumpy since you really need a faster blade to puree them I ve found that the for pureering baby foods the best thing to use is a blender since the blade speed is much faster and the design helps to draw foods down to the bottom so things can get more evenly pureed Don t waste your money on buying this 
2 0 No No for this one This product was a big disappointment for us Our baby was always covered in sweat after sleeping on the polyster based sheet He was most uncomfortable in his sleep and his back would be wet with sweat Definetly not recommend this one 
2 0 Reviewed for quality not yet function Before I even had the opportunity to use this product it has disappointed me I have washed this item per the manufacturer s instructions The bottom pad came out of the drier all pilled I wonder how many more washings this pad can stand Truly a disappointment 
2 0 good in theory This is one of those products that is good in theory but not in practice I thought OOh what a nifty idea a head bumper The whole idea was great BUT if your baby is a wiggle worm like mine then the head bumper guard is a waste I actually found this item to be more of a hazard than anything Because my son wiggles while he sleeps he ended up with his arm stuck under the side guards wrapped in a semicircle around the bumpers Don t ask me how he did this The good thing was that if he wet through his diaper the pad underneath absorbed the urine Other than that it was a hassle to keep in the crib 
1 0 Would not buy again Looked nice at the store Thought the adjustable head rest was a nice touch until we got home and tried to use it The head rest will not stay stuck down on the mat the velcro is not strong enough I would not buy this product again 
1 0 sent me wrong extension to elongated kidco gate I ordered a KidCo Elongated child gate A recommended extension needed to be purchased The wrong extension was sent I needed G24 model and received 24 extension for a different model 
2 0 Looks great doesn t work good I thought Tiny love products were good so I bought this The first one I received had the water leaking out The second one doesn t make bubbles and after a few days the music already sounds like the battery is dying My baby seems to like it but it does not live up to what it advertises 
2 0 Good concept but doesn t work well at all I like the music but we have to have it on auto to play Because I have a mirror in the seat to see my son he is still backward facing I can t move the seal up farther so that he can reach the part to kick and make the item turn on Also I have never been able to create bubbles like the instructions claim So just music plays There are plenty of other smaller items that can do that This thing also eats up batteries like you wouldn t believe I am changing them every couple of days and we aren t in the car much What a disappointment Good concept but doesn t work well at all 
1 0 Where is the key that s in the photo Frustration is how I sum up my experience with this product On the front cover and with the directions on the back there is a photo of a key that locks and unlocks the magnetic lock However after opening the packaging there was no key There were four locks alright And lots of little screws in case you felt like screwing the lock in despite the product s claim to be the only child lock that doesn t require tools With how the packaging is designed I don t even think there s room for the key Which makes me wonder do you have to buy the key separately I m returning this product and am bitterly disappointed for the wasted time and energy 
1 0 Snack Spreaders If your baby has fingers or teeth this is NOT a trap They can easily take the lid off and scatter snacks about with glee 
2 0 Great idea poor execution For the first couple of weeks the Snack Trap worked perfectly After that my daughter 7 months old figured out how to remove the top it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware but easily removed and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping throwing or shaking the snacks all around the house On the positive side the flaps for the top are very soft and when she does reach in there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers If only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on then this would work perfectly As it is my daughter loves it but we hate cleaning up the mess 
1 0 loved the idea hated the product It worked great the first time my 14 month old son used it but the second time he figured out how to take the lid off and spilled his Cheerios everywhere I tried it a few more times after that and got same result The lid is WAY too easy to remove 
2 0 Did not work for us We are training and really were looking for a useful aid It didn t work for us allowing the entire car seat and straps to become saturated We will continue to use it with our younger child IN HOPES of avoiding a diaper leak through accident 
1 0 Do not bother with this I bought two for my kids seats They constantly bunch up and slip around Now I have to lose money in shipping to send them back for a refund Don t bother with these Just fold up a towel It will be cheaper and just as convenient as these things 
1 0 USELESS This product is absolutely useless Save your money The first problem with this product is that the area that is supposed to fit over the buckle part of the car seat carrier simply does not fit over it In addition there s no way to attach it to the carrier stroller or whatever So when you try to put your child into wherever you wish to use it all it does is slide around So it s more hassle trying to use it every time than just dealing with the occasional blowout 
1 0 You can not return I ordered this item based on the great rating it got yet when I received it I was unimpressed and found the size measurements to be wrong I ordered a medium based on the manufacturer s notes yet when received found I needed a longer one After researching how to return since it came with no information on this I found out you can not return this product from this store I wanted to warn everyone before they purchase 
2 0 Can t use on Crib or Toddler bed I purchased this rail today for my daughter s crib that converts into a toddler bed Everything on the outside of the box looked great until we got home put it together and put it on the crib There is only about 6 inches of space for my daughter to climb in and out of bed Also it sits in about 3 inches which significantly reduces the amount of sleep space After playing with it for awhile I decided to look over the instructions again It states in the warning section that this rail is only for a bed with a box spring and mattress and is not intended for a crib or toddler bed My question is WHY DIDN T IT SAY THIS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX 
1 0 This bed rail sucks I don t care what other reviewers say but this bed rail sucked I used it on my sons toddler bed since it seemed to be the only product that would accomodate that type of bed It took up so much mattress space that my son barely had room to sleep in his bed And it would constantly come unlocked And if I buy another bed rail for our next child it won t be a mesh one cause they get too dirty I can t remember if this cover was removable or not if it was I m sure it would have been a pain in the a to remove 
1 0 Broke within weeks We bought this bedrail for a vacation home and thought it was great at first I realized I didn t like it sticking out so far from the bed when it was folded down but could live with it The second weekend we used it my 2 year old and his cousin also 2 were climbing into the bed by stepping on the bedrail because it stuck out so far and the side popped out of position never to go back in As far as I am concerned this product needs to be rethought by the manufacturer There should be some way to fix it when it pops out Definitely would not reccommend it To make matters worse Babies R Us would not return it becuase we no longer had a reciept 
1 0 not that great If you have an infant that enjoys mental stimulation this item is not for you Since she was brought home my daughter has enjoyed looking about and being held so she can see all around her She was bored to tears literally every time we put her in the lounger the baby faces the ceiling not too exciting I thought it was a cool concept however my daughter did not She did much better in her papasan or bouncy seat where she could nap if she wanted to but have the option to look around and play as well Looking up at the ceiling was not fun for my daughter 
1 0 Disappointed I received this sheet and was immediately disappointed The quality is very cheap and it wasn t a perfect fit I am surprised that this is made by Graco usually their products are good I would not recommend buying this I would buy a regular crib sheet instead 
1 0 Buy this instead This sheet is cheap ugly and scratchy Instead buy a portable crib sheet they fit perfectly and are available in lots of colors They are softer and more durable 
1 0 Expectant 1st time Grandmommy Just a note to thank all of the parents who take the time to post their opinions I find the customer reviews a tremendous help when trying to make decisions on grandma needs I also advised my pregnant daughter to check them out before making a final decision on anything Thanks to all of you again 
1 0 These are some really cheap sheets I don t have an abundance of money but I would definitely pay double if the quality of the sheets was better I don t even want to know what the thread count is on these sheets From what I understand these are the only sheets that fit the thing so I guess I m just out of luck Hope to see an alternative to these sheets real soon 
1 0 Why bother Why bother with a boppy cover when it does nothing to protect the boppy from spit ups and poop accidents It s not practical to throw the boppy in the was each time this happens I can only imagine how stinky this boppy will soon get 
1 0 It never worked The product says that around 20 weeks you should be able to hear the baby s heartbeat Well I m 30 weeks now and I still can t hear the baby s heartbeat while using it It was a total waste of money 
1 0 hate this thing doesn t dry your bottles at all It leave a condensation and doesn t dry completely I give it one star for all the stuff it holds but water leaks out so you have to put something underneath it 
2 0 Breaks easily We bought this item because we could not find what we were looking for anywhere else We had it about 3 weeks and the piece that holds the nipples caps broke off and now everytime we go to set bottles on it we have to attach it back on Not very durable 
1 0 Big Design Flaw Cloth Diaperers Beware I researched many car seats and settled on this one Safe and cute But it has a major flaw The strap that comes up between the legs is too close to the back of the seat My daughter only five months old was already almost sitting on the belt where it comes out This mean that the buckle was way too low and tight forcing the belts to cut into her chunky thighs and pushing uncomfortably on her pubic bone I asked around online on some forums and found many other mothers who returned this seat for the same reasons Many mothers didn t find it a problem until their child was at least 20 lbs but it was a problem for me already because we use cloth diapers so my baby s butt is bigger due to the padding This car seat wouldn t work well if your child is chunky or uses cloth diapers and even otherwise I can t see how it would work for a child over 25 lbs or so The Britax Roundabout has the croth belt at a different location a few inches further out from the back of the seat so it is the one I am getting as a replacement 
1 0 Returned this product Save your if you plan to run with this on a jogging stroller On a mild windy day it flips up towards you and off to the side I didn t think it really shielded my baby from the sun like I thought it was going to either I would not recommend this product It s very cumbersome When I returned it to the store there were two others on the counter behind the customer service cashier that had just been returned recently 
1 0 Don t Bother Pay More for Something that Works I read the reviews for this and decided despite some negative comments to give it a try since it was so cheap at first I was impressed with this shade because it attached quite easily to my stroller and actually provided shade to my baby although not as much as it looks like it would his legs were never protected from the sun even though it looked liked they would be because the shade is so big My stroller is a pretty typical stroller nothing special or comlpicated about it But yes it did flip up in the wind or even a small breeze very easily and i had to weigh it down which didn t really work because it is so flimsy After about 2 weeks it lost its shape completely and the front of it flipped up and no longer provided coverage AT ALL Piece of junk 
1 0 A waste of money Too big and bulky to sit easily on top of the canopy It may be my stroller Maclaren quest that it the issue but I wish I never bought this product My baby hates it too because she can t see where we re walking to 
2 0 too light weight I love this product in the fleece but this is so light weight It defeats the purpose 
1 0 Absolutely NOT recommended We should have been much more careful and read other customers negative reviews on this crib mattress pad before purchasing three of them eventually cancelled one We would not recommend this item After only one wash despite having followed the laundry instruction it shrank so much that it became impossible to fit our standard crib When I tried to stretch the sides around the mattress they tore 
1 0 Doesn t Fit Standard Crib Mattress I would not recommend this crib mattress pad I followed the washing instructions prior to first use and the pad would not fit on the mattress When I tried to stretch the sides around the mattress they tore Luckily Amazon took it back 
2 0 Too small I loved this mattress pad when I first opened it it s made of soft natural cotton and offers a nice cushion for baby However after washing it I found it s too small for the crib mattress which is a standard size I think they just skimped on material or didn t pre wash It s a good 2 inches too short It doesn t have much stretch to it so I m afraid I won t be able to use it all Very disappointing 
1 0 NOT BIG ENOUGH I bought this item despite the review that said it was too small Big mistake It is small It s not big enough for my 21 months old I m very dissapointed because I liked the infant version 
1 0 definitely too small Well I just tried the Bundle Me toddler size with my 20 month old in our jog stroller for the first time today and I am disappointed because it is definitely already too small He really can t sit in the bag unless his legs are bent which he hates Plus when I have the bag pulled as far down as possible in the stroller the only way I can get him in at all then it only zips to just above his waist definitely not high enough to really get warm and snuggly I ll keep the bag for baby 2 but I m really disappointed I can t use it with my not quite 2 year old 
1 0 Poorly constructed Tried this and the zippering was poorly constructed Ihave a product from Nano Bags that beats this one in construction and comfort This was nice only received as a gift but nothing more Washed poorly disappointed 
1 0 Buy something else The Tubbly Bath Dispenser fit our spout just fine but minutes later it would work itself off We tried everything to get it to work with no luck Fortunately the company that sells it agreed to let us return it weeks later without a receipt or packaging Don t even try it it s not worth it Look for something else There are other faucet covers out there 
2 0 good idea but pinches Pinched my daughter s tush even though it was opened all the way it bent as she was getting on She never went near it again Have to be very careful as child is sitting down 
1 0 careful I Bought this product for my 3yr old At first I thought it would help her go to the bathroom when we went out but when she sits on the seat she has been pinched a few times At first she didn t want to sit on it again amp she cried when I took her to the bathroom but I told her I would sit her on it amp I would lift her off Since I have been doing this she hasn t been pinched but it took me a while for her to trust me If you buy this product you have to be very careful or your child will get pinched 
1 0 WARNING This seat is very dangerous and set my daughter s potty training back months The seat folded and fell into the toilet while she was sitting on it Thank goodness I was still holding her She did get pinched and was afraid to sit on the toilet for a few months after Potty training is stressful enough on a child without a defective product making it worse The only reason I gave it a star is there is not a way to save the review with out one 
1 0 Not worth it for us I just logged in to see this item s price so that I could price ours for the consignment sale Neither of my girls was crazy about tummy time and this didn t help that at all 
2 0 It fails because of buggy electronics Sometimes it works ok Sometimes it stops swinging for no reason sometimes turning on the mobile will instead turn on the music it always makes a gringing noise when swinging if it worked like it should it would be a great product i like the stars projected below when they work 
2 0 Swing works fine but mobile lights and music stopped working just after two days When I ordered this product I was hoping that my baby girl will enjoy it I was so excited when my baby likes to spend time in it This happiness only lasted two days before the mobile lights and music stopped working I am a little bit concerned about the quality of this product I have to return the swing and consider another type of swing for my baby 
1 0 Not a lot of quality for 159 99 For the price of this cradle swing I d hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than I got First the stand seemed a little wobbly you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they don t lock into an optimal position Even worse however is that after less than two days of use the lights sound and mobile stopped working Calls to customer service were a complete waste of time and I ended up returning the item While the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable I d have to recommend purchasing a less expensive Papasan cradle swing 
1 0 bob the i cant fix this i got this toy for my brother who is 4 The buttons were hard to press the stickers didnt stick it used many batteries and it makes noise i guess its supposed to talk but all i hear come out if muffly speaking like a bad radio signal Save ur money buy something else 
1 0 Way too difficult to be portable and poor sleeping surface I though it was just me but after reading several other reviews I see that others agree on just how difficult this thing is to assemble disassemble The locks are impossible the items do not quite fit right and it would be impossible to get this thing into its travel bag The mattress is thin and very lumpy each fold in this mattress causes hard lumps I bought this product thinking I could use it as a portable play yard after my baby out grows the co sleeper aspect but there is no way I recommend you avoid this product 
2 0 Terrible to assemble After my husband and I put this together using the TERRIBLE directions we ve been using this as a free standing bassinet for the past 5 months not attached to the bed as some people do My daughter has been sleeping in it just fine However we attempted to fold it up to take it with us on a weekend away from home recently What a nightmare to collapse Again the directions are of absolutely no help It was impossible to get the whole thing into the carrying case and get it zipped up Also this thing weighs a ton I now realize I need to buy something else to use when travelling How annoying Bottom line if you re going to set this up and never take it down it s fine once you initially get it put together that is However if you think you d like to use this on an occasional overnight trip away from home forget it 
2 0 Maybe yes maybe no I have a 3 and 4 year old and this device did little to deter or prevent them from raiding the fridge while their mom and I were asleep A couple of good hard yanks by your child and this device fails This might me a good product for infants and toddlers but if your child is over 2 years old try something else like the Lock Release Fridge Latch by Safety 1st but be aware that even though these are by far superior you ll still have to place about 3 of these Safety 1st latches on your fridge door to keep the little ones from defeating them That s what worked for us anyway I ll be so glad when they grow out of this fridge fascination 
1 0 Medela needs to come up w something else I think that I ve tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them These were just about the worst My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day I went through ALOT of bags I use bottles now and these were a pain They were small thin punctured easily and those twist ties although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept were just a pain in the butt I love Medela s pumps I own the Pump in Style Advanced a seperate manual pump and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months I like their storage bottles I even like their nipple cream but these bags need some more work put into them 
2 0 leaks I do not like these bags The twist tie closure system is cumbersome The bags are small The plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen The only advantage I can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly 
1 0 Absolute Mess If you are looking to make a mess lose milk and get frustrated these are the bags for you First these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag You have to string the twist tie into each bag by yourself Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out It s not that easy The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk This never happened with the other bags on the market My favorite is lansinoh Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others Pass on this and try others 
1 0 Bags Leak These bags leaked for me from both the top and the bottom The fold down mechanism is very cumbersome especially because the plastic is very stiff I lost three bags of milk due to leaks If you have to transport the bags anywhere like back and forth to work like I do I would avoid these bags They just leaked all over the place for me even after I carefully re sealed each one exactly according to the package instructions I would recommend the Lanisoh bags over these 
2 0 Too cumbersome The idea behind these bags is great you can pump straight into the bag and store them The execution however is lousy Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal Even though you can t pump straight into them sealing them is quick and easy 
2 0 Prefer Lansinoh I registered for and received these Medela bags After using all 50 I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase Wow I will never go back to Medela The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don t leak Well this is the only good feature The Lansinoh bag is strong as well easy to close DOUBLE zip lock Vs Medela s bothersome twisty ties easy to get the air out unlike Medela s and the Lansinoh s take up WAY less room in the freezer Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape and thawing will be difficult because I can see I ll need to watch that the milk doesn t spill out the top With Lansinoh I won t have to worry about that My medela bags haven t split in the freezer I ll give them that But neither has my Lansinoh bag 
1 0 Gerber Vs Medela I vote Gerber I ve tried lots of storage bags and by far the Medela ranks the lowest These spill you have to store them upright in the freezer and if your freezer is as compact as mine with food to feed five people storing milk upright is just too hard to do These bags do NOT have a ziplock seal on them which means that they are leaky and unreliable if you are in a hurry like if you have more than one kid and you work Buy the Gerber or the Lansinoh bags with the zip seals on them They can both be stored flat for more convenience and they can stand on their own Pumping into a bag is fine if you are someone who wants to fumble with attaching it to the pump the Medela bags or you can use your Medela pump with your reliable pump kit and pour your milk into a Gerber or Lansinoh storage bag for ease I use the Medela Lactina Plus and I find that this method works the best for me Simple clean and easy 
1 0 Terrible storage bags I love my Medela Pump In Style but their breastmilk storage bags are awful The twist tie closure is complicated They also spill milk easily when pouring into a bottle after thawing I recommend the Lansinoh bags They have an easy to use double zip closure to ensure that the milk will stay fresh and it s very easy to get the air out of the bag before closing You can also lay them flat to freeze so they won t take up much space in the freezer They pour great no spills 
2 0 I did not like it Well the fact that it is a leash was really not the problem cause I mean when you buy it you already know that LOL My daughter would have more tantrums wearing it than not Every time I would put it on her she would scream and beg me not to put it on It was really heartbreaking On the plus side this item really taught my daughter to walk next to me and listen to me LOL We used it a couple of time and put it aside She really hated it and I felt that it caused more tention than it is worth 
1 0 FELL APART _ _ Didn t even get to use it I didn t even get to use this pad It fell apart in the washer the first time I washed it The vinyl in the back ripped to shreds on the delicate cycle What s up with that What good is it to have a mattress pad that you can t wash TOtal waste of money I am taking it back today 
2 0 Changed merchandise Unfortunately you are correct these are not the same Premium Heavyweight Cloth Diapers that used to come from Gerber When I called the company I use these cloth diapers in my business to ask they told me this was the same product It is not They quilt and wrinkle after one washing and just don t hold up their shape in general Amazon needs to update their site because the packaging has changed as well I miss the old diapers 
1 0 What is pictured here is NOT what you get The item pictured and described is not the item you will recieve I ordered 4 pakcages of these diaper service diapers and got a completley different diaper These are thicker better quality and have blue stitching and Gerber stamp on them that distinquish them to be the diaper service diapers The diapers I got were thinner plain white and had no stamp Buyer beware You will not get what you see in this current photo 
1 0 Best diaper you can buy in a store I started using these for cloth diapering with my first child They hold plenty and have held up pretty well the ones I havn t bleeched are still going strong after 6 years These aren t as great as Chinese Prefolds but then again they are a little bit cheaper trimmer and you can get them when you need them rather than having to wait a week for them to arrive in the mail these are the best diapers sold in stores 
1 0 NOT WORTH THE MONEY After trying almost every bottle I tried these and waht a nightmare There are to many parts to clean and they leak I called Dr Brown s customer service line and they were on the defense and said you can not shake the formula to mix it you have to stir it As most people who use powder formula know this is not an option as just stiring very slowly as they say does not mix the formula I saw no difference using these other than they leak and a pian to clean and have to use a special brush to clean them I went with the Playtex Natural Disposables and never looked back 
1 0 Skeptical and there are problems too We used these bottles for three weeks and we are very skeptical that they actually work as well as they are supposed to There are some additional drawbacks as well 1 These leak in travel Twice we ve gone to the park with 7oz and arrived with 4 and a mess in the bag 2 We see no difference in reducing gas And while these are designed to take gas away from the collar on what about all the air in the nipple where the air first enters Is this a gimmic 3 The flow is too fast We went from bottles with smaller holes and less flow to these which are far too fast for an infant 
2 0 disappointing I thought this product would be helpful for sleeping since it was recommended from a friend However it doesn t work for me I took it out of the box and it was just in a plastic bag After trying it for 5 minutes I decided that I didn t like it and tried to return it The company would only issue store credit because I opened it What a rip off 
2 0 Had to return swing My baby absolutely loves her regular swing so we thought this would be a great travel swing She cried everytime we put her in it It really does not provide a full swing motion She tends to like her swing on the highest setting and this swing barely moved in either direction 
1 0 Did not like this swing I tried Fisher Price s Take Along Jungle Swing then this Open Travel Swing In both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat The Jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it didn t stay closed well and the palm tree was always in the way Finally I bought the Fisher Price Aquarium Swing I found the seat of the Aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place so it won t fold over on baby and it is easier to assemble and haul around 
1 0 don t buy this I got this swing And I will be talking it back I put it on 5 and It will not move I don t know what it would be like with the baby in it I just tryed it 
2 0 Well it s small The size of this swing is about all it has going for it and it is far from the best swing out there I put the swing on the 5th speed and it barely moves so much for the other 4 speeds My daughter is starting to explore her surroundings and get into things which brings me to what I hate most about this swing My daughter pulls herself into a straight up sitting position by holding onto the bars and stops the swing looking like she is going to fall out I just pray that buckle is secure She also likes to get her head trapped in between the legs and the swing bars to where her head is hitting the bars So I don t like leaving her in the room by herself when she is in this swing If you don t like to get house work done or take showers this swing might be for you 
2 0 Does not last long We bought this about 6 weeks ago and it has already stopped beeping when the nipple is sterlised or milk is warm Now the markings on its measuring cup is coming off Basically I believe Minchkin has cut corners with poor quality product Not recommended at all I would prefer some other brand 
1 0 This thing is horrid I m currently in the process of adopting my son and I bought this to take to Guatemala with me when I visited It never worked it didn t matter how much water I put in the chamber it would never cycle on more more than 30 seconds I then had to wait approximately 5 minutes for it to cool back down before using it for another 30 second cycle I ended up filling the ice bucket with hot water and letting the bottle sit in that to warm up Needless to say it s been sent back I think I ll just use the microwave when the baby gets home it s got to be easier and quicker than this thing 
1 0 Will wake your baby up when it s done The warmer made such a loud beep when it completed its task that it woke our baby up So much so that we ended up staying near it to shut it off before it went beeping Had to also physically pull out the power cord after each use as it had no auto shut off 
2 0 Great for just 1 and half years until it started folding up while in use This stroller was great for a year and a half My only complaint until now was the sunshade it doesnt block much sun when up and falls off when down and seems to always catch on things when folded but I could deal with that for how light and easy this stroller is It s easy to steer one handed when needed and folds down very compact However now I am suddenly having problems with it folding while in use It does it with both my 2 5 year old and my 9 month old so its not related to weight Every time it s happened I have been right there so there have been no injuries but I am leary to put my children in it now I contacted Chicco and was told Sorry you are out of warranty Their products carry a 1 year warranty and I purchased mine a year and a half ago I only gave 2 stars because it was 4 or 5 star worthy until it started folding on its own otherwise I would try to give it no stars Every Mom wants to feel that their child is safe and I am now uneasy about the safety of this stroller 
1 0 Did not like this swing I tried this swing then this Fisher Price s Open Travel Swing In both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat The Jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it didn t stay closed well and the palm tree was always in the way Finally I bought the Fisher Price Aquarium Swing I found the seat of the Aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place so it won t fold over on baby and it is easier to assemble and haul around 
1 0 Do not purchase this swing I purchased this swing because we wanted something to take back and forth to our parents house Though I am VERY sorry I purchased it When you place the baby in the swing the seat lays almost flat horizontal with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position Very weird While it swings I am afraid my daughter could end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor Also there is no head support On the box it says that it is age appropriate from birth to 25lbs THIS IS NOT the case My daughter is only 4 months old and she can hold her head but not too great yet and there is NO HEAD support with this swing My daughter ends up leaning way over to one side of the swing it doesn t seem to have the support that other swings have I have another swing the head support and positioning of the way the swing sits is MUCH BETTER To add the mobile is horrible It s really pitiful and hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market The entire swing has a poor design to it 
2 0 Taking it back I purchased this swing because we were out of town and it was much needed We have the full sized Papasan swing and the travel Ocean Wonders swings at home which in retrospect we were wishing we brought with us While neither of those are 100 perfect they are much better than this one The open frame allows the child to kick the swing frame stop the swing from moving and potentially get their feet legs stuck in between the bars ALso the swing seat almost lays horizontal with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position while swinging to the point that I am afraid if my daughter would wiggle a bit she would end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor Lastly the mobile is horrible It s pitiful and I find it hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market It s a plastic leaf that has little notches for two toys on strings The strings have a not on the end of them and you slide it into the notches These toys remain on the notches for approximately 3 seconds It s a very poor design and needs a LOT of work And my daughter ends up in a crumbled up ball on one side of the swing more times than not it doesn t seem to have the support that our other 2 swings have That said the swing is very attractive and appealing I only wish it were better made and more thought out 
2 0 I m Sorry I HATE IT I have looked at alot of other reviews before I bought and wished that I hadn t because You can t go off someone else s experience you REALLY have to experience it for yourself First of all it s too bulky The suction thing on the tub didn t stick and it was in the way when I tried to shower and kept falling down My poor baby kept sliding because there is no non skid at the bottom of the tub so I had to go out and buy a small mat to put at the bottom I bought this tub only because my baby was out growing the fold away bath chair but it looks as though I will have to continue using it and buy a larger one for her I was very temped to send it back but I m just going to sell it on ebay I m sorry but it was a waste of money for me I m happy that it did aleast work out for the other moms maybe mines is defected 
1 0 waist of money This was the first bottle I purchased for my daughter when she was born I was breastfeeding but since she had jaundice I had to suppliment formula for the first 2 weeks of her life I had the worst time with this bottle It leaked everytime I went to shake it and whenever I would try to feed my daughter she would literaly drown because the flow was too fast SHe would also gag and had horrible gas I stopped with the formula till she was 6 weeks and I thought maybe since she was older she could take it a little better It ended up being the same problems again I switched to the playtex nurser and those bottles are great I would recommend them to anyone who is breast and bottle feeding My daughter did not get confused and she did not drown in formula Even though it is a little more work with the drop in system I dont care I can push the air out of the bottle and she swallows less air and she has less gas and spits up less 
1 0 Leaks Leaks Leaks What more can I say These bottles leak all over the place I switched to Dr Brown s and they have been great No leaks and my son spits up less Do not buy Avent bottles and nipples they leak like crazy and cause a huge mess 
2 0 not what you think This does not fold down 90 deg Don t buy if you think you ll be able to fold down and change sheets or something 
2 0 NOT the best mattress I was really disappointed in this Sealy Ultra It does not feel like a very good mattress We ll use this for a couple months and replace it with something better I d say you need to see the mattress decide the one you want and then look for the best price on the internet 
2 0 Look for one piece instead I purchased this item from Target and had to return it to the store The wedge comes in 2 pieces of foam and the foam is inserted into the cover The foam isn t the problem it s the cover The zipper goes right down the middle so it can t be comfortable for the baby to lay with the zipper poking out under their head neck I would recommend the crib wedge that comes in one piece If the zipper were on the side the product would be great 
2 0 Waste of Money I bought this Thermometer when my second son was born thinking it would be easy to use and good for the money My husband and I tested it on ourselves to see how accurate it was We both got 5 different readings I didn t see what the need of the plastic covers were for since we ran out of them quickly Not to mention you can t find replacements anywhere My biggest complant was that after a month the product completely stopped working even after changing the batteries I would suggest paying the extra money to get a better thermometer 
1 0 Don t waste your money I bought this item in preparation for my first child I tried it 8 times on me and my husband and got a different reading each time from 94 2 102 3 I returned it the next day don t bother 
1 0 A complete waste of money Every single time the reading is way low around 94 9 or something like that It is extremely unreliable Don t waste your money 
1 0 what a waste I don t usually bother complaining about products but this thermometer was such a waste of I just wanted to save someone else the trouble The temperature readings on this are SOOO inaccurate EVERY time that we check a temp it is different it varies alot Just to see if it worked we tried 8 times in a row on ourselves to see what we got Every time it was different sometimes by a few degrees It reads low sometimes so you may have a temperature and not be aware And we couldn t even take it back to the store Do yourself a favor by the regular digital thermometer We didn t have any luck with a diffferent brand either the ear ones are all off but not as bad as this one 
1 0 WASTE OF MONEY I bought this thermometer for my daughter when she was first born It is AWFUL It gives strange readings like 94 5 and 95 1 when in fact I know that she has a fever I bought just a regular digital rectal thermometer at the pharmacy and it gives more accurate readings Don t buy this its a waste of time and 
1 0 Inaccurate and Inconsistant This thermometer is not very accurate or consistant Whenever my son was sick and we used this it would give a normal temperature reading and I knew that it couldn t be right We would take our sons temperature 3 times in a row and never get the same reading twice I even check my own temperature and it would come up with crazy readings like 95 1 We got rid of this one because fever induced seizures run in my husbands family and we needed something more accurate It has been my experience that nothing digital gives accurate readings and that the old fashion oral and rectal thermometers work best 
1 0 Do Not Buy This Thermometer I bought this to take my infant s temperature since she doesn t like to sit and wait for her temperature to be taken under her arm I decided to test it before she was sick to make sure it was accurate and it never gave the same reading twice First it was 95 5 and then 98 5 and then 96 2 etc I tested it on myself my daughter and my husband Then I gave the directions and the thermometer to my husband to try to see if maybe I just wasn t doing it correctly and he had the same results I have taken it back to Target and am trying a different brand DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT 
1 0 Not worth your money I was excited when I purchased this ear thermometer because I had an ear thermometer years ago that I loved I was unfortunately very disappointed with this one s performance The temperature seemed innaccurate when we were testing it right after purchase Then about two weeks ago my daughter came down with a fever I could feel that she was burning up but the ear thermometer read 97 5 when I checked it twice I got out the oral thermometer and discovered her fever was actually 102 1 Needless to say this thermometer went back to the store I won t buy another ear thermometer until I can afford to get a better brand like the one I had years ago ThermoScan o 
1 0 WORK MESS I USE THIS AT WORK WHERE I HAVE INFANTS UP TO TODDLERS WE HAVE TO REPEAT THE PROCESS 3 TIMES BEFORE WE EVER GET AN ACCURATE READING THE UNDER THE ARM OLD TRADITIONAL THERMOMATERS ARE BETTER 
1 0 Save your money I loved this at first But after two months of daily use the thing broke I cant get it back together I think I will just go back to walking the diapers to the regular trash outside 
1 0 Too Abrasive I used the quilted sheet for the first time when my baby was 6 months old He woke up the next morning with his face raw and irritated The thread from the quilting is just too abrasive on his delicate skin I won t ever use it again 
1 0 Do not buy this Don t bother it doesn t fit at all Plain and simple just don t bother 
1 0 Not machine washable dryable Okay maybe I should have read the laundering instructions which say to machine wash and then drip dry but who makes BABY items that can t be machine dried How many parents have the time to line dry delicates The upshot is that this fell apart melted in the dryer and got fluff all over EVERYWHERE the first time we ever washed it If you need something you can throw in the washer dryer when it gets dirty and not worry about sorting this is NOT your product Grrr 
2 0 Too Small I bought this for an older model Graco pack n play we got from friends who no longer needed it The mattress measures 27 x 39 and before washing it my husband and I tried it out to see if it fit It s too small I know it s supposed to be snug but the mattress won t even lay flat with this sheet on it It seems like it d be a great product if only it were slightly bigger to fit properly 
1 0 Cradler doesn t work for older kids My son is 8 months old He has outgrown his infant car seat and is now in a larger seat but still rear facing I bought the cradler to prevent his head from slumping forward when he falls asleep in the seat It does not help in this regard at all In fact it just annoys him I have taken it off the car seat entirely and I m not using it at all Very disappointed in Californi 
2 0 Didn t work for us I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds He hated this carrier because he couldn t turn around and see the world I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly I tried numerous positions There isn t a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn t move around I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 Note there is a 5 return charge 
1 0 bad it started loosing air after just a few uses i was so excited when i ordered the item but now i m extremely mad 
1 0 Company Does Not Stand Behind Product The biggest disappointment was that after 6 months the tub began leaking air through an unseen hole maybe in the seams thus patch would not work Kel Gar does not warranty the product and the store that the tub came from via amazon only offered a 90 day warranty Also the tub is too wide to fit in a standard tub only half the water from the tub spout lands in tub the rest flows behind it Thus wasted water and it takes longer to fill 
1 0 Problems with Baby Because We ordered a tub from Baby Because which was delivered Then they mistakenly sent us formula someone else ordered On route the formula fell off a UPS truck and was lying in the street for over a day A neighbor saw it and gave it to us Baby Because contacted us saying they wanted the formula back to sell it We expressed concern that they wanted to sell baby formula that had fallen off a truck and been lying out in the street for a day They said it wasn t our concern and to just give it back 
2 0 not as great as it seams I just received this product after much research and I am really disappointed with it s quality The mattres is so stiff and hard especially for a baby and the sheets provided are like an emory board scratchy and stiff My baby is too long for this so her feet fall off the edge of the mattres I just thought it would be much better than this Looks like I will be returning it My daughter is now sleeping in her bouncy chair tied down at the back to reduce the bounce and with a fluffy pillow underneath it to also reduce the bounce 
2 0 Will not buy Sassy products again I only have the turtle and the fishing net Turtle The turtle was used for about 5 months while my nephew stayed with me and then was put up until my new baby would be able to use it I dryed out all of the bath toys and they were stored in an open air toy bin for about 6 months I finally felt my daughter was ready for toys in the bath and put the turtle in the water and noticed black stuff floating in the water There was mold mildew growing inside of the turtle I tried washing it with bleach water but more kept coming out even after repeated washings I finally just gave up and threw it out I had several other squirt toys stored with the turtle and none of them had the same problem Fish net The paint on the fish net is peeling off after only 5 months use The fish themselves are fine 
1 0 Not a good product Buy the Baby Bjorn before you waste your time and money on this hunk of junk No matter how I tried I couldn t wrap my baby to where I felt he was secure and safe and comfortable Plus it took forever and my baby had no patience to wait for me By the time he was in he wanted out 
2 0 used it once A great idea but very time consuming to put on My advice is to use a regular Maya type sling for the first few months and then get the Patapum It s the least pricey of the structured carriers which are the ONLY ones that put the weight on your hips rather than your shoulders and therefore spare your spine 
2 0 Wrap is the key word here This item was suggested to me by my local birth center I should have noticed the word wrap but I didn t give it too much thought There are two main problems with this baby carrier 1 You have to wrap every time you want to use it which is problematic if you have other kids who need attention and if you are wanting to use it out of the house I live in SW Florida where in the summertime it is 100+ degrees There is NO way I could stand in a parking lot wrap myself up put the baby in and get my other child without suffering from serious heat exhaustion 2 It is HOT Yes this is a nice stretchy breathable fabric BUT the fabric is much much bulkier than standard baby carriers Again I hate to harp on the weather here but there s no way I could take my other child to the park and wear this unless all I had on underneath was a tank top I m also unsure how you would nurse while wearing this unless you had those special nursing shirts with slits in them Otherwise you d have to jack your shirt up underneath the baby and the carrier to feed them On the plus side it s easy to get wrapped up and easy to put a baby doll in and out of 
1 0 I didnt like them at all I bought the bottles and when I used them all the milk came out and get all the baby we 
1 0 Flow too fast My 11 week old breastfed baby was diagnosed with mild acid reflux she doesn t vomit it comes up in her throat causing crying spells from the heartburn She also has a sensitive stomach and is gassy so we decided to try these when she was 8 weeks old They were horrible We like the Playtex Premium Nurser and the Playtex Ventaire chubby bottles MUCH better We tried the regular Dr Browns but she choked on the nipple so we ordered the chubby bottle that has the nipples more like the breast With both kinds she sucked too hard and ate too fast when I sat her up to burp her after her usual 5 minutes one ounce with the Playtex bottles to my surprise she had already sucked down 3 ounces We had a horrible night both times we tried the Dr Browns she cried all night from a bad tummy ache from the fast flow we used the slow flow nipples even I also have a friend that had the same problem with her baby choking and gagging on the slow flow nipples too fast flow formula fed baby I HIGHLY recommend the Playtex bottles they are easy to clean and never leak We only tried Dr Brown to see if it would alleviate the GERD symptoms it did not 
1 0 Do not waste yourmoney You have a spilt second to get the wipey out and then it gets cold Not to mention the warm moist environment is a breeding ground for bacteria especially if you are wiping then put your hands back in to get another wipey 
2 0 Works only if you renew your wipes supply daily I bought this wipe warmer as the weather got colder here in Georgia and so far have not been impressed Two problems 1 The wipes stay warm for about 0042 of a secod so by the time you pop them out and get them to your son s tushy they are lukewarm at best 2 They advertise how intelligent their top warming design it but that s only for the wipes that are touching the top of the product Once you get half way through your wipes there isn t any way for those wipes to benefit from the warming device placed directly below the lid since they cannot reach it They should install some sore of spring device so that all wipes are touching the warmer no matter how low your wipe supply is getting I will continue to use it but wish I had though more about the product s design 
2 0 Would like bigger selection from Target Target com My husband and I purchased this warmer with gift cards we received for our second baby s birth We don t really like it Our wipes dry out down to about the third sometimes fourth wipe That s makes for a 6 8 wipe diaper change that s a lot of wasted money Other reviewers are right about the wipes staying moist when it is not as full But with a newborn infant or even a toddler I prefer the convenience of opening a refill pack and placing all of the wipes into the warmer instead of half the wipes in and then finding something to keep the second half moist until it s time to refill with the other half We had a wrap around warmer with our first child It wore out around the time we started potty training her That s the style of wipe warmer I would recommend for new parents not this one 
1 0 Frighteningly dangerous do not use near stairs We have the All Clear Swing Gate hardware mounted not pressure mounted installed at the top of our basement stairs Earlier this evening I opened the lock and as the gate swung out over the stairs the top hinge snapped off the wall and the gate tipped away under my hand Fortunately enough of my weight was behind me that I was able to correct my balance just and did not fall headfirst down the stairs But it was a close thing An inch or a pound or a second either way and I or god forbid one of our children would certainly have been badly injured While I was taking a photograph of the broken hinge the gate itself which was hanging precariously by its remaining hinge fell off and tumbled down the stairs The gate has been in place for six weeks but has only been in actual use for a tiny fraction of that time as we have been out of the house for five of those weeks NB this was a product failure not an installation fault The screws are still firmly attached to the wall along with what remains of the plastic flanges around the appropriate holes in the hinge I purchased the gate after reading the enthusiastic reviews here but after my experience tonight I would not recommend that anybody buy this gate ever The review gives one star because NO stars is not an option And I would expect to see a product recall very soon 
1 0 NOT RECOMMENDED BY CHP I went to the CHP office to get my car seat checked and the officer said that car seat protection mats are not approved and considered a major safety hazard because it causes the car seat to become loose If you use these mats the car seat will not be installed tightly enough and can be a real danger during automobile accidents DON T BUY 
1 0 Not good for a small car I have a volvo 960 sedan and wanted to use the seat saver in the middle seat and it DID NOT work The bottom section was too large for the space between the seat belt buckle and did not allow the carseat base to be properly placed My friend has one of those nylon seat protectors and it is much better 
1 0 what us that smell First of all the diapers get stuck in the lid and then the room starts to smell like baby poop Yes you can use reg bags for it the only + about it First day after changing the bag it smells OK but buy the 2nd WOW it stinks so badly and when you open it to change the bag the smell is unbearable 
1 0 WHAT IS THAT SMELL Ohhh it s the Diaper Champ Buy anything Buy a regular old trash can and throw your diapers in there because you ll get pretty much the same end result I don t have the pink Diaper Champ because I have a little boy but it s still a Diaper Champ and it is horrible I had a Diaper Genie with my older son now 4 and gave it to my brother I wanted to try something else and was drawn to the Champ because you can use a kitchen trash bag woo hoo NO REFILLS So for three months now that s how old my little butterball is now I ve used the Diaper Champ and the first day it s not so bad maybe because the diapers are floating in the enormous amount of Lysol I spray in there and the fact that I use ForceFlex trash bags for the prayer that they won t break when I m disposing of diapers and flood the house with old baby poop which also have Odor Shield so the bags start out smelling so nice but already by day two my husband is walking in the nursery saying HOOOOOOONEY it smellllllls I clean the thing all the time the stench remains This week I ordered my Diaper Genie online I feel like throwing a party when it gets here I ll spend the extra few dollars on some refills if it keeps guests that enter my home from wondering what on earth died in my house 
1 0 Just Horrible I also had the older Diaper Champ and it broke so I got this new one New And Improved I don t know if they ve ever tested this product It s impossible to get the diaper bag out of the Diaper champ It s big from the bottom and small from the top so when you try to get the bag out of it it always gets stuck and if you try harder then the bag rips It s absolutely horrible product NEW OR SOON TO BE MOMS DO NOT BUY THIS 
1 0 New and Improved No Way We first had the original diaper champ which I would have given 4 stars It kept the odor in pretty well was easy to use used regular trash bags etc We really liked it until one day a velcro tab on a diaper pulled the foam out of the lid Since it was letting the odor out we decided to replace it with the new and improved model WORST DIAPER PAIL EVER As soon as the diapers start piling up the lid grabs tabs wipes etc and jams the top so you can t flip it I spent so much time shaking wiggling and kicking the thing I was very quickly exasperated When you flip the top it created much bigger gaps on the two sides than the older model This is why things get jammed also why it lets a huge waft of diaper odor out every time you flip it HORRIBLE 
1 0 Safety Hazard This step stool is a safety hazard The sides are not angled enough so a two year old can easily step too close to the edge and tip it over In fact the stepping surface is so small that it s hard for a little guy to stay in the middle of it And when the stool is tumbled over a little explorer can hurt himself badly when he falls onto the sharp edges of the legs 
1 0 Please be careful My baby was playing with the giggle ball when one of the caps fell off and all of the beads spilled on the floor Please use caution with this toy The toy wasn t being played with roughly and the floor was carpeted There was no reason for the toy to fall apart 
1 0 Fell apart within a week of purchase This cute turtle was terrific for about a week My toddler loved it and enjoyed the stars and color options Unfortunately the button you press to turn it on fell off inside the turtle after about a week of use I was the one pressing the button when it came off and I wasn t being rough or using excessive force We had to shake the turtle to get the button out but couldn t re fasten it easily For a few days we stuck a finger in the small hole where the button used to be to activate the turtle but then the rubber sensor fell off as well With no way to turn the thing on we threw it away My toddler was sooooo sad but it was worthless to us Since this is overall a popular product I suppose we just had bad luck I wouldn t buy another one though 
1 0 Thought this would work but it didn t I bought this thinking it would work on public restrooms larger toilets for my toddler and it DOESN T FIT AT ALL if you are using just for home sized potties it is fine except it heaves a little in the center but don t get it for travel as it doesn t work for that 
2 0 not best for boys My son used this several times wet all over the floor each time There is no splash guard on it for boys but it probably works fine for girls 
1 0 DO NOT BUY THIS We bought this for our son after experiencing some dirty or too large public toilets My husband tried to use it for the first time yesterday and could not get it to fit the toilet at a restaurant and there was no way he could lift my son on to it without it slipping I thought I would give it a try today when we were out for breakfast Typical toilet at Einstein s bagels I had a hard time getting it to stay lifted my son up and placed him on the seat He let out a horrible scream and I lifted him up and threw the seat cover to the floor He was bleeding THE PRIMO FOLDING POTTY SEAT CUT HIM ON HIS BEHIND This product does not fit on toilets the handles are blocking where the legs should go and instead of protecting him it hurt him We will just bring disinfecting wipes from now on DO NOT BUY THIS 
1 0 Not worth the money I bought this product because my little girl always wants to use the toilet We have a regular potty trainer that goes on our toilet at home and thought this would be similar It is not It has not fit on ANY public toilet we have tried and slips all over the place She doesn t want to use it which leaves me with nothing I would not purchase this product 
2 0 There are bettter monitors in the market Not good for larger houses Ours picks up radio signals sometimes 
1 0 unreliable We went through three of these before we finally gave up Our poor baby was crying and we didn t know cause it stopped working in the middle of the night I luckily am a light sleeper Also the static is bad especially if you have a cell phone any where near We bought a cheaper safety first brand and have not had any problems 
1 0 Spend more money While sometimes this works well I m frequently woken up in the middle of the night to static that wasn t there when I went to bed It doesn t matter what channel it s on I also get a random drumroll sound frequently If you like being woken up in the middle of the night because your monitor is a piece of crap then I highly recommend this 
1 0 horrible all i could hear was the local am radio station and even that wasnt clear spend some more money and get something better 
2 0 Bad Quality We bought this monitor about a year ago to replace the one we had gotten at a yard sale and it seemed to work great at first however after about 2 months the 1st receiver it came with two just suddenly stoped working I thought maybe one of our family members got water on it or something because it was kept in the kitchen but sure enough a few months later the other receiver that we kept in our bedroom just suddenly stoped working There must be some kind of defect in the production of these things because as I can see from reading the other reviews that we re not the only family having problems Save yourself the headache and purchase a different brand model 
2 0 Good if for younger smaller child The product claims to carry children up to 40 lbs my daughter is only 27lbs and it could not hold her While it has all the pockets and looks like the higher end carriers it is not After one day at the amusement park the straps started to strain and seperate fromt he carrier I returned this item and got the Sherpani Rumba which has a wight limit of 70lbs I love it Also the cross terrain claim to Load balancing straps distributes weight off parent s shoulder and onto hips it does not I was in horrible pain after about an hour in both my upper and lower back I suggest you don t waste your money and go with the higher end products like Sherpani and Kelty This will work for a smaller child but only if you can compfortably carry the weight I did like the easily adjustable seat and back I was able to adjust from my height to my husbands 
2 0 can t put in dryer I never got to use this sheet I pre washed it and put it to dry on low heat as I ve done with all the baby clothes I later saw the label said to air dry which seems ridiculous for something that ll be washed so often Anyway it shrunk and doesn t fit over the co sleeper mattress If you have time space to air dry it it s probably a fine product 
1 0 Don t buy from BP Medical This product is great but do NOT buy it from BP Medical You cannot return an unopened and unused product for a full refund they charge a 15 restocking fee that is not disclosed at the time of purchase 
1 0 Correct this problem We also ordered the bedding and got the pillow We called Baby Age and they were nice but refused to honor the price and send us the bedding They should know there s a problem by now and change this listing 
1 0 Baby Age mixed up products Same thing happened to me as the person from the previous review They sent a pink pillow instead of the crib set and will not honor the same price for the bedding set I have to send it back and they will give a refund What a hassle 
1 0 Really bad Baby Age sent me a funny pink feeding pillow with the same value of the crib set refusing changing it to the crib set I have to return it by Amazon A Z Guarantee wasting a lot of time 
2 0 not the best I bought this for my son thinking that the pee guard would be okay My son pees over the top of this plus it being on isn t to comfortable for an adult s back and having this also makes are toilet seat loose and we have to tighten the screws often The whole on it is also pretty small 
1 0 How Easy Can you Get I had a winter baby and I can t begin to imagine what I would have done without this item I have personally inspired 2 other new moms to purchase this already as well The absolute best thing is that you never have to put a coat on the child And what a time saver that is if you are a woman on the go like myself I was excited that right before I had my baby girl they came out with the new Limited version I have the Diva color for my little and I get a lot of compliments on the look and ease of use I disagree with others who thought it was difficult to adjust the item around the harness straps and that it was cheaply made I installed the sack and made the adjustment one time The material allows weather and some liquids to just roll right off the fabric I would consider this a must for any first time moms as I was on their registry The price definitely a lot higher than I would like to see it but still a must if you can afford to make the purchase 
1 0 Not Safe I bought several versions of the Bundle Me only to find out today that they should not be used because they go under the baby and interfere with the way the safety straps fit I am so frustrated by this Why are they allowed to sell products that are not safe We took our car seat to the Katie Cares Safety Check today and they took all of the accessories off We had a neck support cozy on the seat as well that they said was also unsafe Save your money and buy a version that goes OVER the seat and baby not under Kidopotomus makes one 
2 0 Not that light weight This seat does not fit in any snap and go stroller and is not exceptionally light If I were to do this over I would buy a different infant seat 
1 0 Do not waste you money on these they leak We have switched bottles with my daughter more times than I would like to admit She s had gas and discomfort with all of them I decided to try Avent bottles I bought twelve of them and at first they seemed to relieve some of the gas But they leak horribly Sometimes it s a few drops But most times it s like a continuous stream of formula A couple of times I wasn t paying close enough attention to the bottle while feeding and formula ended up soaking my daughter s bib her sleep sack her onesie and my shirt The entire bottle emptied all over us before I knew it the leak was that fast I tried every suggestion given to me mixing the formula in a seperate container mixing it in the bottles and using sealing disks to mix in the bottle heating before adding to the bottles heating in the bottles wetting the nipples not wetting the nipples making sure the bottle rim was properly inserted into the nipple ring etc I wrote a letter to Avent and called twice about this issue Each time the customer service rep spoke down to me and said I must not have read and followed the directions which I had DON T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE EXPENSIVE POORLY DESIGNED BOTTLES These are the worst on the market in my experience 
2 0 Not worth the hype I heard lots about the Avent brand while pregnant and registered for all Avent bottles Boy am I glad that someone gave me Soothies and Parent s Choice Anti colic bottles too The nipples are way too tough and it was a constant fight to get my daughter to drink from them She loves the other two brands and I love the Parent s choice because it truly does help with her swallowing air and the tube in the middle shows when the formula is too hot Don t waste time or money with Avent 
1 0 Horrible product don t buy WE DID READ THE DIRECTIONS and the product still works sporadically My wife is a physician The leaking problem is incredibly frustrating especially when the baby is crying Buy anything else you will be very disappointed especially at this price point 
1 0 Stylish and Durable with a HORRIBLE LEAKING PROBLEM I have three kids and for the third time I am utterly dissapointed with Avent s product With each new child we bought a fresh supply of bottles hoping Avent had fixed this problem We really wanted these bottles to work as they seem to be the most durable and stylish ones on the market and our kids never had any problems with the nipples However each time we ended up having to switch to another brand The leak is not just a spot here or there It is often a torrential downpour leaking out the sides of the white cap I know many people who have had the same problem For as expensive as these bottles are I would think Avent would take more pride in their product fixing such simple things as a leak Don t waste your money 
1 0 Do not buy these bottles When I learned I was expecting triplets I bought a large inventory of these bottles which I thought were the best out there Boy was I wrong These bottles leak not just once in a while but with almost every feeding I am constantly double checking them in hopes they won t leak all over my babies I now cover my babies with a cloth diaper so that they don t get soaked when surprise the bottle leaks all over them Yes I ve read the directions and no I don t over tighten the bottles You can t take them with you for feedings on the go since they will leak all over your diaper bag or cooler bag They are especially leaky when I prepare bottles in advance and store them in the refrigerator There is something about the cold or condensation that affects the seal The bottle must be disassembled the top wiped dry and then reassembled Lots of fun with three bottles especially for 3 am feedings Even if I am doing something wrong a bottle that requires this much precision in assembly not to leak is not a very good product If I hadn t bought so many I d throw them all away and get something else Take it from someone who is using these bottles three times as often they are a waste of money and a source of constant aggravation 
2 0 Some good things more bad things Good things 1 Baby loves watching the hanging toys 2 The nature sounds are very well done and very pleasant Bad things 1 VERY troublesome to assemble The supplied screws are a cheap metal and they are screwed into plastic threads In the most critical support structure the kickstand I could not get all of the screws into their holes completely before the screws stripped out But I did get it together well enough to use However I considered returning it to the store during assembly 2 The vibration feature broke after about 1 month of use 3 Baby cannot reach the toys even at 3 months of age and we have a very tall baby 4 Toys are very easily removed from their holes so that you can t really move the chair without the toys falling out 5 The rocker has a very big footprint It takes up about half of the surface area of our four seat kitchen table 
2 0 Broken already My seat is BRAND NEW and I love it but it has already quick working I ve changed the batteries reapeatedly and it still only works occassionaly It won t vibrate at all and the music only plays sometimes VERY DISAPPOINTED 
1 0 The worst shipment I ever received from Amazon Shoppers beware The item itself is a great item but I have received the worst shipment ever from my online orders 1 Even though the item is advertised in Amazon as new I received an item which was previously used and apparently for a long long time The rocker seat was dirty and smelled 2 Even though the seller charges more than 9 dollars for shipping they did not bother to put the manufacturer fragile box in a mailing box Therefore the package arrived cut in several locations with some of the items bulging out 3 Some of the accessories are missing and I can bet the previous owner forgot to return them 
2 0 Buyer s remorse despite safety claim I purchased this seat because of the safety factor that Consumer Reports reported on In comparing the seat to Graco Snugride however I am very disappointed on the tough very dense foam on the low back sacral region of the seat The foam goes down to a certain point on baby s low back and then disappears leaving a dip for baby s buttocks Just imagine sitting in a recliner with support only down to the low back region with buttocks not supported not comfortable I wonder how a baby s backside would stand up to a traumatic jolt in that seat well I m not going to take any chances Baby Trend should have consulted a Physical Therapist like me before designing this seat 
2 0 Not impressed We bought this car seat and the snap n go based on good reviews not the ones listed here It did not meet our expectations I give it 2 stars just for the safety of it Otherwise I have a hard time finding positive things to say It is way too heavy Our baby was 7 lbs+ and from his early days it was heavy to carry around Now that he is almost 20 pounds at 5+ months it is nearly impossible to carry him for any length of time The adjustable strap often gets stuck and we really have to tug to make it work On most grocery carts it is too big to have it face towards you as you shop When you do clip it on to the cart the front end is suspended in the air I just put it sideways which is a pain Also the handle bar is built to be easier to carry I don t agree It is still awkward I end up hooking it under my arm Lastly to put the handle bar up and down is very difficult You have to squeeze the taps on both sides and really push hard to get it to release I m sorry that I don t have any others to recommend I had hoped to like this and am just suffering until he doesn t need the support in the grocery cart that is really the only reason I still use it 
2 0 Noisy My husband and I recieved this as a baby shower gift and were initially really excited about it until we started using it and realized that the motor and other mechanisms that keep the fish moving and lights going are very noisy The noise the toy makes running is lounder than any of the music to sooth baby We were greatly disappointed 
2 0 where d the water go We loved this toy when my daughter received it for Christmas She loved to lay in her crib and look at it and recently even learned to turn it on by herself This morning I looked at the toy and noticed that the water compartment was almost empty The water drained out of the compartment it belongs in and back in to the part which contains the musical mechanisms and the battery connections It s not exactly fixable so we will move on to another crib toy 
1 0 Only lasted a week We got this in lieu of another similar one because it was in stock but lo and behold it only lasted a week Our son lays on his back and kicks everything in his crib so when he kicked this the knob securing it to the crib through the strap broke off Luckily the broken piece fell on the floor and not into his crib where it could have posed a choking hazard Pass on this and get a Fisher Price one Ocean Wonders or the one we got Flutterbye Dreams which he loves 
1 0 Cute Toy Poor Quality We received this toy as a gift when our son was born It was installed on our crib once and was removed once to replace the batteries When I went to put it back onto the crib I noticed that the plastic straps that affix it to the crib were cracked and starting to break I need to stress that this toy was only affixed to the crib one time and my son never pulled on it or put stress on the straps at all Also like other reviewers have stated the company recommends removing it from the crib at 5 months of age yet that s when my son started interacting with it so it s a little age inappropriate I contacted the company about the straps to see if there is an at home repair kit or if they offer a replacement I ll repost if I hear from them 
1 0 Not what i thought it would be I bought the Baby Einstein Sea Crib toy based on its look I brought it home put batteries in it and it worked for 5 minutes before it quit playing sounds I was also disappointed that the ocean sound only played for a few seconds I had thought it would play for 12 minutes like the music I took it back and purchased the Fisher Price aquarium and it is great It plays every sound for 10 minutes and seems more durable 
1 0 Great bottle MESSY LEAKS I had purchased the Dr Brown bottles after the birth of my boy girl twins in hopes of helping my son with his gasiness They did help ease his suffering but he was also put on soy which seemed to help the most By this point both babies had become attached to these bottles and wouldn t use anything else At first I thought I must be doing something wrong for them to continually leak and sometimes POUR out of the rim of the bottle I have a total of 4 kids and have been through lots of different types of bottles none this bad We tried Everthing to stop the leaks using only all dry parts for each new bottle not heating or storing in the fridge with the valve and stem inside not overfilling After an entire year of frustration with these leaking bottles I noticed that when my son would hold it by the nipple or squeeze the nipple that milk would come pouring down the sides Finally the answer to the leaks Is truly a great idea and I hope they try to perfect it but these have a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW and babies drenched with formula in the middle of the night is no fun These items were meant for baby use and for the price it should help make babies mom s life easier Stick with Avent or Playtex with liners Thank you Good Luck 
1 0 Hard Thin We asked for 2 of these and got both The material was itchy and scratchy and never got softer It was very thin and you could see the pattern through the sheet It was easy to put on mainly b c it was a bit big They ended up in the closet in no time 
1 0 Paper thin I recently purchased two of these sheets and ended up taking them right back They say they re fitted but they aren t elastic so they re not that well fitted They are paper thin Apparently Graco hasn t put these on their pack n plays and observed the quality I purchased the Koala portable sheets which were cheaper thicker and truly are fitted with elastic Don t waste your money on these 
2 0 useful item but very poor quality We got 2 of these and had the same problem with both The cloth on this cover already had some snags on it when we took it out of the package After washing it as directed it has gotten even worse It has strings hanging all over it It s a very useful item but the quality of the fabric is terrible A friend of mine had the same problem and she recommends the Especially for Baby brand less expensive and better quality 
1 0 Poor Quality I washed the cover for the first time and it didn t hold up The ends are frayed and there are even holes where the elastic band attaches to the terry Also little pieces of the terry got all over everything else I washed with it I m extremely disappointed with this product 
1 0 Hands Free gate Extension I loved the gate So when I moved to my new house and found that the doorways were wider than the gate I needed the extension It was well worth it My daughter is always pulling on it and hanging on it and it still stays very sturdy within the doorway I am also happy that we got to re use the hands free gate because I would have hated to fasten a gate right onto the wall and make holes in my wall This gate was a great purchase 
2 0 Does not have an automatic shut off An OK gadget but a large coffee cup with water heated in the microwave works just as well It does not have an automatic shut off so the water in the unit eventually evaporates leaving the exposed heating coil Must unplug the unit after each use to prevent this 
2 0 At 3am remembering is hard When your infant is crying because he s hungry and you re only thinking about how you want to be back in bed you will not necessarily hear the very quiet click another reviewer mentioned unless you are right on top of this unit Did it already cycle through once Twice I don t know I never could catch it since it was in my kitchen and I was usually trying to soothe my child in the living room when the light went out Yes it was in plain sight but that doesnt mean I caught it at the right time What I do know is that leaving the bottle in there reagrdless of it being 4oz or 8oz makes the formula very HOT Even if you have it on the proper setting according to the instructions Then you have to wait for it to cool down before feeding your now screaming hungry baby This went in the trash The only reason I gave it two stars is because it did heat the bottle faster than if I waited for water to boil Otherwise I just started giving my son formula made with room temperature water and had not one problem 
2 0 I love the other sleep sacks but hate this material I love the other sleep sacks you can see my full review of them on their web pages But this sack has different fabric which I really really don t like It isn t actually quilted It is woven to look like it is The material is such that it attracts hair and lint to it in the dryer and it catches in the fabric so it takes a bit of light tugging to get it off It also catches on any hang nails or rough skin When it is warm I use the cotton sleep sacks and when it is cold I use the fleece polyester ones Great sacks just annoying fabric with this one 
2 0 Small compact I used this tub for my first born This is small and holds very little water therefore the water gets cold fast Also there are holes where the tub folds up so the water spills out of the holes as the baby moves It can be messy if you are giving your baby a bath on the floor as I did Our baby would stick her foot and leg out of the tub because it s so small when I used larger tub that didn t happen One positive thing that I can say about this product is that it s compact I kept it at my mother s house and it didn t take up much space I would recommend spending an extra 10 to 15 and buy a higher quality tub 
1 0 Terrible Tub This tub is a waste of money I bought it this evening and I m returning the tub first thing tomorrow morning Water leaks at the hinges creating a mess and a slippery unsafe floor Very unsatisfied with this product 
1 0 Convenient for Mom Uncomfortable for Baby For our first baby we were determined to stay away from the lure of cute but unnecessarily expensive baby items This was one of the few items we did not research and we purchased this tub thinking any tub would work We were wrong The tub is too slippery which causes his head to endlessly roll back and forth into the corners The slant of the tub is also meant for a larger baby which causes his head to dig into his chin which he hates Bathtime is about bonding so after a month and a half of fighting we ended up taking our baths together My son prefered the skin to skin contact anyways The tub is also a poor fit for any oval sink bathroom and the one time I put it in the kitchen sink I filled it with water and it buckled Never tried it again If you want to wash your baby in the sink get a foam sponge or a bath support specifically made for newborns Even for 12 dollars I would not buy this tub again Granted it might work for some but if you have a fussy or even mildly fussy baby I would not recommend this tub 
2 0 I had major safety problems with this tub This tub was great in the beginning it fit perfectly in our kitchen sink and we were able to bathe our baby with no problems at all It was great that she could sit in the warm water and not get cold while I was washing her etc However after using the tub about 10 times it suddenly collapsed into the bottom of the sink with my baby inside Basically the top and bottom ends that fold up for storage just buckled She wasn t hurt but was very scared Keep in mind that this problem started when my baby was 12 lbs so I don t think her weight was an issue 
2 0 Alright but At first I really liked these until I realized that my baby just used about 100 liners in about 1 week It s not easy to squeeze the air out Since I keep track of how much our baby eats how can I do that when the liner is all scrunched up Not worth the money on the liners and there is plenty of air that gets into the liner even if once in a while you do manage to get the air out I m sorry I ever bought them 
2 0 Not worth it First off the person who wrote about her ingenious husband who invented the trick of squeezing the air out before screwing the top on Yeah I d call him creative but not the one who invented that trick I had to giggle to myself and then post this publicly myself and my whole group of friends used that trick Secondly the liners are too expensive and third how in the world do you mix formula in these things They worked great for breastmilk but the hassle of having to mix formula in a seperate container and then pour it into the liners was just too much for me at 3 am with a screaming kid Even waiting to warm it up under hot running water took too long Give me the regular bottles any day PS bisphenol A what about high fructose corn syrup cargeenan which is the sludge that comes from soybean processing and is put in nearly every food on the market as a preservative and even gasp the probability that your kid might someday eat a bug that has eaten off a chemically treated cornfield I m all for protecting your kids but you can t save them from everything and there are much more harmful substances out there 
2 0 Not as advertised you still need a coat Do not believe the manufactures claims that you don t need a jacket if you have this bunting We had a 7am Enfant bunting for our daughter for her first winter and loved it It had a hood that could be unzipped and completely covered her up and kept her toasty warm without any extra clothing Now she has outgrown it and I bought one of these as a replacement There is no way by any stretch of anyones imagination that you can use this bunting without needing a coat and hat as well The zip only zips to about half way up the chest of my one year old Yes you could pull up the flap to cover her chest but she just pushes it down again since there is no way to keep it up It did keep her just about warm enough with a coat hat and mittens at a temp of 35F but I want something that you can use without a coat After much research I am returning this after a single outing and getting a Little Kazook instead which zips all the way up and has a hood 
2 0 Too small I bought this for my daughter when she was 1 year old I could barely zip it around b c it is so small I keep checking the tags to make sure I got the right size and not the infant one I looked at some other reviews and saw many people were having the same problem It s a great product for smaller children 
1 0 same problems as munchkin version Ditto to other complaints won t separate easily either by unscrewing or prizing Cheap flimsy leaks water also because no gasket I m looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice this almost identical to product by Munchki 
2 0 NOT USER FREINDLY This product is a good idea however 1 The fill hole is not large enough to fill the bottom of the dish with hot tap water without getting water into the serving tray 2 Can t be put in the Micro 3 Extremely hard to open bottom compartment to clean 4 Extremely hard to open and close I and my daughter have to use a butter knife to pry open 5 Not good for a grandmother s hands that has joint problems 6 Doesn t keep food warm for very long Perhaps going back to the drawing board would help this product 
2 0 Disappointed Maybe in time I will figure this plate out but I cannot get the suction to work and there were no directions with it as to how to take it apart use the suction clean it out It may seem simple but a harried mother needs these details I am disappointed as it is utterly useless to me at least as far as being a stay put dish which is why I purchased it 
1 0 Your child s safety isn t worth saving a few dollars We purchased 2 of these seats to give to the grandparents for when my son came to visit them Right out of the box the seat pad wouldn t stay on the seat and slides around during use I figured I could live with that since it was just a cheap seat anyway After only 5 or 6 uses however the clip that holds the seat belt adjuster to the booster snapped while installing the seat into our second car a few days ago I tried to contact Evenflo to report this problem but they were completely unconcerned about the failure of their product They told me that they only warranty the seat for 90 days from purchase and you have to have proof of purchase They did offer to send me out a replacement part but under the circumstances I don t feel comfortable using the seat at all so I ll be destroying and disposing of it I explained that we were thinking of replacing the seat with a different Evenflo model and asked if a discount coupon was available to reduce the cost of replacing the defective seat but they told me that out of warranty it was no longer their problem Thank goodness this part failed while installing the seat and not during a crash or my son certainly would have been seriously injured We haven t had any problems yet with the other seat but I ll be replacing it anyway just to be safe After their horrible customer service I won t be buying another Evenflo ANYTHING ever again 
2 0 Super convenient but couldn t hold up to solid food smells I ve used the Diaper Dekor since the birth of my now 7 month old daughter and I loved it to begin with Very easy one hand use step on the pedal drop the diaper through the flap very easy to tie off a bag when it became full In the beginning it handled odors well too even smelly diapers didn t cause problems But as soon as I started feeding solid foods things changed It proved completely incapable of containing the ghastly stench of those diapers My daughter s room is at the top of our stairs and the stench didn t just fill the room it flowed out her door and down the stairwell so we were treated to a powerful whiff every time we walked upstairs I took to leaving her window open and the fan on to air out the room during the day and emptying the pail before bedtime at night in order to prevent it from stinking up the house That lasted a week I just bought a new pail a Diaper Genie 2 and I hope that works better 
2 0 Convenient to use but super smelly We had the Diaper Dekor Plus and it seems that I m the only reviewer here so far that has had a terrible problem with it having a bad smell The first couple of months weren t bad but after about 3 months or so it really started to smell bad This horrid smell only got worse with use as time went on We tried everything we could think of to get rid of the smell letting it air out outside cleaning it with bleach or some other cleaning solution putting baking soda in the bottom of the liner and even leaving a small box of baking soda inside the can but outside the liner letting it soak in a bathtub of soap and water we even bought some scented disc type things can be purchased at Babies R Us that you can put in the bottom and it only made the smell worse We continued to use it but frequently had to let it air out or spray it with Lysol or something Eventually we used it less and less and we just threw it away when we moved to a new home a few weeks ago we d had it for almost 2 years We knew there was no way anyone else would want to use it with that smell and knowing they couldn t get rid of it It was a real shame because aside from the smell it was a great product 
1 0 I never got it Well the women that was selling this product decided that after she had already sold me this car seat that she was nt makeing any money off of it so she decided not to sell it to me So I never got this car seat I really don t understand why I need to write a review on it 
1 0 Cannot be made secure After seeing the latest Consumer Reports article on infant car seats I immediately replaced my Britax Companion with a Graco Snugfit The Britax had previously been highly rated but the latest test trashed it We were surprised becuase it is the first seat we have owned on our 3rd kid that really was rock solid snug once installed I bought a Graco Snugfit and I have nothing good to say about it No matter how tight I got the straps attached to the LATCH in my 2006 Honda Odyssey I could still flip the seat up and side to side with very little effort For now I m sticking with the Britax 
1 0 We searched far and wide and thought this was the best infant carseat on the market It s not In our pursuit for ultimate baby items the infant carseat topped our list What s more important than the safety of your first child especially in so unpredicatable a situation as driving Our search led us to this Graco carseat and we added it to our wish list and recieved it as a Christmas gift just before our daughter s birth in January The seat is fairly attractive but its good points stop there It s a bear to install Not because it s complicated but rather because you need an extraordinarily strong man or a woman unlike myself certainly to install the base We ended up taking it to an inspector who spent about 5 minutes tugging on the belts with all his might and then huffed and puffed and told us That should be in there real good now We examined it and asked why the seat was still able to flip up toward the back of the car and he replied Oh they all do that that s normal Unsure but with the safety rating to back it we continued to use it Throughout her first 7 months it was a cumbersome piece of equipment Lots of bumping and banging it about to get it into the car with the baby already in the seat we have 3 4 door sedans a 1992 Subaru Legacy an 80 something Oldsmobile and my mom s 2006 Saturn Ion With the seat already in the car it s a struggle to get the baby in without bumping her head or catching her legs on the sides at least once for me My husband simply can t put her in with the carseat already in the car Not to mention that the seat while installed in the car has never felt especially stable with the exception of my mom s Ion which has the latch system Of course the drawback of the Ion is that my 6 1 husband can barely fit into the front seat because the carseat is so large and cumbersome that he cannot move his seat back and so he is sort of smashed into the dashboard Then in the past week the seat has begun to fall over while we re driving Literally go around a curve look back and her seat s at a 45 degree angle from the backseat of the car My daughter is 8 5 months old still falls a bit below the weight and height limits for the seat We ve checked the belts that secure the seat pulled with all our might and the seat continues to malfuction This is a safety issue if I ve ever seen one With enough force she could end up directly on her side say the force of a side impact in an accident Upon closer inspection I shouldn t be altogether shocked The base of the seat is proportionately much smaller than the top where baby sits Sort of like a wine glass I suppose so it s top heavy and likely the heavier the load on top the greater the likelihood it will topple at the slightest provocation Needless to say we ll begin shopping for a new seat immediately As for the Snugride I would recommend parents think twice before purchasing it I d certainly never consider it for an older vehicle without the latch system and I d still take it for a trial run in a newer one that does have the latch system In hindsight I wish I had shopped around a bit more 
1 0 I Hate This Mirror Thinking of Contacting Fisher Price I bought this mirror because my son hates to ride in the car I thought the lights and music would distract him After about 1 minute of hearing this annoying lady sing I have decided that I would really rather hear my son cry It is far less irritating The remote is completely useless because you have to press the button on the mirror in order for the remote to work What genius engineered that Also it is to heavy and it folds in the center after being in place for about 15 minutes Don t waste your money 
1 0 Did not work I bought this product as I was going on a long trip I put the batteries in the mirror and it did not work I put the batteries in the remote and it still did not work All that would happen is that the little red light would flash and you couldn t even turn it off without taking out the batteries WASTE OF MONEY 
1 0 NOT WORTH THE MONEY CONS WON T STAY IN PLACE I ve tried several times to position this correctly and it always slips out of place and baby is out of view I even sent away for the extra tether thinking that was the problem but no luck WHY A REMOTE Tell me what use the remote is when you have to press the on button which is located ON the mirror and then if you don t use the remote within five minutes to turn it on it automatically shuts off rendering the remote useless for the remainder of your car ride THE IRRITATING SONG too short and plays over and over and over teeth gritting LEARN WHAT I ve also noticed in the teaching mode it doesn t light up the right item with what the voice is saying My poor confused baby will now think a blue car is a boat and a yellow house is a car PROS Now I have 39 99 less to spend on snacks that will hinder me from losing those pregnancy pounds I gained 
1 0 Horrible my baby choked during her feeding These are a complete waste of money The nipples flow too fast for a newborn I tried using them many times during my return to work transition and my daughter choked and cried during each feeding She also swallowed so much air I was burping her for what seemed hours The bottles are too expensive for just storage you can purchase generic breastmilk storage bottles made by evenflow for 3 99 personally I like to use the storage bags laid flat in my freezer they take up less space 
2 0 Not necessary Don t bother with these They are expensive for only 4 bottles and totally unnecessary It is much easier to buy storage bags If you are pumping full time you will be storing alot more than 4 bottles at a time I also found that I did not like these bottles for feeding because they do nothing to prevent air from entering baby s belly and the result is gas or worse colic They also flow too fast for newborns 
1 0 Mine broke I had this when my daughter was first born It worked OK but she seemed pretty curled up in it When she was about 2 months old we were out walking and one of the buckles snapped luckily I had my hand under the sling and she did not fall out or anything I was able to return the product but I bought the Snugli carrier instead I would not recommend this or any other sling that has plastic buckles 
1 0 Huge Disappointment Waste of Money I bought this for my daughter while I was still pregnant thinking that it would be helpful thru the first few months as well as later in terms of being able to keep up with my daily chores and my 2 1 2 y o son It certainly wasn t cheap so I assumed that it would be a good product and appeared to be safe and comfortable for younger infants Don t let the product description fool you Just as it says in some of the other reviews it is very possible for your child to fall when in this sling because of it s crappy strap tightener My daughter was a small newborn only weighing 8lbs at nearly 2 months which was the first time I tried using the sling And even being that small for the 2 minutes I had the sling on I could already tell that the strap was starting to loosen Definitely NOT safe Aside from that this item is so big and bulky that I literally could not even see my daughter in it I might as well have just put a duffel bag over my shoulder and plopped her into it There wouldn t have been much difference between the two I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE THAT YOU DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT I want to get rid of mine since it s brand new but I threw away the box so I can t return it And I absolutely cannot in good concience sell it to anyone else for their child So I have no choice but to just bite my tongue and throw the product in the trash Don t make the same mistake I did 
2 0 Did NOT like it at all This sling was VERY difficult to use I could never get it adjusted correctly and never figured out how to breastfeed in it without being obvious I used this sling for about 6 weeks and it just about killed my shoulder and back It was uncomfortable and not nearly enough padding in the shoulders Plus you still had to carry a diaper bag and or purse so that just added extra weight Don t waste the money I would much rather have another front back carrier they work so much better and are easier to use and feel a LOT safer The only things I did like were the pockets on the strap to keep small things in like paci s keys money and cell 
2 0 Great for newborns I have three baby carriers It seems eccessive but I never found one that really was doing it for me I started with Gracco carrier and it turned out to be a nightmare everytime I had to put the baby inside My son was crying while I was snapping all the 1001 snaps it has there but after that he was stopping crying even though he wasn t looking too confortable When he got older 5 mounths we bought a backpack carrier This is a really really a nice buy We loved it and so did our son The problem with it is that I wouldn t put a baby younger than 5 mounths inside So when my other son was born we tried this new carrier I think that s the best for newborns because they don t have to support any body part More over when the baby sleeps he is in a nice position and they seem to like it even though I though his head was in a weird angle As soon as the baby gets heavier 8 or 9 lbs it s getting a bit uncomfortable mostly if you have I large breast as I do It slips from its place so the head of the child doesn t stand on your shoulder anymore but on your lower chest so when you have a large breast the baby s head is really really in a weird angle I think that it doesn t worth the price for the time you use it Now that my younger son is 5 mounths I don t use it anymore 
2 0 Trap doors break a lot I have owned my Diaper Dekor Plus for 25 months In 2005 I found glowing reports in the Wall Street Journal and most other places It definitely is easy to use and the refills do last quite awhile BUT the trapdoors have broken TWICE I contacted Regal Lager a year ago and they sent a free replacement That free replacement broke less than 6 months later You can t expect it to contain the smell when the trapdoors are always broken This week I contacted Regal Lager again and they said a replacement is 10 I loved this pail until the trapdoors broke Unfortunately it looks like it is a common design flaw as I browse the reviews from the last year or so I am an engineer and I don t know what to say except I am really annoyed that the product is not more durable Regal Lager would do well to spend some time and money to engineer a more robust spring system instead of relying on 10 replacement parts especially since loyalty to diaper pails is so fickle Now I have to decide whether to spend 10 on another replacement try to fix it myself get a different pail or maybe none of the above At what point is enough enough 
1 0 Several flaws I ve owned my Diaper Dekor Plus for just under 2 years At first I thought it worked fine It was easy to deal with and easy to empty The first liner that it came with lasted me 6 months 1 baby using newborn diapers through size 2 s However the unit failed to control odors after about 9 months Since then I ve had to hide it in various places of my home to keep the odor to a minimum Definitely not convenient The unit has one particularly fundamental flaw regarding odor control Unlike the Diaper Champ which allows you to deposit a diaper without opening the container and letting odors escape Diaper Dekor has no such provision It has two trap doors that allow you to drop the diaper in easily and then they are supposed to spring back into place Still no matter how quickly you drop that diaper in and let the top lid fall closed strong odors inevitably escape Also these trap doors are quite flimsy The hinge on one of them recently broke so that the door no longer springs back into its closed position thereby contributing to the odor problem I inquired about a replacement from Regal Lager and they said I could purchase one for 10 Instead I decided to purchase a new Diaper Champ since I ve pretty much had it with this thing Speaking of flimsy there are two other flaws I ve experienced Firstly the plastic foot pedal has cracked and seems loose It still works but I have to wonder for how much longer Also the door on the bottom of the unit that enables you to cut off the bag and remove it does not close very tightly once again contributing to a lack of odor control The door is only held shut by a small plastic latch leaving a significant gap for odors to escape Overall I have not been impressed with Diaper Dekor Plus However contrary to what some people say regarding the liner refills that actually was never one of my bigger complaints I did not find them cost prohibitive at all because you get 3 liners for 20 and I found that 3 liners will last me about 6 months of holding toddler size diapers In the 1 year 9 months that I ve owned this system I ve only had to purchase refills twice The only thing I didn t like about it was that I did find it inconvenient to have to purchase liners online couldn t find any local store that carried them and wait for them to be shipped to me especially when there is no indication of when you will reach the end of your last liner Diaper Dekor is the only system I have used extensively and I would not buy it again nor recommend it to anyone I m hoping my Diaper Champ will serve me better 
1 0 A Waste of Money We bought this diaper pail when our newest baby arrived We had previously used a Diaper Genie that we no longer had it worked fine but was expensive We decided to buy the Diaper Dekor because of the Odor Free Guarantee Don t buy it The guarantee or the pail It stinks up the whole house with just one or two diapers in it We have kept it in the garage and also outside Not convenient Refills are expensive And worse yet my one year old can get DIRTY DIAPERS out of it through the top or get the bag through the door in the front Who designed this thing 
1 0 Not easily foldable I ve bought this tub thinking that I can just fold it up and store it under the sink But that s not how it works It take many steps to fold and unfold it one of them ivolves inflating the seat The mechanism for snapping it in place when it s unfolded looks like it would break if it was used a couple of times Also the plastic inflatable seat smells like all of the plastic inflatable things probably not very pleasant for a little baby I am returning this item 
1 0 Simply put does not work I read Dr Karp s book and decided to buy a swaddling blanket After doing a lot of research and reading a ton of good reviews on this one I decided not to spend the 30+shipping on the miracle blanket but get this instead Boy was that a bad decision We tried a few times and my baby unswaddled herself within seconds Granted we had a big and healthy baby who was strong so maybe if your baby is tiny and or weaker than an average newborn for whatever reason it might work nicely for a while but otherwise don t waste your time with this I ended up buying the miracle blanket and that WORKED Do yourself a favor spend the extra 20 and buy the miracle blanket I could have avoided many sleepless nights if I did that earlier 
1 0 Not Good My infant daughter got her arms free in about 60 seconds It is not a well designed blanket 
1 0 DEFECTIVE This product is nice at first but you ll find yourself time and time again replacing it just so you don t have to put anymore holes in your home I ve bought 5 of them over 4 years We have an expanding family and this things keeps on breaking DO NOT BUY buy something better and higher quality so that you won t have to replace in 6 months PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW IT WILL SAVE YOU 
2 0 Works well then it breaks We had better luck than some the gate lasted about 2 years before the locking mechanism gave out Called customer service and they said it isn t a replaceable part Too bad It was easy enough to install and worked well up until it didn t anymore The click is pretty loud we found ourselves trying to close it two handed to avoid waking up the baby Disappointed it didn t last as long as we needed a gate but my daughter is only 2 1 2 and I still need a gate at the top of the stairs I l be replacing it with a different product obviously 
2 0 Great Until It Breaks Like so many others have said this was a great gate right up until it broke Each time the issue has been the lock freezing in place We are now purchasing our 5th one in 3 years the previous 4 having broken after varying lengths of use Each time a gate has broken we ve pondered what to do because we don t want to drill lots more holes for gates that might be equally disappointing but we dare not go gateless with two toddlers and their not surprising interest in the stairs Argh 
1 0 We went through FOUR gates Please spend your money on a different gate There are nice wooden stair gates out there that seem pricey at first but after going through what we have gone through I wish I would have gotten a different gate We have twin girls in a bi level house A stair gate is a must The 90 day warranty is a joke because naturally each gate broke after 90 days Same problem with all four the knob just wont turn I will say when it worked it was nice But read other reviews and you will see the same problem over and over again Shame on me for buying it again It just broke this past Saturday after six months of use I will contact the manufacturer but as in the past I m sure I won t get anywhere If enough people complain perhaps they will change the design Again please look elsewhere 
1 0 Save your Money As with all other reviews our gate worked well for a while then the latch broke as well There is no way to fix it The company did nothing to help us with the situation except to suggest that we buy an whole new one No thanks I would encourage anyone who has purchased this gate to send your complaints to the company as I am doing Though the company says they have made improvements to the product the gates are still breaking and should be recalled Their representative told me there is no reason to recall the gates since it is not a safety issue however they advertise its use for the top of stairs I called The First Years and they said to send your complaints to Judy Paulette RC2 The First Years 100 Technology Center Dr Suite 2A Stoughton MA 02072 
1 0 Terrible gate This gate only worked for 8 months and the latch broke The company would not replace it because they only offer a 90 day warranty They will not even let you buy a replacement part They want you to buy a entire new gate What a rip off Don t buy this gate it is a piece of trash 
2 0 Nice carrier The baby bjorn is a nice carrier I received one for my baby shower However I hardly used it I thought I would use it a lot but I found I hardly used it after the first 3 months cause my baby weighed too much Before that the many straps made me afraid I was going to drop the baby But probably the same problem for other carriers I was really surprised by how little I used it since I really wanted to carry my bab 
1 0 Do not buy this sheet I wouldn t let my dog sleep on these sheets They are of the worst quality imaginable We took ours back and purchased plain ole porta crib sheets and they fit PERFECTLY I recommend the Koala Baby name brand porta rib sheet They are available at BRU and have elastic all the way around making for a snug fit And the quality is 1000 times improved over the PNP sheets 
1 0 don t bother don t buy this sheet it is not much thicker than a piece of tissue paper spit up would go right through it i have a much better solution for you buy a couple of sheet savers to use in your pack n play they are a couple of less and are sold as especially for baby which is B R US house brand they are great i use them for both my son s crib and for the pack n play they come in a number of colors so you should be able to match them to just about any pattern 
2 0 Not as happy as I had hoped The swing was easy to install and I did not need extra tools or help Unfortunately the tree branch was not exactly horizontal and so it was difficult to make the swing horizontal It was even enough however and I put my daughter in The swing was tilting a little far forward but I could not adjust it The worst part was getting her out The tray was near IMPOSSIBLE to undo from its locked position I guess I did not need to worry about her falling out I was just wondering if I would be able to get her out at all I ll be donating the swing 
1 0 Zero stars Avoid this product at all costs We received this product off of our baby registry a couple of months before our due date and never used it until a week before the delivery It worked the first time but never again I repeat we used it one time and then it stopped working it just would not turn on I asked the retailer for store credit but it was after their return period I then sent a email to The First Years explaining the situation and never received a reply Lousy product 
1 0 stopped working I should have read the reviews I purchased this item and it quit working after a week of normal use 
1 0 Not so great I have this and have used it for about 5 months I have never had problems with it starting but it drives me crazy with the dripping all over the counter and the amount of condensation I am looking for a new sterilizer because of this I do not recommend 
2 0 Worked great at first I bought this right before my daughter was born and have used it every day since she was born 4 months ago A week ago it just stopped working I really liked this steamer and it had served me well but now was just not turning on anymore So I went out and bought the exact same steamer I used it for 2 days and then on the third day yesterday it wouldn t turn on anymore I m taking it back today and getting something else 
1 0 Junk We too had problems with turning the sterilizer on The unit would not turn on when the lever was pressed but several presses got it to work a couple of times After about 6 uses it died completely Not sure what the hard part about making a hotplate that is switched on by depressing a lever like an electric kettle is exactly but these guys found it This unit also left a LOT of condensation in the stuff we sterilized 
1 0 Disappointing I had purchased this sterilizer based on a recommendation from a friend After just a few uses the steamer stopped working When the lever to turn the steamer on was pushed it just wouldn t turn on any more I contacted the First Years manufacturer and to say the least they did have excellent customer service They had no problem replacing the unit Upon receiving the second unit I used the steamer once And because the steamer couldn t hold every thing on the first run I had to run it twice in a row To my disappointment I pressed the lever and again it did not work Frustratingly I pushed the lever several times and then the light finally came on Unless you cool it for about a half hour or more this is how my unit operated I m sure that not every one s experience is the same but this was how mine was I definitely would caution buyers on the product only because this problem occured twice with the units that I have used 
1 0 Piece of I accidentally ordered this one instead of the Kolcraft Universal carrier since they are both called the Universal carrier This car seat carrier is over engineered with too many moving parts that are completely unnecessary Rather than returning it my husband wanted to eat the 59 99 plus shipping by beating it up with a baseball hat We went out and purchased the Kolcraft Universal carrier it is much simpler easier to fold and has a large functional basket underneath the car seat 
1 0 Don t waste your money We tried these after getting one of the portable mats that didn t work out This item too didn t work for us It won t stick it there is a table cloth Then 9 time out of 10 when we would get it stuck our daughter would pull it up with one hand It really ended up being more trouble than it was worth We started carrying a package of cleaning wipes in her bag we wipe down her part of the table really well and let her have at it At 14 months she doesn t really make too much of a mess and if she does we just had an extra couple of bucks for a tip and apologize for the mess on the way out 
2 0 more about safty then comfort I wanted something thick and soft so my baby couldn t feel the plastic under his sheet This one is so thin you can almost see through it There is hardly any quilting Another down side is you have to take the mattress completly out of the crib to put it on It is a safe fit and washes well I ment to give it 3 stars 
2 0 My opinion I was happy when this product arrived It arrived in great time I like the fact that it runs on a 9v battery and has the option of using two head sets It states that it should be used in the last trimester I am now 7 months pregnant and it still wont pick up my babys heart beat I have even went to my appointmets with it thinking I am using it wrong It will pick up my heart beat but not the babys I can t say it doesnt work because every woman is diffrent but it hasnt worked for me and as I mentioned it says to use it in your LAST trimester The greatest thing about this is the cd s I play them for the baby every now and then 
1 0 Baby Universe Use at your own risk I ordered this item I have bought directly from Baby Universe before but now I ve had several problems I ended up cancelling this order because after I inquired to Baby Universe I was told that the item was backordered They didn t know when it would be available I also ordered a JJ Cole Bundle Me Lite from them It arrived fairly quickly but was slashed through by a box cutter I ve been trying to get it exchanged but their customer service is lacking I won t exchange it and am trying to just get a return done now I m not so sure that I would buy from this company They seem to be slipping perhaps they can t quite handle the amount of business they are getting Disappointing Just got an RA number for the item but it has to be shipped back to JJ Cole and who knows when I ll get the item shipped to me They don t even give you the address to ship the returned item to Won t let me do a return This is a bad way to run a business 
1 0 Another vote for NOT SAFE My experience has been similar to that of other reviewers The one movable positioner secures very loosely with a small piece of velcro My two week old daughter managed to slide down in between the positioners and had her face against one of them when I checked her in the middle of the night Honestly the only way a baby would stay on this thing is if they didn t move their arms so perhaps the designers had no children of their own 
1 0 NOT SAFE My baby slid both down and off the side of this I thought it would be a good positioner because it was elevated but instead the right bumper which is detachable does not securely fasten onto the base rather it acted as a swivel and I found that my baby had her head hanging off the side of the positioner I am involved in a SIDS research study and this product alarms me She could have suffocated I am trying to contact the company to report this item please do not buy 
2 0 let down I had been told that these were wonderful to keep your baby safe while sleeping on his side or back But my little man slides down to where his face is between the foam sides This worries me more than if he were to sleep on his stomach 
1 0 Used it once or twice I thought this would be a great way to keep my newborn son s head elevated while helping him feel snug and secure when he slept The first night we used it my husband went in to check on him and he had wiggled his way down so that his head was right between the side supports He was horrified that our son could have suffocated This was after I had made sure our son was snug between the supports and they sat under his armpits I suppose the sleep positioner would work if your baby didn t move at all 
1 0 too many detachable pieces poor design and poor quality material I need something that I can use on top of a regular dresser but this one I don t particularly feel safe to use because it has velcro on sides 6 pieces that wouldn t stay in place when the baby tries to roll on his side Also it has a fold line in the center that is not very comfortable for babies back cushion kinda sinks in that area The diaper cloth cover that came with it is made of cheap looking dirty white fabric It looks used even when its not Which also does not fit snugly in the pad The belt looks flimsy and generally useless especially when the velcro on sides of the pad wiggles around and unstable I purchased another changing pad by Childkraft It is way better than this one just one solid well made piece and so much stable for over the dresser purpose 
1 0 Find a different warmer This wipes warmer dries out the upper wipes overnight The screws in the upper lid rusted after a few weeks The rust dripped down into the wipes container and contaminated the wipes on the bottom I have another wipe warmer by Dex that doesn t seem to dry out the wipes and I have never seen rust 
2 0 Not for inducing lactation I am an adoptive mom that was told that this pump was hospital grade and it has not helped at all therefore I would not reccomend it for those that are trying to induce lactation I liked the concept of this item and it was comfy I had this pump for a year and had to return it to the manucaturer 3 times because the pump body stopped working I would not recomend this pump at least not to adoptive mothers The customer service was awesome though They were understanding and helpful I eventually ended up getting a refund and then buying a medela 
1 0 Mobile only works while playing music so you are FORCED to listen to it it is too LOUD even on the lowest setting IMPORTANT Find a mobile with the option of it working while being silent w out music I thought this mobile was great for the first 5 minutes but then I quickly realized I couldn t get the thing to shut up darn it they didn t put that option on it How can this be It is a 40+ dollar mobile My baby just wanted to see it go but the music and sliding beads put him over the edge This mobile is too loud and the sliding beads are loud as well It stimulates baby too much Even after covering it up and arranging it under the bumper pad it was still too loud The motion is actually quite hypnotizing and great but Tiny Love RUINED it by not putting a silent running feature button on it I d pay 60 for it if it would just be quiet If this mobile worked without sound it would be wonderful As it is now I can t use it that much only when baby is at his happiest Even then the mobile wears him out and ruins his happy state because it is too loud I think I shall pry it open and try to break the speaker I am serious I rated it with one star because I can only use it when my baby is at his most rested and happiest state If he is the least bit tired it overstimulates him and makes him cry 
2 0 It works sorta We have the single but had to make adjustments for it not to flip backward and also to keep it low enough The double has the same issues it s not sturdy enough for even a modest wind 
2 0 Great idea with a design flaw I have the Safari TT Dbl jogger from In Step and I bought this shade because the shade on the stroller is non existent I have seen this product work well on single strollers but it keeps blowing up and back from my canopy with the slighest of breezes so it is not doing such a great job of keeping the sun off my kid s faces I ve used a binder clip to keep it in place but it still blows back more than I think it should 
1 0 Terrible Sun Shade This was the WORST sunshade ever Don t waste your money It is so flimsy that it offers no sun protection at all We used it on our double jogger stroller but it just flopped down into the faces of our babies I do not recommend this product I only gave it a one star because zero star was not an option 
2 0 Doesn t cover entire toilet seat Weak flimsy I just bought the Dora folding potty seat today at Walmart It doesn t cover the entire toilet seat It starts at the front of the toilet and doesn t go all the way to the back The result is that there is no support in the back My daughter is 3 yrs 4 months and this seat is much too weak for her Any movement she makes causes the potty seat to sink in the back I m afraid that if we use it it will soon break and she ll fall in She definitely can t sit back or even sit straight up because it sinks so much I m returning it and I m going to look for something else 
2 0 Not bad its a great price but its VERY small Its unfortunate because it seems well made and folds up nicely but its way too small There s no way 4 kids can comfortable sit at it 
1 0 doesnt look like ill be ordering from amazon anymore well lets see i ordered this product for my sons birthday which by the way was on the 14th of january well i think its the 2nd of feb still hadn t received it but i did get a CHAIR Anyway so i called and canceled when i got the chair the money was never placed back into my account i was told it would be put in on a monday so tuesday i felt safe writing a check that would include that money and my bank went overdrawn for like 200 dollars in fees i realize it was my fault for believing a reputable company like amazon now its been a month and i call youall back and you say that it should be sent out to me this week though this is the only email i get from you how should i rate the damn table when i havent recieved it i mean put yourself in my situaition how would you rate it 
2 0 Safety Concerns Before purchasing this item please check with your safety services division in your state regarding the use of this product with carseats I purchased this item with the hopes of keeping my newborn warm but after I received it I was told by the Director of Safety Services in our state that these items compromise the integrity of the belts in the carseats I also had a very hard time tightening the belts in the carseat because the openings for the belts did not line up well Instead I returned it and purchased a Kiddopotamus which is shearling lined and zips but fits OVER the carseat The Bundle Me item is perfect for strollers but NOT for use with a carseat While I want to keep my baby warm I think it is MUCh more important that she be safe and secure in her seat 
1 0 The hat is so small I don t know who JJ Cole made this hat for my daughter had the tiniest head and it still didn t fit Waste of money 
2 0 size of jj cole baby hat The size stated 3 6 months The baby was 2 months old and the hat was too small Anyone ordering should consider it runs very small Then because I used my credit card to purchase it I was unable to return it and get a refund 
2 0 Adorable but too small Had to return this item It was way too small Forewarned when you order that it won t fit an average baby up to six months I would say it would fit up to 6 weeks at most It is very cute and would be a great addition to a Bundleme cover but the company needs to reanalyze their sizing More disappointing was having to pay shipping return on a 9 item 
2 0 dislike it s a waste of money you can substitute it for any piece of plastic if you have carpet if not don t buy it 
2 0 Not very helpful if you use cloth diapers This seemed like a great idea but it doesn t work very well for cloth diaper users like me I use the top shelf for the wipes warmer and the side pockets for grooming items such as a brush and cotton swabs However since my cloth diapers won t fit into the diaper organizer I m not sure what to put there Because of this there is a lot of wasted space I would not recommend this product if you use cloth diapers 
2 0 Child loves mobile but two were defective Our daughter loves the mobile she laughs every time the peek a boo leaves open to reveal the animals Unfortunately both mobiles that we have bought have failed none of the music buttons will work except the forest sounds The sound is also very soft 
1 0 Too Heavy Too Big and Too Bulky This stroller is way to heavy too long steering is very difficult and too bulky it is huge when folded Try something else 
2 0 read if you plan on using the AC adapter Monitor itself works fine but not if you plan on using the AC adapter Fisher Price customer service recommends that the AC adapter should not be plugged into the reciever for more than 13 hours at a time or the rechargeable battery and or unit will be damaged In my mind that makes the product useless if you intend on using the AC adapter you ll have to remember to unplug it every morning or risk wrecking the thing the fisher price rep actually told me I d fry it 
1 0 VeryProblematic This monitor interferes with our cordless phones on all channels a shrill noise emits when the phone rings or when you talk on it ALso it beeps out of range even when at distances much less than the stated 800 feet from our daughter s bedroom to the kitchen I would definitely not recommend this product and had I not lost the receipt I would have returned it 
1 0 Expensive Doesn t = A Good Baby Monitor 52 00 less weighted down by cash and I was on my way with what was the most expensive non video monitor available at the local Target Surely being the most ridiculously expensive with all the highlighted bubbles beside features like clear reception and no interference I would be able to hear the baby s every move from every household location and beyond We hooked it up in short order turned it on and SCREEEECH Apparently a volume level that might permit us to hear the baby one room away would also cause some sort of massive interference between monitor and reciever We tried shutting that monitor off and plugging the second in the kitchen outlet the entire length of the house away No screeching but it sounded like someone speaking from inside a tin can Totally distorted useless You couldn t tell if the baby was banging on her crib bars or if someone was moving heavy machinery about in her bedroom We ve packed it carefully back into the box and are hoping Target will take it back without a fight Needless to say I d steer clear of this one Our 20 Safety First monitor far surpasses this one even on its last leg 
1 0 Not long enough to actually block sun I was excited to find a canopy for my daughters car seat to get the sun out of her eyes The ad said universal fit Well it fit but second size up car seats are taller and kind of lean back When you attach the canopy it doesent pull forward enough to block any sun A hat better serves my child then this aparatus It now sits in the garage with all the other failed baby devices 
2 0 Leave the batteries out for potty training I bought this potty because I thought it was SOOOO cute looking like a real toilet with the toilet paper roll and everything I still think it s cute but just like many other reviewers say all the music and talking and sounds are WAY too distracting to be able to actually learn potty training And like other reviewers say the sensor is NOT accurate so it s always saying the child went potty when they didn t Very confusing for a child who s trying to learn to really go in the potty We re currently potty training our daughter and we have three training potties this one an older one that has a soft seat and one that fits into the ring of the big toilet and this potty is the last one my daughter will pick when it s potty time When we first got it she had a blast with it using it as a toy and nothing more Now that the newness has worn off she shows very little interest in it If I had it to do over I would have given her this potty without the batteries in it and without her even knowing it had the capability to make all the sounds Here s a suggestion Don t put in the batteries until your child has mastered potty training Then as a reward for his her accomplishment put batteries in and show your child what the potty can do With the training part out of the way the sounds won t be such a distraction anymore 
2 0 Too Much Fun The seat is fun to play with but that is also the problem My son was so distracted with the features and songs he NEVER sat still long enough to go to the bathroom 
1 0 A HUGE disappointment We bought this thinking our son would love the neaty gadgets and sounds We had several major issues with it 1 The pee guard It doesn t really latch on and STAY on Our son was irritated with the pee guard we he was first learning and kept ripping it off the seat then throwing it accross the room As luck would have it when I would go retrieve the item he would pee and since there was no guard the pee would go everywhere BUT in the seat pot To resolve this I had to use special adhesive for plastics super glue didn t work AT ALL which took 24 hours to set which interuppted our potty training It also turned part of the seat yellow which made it look dirty even when it was not But I had no choice the guard HAD to stay on 2 The sensors were too sensitive and would go off even when he did nothing He could just sdjust his position in the seat and it would tell him he did a great job going potty even though he never went 3 The sounds and gadgets were TOO distracting He wanted to play with them and would turn around in the seat and this would sometimes be when he was about to pee and it would end up all over me the floor whatever was nearby I finally just took the batteries out and told him it was broken 4 When he was ready to use the actual potty we took it apart per direction and placed it on top of one of our toilet seats Everytime he pees I have to hold down his bits because the seat does not go all the way down to make a seal between the potty seat and the toilet seat thus it leaks out from under the potty seat onto the toilet seat and then down the front of the toilet and onto his pants underware etc The pee guard is useless for this feature Sometimes even when I do hold his stuff down if he wiggles or moves then he is not in position There is only one position he can be in or it will go all over the seat and down the toilet and onto his clothes It was the most expensive toilet seat available at the store We thought we would be getting a top quality seat from begining to end of our son s potty training experience The price is what motivated me to try and make it work for us Finally I threw the darned thing in the garbage and just got a circo toilet seat with a pee guard for the toilets It was the least expensive toilet adapter and it turned out to be the best If we have another child I am going to get the basic toilet seat no frills and the inexpensive toilet adapter Both together were a fraction of what we paid for this seat and would be a million times less aggrevating DON T waste your money 
2 0 Didn t work for us I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds He hated this carrier because he couldn t turn around and see the world I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly I tried numerous positions There isn t a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn t move around I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 There is a 5 return charge 
1 0 Piece of JUNK I wish I could give this stroller 0 stars because it doesn t even deserve the one I gave it It s a light stroller there the only plus Where do I start how about how after using it for one week the wheel fell off and they wanted to charge me shipping to replace it because I didn t have a reciept it was shower gift After arguing with their lack luster service team and proving with a birth ceritficate that my daughter was only a week old and that is as long as I had been using it they shipped a new wheel free of charge Fast forward to our vacation in Hawaii The sun shade is non existent and I had to use a light blanket draped over the hood to protect my baby from the sun The steering stinks I have spilled drinks all over me and my baby because the cup holder moves AND doesn t hold anything but a small water bottle The basket is hard to get to and holds nothing easily because it is so awkward My husband and I went on a hike and came to the end of the path that wasn t paved He asked me Are you worried about leaving the stroller so we can continue on the sand I replied PLEASE I hope someone takes this piece of 8 8 End of story I wouldn t invest in the Pliko P3 either Don t get me started in the Peg Perego car seat either JUNK 
1 0 Poor Stroller Quality I bought this stroller from my daughter thinking we could transition into it around 6 months She hated it The stroller lacked back support and she would slide down in the seat She would cry within five minutes of riding in the stroller After several months of use the wheel fell off Also the stroller is hard to stear You need both arms on the stroller to push If you try to guide it with one hand then it goes in another direction Even now that she is 16 months old and able to support her own body she prefers other strollers I bought a cheap stroller from Wal Mart and have been ten times more satisfied This stroller was recommended by my brother who has twins and uses the Aria tandam which I assume is better I would not recommend it to another consumer 
1 0 Poor Quality Hard to Steer We purchased this stroller because of the weight 10lbs ease of lifting it out of the car Two weeks after purchasing the stroller we noticed that the stitching on the sun shade was already coming apart The shade is barely big enough to shield anything let alone provide protection for the child We received a replacement cover but was advised that this would be a one time replacement The tiny cup holder that was not big enough to hold a bottle has already broken off Our 8 mo old is 17 lbs and the stroller is very difficult to maneuver For straight paths great If you have to take a turn or change direction quickly do NOT plan on having the stroller transition with your directional shift The front wheels get stuck and you have to kick them back forward or the stroller will not steer correctly when you are going straight Having had a Pliko previously for my 4 yr old we thought we could trust the name of Peg Perego Unless you are seeking a light weight stroller that does not maneuver well we woud not recommend this stroller to anyone 
2 0 Better stollers out there I bought this stroller last year when it went on sale at a local story Luckily it was a floor model so it was even further discounted I bought it because it was lightweight had a front tray adult drink holder and was in a very stylish orange color I was looking for a stroller with all the features of my full size Gracco but light weight and smaller to put in my trunk Well after a couple weeks I changed back to my umbrella stroller and use my Graco for longer trips Here are the negatives I experienced with the Peg Prego Aria Poor steering Can not handle quick turns Sun shade only works for direct overhead sun 5 point harness is poorly designed The plastic hook is always coming undone and gets tangled My drink holder broke Overpriced for features and quality My positives are Nice looking Easy to fold Lightweight I keep this stroller in our attic now as an extra stroller for when we have company Thankfully it folds up small and does not take up too much room I would not buy a Peg Prego again 
2 0 Not practical for an on the go family When we first received this stroller we loved it It handled well very smooth easy turns could be directed with one hand My one complaint was that the handle was too short for someone with longer legs But as we started using it more and more we found it was not very user friendly For one the way it opened was not intuitive We had to push it out and forward while pulling up on levers on each side of the handle bar Forget trying to do this while holding a baby Also the canopy was too small and doesn t meet the baby carrier canopy when used as a travel system As a result to keep the sun off baby we needed an extra blanket These were minor inconveniences but the real trouble started when my son outgrew the baby carrier and began riding in the stroller solo We quickly realized how stupidly designed the harness straps were They simply slid into a clip on the back support so my active son could easily move forward and unclip the straps He was still held in the harness but he was able to move about a little too freely and could easily lean over or forward to grab the wheels Too after about a year and a half of daily use the handling deteriorated The wheels stick when climbing hills and when turning and I constantly have to backtrack to get them realigned 
1 0 Poor poor poor stroller Somehow we ended up with no less than three strollers a nice Zooper 3 wheel outdoors stroller a MacLaren umbrella stroller and in the middle this red Peg Perego Aria stroller We have had nothing but bad news with this Aria stroller What a clunker As an Italian I am ashamed to say this confirms to me the stereotype that they can make nothing that works but everything looks fabulous I am only being slightly facetious This stroller is very sleek and stylish and light weight but that is where it all ends The biggest flaw is the poor handling wheels Pushing and steering is a constant battle Sometimes it just doesn t want to go I have really tried to inspect where the problem is and it does not look like the wheels stick Rather the whole body seems to flex too much when you push the stroller Just gently rock the stroller side to side and you can see what I mean Other nits include the Aria stickers coming loose and eventually needing to be torn off and the baby s cup holder being both too shallow and too easily removable But the biggest problem is the handling it is not pleasant and we never use it anymore 
1 0 Don t like it much My son hated this mat at first then he played in with it for about 5 days after that it got old Mighty quickly My son is now about to make 5 months old and he doesn t even want to look at it Waste of money for me 
2 0 Skeptical of Tummy Time Mats I got so excited when I saw this tummy time mat My enthusiasm was hedged when I read that the water pouch needed to be EMPTIED DAILY If had known that little detail I would not have registered for this mat I must also confer that the neat little toys do stick together bummer Honestly now I am skeptical of any tummy time mat I think my boys prefer a brightly colored patterned blanket toys within reach and lots of parent encouragement to stimulate their tummy time needs Better off spending the money elsewhere 
2 0 2 Strikes I was initially very happy with this product We purchased it to transition our 2 year old to a double bed However the plastic hinge bracket broke after several months of use Since I liked the product I thought maybe I didn t have it adjusted correctly and bought a second one It too broke so I m now looking for a sturdier alternative 
2 0 poor quality I bought this for my son who was just over 2 years old at the time Within about 9 or 10 months the railing broke at the plastic hinge Obviously since this is major stress point for the product it cannot be fixed with just some heavy duty glue I was disappointed that this railing did not last longer 
1 0 find a better sling My neighbor had the Nojo and liked it so I was going to get one too I tried hers but I couldn t get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which didn t seem safe and hurt my back I thought I could order a different size but found it only comes in one size I then read all the reviews here and followed someone s advice and ordered a from babymoon slings It fit me better I m petite and was a lot easier to use and prettier I think it makes a big difference to get a sling that s not bulky and comes in sizes I don t get why they use so much padding in the nojo it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings 
1 0 impossible I registered for this sling and was thrilled when I received it as a shower gift I couldn t wait to use it When my son was about 3 weeks old I tried to put him in it We both instantly hated it Its far too bulky to use with an infant and it doesn t adjust small enough to fit my frame I m 5 6 quot and FAR from skinny I kept it thinking that my son would eventually fit in it and perhaps as he got bigger I d be able to wear it WRONG I wish I d brought it back when I could still return it My son is now 11 months old and we still can t use this sling There s no way he can sit in it securely He hates being held but can t walk yet so I was really hoping we could use this but it still doesn t fit me and my 24 pound son isn t held safely in it He can wiggle his way out in less than 3 seconds I m expecting again and hoping I can find something much better than this for this baby 
1 0 Waste of money There are so many other sling out there Don t waste your timeor money on this I hated the padding as it was bulky constricting and hot It was also impossible to adjust I got a couple of slings from www equanimitybaby com and one from www peppermint com and love these Bottom line check out the other options this one is a waste of 
1 0 Uggh Nojo is a no go This is by far the worst sling I have ever tried The padding is bulky and hot It is impossible to adjust Total waste of money I bought a pouch from www equanimitybaby com and it was perfect easy to use and very comfy The bottom line is there are many other options out here besides this peice of junk If you can t use this sling its not you its the sling 
1 0 Love it or hate it I think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby Everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams He is an easy going fellow but he hasn t liked being held to closely He wants his freedom and this doesn t give much freedom to a newborn Also the quot training quot video is more of a promotional advertisement I had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it 
2 0 Battery Problems A friend gave this to me for my 6 month old daughter the walker itself is wonderful but the light and sound feature is just the worst as others have said it dies after about 2 months and the battery is non replacable My daughter loved the sounds and now they just die and warble and I can t stand it If you buy it don t get it for the music lights they will let you down 
2 0 Poor Design on Sounds N Lights Feature I would have given this walker 5 stars the first couple of weeks The walker seemed great for the price it was easy to maneuver and the baby loved it Unfortunately the design is terrible on the Sounds N Lights feature It began fading out before the baby had time to become bored with it After much frustration trying to get to the battery compartment to replace it we discovered it is not designed for replacement at all The internal battery is soldered in place Once it loses it s original charge you are left with a dismal fading off of the sound and a potentially unhappy baby 
1 0 Do not use this item crib death danger If you research the toxic gas theory for crib death which has been around for 15 years you will see that this item can produce toxic nerve gases just like crib mattresses can This product is not safe at all no matter what they call it Get a BabeSafe mattress cover to prevent toxic nerve gases from getting to your baby and use only 100 cotton on top of that between your baby and the mattress cover Do not use polyester fleece or acrylic blankets or comforters and use 100 cotton blankets Run from this product 
1 0 RETURNED PAD LEFT MESH IMPRINT ON FACE The Breathe Safe Padded Sheet also left a mesh imprint on my baby s face Placing a sheet over the Breathe safe pad defeats the purpose of lessening the current routine 1 Untying bumper guard moving it out of the way 2 Struggling to pull out heavy mattress from crib 3 Removing washing sheet mattress pad 4 Wiping off mattress with soap water 5 Replacing sheet mattress pad 6 Returning heavy mattress to crib 7 Re arranging dust ruffle 8 Re tying bumper guard Other than that it seemed like a good idea Searching for a better product 
2 0 Good to have but not necessary Got this for my then newborn and thought it was a life saver until she started soiling it months later and then realized it isn t all that easy to get on and off With 8 snap on straps it s a hassle to move the crib away from the wall and snap on off on a regular basis I realized changing the crib sheet was just easier With crib mattresses being vinyl covered why do we need waterproof sheets anyway I just slip off her fitted sheet and wipe up any wetness off the vinyl so simple Sometimes good marketing convinces us that we need useless products By the way two of the straps broke off in the wash thank God it was after I realized I didn t need this anyway 
1 0 Odor problem When we first bought our baby s mattress it did not have any unusual odors at all We washed the Ultimate Mattress Pad before using it but after a short time we began to smell an odor on the mattress that became stronger with time We finally replaced the mattress and once again had a mattress that was stench free By this time we had purchased an organic mattress pad as well Use of the organic did not cause any problem but since we had not yet put two and two together not smart we put the Ultimate Mattress Pad on our new mattress just one time and sure enough it began to smell We now use only organic mattress pads and only one side of the mattress The side that never came in contact with the Ultimate Mattress Pad smells just fine but the side that we did use it on has a stench you don t want your baby sleeping on I guess you need to make sure you put a sheet between the mattress pad and the crib We actually put the sheet over the mattress pad because the surface seemed so rough that we didn t want our little boy sleeping directly on it When we did try that he woke up with a mesh imprinted face 
2 0 Scares Baby This worked great for a couple months Then the monkey that moves up and down started making a loud clicking noise The gears must be slipping My poor baby gets really excited to kick the parrot to make the monkey move then gets scared at the loud clicking popping noise and starts crying Really sad 
1 0 Terrible product totally defective I bought two of these and had to return both of them because they both were defective After a few days they started making a terrible loud clicking sound when one of the parts moved up and down This product is a piece of junk 
2 0 Not for a baby with acid reflux This is a very cute bouncer chair However I feel it was poorly designed It sets the baby almost laying down so it is difficult to play with the toys In addition our baby has acid reflux and it was not a good chair for him because it sets him back too far We had to find one that set more upright 
1 0 LEAK EXPENSIVE These bottle leak they re expensive and you can t mix formula in them unless you buy the special tops or it sprays formula all over Don t waist you re money they re a pain to wash too many pieces and they just plain leak After 9 months of using them I m ready to toss all 30 of my bottles and start over with something else Plus even with the top on if they fall over in your diaper bag the whole bottle will leak all over everything 
1 0 Great for a house in the woods This machine is not loud enough I have 2 machines this one that is in the babies room and a different machine made by lifewise in my boys room My boys sleep through anything the dog the door bell whatever it is but this machine just doesn t cut it unless you live in a sound proof house 
2 0 Too quiet This was way too quiet even on it s loudest setting My infant didn t benefit from it at all The sounds are fine and not too repetative as with some machines but even in a small room really small I found it too quiet to be effective 
1 0 Didn t work for my newborn I bought this hoping it would help my newborn calm down or sleep the same way a hair dryer or vacuum cleaner work so well This thing doesn t have a white noise sound but I thought maybe the Womb sound might work However the volume was not even close to loud enough to compare to a hair dryer It s just become a toy for my older child who likes to play with the other sounds 
1 0 It would be great if you could hear it The AC adaptor and sound selections are great but the sound is way too low even on the highest level I foolishly bought this knowing that others thought it was too low but it really is SO LOW you can t hear it 4 feet away Turned out to be a 20 buck paperweight for me 
1 0 Please do not buy DANGEROUS My 8 1 2 mo granddaughter got her leg stuck between the bars in the middle of the night I ve got the correct bumper pads etc but babies do move She had bruises on her ankle and was throwing up she was so upset I ve only had the crib 1 week she s gotten her leg stuck 2 times We caught it within minutes and it frightens me to think that she could have gone longer 
1 0 Frustrating isn t the beginning I have thrown this thing more than once trying to put it together I have never had so much trouble with any of my daughter s other contraptions I guess I ll have to sic my husband on it 
1 0 Tots in MInd oh really Very poor construction and does not fit most sleigh cribs as advertised on the box This company should be ashamed of themselves for charging 70 for this product The concept is a good idea and could be so much better but this company fails in execution Tots in Mind definately has something in mind however it is not your Tots Buyer beware 
1 0 Does not fit crib No Returns allowed The crib tent did not fit our crib It s not deep enough or long enough I called to try and send it back and they do not allow this item to be returned I am very disatisfied with this company and the product 
1 0 Beware they don t allow returns Bought this crib tent after reading all the fine print about returns Besides toilet seats etc which Allegro Medical does not allow for returns due to hygenic reasons Allegro Medical made it appear that you can make returns within 30 days Not when I tried to return this Allegro Medical said all returns were up to their discretion They would not allow me to return this despite the fact I didn t even open the box Very misleading will never buy from Allegro Medical again 
1 0 Don t waste your money The aspirator has no suction power and only irritated my son The nail clippers are not sharp enough to cut a newborns soft nails I use my own Revlon clipper especially since I am comfortable with the feel of it already The thermometer is sooo slow I get make an educated guess faster The case is cute and I am sure the medicine droppers are ok haven t needed those yet But all in all I threw half of this kit in the garbage 
1 0 Useless The one star is for the bag it comes in You can take these things along with you but honestly how many of these things will you really need Maybe just two of them the nail clippers and the bulb syringe I have the set given to me as a gift I say just buy these things separately it s cheaper and then go out and buy a simple bag to take along with you it s more practical than buying this whole set 
2 0 OKAY I was so anxious to get this and when I finally did my daughter was just not that interested with it She barely plays with it I was hoping that with this she would spend more time on her tummy because she normally hates that Maybe that s why she didn t care much for this 
1 0 Not worth the money I bought this play gym because I figured it was a baby einstein play gym it has to be good plus the reviews I read were good Our local BabiesR Us didn t have displays of the playgyms so I had no idea that this gym would suck I HATE IT My son only loves it cause I put other toys on there Notice the pictures that people have shared who state they love this play gym and so does their babies that the toys hanging on the playgyms aren t the ones that originally came with the gym Why buy extra toys I paid 69 for this gym it should come with more toys I tried to return this for the Gym by Tiny Love that comes with lights music and lots of toys but when I opened the product the original packaging got messed up and I was unable to return or exchange What a waste of money for me I received another playgym that my friend bought for 20 from my baby shower That only came with 3 toys and hung all these toys on there and my son loves that too My point is that you don t have to spend so much money on a playgym Your babies will love anything as long as there is lots to look at OR if you are going to spend money find one with lots of toys so that you dont have to buy extra toys 
1 0 Overpriced and Leaks I bought this product thinking it was different than the standard square playmats I like the scalloped edges the pillow and the colorful pictures but I am disappointed in the playmat overall The pat mat leaks so bad that I can t use it The playmat is cute but it isn t functional not to mention WAY OVERPRICED The arches have netting which I think freaks my son out He has never liked this playmat I have a square one that he seems to enjoy more 
1 0 Suction Tabs don t stay We bought this product so that I could see my 6 month old son from the front seat But everytime I put the rear view mirror on the back window it would pop off and hit my son in the face The blinds don t stay up either Their suctions don t stay if there is any moisture on your windows and when you shut your car door 
1 0 Too big velcro not strong enough Get a Miracle Blanket I received a SwaddleMe as a gift The first problem I discovered was that even with the small size I had received that when I wrapped it around my son the velcro pieces didn t meet In other words the wrap was too large I attached the velcro at the tightest position possible but my son still managed to squeeze his little arms out the neck not a pretty sight The next problem I ran into is that while the bottom of the wrap is supposed to support the baby s feet like a womb my son out of frustration to get out of it would just bust the bottom completely out so that his legs were completely exposed In fact he tore the velcro that secures the bottom pouch to the top A friend recommended the Miracle Blanket and although it looks like a straightjacket it works and he has never busted out of it It is one size fits all because of its design which is helpful as well 
2 0 I guess it s ok We have this stroller and aren t really thrilled with it In fact we re going to buy a different double stroller to replace it Our children are aged 2 years and 4 months While the 3 month old was still in his car seat carrier this stroller worked well for him He s now out grown the carrier and we ve put him in the seat of the stroller The shoulder straps are too tight for him and don t adjust well The seat isn t padded well and there is no head support Our 2 year old does not like the back of the stroller With the infant in the front we have to keep it reclined so my daughter has to lean forward if she s sitting in the back She hates standing on it because she is very short and she can t see anything She would much prefer to sit in the front We find that the basket in the bottom is practically useless We can t reach it so we never use it There is no cup holder or tray for the parents It is also a bit bulky when folded and heavy So I think that we will put this stroller in storage until the kids are older and get a double stroller with 2 seats for now 
2 0 Not well equipped The idea of the stroller is great However after purchasing and using it it isn t well equipped There is no cup holders the basket for storage is not easy to get to and isn t even big enough to hold a diaper bag let alone any bags when shopping I also have to take it apart to even fit it in my trunk Need less to say I don t even use it much b c it is too hard to maneuver with two kids I wasted my money on this Graco has a new one out that looks so much better and much for equipped for on the go Moms like me Wish I would have waited It is the same price Wish I could have exchanged it 
1 0 Disapponting product I was very disappointed in this liner It seemed like such a great idea but I could not get it to stick to the tub when there was any more than 2 inches of water in the bath Once the water level rose so did the liner We ended up returning this product to Amazon 
2 0 wow best baby shower gift I brought this gift for my son and his wife their daughter was born on 2 21 07 when I questioned them as to why they had not used the bottle warmer they just didn t get around to using it I insisted they read the directions and start using it the next day my son stated wow mom this is the best baby shower gift they could not believe how fast the bottle warmer worked how much timed it saved them as new parents and the milk was heated at just the right temperature each time my son was so thankful that I insisted he use the product 
1 0 small thick and leaky I have tried several types of pads and these are the worst They are very small thick and do not hold much causing them to overflow and leak I d recommend the Gerber pads 
1 0 Itchy I have no idea why these itch but I have tried on multiple occasions to wear these pads and found myself wanting to claw my skin when they are in use I haven t had that problem with any other brand and will NOT buy these again I m not continuing to wear the ones left in the box I have but they make fine sponges for mopping up small spills 
1 0 Not impressed I will not buy these again They are tiny thick and do not tapper on the edges This means you will see the lines thru your shirts The adhesive isn t enough and the pads shifted durring the night I highly recommend the Lansinoh or Medela they cover more are thinner and stick better 
2 0 Soak up but don t absorb I went through an entire box in two days The fill with milk in no time and have to be changed constantly Plus the diameter of these are much smaller than any others Try Gerber or Lansinoh 
1 0 Make nipples hurt I used these pads when I first started nursing They did a good job of keeping me from leaking onto my clothes However my nipples were incredibly sore When I took my baby to her first appt the pediatrician suggested cloth pads WHAT A DIFFERENCE Yes they did cause me to leak through a little but that was needed WHen ALL the moisture from let down is pooled up against your breast it causes sore nipples for some moms Don t use these Buy some cloth ones instead that will allow your nipples to breath I use the Imse Vimse 
1 0 Waste of money This accessory system does not fit my Kohlcraft umbrella stroller I can find a place to put the parent cupholder but there is no place at all to put the child s snack tray The stroller will not close when it is attached anywhere on the stroller The whole purpose of spending the money on this system which was considerably more expensive than others in the store was for my child to have a snack tray Therefore it s going back to the store There are plenty of other cup accessories out there that are far cheaper than this even the Prince Lionheart cupholder alone was very expensive The product itself is also very cheaply made The s hooks look so flimsy I wouldn t trust them again they sell thicker sturdier s hooks that look like they will work much better than this so that s what I ll purchase Plus the parent cupholder is also extremely flimsy already the arms have fallen off several times and that was just moving it from the table to the kitchen counter Thirdly I m not sure if it was the clips that came in my packet perhaps a defect or if they are all made this way but it is extremely difficult to get the screws into the clips and then they didn t fasten correctly No matter how I tried I worked on it for close to an hour and I consider myself pretty good at these things I could not get the clips to tighten properly They continued to be loose even with using the smaller screws Perhaps my stroller tubing is too small Very unlikely but it just might be the case This is going back to the store where I will purchase the insulated parent cupholder for 5 a package of two thick s hooks for 3 and my child will have to learn to deal with holding her snack cup and straw cup I will save myself 10 a headache and backache from attempting to continue to get this on correctly and my child will get the added bonus of learning to be responsible for her own items Do yourself a favor and don t bother with this product 
1 0 Oh Gimmie a break If I could rate it no stars I would Let me tell you that my son is now 8 and is perfectly normal especially as a baby but I ll tell you what YOU DON T NEED A MICROWAVE technically they are dangerous for the fomula the safest thing to use is room tempature distilled water pour that in with the powdered formula give it HARD shake then your all set It s that easy don t be lazy and take away vital nutrients from your baby by microwaving their formula 
2 0 lid doesn t close I got this sterilizer because of the Avent name My main complaint is that the lid doesn t lock into the base when closing You have to use alot of power for it to close I have to place it on the floor and stand on it for the sides to lock 
1 0 spend the money sometimes you just have to spend the money to get the superior product buy from pottery barn and order additional covers from them as well same pillow but the fleece like cover exclusively at pottery barn is actual luxury more comfortable for mom and baby wears amazingly well due to thickness and stains lift right out we have used one cover continuously for over 4 months and it s still like new in another class from the chintzie alternatives offered at other stores 
1 0 Shredded Ripped after 1 Wash These slipcovers are tooooo expensive to fall apart after one washing I bought two of these one ripped and the other is coming apart from the inside I constantly have to cut the strings 
1 0 WATCH OUT I was very excited to try out this tent at the beach We got it set up and my 4 month old was taking a nap in it out of the sun Everything was great until the cabana suddenly collapsed on him One of the supports had broken It was the first time I d used it I was very disappointed 
1 0 Thought it was great I received this as a gift and loved it at first But after using it just 3 times one of the support poles snapped when we were putting it up I was bummed too because I loved it so much If you do buy it be careful when you handle it it s not as durable as it seems 
1 0 Diaper Dekor Refills What a challenge We cannot get the refill bags into our Diaper Dekor Plus Are there different size bags depending on whether you got the regular or plus unit The lady in the store said NO so we bought 3 boxes of extra refills Now we cant use any of them What should we do 
1 0 Refills don t work I can t begin to convey the frustration I felt when trying to use the refill I struggled for 20 minutes trying to slip the too tight bag over the cartridge The Diaper Dekor works wonderfully as a single use item but at about 30 40 a pop it is the most expensive garbage can outside of Ted Kozolowski s apartment The printed instructions were clear it s just that they product does not do what it supposed to do 
2 0 Have an afternoon to waste Some assembly is required I consider myself to be fairly skilled at assmebling things I have an engineering degree I ve put together bikes furniture installed car stereos and this thing was an absolute pain especially for such a simple device I found the instructions to be woefully inadequate I found the images to be useless and the instructions leave out fairly critical steps like how to orient various pieces together Takes 10 times longer to install then it would if they had taken the effort to provide more guidance It was aggravating enough to make me go straight to Amazon upon finishing to leave feedback I didn t even buy it from Amazon The gate itself is fine 
2 0 A Royal Pain I purchased this potty for my son I thought that the royal turns would give him an interest in using it it didn t He used it once and cried He would not sit on it again I was very disappointed The potty would sing for now reason sometimes and EVERY TIME you would touch it I do not recommend 
2 0 Don t waste your money I would recommend just buying one that sits on top of the toilet and a stepping stool You don t have to clean 2 out of the cup and you ll probably already have a stepping stool so that your child can reach the sink It really saves a lot of hastle My mother in law and I both bought this potty for my daughter One for her house and one for mine It was hard for me to put together my Mo in Law couldn t get it together at all It makes a loud trumpet sound every time water passes a sensor inside the toilet that scared my daughter terribly at first but luckily it took a lot of batteries to work and it died The other thing I d like to point out is if your child actually likes the noise and the batteries die they are almost impossible to replace In order to replace them you have to take almost the whole toilet apart which again is very hard to put back together We got ours on sale so I don t mind the expenditure When you are buying these things just remember it is only a toilet that they will be using for a year or so tops 
1 0 Royal Potty Did not work at all had to return it We prefer the Tinkle Toons potty with a moisture sensor the motion sensor on the royal potty did not work 
1 0 Terrible Product My husband and I were so excited to receive this as a gift when our daughter was born He has been using it up to now and I used it this week for the first time Our daughter is 9 1 2 months and 21 pounds It was easy enough to get it on and off my back alone The problem is the horrible pain it caused while walking and the excrutiating neck pain I have after just a two mile walk I can t wait to get rid of this and buy a quality carrier that allows you to enjoy a walk I would NEVER recommend that someone buys this 
1 0 HORRIBLE BACKPACK I bought this for my son who is almost 1 year old I ended up returning it 3 days later I am a petite woman 5 2 and this item was totally uncomfortable I still have bruises under my arms from this item I followed all directions and no matter what could not get it properly positioned as shown in the pictures of the manual It bounced on my back and the straps dug into my armpits I would NOT reccomend this item for anyone who is as petite as I am NOT WORTH THE MONE 
2 0 Baby needs to work hard to jump The good thing is that except for the spring the jumper is pretty nice Unfortunately the spring is THE most important part and it is not good It has low elasticity and our baby did not like it as he had to push really hard to get anything exciting out of it We gave it away for free and will buy a different one for our new baby girl 
2 0 I returned this for the version with the tray This seemed like the original johnny jump up I had for my first child 13 years ago We loved that one so I got this one for my baby and after spending almost half an hour figuring out how to put it together it didn t work very well It just didn t seem as SPRINGY as it should be I ended up returning it and getting the 40 version with the tray instead the Jump Go People have complained about the tray pinching baby s fingers against the doorway but we have a wide doorway so it works well and is a lot springier Also our little guy likes the toy tray on the Jump Go version a lot 
1 0 waste of money don t bother Overpriced Not what I expected You can t really used it because it s too small for big bellied pregnant women Uncomfortable The velcro gets in the way of sleeping comfy YUCk 
1 0 Worthless We bought 2 of these and neither one keeps the wipes moist or warm Save your mone 
1 0 Poor Engineering I unpacked this warmer which we received as a gift did not use one with our first child I got as far as filling the removable reservoir with water before I decided to return it You literally fill a plastic reservoir with water and turn it upside down so that the lid to the reservoir which slides on has no rubber seal or other watertight implements can leak everywhere Judging by the other comments I m glad it leaked before I had a chance to use it and burn up a box of wipes 
1 0 Don t waste your money I should have checked this out before registering for it The lid won t stay shut the bottom wipes brown the unit leaks I contacted the manufacturer When telling him about the lid not staying shut he asked are you sure there isn t a ghost in the house they offered to replace it if I returned it to them offering to compensate for shipping charges with some of their other products After reading these reviews I think I ll just trash this unit and buy a different manufacturers product 
1 0 Horrible Wipe Warmer We received the wipe warmer as a gift and our baby was happy with the warm wipes that is until I lifted the unit up and found that it had damaged the wood changing table it was on because water leaks from the bottom Upon further inspection I noticed that the bottom wipes were all burnt and brown even though I had filled it up at least once a day It seems that all the water going in was subsequently coming out the bottom Originally I had thought that perhaps I had a defective model but after searching online I noticed that a vast number of parents had the same experience we had and now have decided to buy a different brand I did keep the water filled and still had a poor experience Save your money and invest in a different brand 
1 0 Too much trouble This wipe warmer is more trouble than it s worth The water resevoir would not hold the water and kept leaking all over the changing table As a result the wipes would dry out and the warmer burnt the wipes I emailed the manufacturer regarding this product to see if they had a fix or if my product was defective They failed to respond 
1 0 HORRIBLE This wipes warmer was to replace the one that got broken in our move We use cloth wipes it has burned a few smells moldy no matter what I have done to clean it never happened with any of our other wipes warmers won t stay closed It actually got so hot it melted the moisture dispenser and melted burned the little foamish piece in it Then last night we refilled it one last time before we could head out today to buy a new different one and leaked water all over the changing table GET a different warmer this one is awful 
1 0 Wipe Cooker We actually went through two of these in two weeks The first one cooked the bottom 20+ wipes so we returned it thinking that it was simply defective The second one did the exact same thing We wasted so many wipes with this warmer since they were cooked We have even emailed the company and sent them pictures but never heard back from them Save your money 
1 0 This wipes warmer does not work I have 2 wipes warmers one for upstairs and one for downstairs At one point I had this particular wipes warmer and it just does not work mine took FOREVER to warm the wipes and would only warm the bottom section same as previous reviews the lid would not stay shut and the wipes would not pop up properly I have two other different brands of wipes warmers that work fine Do not waste your money on the Munchkin warmer 
1 0 Poor quality design This wipe warmer does not function simply because the lid won t stay closed I waste time trying to get the lid closed while my baby is crying on the changing table The wipes cool off and dry out because of the poorly designed and flimsy lid Don t buy this wipe warmer there are better ones out there 
2 0 Don t waste your money I bought this for my baby who at 6 months was barely 16 lbs She didn t hit the 20lb mark until she was past 18 months old so she was rear facing for a long time She loved kicking this but the mirror never worked well I could adjust it and within a day or two it was all over and I couldn t see my baby again The water seemed to evaporate and now just over a year later has hardly any water in it We can t find any leaks but there s little water The little fish inside stuck together right away and we could never get them back apart Sadly we just gave up on it by her first birthday It never worked for us as a mirror to see her and the toy part while it was fun to kick at was just worthless My sister in law wanted one for my niece but I am glad she saw how worthless mine was before wasting her money on this 
1 0 Cute but It Smells Funny I picked this up at my Babies R Us store because it looked like so much fun for my baby and with the mirror I would be able to keep an eye on her From the minute I brought it home it smelled awful like artificial grapes I have aired it out in our garage for two months now and it still stinks At this point I am just going to throw it out because I can t imagine having that smell in my car I have since been back to Babies R Us to see if the other ones they have smell as bad and they do Don t buy it without smelling it 
2 0 Baby can not play with it This toy is very cute however my 8 month baby has difficulty kicking the feet pads to make the fish move It ends up moving all around and I can not see in the mirror The plus is that it is something for her to look at instead of just the seat 
1 0 Hazard I just took a course from the Florida Highway Safety program I thought something like this would be wonderful especially for little ones in the rear facing position I was dead wrong Anything put in front of on the side of in fact anything in the car is a real safety hazard in case of a crash This toy even latched down poses a threat to the baby He or she may just have to be bored for a while On long trips have Mom or Dad or sibling in the back seat with baby for entertainment 
1 0 Not good for chubby babies This is very cute but my baby is chubby It gave him a cut and bruises on both legs The seat isn t big enough for chubby babies so it cut his legs off I wish it was bigger cause this is really cute So if you have a chubby baby avoid this because it can cause bruising and cuts 
2 0 Enh I bought these because they come with foam inserts to help collect leakage I m a 38 DD and use the large flange for my medela pump so I too found the sharp edge that contacts the breast was cutting into my sore areola nipple The ameda shells had a round edge and were much more comfortable although leakage city My sore nipples got nearly instantly better using my brest friend great proper latch and treatment for a mild yeast infection Hope this helps 
1 0 Diaper Genie is too hard to use I received a Diaper Genie as a shower gift and gave it a chance After 8 weeks we replaced it with a Diaper Champ which is much better at containing odor The problem we had with the Genie is that it is too hard to use You re supposed to put the diaper halfway into a neck thing then twist twice When we did this about 50 of the time the twists would come undone leaving the room exposed to the diaper smell Neither my husband or I could determine how to fix this once it happened and ended up emptying the darn thing at least daily The Diaper Champ however is one handed operation which the Genie is not you can t open the lid with one hand holding a baby and the 2nd a diaper It contains the smell incredibly well as long as you follow the directions fold your diapers into balls and don t leave smelly stuff exposed to mess up the lid We actually keep a small roll of diaper disposal bags for the blowouts which we have about once a week to keep the Champ clean It has been a wonderful new baby tool 
1 0 It did not work for me either Years ago when the Diaper Genie first hit the market I was given one as a gift for my baby shower It did not work the way I thought it would The Genie was supposed to dispose of the diapers by sealing them so that no odor would be present This was not the case The smell seemed to linger in the room longer then just disposing of the diapers as normal in the trash Also the smell that the Genie left after opening the Genie to dispose of the long tied knots of diapers was horrible I had to clean it several times just to get the smell out Needless to say when I had my second child and once again received one It remained in the box and it still sits in the box after five years I would definitely not recommend this item for new moms Too much hassle 
1 0 Using the Diaper Genie Stinks I didn t use mine for the first two weeks of my daughter s life because it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too complicated I figured it out sort of but to this day when I push the diaper in the film rips Then when it comes time to change the film the top doesn t cut the film so I have to use scissors My sister in law told me to register for it Why did I listen to her Don t buy it Dont register for it It s not worth it I want a refund 
2 0 Maybe good in the past but not now This WOULD be a great space saver but now that Gerber has started using the plastic tubs instead of the jars we never used it AT ALL Now Gerber makes their own Feeding Center to accommodate their tubs and I LOVE it 
2 0 Have a lot of room I thought this would be a great idea to keep the jars in but really it took up too much counter space I ended up putting it away and putting the jars into all the nooks and crannies in my cupboards as I personally do not have the space to waste for something that is completely unnecessary I found Save your money 
1 0 TERRIBLE I bought this potty seat for my daughter and I took into consideration that this was supposed to fit regular and elongated toilets The second I put my daughter on it she nearly fell into the toilet The seat is not very stable and as far as being able to go on most toilets that is a lie My toilet seat is as regular as they come and it still falls through A waste of money and a safety hazard 
2 0 Disappointment I bought this product for childproofing purposes I was disappointed to learn upon delivery that the manufacturer s instructions state not to install gate against drywall which was not in the item description so i cannot use it where i needed it Also the unlocking mechanism is quite difficult to open and close especially with a small child in your arms 
1 0 Great gate if you have a strong healthy back and always have two hands available This is a great gate if you have a strong healthy back and always have two hands available But how many people with kids have both of those It was great at keeping my baby in the room but my 4 year old couldn t open it and neither could her grandma And it made me and my husband want to cuss It is back in the box and in the return pile Don t waste your money 
2 0 Didn t Work For Our Baby The quality of this swaddle blanket is very good I m not complaining about that The problem we ve had with our newborn is that as he squirms the blanket rides up and hits his cheeks This triggers his newborn rooting instinct which makes him search around frantically for a nipple to suck on Instead of lulling him to sleep it gets him frantic with hunger I recommend the sleep sac from this same company instead of this item We own two of them and they keep our baby very cozy and warm 
1 0 not designed well I bought this sling when I was still pregnant After my son was born I tried putting him in it but he just didn t seem secure so i threw it in the back of the closet When he turned one I dug it out again thinking it would work well as a hip carrier but it is even worse for this I had him in this a total of five minutes and it was awful First of all the buckles should not be placed so they hit the wearer either on the neck or the shoulder bone it is very painful with a heavier baby I took him out of it and will never touch the thing again 
2 0 Just a pretty face not much more for us at least we were so excited by the idea of this product and the orange burgandy colors but when it come down to it we just couldn t ever adjust it comfortably enough for ourselves or the baby we used and liked a hand me down baby bjorn and breast friend sling much better sigh such a waste of a pretty sling 
1 0 Horrible My son was 7 lbs 1 oz when he was born and 20 inches long He wasnt the tiniest baby I tried putting him in the sling and it just looks like he s falling and being enveloped by this huge orange thing It s the WORST product ever I am definitely NOT using it and will probably donate it to goodwill 
1 0 Cheap piece of junk I bought this seat to travel with my toddler and found it extremely annoying and difficult to use The tray stuck and never loosened up and was difficult to get my child in and out of Also it was close to impossible to keep clean unless you unstrapped it and took it completely apart after every use It was very unwieldy to travel with It folded up but didn t stay together and so was not very portable Because it was so cumbersome it ended up getting dropped on a laminate floor and promptly broke The cheap plastic its made of shattered at the bottom corner where the side and seat fit so now it is in the garbage where it belongs I only owned it for five months and used it barely three times a month for the average Yes it was cheap but as they say the poor man buys everything twice and now I m out fifteen dollars and have to buy another booster 
2 0 Good toy but beware for younger children We bought this toy for our 10 month old daughter who just love to make noise with anything She also loves to stick things in her mouth because she s teething One day she was trying to stick the shaker with the bells in her mouth the metal from one of the bells cut her lip We let her play with the other ones still but the one with the bells is put away at least until she s older 
1 0 NOT Worth It Don t buy this stroller The only good thing about it is that you won t be sad if you leave it somewhere The restraints don t restrain at all My one year old twins barely stay in it so when we re in a store they can reach very far to pull down all sorts of things not safe The stroller barely fits through regular door ways and I mean barely fits It does not maneuver well at all and is difficult to stear The adult drink cup holder snaps off when struggling to go through doors and I don t have to describe what a mess that is I m just lucky I don t drink hot coffee otherwise I would be suing the manufacturer for burns to the children There is no storage The saddle bags can hold a few small things but you should only use it for things you don t mind the children being able to reach This stroller is not only a nuisance it has potentially dangerous features so please don t buy it 
2 0 COULD be a great stroller but NOT BUILT to last Exactly 3 months after I bought this stroller a bracket on the back that holds the bars together popped off making it dangerous and impossible to use Luckily I bought the extended warranty and will receive a full refund in store warranty expired just 3 days previously When I tested the stroller at the store I thought it seemed very flimsy and felt it wouldn t last long which is why I bought the warranty but the idea of having such a great stroller is why I decided to take the chance PROS for the stroller very light compact and easy to fold easy to maneuver great for tall people like me don t have to hunch over to reach the handles There are some nice little things too like ventilation for the back a headrest a cup holder and a reclining position CONS are only rated for carrying children under 40 lbs in each seat didn t know this when I purchased it I have a 35 lb 2 y o and a newborn so we don t exceed the limit there but my 42 lb 3 1 2 y o can t use it The canopy doesn t cover kids well from the shade only the face and that s a big deal when living in southern AZ or if it s raining and when the seat is reclined for my newborn the canopy doesn t even cover her head I have to clip on a blanket and drape it over My 2 y o practically is too big for it her head extends above the top of the seat And finally the general construction of the stroller is not sturdy Overall this COULD be a GREAT stroller but it s just not sturdy obviously not it broke but one would expect that with a brand name Jeep it would be built better We only use it for walks and going out no off trail stuff we used it about 10 times before it broke My umbrella stroller I bought 6 years ago is still going strong why can t they make this just as well built I would love this stroller if it were just built better 
2 0 Didn t last long Heed the bad reviews I think the problem may be Medela s definition of occasional use I used this pump about once every other day or two for a month and a half and apparently that is deemed more than occasional because the pump yields very little now about half of what it used to So this is yet another review that leads to the same conclusion I should have gotten a different pump 
2 0 How to decide between this and a more expensive pump I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high end 250+ models In an effort to save money I started with this one But I quickly realized I d made a mistake it took forever to even get one ounce of milk I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it I just wish I d gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model here are my two cents TRY THIS ONE IF You have a very abundant milk supply You only plan to pump one or twice a month You wouldn t mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended period INVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER END MODEL IF You re going back to work Your milk supply is medium to low You plan to pump more than two or three times per month You are opposed to giving your baby any formula ever with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency Also it s worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you re done unlike this one 
1 0 Unhappy Mom I was very disappointed with this pump It was very loud and stopped working after 3 weeks and I only used it once a day Even more disappointing was the companys return policy You have to ship it to them at your expense wait for them to send you a new one and return that one to the store Do not waste your time 
1 0 Not recommended for multiples Rent a hospital grade Medalia pump You wont be sorr 
1 0 DON T BUY IF YOU PUMP MORE THAN ONCE A DAY This was the second pump I purchased I was hoping that it would turn out better than the first brand I bought This pump is a pain in the neck to put together and the pump that is not hooked to the AC plug in is much weaker than the other side The motor died out after 2 weeks of use This pump is not meant for everyday use I just bought a Medala and I hope to have a better expeirence with it 
2 0 Not comfortable That would be one of my problems with this pump It hurt it took forever I did not have a good expereince with this pump 
1 0 BAD PRODUCT I wish I would have read the reviews on this before I bought the pump This is a bad breast pump I couldn t get anything out of my breasts with this except for sore nipples It has very poor suction is a pain to put together and is uncomfortable to use So don t waste your time and money buy something different If I could have rated this a negative I would have 
1 0 Garbage This is the worst pump you could buy I have gone through 3 of them because the motor breaks down It also has put me behind in what my daughter is drinking while I am at work PLEASE don t waste your money I also spoke with hospitals and they mentioned that they have many many complaints about this product If you don t believe the bad reviews call the hospital and they will tell you the same thing I recently got a new pump from a friend and found that the evenflow is by far the LOUDEST pump on the planet there is no descreet pumping for you if you own this product 
1 0 they should be sued I swear this is the crime The worst product in the western hemisphere Never never buy this piece of garbage 
1 0 A big bulky disappointment I used to have a Graco Metrolite stroller and I really liked it However I gave it to a relative because it went with an infant travel system I bought a used Jeep Liberty Stroller thinking it would be an upgrade and boy was I wrong I will simply list the things I do not like 1 It is quite bulky when folded especially compared to other strollers I ve had 2 It is heavy awkward to carry and there s nowhere apparent to grab it Handles I don t see any 3 All 3 tires went flat My local bike shop charged about 30 to replace them all your mileage may vary 4 My daughter was not interested in the steering wheel and since the battery that the previous owner left in it had corroded the sounds didn t work so I can t comment on those 5 It CREAKS when you push it I m not sure where the sound is coming from but we oiled the wheels and it still creaks 6 The MP3 player which is the cool factor and the only reason my husband has prevented me from getting rid of the stroller has these small speakers near the baby s head so in order to really hear the music if you re playing music YOU like you have to turn it up And the volume doesn t go very high For the same money you could probably buy some portable powered speakers and clip them to the stroller 
2 0 Good looking but not functional I bought this chair because it got such good reviews and looks great I was so sick of seeing fish butterflies and primary colors all over our house the neutral tones were a sight for sore eyes But I ve been so disappointed in this chair s function With all the nooks and crannies in the buckles and straps it s impossible to keep clean The straps and parts of the vinyl seat became so caked with food that I threw them into the washing machine even though the tags says not to The worst part of the seat is the tray It s ridiculously wide too big for my dishwasher AND my kitchen sink And both are full sized The way my toddler smears food on the tray there s no way I could just wipe it with a rag and be done with it Washing it turns into an exercise in hosing down my countertops with the sink sprayer Oh well at least they get clean too Also I agree with other reviewers that it s really difficult to slide the tray into place I wind up shaking it around and my poor toddler looks at me like I m torturing him On the bright side the recline feature is wonderful for infants and babies who are just getting the hang of sitting up Overall if I had it to do over again I d pick a simple Fisher Price 
1 0 Ugh hate it Is it just me I m a big believer in reading Amazon reviews customers rarely lead me astray But this chair which we bought specifically because of everyone s praise is miserable I don t understand why it got such high marks The tray is way too huge for easy cleaning and it rather than the chair has a leg separator which means you can t set it down anywhere without it tipping all over the place We ve also found that the tray can be EXTREMELY difficult to hook onto the chair and doesn t push in towards the baby s belly far enough In addition the clips that attach the harness are filled with grooves and can t be cleaned well so they re beyond gross just after a few feedings Of all the baby things we wish we d never bought this is number one on the list I can t help feeling that if we d just closed our eyes and pointed at random to a high chair we would have done better than this thing The only reason it gets ONE star is because I appreciate the non obnoxious print it s nice to not have something on display with clowns or fish or teddy bears or bright colors 
2 0 Tray is HUGE but not in a good way Ok this chair is fine except for two very important things One the tray is huge and not in a good way in a really hard to clean and maneuver kind of way Also the two trays that fit on top that are dishwasher safe ARE TOO BIG TO FIT IN THE DISHWASHER So what s the point Two it has the little thing that separates the legs on the TRAY rather than on the chair making it impossible to set down anywhere when it s full of food and your baby is yelling to get out of the chair Everything else about the chair is great but you can find these other features in just about any other high chair I m bought the one that s made by the famous toy maker and love it 
1 0 Pretty much useless I could not get this mirror to angle properly in our Honda CR V to give a view of the baby and when my wife held the mirror on the seat as a test the image of the baby was so small that I could discern no details about what the baby was doing The mirror is also distorting The image only appears focused and in the appropriate dimensions if you look DIRECTLY into the center of the mirror 
2 0 Takes a bit of maneuvering for minivans infant car seats I bought this so I could check to make sure my baby was ok since he can t hold his head up quite yet and so I could see my cute baby s face in the mirror while driving in our Honda Odyssey minivan He s in an infant car seat though and I couldn t see anything at all either from my mirror or turning around to look into his mirror I finally figured out I had to somehow raise the headrest and fit the mirror on the headrest I m still worried about it flying off but it does work now Perhaps it would work on the window but I didn t bother On the window it would be held by suction and I really don t want that thing possibly flying off and hitting my baby 
1 0 Not Very Helpful I thought that this would be really helpful when it comes to making sure that I have clean nipples for my baby Unfortunately when you read the instructions for most latex nipples they aren t dishwasher safe and you are instructed to hand wash So having a dishwasher container for nipples is pretty useless I use mine as a container that I can airdry my handwashed nipples in Don t waste your money 
1 0 Waste of Money I thought I would love this but it just takes too much time and energy Germs can go through cloth once it is wet from saliva Then this material has been rubbed all over the cart and then I put it in my car etc I just don t see the difference in that and not using it My hands touch it baby s hands touch it etc I have enough to keep track of with a bag baby wallet cell phone I just dont have enough to keep track of a giagantic piece of material My grocery store has those sanitary wipes outside the store by the carts and I wipe down the handle bar that is far more effective against germs You are better off buying a 3 thing of purel hand cleaner than this bulky ineffective cloth 
1 0 Didn t work The maternity support didn t stay in place It kept bunching up in one spot and didn t help my back at all I would not reccommend anyone to waste their money on this product 
2 0 Awkward to use and not supportive enough Very disappointed I bought this in hopes of relief from pain and pressure after I pulled a pelvic muscle at about 30 weeks pregnant It has not helped me and has been annoying The L XL is too large but the S M was too small The material folds and rolls under my clothes and there s nowhere for the extra flap of material in front to go I get sweaty underneath it and it s difficult to get my underwear back under it after using the bathroom which I m obviously doing frequently at 34 weeks This was the only pregnancy belt available at the shop I went to I wish I d had the chance to try on others to compare 
2 0 Better than nothing but not the best choice I bought this just before my third trimester when the back pain from lifting a 30 lb two year old all day long became absolutely unbearable It wasn t quite what I was expecting and came nowhere near giving me the support in my back and belly that I was looking for It helped a teeny tiny bit but the construction is such that it just can t provide much support it s a little heavier weight than a bra with no additional elastic I bought the other one by loving comfort and was thrilled It s a little bit more intimidating perhaps and less uh sexy but it really works in all the ways that this one didn t It slings my belly up nicely and takes over the work for my pained muscles Ahhhhh 
1 0 Not the best maternity support item This item is misleading because it runs VERY small I am a pre pregnancy size 6 and I ordered the s m size based on the waistline WRONG I am in my 35th week of pregnancy and this thing barely would fit around my lower abdomen Not only does it run small but it also fold and wrinkles anytime I move so it is not much help If you are shorter or petite the waistband is VERY wide in the back and can be ill fitting does not conform to the curve of your spine It is definately made for taller longer torso women aka 6 ft models I would go with another type of support if given another chance 
1 0 not for the full figured mothers to be If I could have given this no stars I would have This product in L XL only fits a pre pregnancy 28 34 waist And in sizes that only goes up to a 18 So now I m on the search for something a little bit bigger So if your pre pregnancy size is any bigger then a 16 on the safe side dont waste your money or time by getting this 
1 0 DANGEROUS DELTA SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THIS PRODUCT I have owned the bed and it is very DANGEROUS for a child I am stunned that this product is still on the market while it is very cute and fairly priced you hardly get what you pay for My daughter loved the look of this her first big girl bed that was until it fell to pieces with her in IT The metal rails that are to hold the bed together and the matress in place are not properly planned out If you can even manage to get this bed built which is difficult much more so than it seems at first the metal support bars fall out when the child gets into the bed it is flimsy poorly designed dissapointing and DANGEROUS delta should be ashamed 
1 0 Very upset I am so disgusted that I woke at 5am on black friday to drive 12 miles to walmart to purchase a Dora toddler bed I held the Dora toddler bed until christmas when on Christmas eve I went to put it together and the pieces were package wrong and I was unable to assemble the bed at all I ended up returning the bed in exchange fr nothing I found out that they no longer carry the bed 
1 0 dora deserves better wow cheap plastic poorly routed holes took 1 2 an hour to finally reach the conclusion that the screws could not align properly due to bad construction sent it back my daughter loved the Dora picture and was very sad that she couldn t keep it 
1 0 Parents please read I purchased this bed online last year It looks great and as we all know our daughters love Dora However the bed was a disaster to put together and if your not handy you would problably give up The rods that come with the bed do not stay in the holes and for a very active 3 year old this bed will not last 3 months 60 br 62 What a waste of money invest a bed that your child can growth with and something that will withstand the active lifestyle of the average child 
1 0 Not 10 tall as advertised My son who was used to using a wood stool 8 tall with slick wood feet fell climbing up on this because the top foot area is too small and it tipped on him It s only 6 wide on top Not much room for clumsy toddlers to turn around on If you push it in toward the toilet there is NOTHING left for the child to stand on If you leave it out then it takes up more room and the arc design is a waste Getting down he also started to fall because it was such a narrow top His feet still dangled as he sat on the toilet not coming near the top of this 8 1 2 tall stool This is advertised as being 10 tall actually 8 1 2 14 long correct but top surface is only 11 1 2 and 10 wide also correct but again it is only 6 wide on top The rubber feet are great for non skid purposes but that s the only positive thing I have to say about this 
2 0 Slow Delivery From Target Direct Nine days from MN to PA seems too long perhaps Target Direct got process problems I AM NOT SATISIFIED got the same three pack of bottles which I bought at the same time as this gift pack at my local CVS for 1 50 less and did not have to wait nine days for it 
1 0 Not for my son I registered for these bottles I am a new mom and thought the variety was great We used the stage one nipple and my son was able to suck down his formula with no problem infact way to quick He would struggle with feeding time He was so gassy and had horrible reflux that during feeding he would arch his back stffin his body and cry I did have a recommendation to switch to the Dr Brown bottles which made a huge diffrence However he was still spiting up and still a little gassy just not as bad and it was managable their stage 1 nipples were to small and the stage two were to big We had gone on a camping trip and I bought the Playtex disposable bottles for easier cleaning I also had done some research on these bottles and found several people liked them better then the Dr Brown So I tried them and my son is doing much better he dosen t even spit up anymore So if you like the ventair I think you would like the disposable much better My sons Dr wanted to put him on an antacid but I was not comfortable with giving him medication at such a young age I wanted to see if I could solve the problem which I have done completly with the Playtex disposable bottles 
1 0 Could not get to work I thought that these would be great but could never get them to work right Sometimes they would flow sometimes not I would have to take the bottom off to make it work and then remember to put it back on after using them or dump it all over To many pieces to much trouble I would be upset and my baby would be also Switched to Avent and loving it 
2 0 leaky bottle These bottles leak after a few months and it s hard to find new parts for the botttom of the bottle You almost have to buy more bottles to get new parts when they leak 
1 0 rickety piece of junk We ordered this gate with the special attachments for our staircase First of all we had to order 4 different pieces to make it work since they make you order each little piece separately We spent all night putting it together and it didn t work for us The actual gate is very small I don t see how it would be big enough for any opening Even with the extension kit it was still not long enough The extension kit is so rickety that it just kept falling apart It is a very poor design and way overpriced We spent over 150 with shipping and all of the extras we had to buy for this piece of junk that just kept falling apart Save your money and buy a different gate 
1 0 Product sucks I purchased this gate to keep my daughter out of the kitchen Unfortunately every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it which makes it impossible to close with one hand Even if you don t care about the one hand feature it is still a hassle to adjust I do not suggest buying this gate 
1 0 Didn t fit my doorway Unfortunately despite the fact that it advertises that it will fit any doorway I have high baseboards on each side of the opening and only one side of the gate adjusts to accomodate high baseboards It was not sturdy at all returned it 
1 0 what a waste of money I purchased this gate thinking in would be perfect for a high traffic area I was totally wrong Every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it which makes in impossible to open and close with one hand Forget it if you have to get through in a hurry cause it needs to be readjust to open AND close it Plus the gray bumper on mine is loose so if I can get the top bracket to fit correctly the bottom one is to lose and not secure I have to get on my hands and knees to readjust it correctly so I can close it only to go through the same readjusting hassle in a few minutes I would have returned this gate but I trashed the box before I installed it 
1 0 useless This gate is almost totally useless unless your doorways and walls are all perfectly plumb and square AND happen to fit the arbitrary slots where the gate will allow you to engage the lock that is 
1 0 super thin I thought this would be great for the size The changing pad is just a very thin piece of plastic It provides no padding at all The case itself is padded Why didn t they use the padding on the changing pad instead of the case Very uncomfortable for baby It is basically like laying out a piece of paper I d rather use those small padded things that come with most diaper bags 
1 0 Unsafe product I had tried this for my newborn and I think this product is unsafe and not sturdy The base of the seat is very wobbley it would help to have suction cups on the bottom And you do have to fill your tub about half way in order for your child to stay warm Also when I put my baby in the seat and he is 12 lbs the seat tipped backwards I can imagine that it would be worse when my child is heaviear and moves around more I do not think this product is safe It would make a great product if they included a baby tub with it So I returned the product and ended up with the 4 in 1 bath station from Safety First that worked well with my first child 
2 0 Doesnt fit on our crib The bumper was very cute and colorful and I was excited to put it on the baby s crib until I put it on no matter how I tried to fit it onto the crib it is a white spindle Jenny Lind crib full size it fit very akwardly and never quite right There were large spaces where it should have fit snugly around the inside of the crib I was very disappointed since it is very colorful and matches the sheet and comforter we received as gifts 
1 0 Cute but unsafe I really thought these were the cutest bumper pads but after hearing over and over again how you shouldn t use bumper pads because of risk of suffication I decided it wouldn t be worth the risk to put them on the crib I don t think there are enough ties on them to hold them securely for one and even if there were I wouldn t be comfortable with the thought of my daughter getting her head caught up under them She has been able to scoot across her crib since she was a newborn so there was never an ideal time to use these Again cute for the nursery set up pre baby but I wouldn t use afterwards 
2 0 Very Dissapointed I am a previous Britax owner I purchased the Britax Roundabout for my daughter when she was 4 months At 18 months she was only 5 inches from outgrowing it Since we had such a plesant experience with the roundabout we decided to stay with the Britax brand and purchase the Marathon in the Olivia print I was very dissapointed I had a major issue with the straps comming loose while we were driving When we would get to our destination the straps were so loose there was virtually nothing holding her into her seat A huge scare for any parent at the thought of what could happen when you slam on your brakes It also lacked the supurb comfort that britax boasts of My daughter was never as comfortable in the marathon as she was in her roundabout The rubber things that go over the straps were also incredibly annoying The constantly slid down out of place and by the end of the trip the chest clip was in my childs lap That coupled with the straps comming loose were defentially not expected of britax high saftey standards I went through quite the fiaso returning this seat and after 3 returns I bought the Eddie Bauer seat instead So far I have no complaints I wouldn t waste my money on this Buy the roundabout if you want Britax name but please dont bother with this Marathon 
2 0 Not Great This was given to us as a present but I would have never bought it for myself Here are the problems 1 we have a platform bed and you cannot shorten the height so it was worthless as a cosleeper We still tried to use it as a bassinet but 2 the mattress is so thin and uncomfortable our daughter would cry when you put her in it I tried to put extra padding which worked ok but still not great 3 Once she was bigger it would have been nice if this converted to a deeper thing like a pack and play to use in the living room but the bassinet part is fixed I would have been happier with a regular pack and play which had a removable bassinet Ultimately we happily gave it away after about 5 months 
2 0 Mattress is like sleeping on a rock I loved this item at face value it looks good the materials are good quality it feels secure and the premise of the functionality of the bed was what I wanted because I planned on breastfeeding my newborn and wanted her close by I was proud of my purchase and showed it to many of my friends before the baby came Well the mattress that comes with it is so hard that my baby won t sleep in it She won t nap in it and when I put her down all she does is cry I ve tried everything to get her to sleep in this thing because it would be so helpful if she would but she won t sleep in it at all I ve even tried making it softer by putting blankets down on the board of a mattress and covering this with a receiving blanket that I tuck in the sides something I don t want to do because of the SIDS factor and that doesn t even help it s still too hard of a surface Now my baby is sleeping in bed with me and I can t get any sleep because I m afraid of rolling over on her or her rolling off of the bed If they d just make the mattress more comfortable for the baby this would be a perfect product and I d rate it a 5 but because it s virtally useless to me and my baby due to the mattress board I have to rate it only 2 stars I m so let down by this product 
2 0 Busting out This is a great product for a few weeks then the velcro gets really weak and your child will be busting out I go in to find my son with both arms out and one leg out No matter how tight I make the blanket the velcro comes apart I encourage you to buy their other SwaddleMe blanket with the larger velcro flap 
1 0 Too difficult This product was a waste of my money It was very difficult to put on and very difficult to use My husband tore it off the day after we got it I would rather use duck tape then this product 
1 0 Toilet lock I was really unhappy with this lock It not only kept the one year old from opening the lid but kept everyone else in the house from opening it as well 
1 0 Not soft jersey cotton as advertised I received this crib sheet today and am returning it tomorrow Although the tag reads 100 cotton it is most certainly not the soft 100 jersey cotton advertised The print is cute but I was looking for something a little softer and warmer now that the snow is falling I gave this item 1 star because of the false advertising but if one is looking for a nice regular cotton crib sheet this would probably be okay 
1 0 Not convenient or useful Just as the other mothers have stated nothing about this pump is beneficial It was given to me by a lactation nurse but it was more trouble than it was worth Only once was I able to pump more than one ounce it took almost an hour and I hurt so much afterward nursing my son was agonizing I only needed it occassionally but this was such a waste of time I bought the pump in style which is amazing This is not comparable to the more expensive Medela pumps so if you want something that works with little discomfort invenst in the pump in style or similar model Don t waste your money even if it is cheap 
1 0 WASTE OF TIME LUCKY FOR ME I DIDN T PAY FOR THIS PUMP BUT THE HOSPITAL GAVE IT TO ME I COULD ONLY GET TWO DROPS OF MILK FOR EVERY TEN PUMPS WHAT A WASTE OF TIME YOU WOULD FIGURE THE HOSPITAL WOULD KNOW IF THE PUMP WORKED 
1 0 DO NOT USE THIS PUMP This pump was refered to me by the hospital where I had my first son So since I got it and used it My breast hurt worse using this pump then when I was engorged It was one of the worst experiances I was under the impression that this was suppose to help with day to day with a new baby I connot recommend enough to NOT use this one I am know expecting again and looking for a pump I know that I will not go by hospital recommendation again 
1 0 Worst Experience Ever I bought this pump because it had the medela name and I thought it was reliable I was wrong This is the worst pump in the world Everything the other poster said is true This is the worst breastpump I would NOT recommend this breastpump to anyone 
2 0 Too much like a car seat I recently purchased this booster as well as the Britax Starriser booster seat I have two cars two toddlers and an infant My children argue over who gets to ride in the Starriser For some reason they are not as comfortable in the Parkway My theory is that it is too much like a car seat rather than a booster and they feel too snug in it They even look uncomfortable in it The one advantage of the Parkway over the Starriser is the increase neck protection if they should fall asleep If I had to do it over I would have purchased two of the Starrisers instead of the Parkway BTW I purchased the Britax Companion for my infant and I LOVE it 
1 0 Poor Quality Control We purchased Storkcraft s Rochester Stages Crib in Natural Aspen Changing table 5 Drawer Dresser 3 Drawer Dresser 2 side units left and right and a hutch Every single piece of furniture that we ve gotten from Storkcraft is damaged in some way nicks and scratches and paint on a lot of the pieces On the side panel of the 5 drawer dresser the piece is completely cracked It s obvious that Storkcraft has no quality control We re in the process of deciding whether or not we re going to return all of the furniture or just get replacement parts and or a new unit All I m going to say is don t waste your time on purchasing Storkcraft furniture 
1 0 DON T BUY I ordered this crib almost a month ago and I couldn t be more disappointed Every single piece was damaged somehow either chipped cracked discolored or stained I will NEVER buy a Storkcraft piece EVER AGAIN Don t waste your time and money on this crib 
1 0 ugly and cheap and very un happy I looked amazing on the computer but let me tell you it was Ugly we had recived it my mail and it was cheap plastic fake wood Needless to say it went back I also was upset by the way it was delivered it was left on my front patio blocking my door in the pouring rain So i am sure the crib was wet as well 
1 0 I should have paid attention to the reviews My daughter placed this crib on her registry mainly because of the price She didn t want anyone spending 500 00 on a crib and this one matched the style she was looking for I found this set up at a Depot store and it was beautiful and sturdy but didn t come in natural So I went home and ordered it online It arrived 4 days before the shower 8 days early from ETA but it was shattered The first 3 pieces we looked at were split chipped crushed Quite a surprize considering the box wasn t in bad shape We decided to return it and buy a more expensive model at a local specialty store Amazon s return policy was amazing a click on the mouse and the next day UPS picks up No packing labels to print no lugging big heavy items to post office very simple Amazon gets 5 stars Storkcraft 0 
1 0 Extremely Poor Crafsmanship We purchased the crib armoire dresser w tower it took 5 wks for this to be shipped to us Once we received it we opened it only to find that each box contained 2 3 severely cracked pieces After inspecting them we found that the dmg wasn t caused by packaging but poor craftsmanship Most pieces were assembled using a nailgun some of the nails were even bent The cracking stemmed from areas that had been nailed continued all the way up the piece of furniture Had the co pre drilled the holes used screws instead this would ve never happended Obviously it s cheaper to use nails instead of screws We took pictures of the dmgs I wish I could attach them to this review so you d be able to see for yourself There were also several areas inside the crib which weren t sanded properly would be a real hazard for little fingers b c of splintering wood It was advertised to be constructed of hardwoods but in all actuality it s pine When you think of hardwood you expect oak or birch not a softwood like pine The tops of the furniture the drawer fronts were the only pieces that were solid wood Everything else was particle board Some of the solid wood pieces weren t even 1 piece of wood but 3 they were glued together We re currently trying to return this product for a full refund We re also shopping last minute for replacement furniture w only 2 wks left before my due date I would never purchase a another peice of furniture made by this company again 
2 0 Disappointing We bought this product based on its testimonials and thought it would be the best choice for our new baby While he had no problems using the Playtex Nursers he ended up having a problem with Dr brown s Natural Flow bottles First off they are a pain to clean Each piece needs to be painstakenly washed boiling the nipple washing the bottle and scrubbing each hole of the the insert and the reservoir It was certainly laborsome and time consuming Anyhow when he uses them he spits up where he didn t with the competition I tried to figure out why If you tip the bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking So my baby is not sucking or swallowing when he uses this product He lets it build up in his mouth and then ends up having to push it out when he has gotten too much Needless to say we are planning to return these and will stick with Playtex 
2 0 Condition I would not reccomend this product It was cheaper at Amazon com than walmart but It took forever to get It took two weeks for us to get it When caption said ships 5 7 days Than when we did get it several pieces were broken Major pieces When I called the company which I was on hold for 30 minutes then told me that we had so many pieces that were broken 5 that we needed to return it I told them no it s over 100 lbs and I am 7mth preg they then changed the tune and said they would ship the parts they would be here in 4 weeks Another mth So it took almost 2 mths to get this product It is not worth the problems Plus nothing was labeled and you had to figure out what pieces were what Plus the shelves inside the unit are WHITE the armoire is natural but the shelves inside are white I called the company and they said this is true 
1 0 kindof dangerous We were so excited to try a jumper for our son but were very dissapointed in this product First of all he tipped himself right out of it With the three strap design it s unsturdy in the back which we discovered after he spilled himself onto the floor He seemed pretty intent on jumping so now we ve tried stuffing him in there with a blanket so that he s nice and snug but it s still unstable and wobbly I don t recommend this product and in fact we are going to try a different brand 
2 0 Not made for a woman I was going to order this backpack but wanted to try it out first I went to a local store with a friend and tried this thing out The sternum strap would not even snap over my chest I have an average build but have a chest and it would nt reach My friend tried it also and had the same problem I would suggest that if you are interested in this carrier you find one and try it on first or it could be a costly mistake 
1 0 daughter quickly overgrew this potty my daughter is not even 2 yrs old and she is already having a hard time fitting into the potty i think this is the case for other types of potty seats too so i ll be trying the type u attach to the adult seat and see how it goes 
1 0 Again not for little boys Reasons why I do not like this potty 1 The shield falls off with one touch ussually into the potty 2 The potty has many cracks and crevices in the bottom that collect pee in numerous ways 3 It is cumbersome to empty the potty 4 Once the shield is lost since it impossible to keep attached it is hard for boys to sit down and not make a mess I highly recommend that Bjorn potty since it is all one piece and with a built in shield 
2 0 not made for boys definately NOT a potty for boys As with other reviewers the shield does not stay on Looking for another simple and basic potty now o 
2 0 Buy a more expensive one Though this potty is nicely priced it s worth it to buy a more expensive one Though mine hasn t fallen apart like other reviewers it does shift around on the base allowing for spillage The removeable receptacle in the base is way too far from the actual seat so my daughter gets stuff ALL OVER the inside not just in the receptacle The inside has a criss crossed honeycomb type pattern see my customer image so it s impossible to clean messes out of it It does serve it s purpose as a potty but I m definatly going to buy a different one when my son is old enough for one 
1 0 Fall apart potty I got this potty for my baby shower I registered for it because it was Safety first and most of their products are excellent I set it out to introduce it to my son he was just beginning to show interest not ready to actually start yet We never actually used it since the top of the seat and I mean the entire top kept falling off even with nobody sitting on it Even if you just moved the potty it would fall apart Instead we bought a plain potty seat by Graco and it is excellent 
1 0 Not for little boys I hate hate hate this potty The shield will not stay on My son sits on the potty and either the shield falls off into the potty or he grabs it and hands it to me saying here you go It is also cumbersome to get the bowl out of the potty to empty There is a lot of open space under the seat that gives bacteria a great chance to grow even with frequent cleaning Maybe this would work for a little girl but it is a no go for a little boy 
1 0 A big disappointment I purchased this baby carrier for my 1 month old son When I put him in it he looked so uncomfortable I tried putting a blanket in there underneath him to prop him up a bit but it still covered his face So I decided to shell out the for the infant support pillow expecting that to make a difference It didn t He still looked uncomfortable and squished only now I wasted MORE money My son is 21 1 2 inces and 11 lbs 4 oz I can t imagine how a bigger baby could fit in this at all A big disappointment If you re looking for a carrier try the Bjorn A million times better than this 
2 0 Can t figure it out I ve tried this sling about 4 times with my now 10 week old son I just can t get it to work so that he seems comfortable He usually cries when he is in it He fell asleep in it once but he looked so contorted It s just so tight against my body that it bends him the wrong way And the pocket is so deep it closes over his head And I know I got the correct size I ve given up and am looking for a better sling Right now we use our baby bjorn several times a day and he loves it but it s a little cumbersome and I want him to be able to recline 
2 0 Lucky baby com Rather than this sling I recommend you check out for your sling They are hand made based on your body size and come in a variety of colors This is a far better buy than the native baby carrier 
1 0 Cindy s back must hurt When my daughter was tiny she enjoyed being in this sling on the one or two occasions I managed to endure the discomfort of wearing it for more than two minutes The cotton fabric doesn t offer much support for the baby s weight and I found it became uncomfortable very quickly It also didn t feel as secure as some of the padded over the shoulder style slings I actually was afraid not to keep an arm on my baby at all times which defeats the purpose 
2 0 better slings out there This sling was only useful for a couple months because there is no adjustable strap There are so many slings out there that are more functional and that you can use from newborn to toddle 
2 0 straps are too short I m going to buy a new car seat even though my 12 mo old son weighs 28 lbs and should be able to stay in it for alot longer up to 40 lbs The straps are let all the way out and it s still too tight for him I wouldn t recommend this car seat for chunky babies 
2 0 Bought because it was pink and had problems with it from the beginning The cover was ripped where the the plastic clips were attached Evenflo did replace it after I sent pictures The shade protector doesn t stay up I had a mother stop me in a store and warn me that the handle on hers broke while her husband was carrying her daughter I wish I had checked safety ratings and reviews before I purchased this product 
1 0 No good for brand new baby The only good thing I can really say about this seat is that it comes in pink It s hard to find carseats that are not really ugly Otherwise I cannot take my newborn out without help because this seat does not recline far enough back and her head flops forward I will be returning to work in a couple of weeks and will be bringing her with me I m a nanny I don t know how we are going to do it and may have to purchase a new seat already I would think that if something is deemed an infant carseat it should work correctly and safely from birth not from when the baby can hold their head up 
1 0 Breaking I loved the idea that this car seat was Then after I bought it I have had problems with it The handle realse has broken many times Then the gray handle part has came apart also This is has not been safe at all I went to return it and Target would not return or exchange it for me I think it was a waste of money 
1 0 Buyer s remorse The product is flimsy the step is too close to the toilet to be practical for a child to step up on the deflector is not tall enough to deflect any urine and the seat is too large for a toddler My child does not feel comfortable using this potty 
2 0 Not for oblong toilets kinda flimsy The idea is good but it does not sit well on oblong toilets The adjustable step is a great feature as my sons feet could not reach the other step stools we have used before we bought this apparatus Would recommend with round toilet only 
1 0 Better potty training aids are out there The Freedom potty trainer looked like such a good idea but the plastic is very flimsy and when set in place it just barely reaches the floor It s a pretty unstable situation A separate kids toilet seat and footstool would be far better 
1 0 SCARY JUNK It s not just the most icredible piece of junk I ever seen it is the most DANGEROUS piece of junk I ever seen on the market for kids The plastic is very thin very weak and bends every each way My daughter weighs 35 pounds and the step almost collapsed under her weight Is SLIDES off the toilet bowl and the seat itself also bends down under the child s weight which really frightened my girl There s no way a child should use it without an adult actually lifting it and putting it on the seat I feel soooo stupid to have bought it 
2 0 Cute Chair but doesn t hold up I bought this chair when my husband was working out of state as a consultant I wanted a portable chair that my son could use in the hotel room to eat watch TV or drink his sippy cup This chair was the perfect height design and was compact enough to fit in my suitcase without being too bulky The problem is that it broke on the trip back from our first trip The fault is in a joint I bought a second chair and on the next trip kept it the box when I packed But then my son stood on the chair and the same joint broke in two That joint is really weak Too bad It s such an adorable product 
1 0 great concept lousy physics We got this as well as a car seat bag with wheels I was not going to pay 200 for a car seat stroller combo so we picked 2 alternatives I was hoping that the Traveling Toddler would be great but I found that it too much torque and stress on the suitcase To add the weight of my car seat a Britax and my 22 pound 1 year old was just too much weight for the handle of the suitcase It felt awkward and unstable The physics of it just did not work So we put the seat in a bag with wheels and dragged it behind us The bag was also better for our trip because we fly stand by and wait and see what seats are left There was no more window seats available on one of our flights so we gate checked the seat and I was happy to know that it was protected 
1 0 Don t waste your money THESE BOWLS ARE NOT WORTH THE MONEY THEY DO NOT STAY ON THE TABLE AT ALL 
2 0 Agree with other reviewers bowls don t stay put I got these when my son was 12 months old and already a strong little guy who enjoyed dumping his bowls of food onto his high chair tray Trying to outsmart him I purchased these hoping to keep some food in a bowl Much to my disappointment they only stick to the formica countertops well The littlest one doesn t even stick to that None of them stays on my son s plastic high chair tray for more than a second or two On the upside the lids are secure once shut all the way which can take a little work so they make great storage for on the go finger foods in the diaper bag I haven t had one leak yet and I put things like applesauce in them to test them Not a total waste of money now that I found this alternate use They wash well without any noticeable breakdown of the plastic on the top rack of the dishwasher 
1 0 Suction does not work I was very excited to get these bowls in the mail because they are so cute and the concept of having a suction bowl was and is appealing to me My son loved the bowl right away as he was able to reach into the bowl for some puffs to feed himself instead of having to push the puffs around the table until he could finally grab one in his fingers I d also like to add that he ate tofu cubes for the first time out of this bowl and loved them However I m disappointed because the suction on the bowl does not work for more than a few seconds I m constantly pushing the bowl back down which is disruptive to his meal Despite some of happy memories I ve had with this bowl I would not recommend buying these bowls because as suction bowls they do not serve their purpose 
2 0 Cute but not functional I tried my new bowls out this morning and was very disapointed The suction won t stay down for more than a second or two on our wood table On the kitchen counter top formica they stay put for longer but not long enough for a meal I am returning mine to the store today Dissapointing BUT they are darling colors and the lids are a nice feature 
1 0 stay put doesn t stay put The suction on these bowls is so weak that the baby pulled it off the highchair and dumped the contents in a few seconds flat They do come in lovely colors though 
2 0 mixed review I agree that the water holder is a bit tedious to fill and measure acurately I always follow the measuring instructions but sometimes the bottle is too cool or too hot even though I have been practicing to get it right I wish it were more accurate and for someone like me who only has a 3 room apartment the cooling feature is not that useful 
1 0 Dangerous product Waste of money I agree with all the other reviews saying the warmer with burn your hands and overheat the bottle Especially when you only have a few oz in the bottle The water in the warmer actually BOIL when it heats up and if the bottle got stuck in the handle it means you have to use your bare hands to separate the boiled bottle and the boiled handle You end up having a boiled hand as well The worst part is it will burn your love one Not only that the cooler does not close well so the content will not really be kept fresh even the ice pack is frozen before placing into the cooler We switched to AVENT warmer A little more but it is much better I would NOT recommend this product 
1 0 You re better off using a microwave to heat the bottles WHAT TO DO IF YOU JUST BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT Go outside and bang your head as hard as you can against the side of your house Maybe that will knock some sense into you after you ve gone looney trying to use this piece of junk As many reviewers have noted it is extremely difficult to get this bottle warmer to work properly First off the little vials you use to measure the water into are poorly marked Why did they choose to use teeny tiny WHITE lettering STUPID It is then very tricky to get the proper amount of water into the vials In fact the difference between say level 2 and level 3 is maybe two drops of water Trying doing that out of a standard faucet In fact we use a filtered water faucet with a thin spout and it is still hard to get write But that s easy compared to figuring out the right water in the vial to formula in the bottle ratio We are currently using a 4oz Playtex bottle with the disposable bags and are contantly playing a guessing game as to the right amount of water to use Level 3 still to cold but wait last night that same amount of water practically scalded the formula And just try to use a vented type bottle Forget it How about an 8oz bottle NO WAY Either way to cold or way to hot And even though we use filtered water this thing still need to be cleaned with vinegar as recommended evey week or so However the cleaning barely hepls and after less than 8 weeks of use we now use the microwave more and more Why Because we know that 4oz of formula will always need 6 7 seconds in the microwave Every time 
2 0 Looking for a better mouse trap I ve heard some say this is the best warmer available If so parents are S O L Heating is SO inconsistent Same amount of water with the same amount of milk will produce a different temperature every single time Sometimes way too cold and sometimes way too hot When the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium Be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place Otherwise the bottles esp Brown s will overflow If that happens cleaning the inside of the warmer is a major hassle because the milk will have burned onto the heating plate The carrier is too short for Mr Brown 8oz bottles or any other of similar height The tubes provided to premeasure water are a joke The caps are so hard to close and open you need two really strong hands and maybe multiple tools to shut or flip the tops open Of course you will likely be holding your crying and squirming baby in one arm while trying to do open the cap and not spill all the water They tried to get fancy with the shape of the tubes and cap they forgot to make them easy to use I just can t believe that someone can t design a better mouse trap To add insult to injury the taps on the handle that are supposed to hold the top of the bottle storage compartment just broke off picture provided by Amazon is not the current model refer to the pictures posted by other shoppers 
1 0 Late and of Poor Quality Not only did the product get delivered 3 days later than expected my child s grandfather who is in the construction industry installed the seat and the entire set broke off of the bowl the first time anyone sat on it And nobody in this household is overweight 
1 0 Disappointed After reading all the rave reviews we put Pupsqueak on our Baby s registry but were very disappointed when we received one as a gift and he didn t work We tried exchanging him for another one at Babies R Us but we couldn t find one that worked So instead we exchanged him for the Dinosaur I forget his name Our daughter loves him Since he s soft we are not afriad with placing him in her car seat with her She loves falling asleep holding onto Mr Dyno 
2 0 Big Disappointment I bought this car seat based on the good ratings it received However it did not work for my son until he was about 5 months old My son was born 5 lb 11 oz He did not fit snugly into this seat even with the head cushion His head rolled around or rolled forward I tried to put washcloths or towels around but it did not work Also if I adjust the base so that the car seat is flatter it would roll around a lot more I have leather seats Additionally the material on the seat is not breathable it is velvety so my son s back and head would become very sweaty on longer trips even in the winter I would say that once my son was bigger about 14 pounds and 26 inches I removed the head cushion and moved the seat belt to the higher position this is when he actually fit into the seat however the fabric is still an issue and his back and head still become very sweaty making him very uncomfortable for longer trips 
1 0 Don t buy this seat It tips over I received this seat as a gift for my baby shower I thought it was going to be a great seat Graco has been on the market for several years and it s built up a reputation But was I wrong Everytime that I would go out with my newborn and I would make a turn the seat would flip over to the side it did not matter how slow I made the turn it would always do the same thing I m a very carefull driver specially after I gave birth to my son You can t imagine how horrible it is to look throuhg the rearview mirror and see that your tiny little precious bundle of joy has flipped over and his head is hanging I would have to look for a place to park and have to fix him and the seat I had to move both the passenger and the driver seat as far back as possible in order to hold the baby seat with the backrest just so that it wouldn t tip over and it made it a little difficult to drive You might say she probably didn t install it well but you would be wrong it was perfectly installed I had someone check the installation in my city and everything was fine The base of the seat is not completely flat making it difficult for the seat to stay in place This did not just happen to me it also happened to my sister with her baby s seat we had our children with a few weeks difference I had to get a different seat I purchased one with a flatter base and that one worked perfectly I will never buy another Graco seat again I believe it s worth spending more money on a better seat I believe ones children are priceless and investing money in their safety 
1 0 Expensive but dangerous I bought this carseat different color because I liked the features However everytime I put my now 5 week old in the seat his head plops forward I have tried everything from putting a diaper or towel around his head because the headrest sucks to trying to push the base down so it doesn t sit up so high Do you know how nerve wrecking it is to be driving just to look back and see you newborn s head ploped forward so bad that he is choking Not good Graco this carseat could not have been tested before I had an Evenflo with my previous child and did not have this problem I am truly disappointed Can anyone could tell me how to make this problem go away I am all ears I know the seat is right because the balance window is all blue I have talked to other mothers and they have the same problem HELP 
1 0 Terrible doll do not buy for potty training I bought this doll because at the expensive price I figured it would be the best It definitely is not Patty is cute but that is the only good thing about her To fill up her bottles you must squeeze and insert into a glass of water then squeeze again until water shoots out and then reinsert into the glass of water again It requires it to be done in such a particular way that only an adult can fill the bottles with water no small child will be able to master the precise way it takes Then to feed Patty you must hold her very still at an exact angle where she is almost standing up Most children cradle their baby dolls in their arms but Patty will not drink in that position Even in the standing up position most of the water spills out of the tiny hole for her mouth and soaks her outfit It takes 5 10 minutes to fill Patty up Most children don t have the patience for this and lose interest as my daughter did Plus since she has to be perfectly still and at an exact angle only an adult can feed Patty her water Then to make her pee you must press her thigh very hard This distressed my daughter because she thought I was hurting Patty Once I assured her Patty was ok then she was upset because she was not strong enough to press hard enough to make Patty pee My daughter is 35 months old and a lot of children start training earlier At 35 months old my daughter was not able to fill the bottles feed Patty or make her pee Only an adult can do these things due to the complexity of the bottles and feeding and peeing systems of Patty So my daughter quickly lost interest in Patty and started squirting water all over the bathroom instead with the bottles The whole teach the doll to pee part of the potty training was lost I wish I had gone to the store and bought a cheap wetting doll instead Then I e mailed the company to complain but of course received no response And you can t get a full refund if the doll has been used In fact getting a refund at all is extremely difficult I have just given up on that Don t waste your money This doll is too expensive and cannot be used by a child which defeats the whole purpose Go to your toy store and buy a cheap wetting doll At least that way if you don t like it you can return it unlike Patty 
1 0 Great concept unfortuately it is garbage Same thing that happened to the previous poster happened to my son s toy The turtle cup came off after the first use and within 20 min My son is 8 months old and it can t even withstand the pulling of an 8 month old And a sharp screw is revealed when the cup comes off Luckily we noticed it before my son was injured unfortunately I had to remove it immediately which of course upset my son who no longer had his toy to play with I would pay more for something that is quality so it is sad and amazing that companies put out cheap quality products that break immediately and expose dangerous parts I would recommend that you do not buy this item I now have to waste more time returning it to the store 
2 0 Mommy to Baby 2 I bought this toy bar for my second child and absolutely loved it at first My daughter loves to play and chew on the toys and it keeps her totally entertained for trips to the mall or doctor It fits beautifully on my Graco Quattro Tour stroller The big drawback is the turtle snack cup came off revealing a screw which scratched my daughters arm I feel Sassy needs to recall this item and make some adjustments The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the potential hazard of the cup coming off 
1 0 Peice of Crap After only 2 months this toy fell apart My daughter loves the toys on it but the turtle fell off and a metal screw was popping out and the snail s threads came out and the stuffing our of the side started to come out of the seams 20 is not cheap for this toy and I think the quality should have been alot better 
2 0 Ripped off These come in both boy and girl colors The picture shows pink purple and yellow bottles I received blue and green bottles I contacted Amazon who promptly sent me another three sets all of the first three sets were wrong In the second shipment they only got one set right I e mailed to return these as well When I sent back the five incorrect sets the company would not refund my money because they had already replaced the items Be careful when ordering from this site 
1 0 Not for my baby My son is ten days old I tried these bottles and was highly disappointed The liners are a pain in the butt Once you prepare the bottle and get the air out of it if your child does not drink the whole bottle it collects air again I changed to Dr Brown s bottles and my son is having less gas and isn t wearing his food 
1 0 Truly doesn t serve its purpose So I bought this for our 7 month old What a nightmare What the previous posters said about this thing is TRUE It is hard to get it to STAY PUT in the cart while you put your kid in it It just doesn t happen And then when you DO get your baby in the seat portion is so narrow that it barely is the width of your child s hind end Forget the bar cover It is just as narrow This thing covers just that small area and if you have a child like mine they are reaching over and touching EVERYTHING To add to it the back cusion part doesn t even go up to the top of the back support My daughter totally whacked her head on the back of the cart seat and screamed The cusion part totally doesn t cover it Just bad Just spend the extra cash and buy something that covers the whole darn cart 
1 0 Out Dated Seemed like a good idea but these days it hardly fits over any of the grocery carts or high chairs at restaurants So now it sits in my car fading in the sun Save your money 
2 0 Disappointed This is o k if you re using it as a restraint only If you want it to protect your child from the germs on the cart forget it I thought the bar cover would keep my baby from touching and chewing on the bars wrong It hardly covers anything I went back and bought the cart cover that covers everything I wish I would have spent the extra money before wasting it on this seat 
2 0 This pump sucks literally I bought this after renting the hospital grade Medela Lactima Big difference The backpack is compact sleek and inconspicuous but the pump sucks It has one adjustment for speed suction and a computer chip that selects the best combination of the two for you Well after a few pumps my nipples are about to fall off If I lower the suction to a comfortable reasonable level the pump is way too fast If I slow the pump to mimic MY baby s speed the suction is excruciatingly painful and it still doesn t pump slow enough I am very unhappy with this and wish we d just rented the hospital grade for a year instead The little cooler is cute but it s tough to actually fit the frozen insert blue plastic thing AND four bottles in there And it is convenient for the horns to pump directly into standard size bottles it will pump into Dr Browns Evenflo bottles too any regular mouth size bottles or bags I love the setup just wish the pump had slower speed settings and that the speed suction were truly adjustable and independent from each other I can t be in pain like this all the time and am looking for other options 
1 0 Mine broke down in 5 months I have been using my medela pump for the past 5 months first couple of months intermittently and the last 2 1 2 months daily Suddenly it broke down without any warning signs on a weekend My dealer was not open to replace it and this has caused a considerable loss of milk supply in me Thankfully the dealer was a local dealer and very good He replaced just the pump in the pack with a new one Per Medela s instructions they actually want to send the broken pump over to them and they will take care of it if it was under a yr old It would have been very late for me if I were to ship it and they have to ship it back Another thing that is happening is my back pack s handles have started wearing down And I hardly carry them around I am giving it a 1 star because of the poor quality check that must have been carried out for such an expensive pump I would think twice before buying this 
2 0 It worked great in the beginning I m very dissappointed with this expensive pump Now I m looking for another one It s difficult to pump if you have large nipples You have to buy extra sheild which costs extra It s noisy It loses suction The milk backs up to the tubing and gets moldy I clean the parts everyday I have contacted Medela a few times to troubleshoot the pump and they eventually sent me another motor great customer service It worked for a few months and now the same problem is happening I guess it works for some and not others Now I m in the hunt for another pump since I want to exclusively give my baby pure breastmilk for her first year 
1 0 Too difficult for a newborn to suck no good for the first month at least Initially I thought these angled bottles make a lot of sense so I put different sizes into our registry However when our baby girl 1 week old first tried to suck the milk out from the bottle it did not come out My husband had activated the vent and did everything according to the instructions He thought the holes were not big enough since he did not see any on the nipple so he put more holes on them but still nothing came out He finally found out the way that these bottles work are not the same as a traditionally bottle does The hole will not open unless pressure is applied against it and hole will get sealed back again when released Baby has to use their tongue to push against the nipples in order to open up the hole For a newborn infant it is too difficult for them to figure out how to get the milk out especially if you are bottle feeding only Luckily we had two Avent bottles with the traditionally hole idea so she is doing very well with the Avent bottles and she still loves them a lot We ended up returning the unused VentAir bottles and got a lots of AVENT bottles but still stuck with the opened ones I do not recommend these difficult bottles for newborn Baby should not need to think how to get the milk out For leaking problem we do not have any issue with the Avent bottles When it leaks it is usually because the nipples have not been properly placed push all the way though the ring or the ring has not been tightly screwed We also found out if you use a warmer to warm the bottle you have to unscrew the ring once and screw it all tight again after the warmer It is because the theory of heat with expense the plastic bottle which creates a gap between the ring nipples and the bottle neck This works 99 for us with no leak We are the fans of the AVENT bottles 
1 0 NOT worth your time energy or money Like you I read all the reviews I could of bottles travel systems baby swings cribs etc etc etc I loved the shape of these bottles very handy when needing your hand you can prop the bottle under your chin while feeding and the concept of the ventaire system made a lot of sense HOWEVER 2 months into using these bottles I became FED up with having to wash all of the different parts drying them thoroughly it s a MUST with these things and having to activate BOTH the nipples and the ventaire plastic seal wasting valuable time and energy that should ve been spent with my family catching up on laundry cleaning the house cooking and grabbing naps in between I also work a full time job and didn t get home till 6 PM every night The WORST of all of it is that if you don t install the vent juuuuuuust so it leaks the person below who said it doesn t leak if you screw it on right hasn t met me I m 34 years old and DO believe I have learned how to screw on a stupid cap It s a hit or miss deal sometimes I would go a whole week without a leak and then OUT of the blue water EVERYWHERE and they re slow leaks too so it s not like you would notice right away it took like 30 minutes before showing Then I called Playtex to ask them what the problem was and they thought my water might be too hot and breaking down the material so they kindly sent me some new ones Well yeh THAT didn t work either It is a GREAT idea but VERY bad design I finally threw my hands in the air and purchased Evenflo s version of the angled bottle and now I am in HEAVEN Do yourself and your time a favor and don t waste the money 
2 0 Not worth the money I chose this bottle system for my son after reading so many great reviews and even bought one and ran it through the dishwasher to test for leaks no leaks They worked well UNTIL recently My son is 4 months old and they all LEAK Constantly I fill one up to put it in the diaper bag and within a half hour it s empty They aren t very durable the plastic on the rings is actually breaking off and now I m going through the struggle of trying to find a new bottle system that my son will take I hate the liners And they never did reduce the amount of air in the bottle at all Do not buy these bottles unless you want to buy a completely new system in 4 months 
2 0 Problem with bottle flow I bought these for my daughter thinking that maybe they wouldn t leak like the last ones I had used They don t leak but the stage 1 is TOO slow and frustrates her She s 5 months and the stage 2 is TOO fast They made a HUGE mistake in not making more stages Had I realized this before I had used them I would have taken them all back 
1 0 Horrible I thought this cover was horrible It doesn t cover enough area of the cart It s difficult to put on because of all the ties I couldn t even get the harness to fit right Try one of the other seat covers instead that have elastic you can put them on the cart with one hand and it completely covers the cart even the big ones at Costco 
2 0 Definitely too small for most shopping carts You don t want this one Although the fabric is appealing calm stripes vs the buzy themes of the other covers this cover will not fit most shopping carts It only fits the carts found at small city super markets If you are a suburbian shopper you ll have to spend the bucks for a more satisfactory product 
1 0 Too Small I tried putting this on a shopping cart from Target This does not cover area at all I caught my baby biting on the cart handle and almost flipped Not good Plus its annoying to put on 
2 0 Not as good as other covers I bought this cover thinking that anything to cover the cart would be the same Other covers I ve seen just slip on this one has to be tied on Also it doesn t cover the entire cart There is an opening that my baby s fingers always find where he can touch the icky cart handle Not a great product Spend the extra money and buy the better one 
2 0 Too expensive for quality This product serves its purpose but does not need to cost almost 30 Basically it s a foam wedge with white mesh fabric over it I m sure you can find the same product that performs as well if not better if you take the time to look 
1 0 Even the replacement was not up to description I received this after much debate about the prior review Had seen this item described the same on other web sites and figured it had to be an error for the other customer So I bought it and sure enough had the same problem Amazon was great they sent me a replacement and still the same problem My baby is due any day so I am keeping the first one but sending back the replacement It doesnt come as described no blanket included and I dont see how you could adjust the wedge I am very disappointed with the product but happy about Amazon s willingness to assist in the issue 
2 0 Not what I expected I just received this sleep positioner today and it is nothing like what I expected The description makes it sound like the wedge is adjustable but I don t quite get how to adjust this It also says that there is a blanket Maybe I misunderstood the description because there is no blanket here I imagined the wedge would prop the baby up much more than it does At the thickest layer the wedge is MAYBE 2 1 2 inches thick I m pretty disappointed I thought this was going to be the answer to my baby s sleep problems 
1 0 Awful returning asap for a different brand 1 Like others here my charges do not last more than 5 hours The beeping from the parent unit WILL wake you at about 3am every night unless you leave them on the charger 2 Both of my parent units now after only two weeks of minor useage refuse to connect with the nursery unit beeping endlessly Cycling them on and off per the prescribed though not well detailed manufacturer s trouble shooting method has done nothing Only logical conclusion the nursery unit has apparently died and is not sending out a signal Also while they were working I did not really get the hype these units generated My home is a very common 1800 square feet of two story box type arrangement The static would become unbearable once the parent unit was taken downstairs and maybe due to a weak or faulty nursery unit from the get go the signal would cut out before we even got to the kitchen So we either got static or no signal at less than 50 linear feet from the nursery Poorly designed operator interface controls directions and trouble shooting poorly engineered poor reception enormous static fast battery drain and poorly manufactured apparent faulty parts and lack of quality product 
2 0 Flaws outweigh features I bought the dual room iMonitor yesterday only available in store at Babies R Us It is the same as the one shown here but it has two transmitters to montor two children Based on only 4 hours of testing I am taking the unit back Pro The range was great Whole house plus 800ft outside No interference I live in a dense suburban area with many sources of interference Easy to setup Shape size of parent units are much better than others especially sony Cons Controls are not very straightforward The unit always hisses It is not sound voice activated The power switch on the parent unit is a button that is not recessed When you turn it off it does not beep or let you know that you did The button is easy to bump and would make it easy to carry the thing while it is off and you think it is on The DEAL BREAKER a power outage requires turns off child units With even a short power interruption the child units come up in the off mode You have to go to the baby s room and turn them on Until you do the parent unit will beep and flash red We have been using the Sony 910 for 3 years with our first child I guess it has spoiled us 
2 0 Good idea but severly lacking in execution My wife and I purchased this baby monitor in preparation for the arrival of our first child and after using it for almost 2 weeks I could not be more disappointed We were drawn in by the promise of a clear connection that would prevent others from listening in but the many drawbacks far outweigh this one advantage This is one of the more expensive and highly rated baby monitors but you certainly don t get what you pay for here Pros 1 You do get a clear connection when the unit is in range see cons for a further explanation Cons 1 The biggest complaint I have is the battery life Even with the parent units on the lowest volume setting you will not get more than 5 hours of use without having to recharge You will know when you need to recharge because the unit will start beeping loudly every 5 seconds until you put it back in the cradle to recharge This is a great feature to discover during the middle of the night The nursery unit is even worse as it does not take rechargeable batteries and will eat through 3 AAA batteries in 6 hours unless it is plugged in Why they even allow this unit to operate without being plugged in is beyond me Basically all of the units have to be plugged in at all times 2 I have already had a couple instances where the parent units will simply not connect to the nursery unit They just sit there and beep like they do if you are out of range This required a couple of off on power cycles of the nursery and parent units to correct 3 The range is not ideal I have a 2800 square foot 2 story house and we have already had 1 issue where the parent unit would not connect to the nursery unit Granted the units were about as far away as they can be in our house but considering this distance was only about 60 feet I do not think it is unreasonable to have complete coverage in our house 4 As other reviewers have noted the lowest volume setting can be too loud if you are a light sleeper Since the speaker is always on you will hear any ambient noise in the room amplified and played on the parent unit Several other monitors on the market have noise thresholds and will only transmit the sound if it is above a certain volume i e if the baby is crying as opposed to shifting in the crib Also the LEDs are also extremely bright in a dark room Unfortunately I cannot recommend this product We are making due with it simply because I refuse to throw away a 100 baby monitor although I m sure I would be much happier with a different product If you can deal with leaving the units plugged in at all times and only taking the parent units out of the cradle for short periods of time then this product would probably suffice although I m sure you could find a much cheaper product that would work just as well 
1 0 Terrible Terrible and Terrible Monitors I am so unhappy and fustrated with these monitors The battery only lasts about 5 hours off the charging base so I can t make it through the whole night without it beeping due to low battery And it doesn t just beep once it beeps and beeps and beeps until you do something about it I have to keep it on the charger all night so it doesn t go out There is tons of static and extra noise Also the belt clip is not tight the monitor always falls off of my belt if I bend down to much Just super dissapointed with these monitors ABSOLUTELY NOT worth its big price tag Please look elsewhere DO NOT recommend 
1 0 Look Elsewhere I have never written a review but in this case I feel compelled to do so I purchased the iMonitor last week as an upgrade to a Safety 1st dual monitor for no other reason than I was tired of the interference I was excited to learn of the digital technology and once I got it home I was anxious to try it After a few nights trying it out I was equally as anxious to return it and get my money back let me explain To begin with before you buy please be aware that the lights and sound are awfully bright and loud which was troublesome since I am a light sleeper I would have been able to deal with it but there are other problems as well there are clicks and crackles that are intermittent and like I said before not good for a light sleeper The final straw was on the fourth night the parent receivers lost contact with the base I spent a half hour resetting it reconfiguring the layout powering on off all to no avail It kept beeping Out of Range I was only 10 feet from the monitor at the time Absolutely unacceptable In all fairness we do have a lot of gadgets that are wireless and may have been competing with the monitor but that isn t an excuse it says Crystal Clear Clarity and 2000 foot range but this is not I repeat NOT the case So I packed it back up and went into Babies R Us to return it here s the kicker The salesperson at the store said that she agreed they had a lot of problems and she has seen more of the iMonitors returned than any other monitor She rec d the Sony but it doesn t come with two parent units so I have resigned myself to living with the Safety 1st even with all of its interference it is still superior and 1 4 of the price as the iMonitor I have no doubt that Digital is the next step in baby monitors but so far Graco does not have it figured out Save your money and give it some time so they can work out the obvious flaws in the system 
1 0 Simpler is better We have the Graco Ultra Clear monitor and it has worked really well for us for over 3 years With a new baby on the way we thought we d upgrade to the new technology Oops It turns out that the range on the new monitor was about half that of the Ultra Clear couldn t even make it to the other side of the house and the reception was quite poor And the annoying beeping was the clincher I sent it back today and bought another 40 Ultra Clear Oh and I tried the Fisher Price Private Connection also and had the same issues 
2 0 Not versatile enough to be worth the money This is a kick piano not a hand piano and as such it needs to be mounted in a baby s crib We thought it would be useable if we just held the piano in place for our daughter to kick or for her to use her hands on the keys it isn t As we use her crib for sleeping not playing this has been a total waste of money At 10 months my daughter is now able to sit and press the keys on the piano with her hands but the response of the keys isn t instant and the noise is so soft that she doesn t recognise that she s making it work Her sister s toy xylophone with twice the number of keys an obvious sound and an instant response to her touch is far easier and far more satisfying for her to use 
1 0 Awful piece of equipment I purchased this sterilizer about two weeks ago and I have used it all of two times It creates a horrible mess with water running everywhere when the lid is lifted and I really had to wonder if the bottles were actually sterilized I am terribly disappointed with this product and truly caution those of you who are thinking of buying this to run from it like the wind 
1 0 Do not buy it It does leave mineral deposit on the bottles even if you use distilled water It is worse if you use tap water It doesn t help if you clean it with vinegar after each use as is directed When you lift the cap all the water drip You will need a lot of towels to clean the water after each use The plastic lid of this product is not appropiate because it gets soft from the heat You wonder if it is going to melt I am a fan of Gerber products but this one does not work 
2 0 Maybe Worth a Lower Price I got this to make sterilizing easier I m not sure it does It is kind of a pain Cartoonish in appearance cheap looking cheap feeling not nearly enough room for what you have to put in you have to use a glass or something to hold the small things Water does spill like crazy from the lid Does it really sterilize I hope so I can t tell Air vent bottles air dry but one piece bottles will not dry no matter how long left out on the bottle drainer I have Why I don t know the steam Metal of heating unit isn t smoothed by company so be careful when cleaning you don t get cut I was VERY disappointed For that amount of money I should have gotten something of better quality You pulled a fast one on us with this to be sure 
1 0 Horrible product Both my children get Thrush very easy so I purchased this product to sterilize the bottles and nipples with every use My kids still get thrush and this product is terribly messy and the bottle look horrible afterwards If my kids keep getting thrush obviously this product does not work 
1 0 Not needed We just learned in Parenting class and I checked with my pediatrician that you don t need to sterlize bottles nipples or anything else now as long as you have a dishwasher So save some money and don t get this 
1 0 not helpful at all this product is a mess i cant believe it actually sterilizes bottles and nipples i ended up having to wash them and boil the old fashioned way it builds up nasty mineral deposits and it lets water out when you pick up the lid it really is flushing 50 down the drain you need a whole role of bounty paper towels to clean after this jun 
1 0 Messy I received this steralizer as a gift If I had to do all over again I would have never put it on my registry The steralizer is messy everytime I lift the top to remove the bottles water is everywhere In addition I have to keep a dry towel under the steralizer to dry up the water that spills out there has to be a better way 
1 0 Horribly messy waste of money I was given this as a gift so thankfully I didn t waste my money on it This sterilizer is so messy and awkward that I can not recommend it at all The metal pan started corroding after only a week Little flecks of metal and water soak the bottom of the unit and lifting off the cover will drench your countertop All the bottles and nipples and breastpump parts stay wet and spotty so I can t imagine how it could possibly clean Horrible product 
1 0 Don t waste your money This is the worst nursing pad that I ve tried It slips out of place and the pad itself leaks after even the smallest amount of milk leaks into it I found myself with wet bras all the time These pads are terrible I recommend the Lansinoh brand 
1 0 Buy Johnson Johnson These breast pads are sooooo different from the Johnson Johnson product They don t absorb your milk which means it still gets all over your clothes The don t have adhesive which means the pads move all over the place Generally just a waste of money You might as well use toilet tissue 
2 0 Okay but better products out there I received a box as a shower gift and they worked okay unless I changed them a lot though they ended up leaking I was resigned to just living with wet spots until someone gave me some of the Lansinoh pads to try I have no idea why Babies R Us doesn t arry them but they really need to These things absolutely do not leak they hold tons of liquid 
2 0 Brush Broke After three weeks my brush broke too Cannot find a replacement I do not want to buy a whole new rack Design fault that they should correct Not good enoug 
1 0 Not Sturdy or Durable at All After spending over 30 for this item we used it only twice and it ripped on the bottom clear across A seamstress said it could not be repaired and commented that the fabric was not very durable or strong Would not purchase again or recommend to others 
1 0 Didn t fit our seats zippers broke on 3rd use We own two of these and they have never been easy to use We tore holes in the first one trying to insert the seat We have kept it though We bought another and on our second trip the zippers broke off We would not buy this one again We do have large carseats they are both Britax Marathons 
1 0 does not fit most car seats waste of money does not fit most car seats and the info on the package does not specify this 
1 0 not safe Do not buy this mattress it is not safe This mattress does not fit either of the cribs we have for our twins When I called Kolcraft to inform them the CS rep was rude and insistent that this mattress was standard size and would fit and that they haven t had any complaints She also implied it was my crib that was the wrong size We have 2 cribs and the sealy matress in the crib the twins still share fits nice and snug The Kolcraft has at least an inch gap and can move around quite easily 
1 0 It doesn t fit We are pregnant and our baby is due in two weeks We bought the mattress for our Delta Marisa White Crib and you guessed it it doesn t fit I read the review of another poster here and it says it doesn t fit their Thomas The Tank Engine toddler bed The poster assumed that it may fit a baby s crib but the honest truth its one inch possibly more off An inch is enough for our baby s foot to get stuck in it and the mattress feels like a joke its too cushiony We regret not reading the reviews before buying it If this mattress doesn t fit the majority of cribs beds then what is it good for 
1 0 Horrible Cheap cheap cheap Due to the fact that you can t give 0 stars I had to choose a 1 otherwise it would have been a big fat 0 We bought this mattress when I was pregnant thinking that all crib mattresses were the same and we were totally wrong A couple months ago my son poked a couple holes in the vinyl when he should have been napping mind you he had nothing to use other than his fingers no toys nothing sharp etc Well last night he wakes up crying in the middle of the night and my husband and I go in to see what is the matter and find that the vinyl had split completely from side to side and the springs were sticking out My poor little one had the springs poking at him After further examination we found that under the vinyl is a thin and I stress the word thin layer of foam then CARDBOARD piece and then the coils What a joke Carboard Needless to say I went out today and bought him a much better better constructed Simmons mattress I should note my son is only 17 mths old and the first five months of his life he never even slept on that mattress so bascially he had only used it for 12 mths Don t waste your money you ll only have to buy another one down the road Take your money and buy a much better well known mattress for your baby Afterall they deserve just as good a nights sleep as we do From a mom who learned the hard way 
2 0 not as good as I thought I just bought this seat for my 9 month old son I bought it for the convenience of the fold down front As good as that feature is it still causes red marks on my sons knees He is a thin baby so I don t know how well this would work for a chubbier baby Also the seat it self is slippery I have to place a rag down before I put the baby in because he will slide forward if I don t This is very uncomfortable for him Unfortunately this seems to be the only seat with the fold down front which does make taking the baby in and out easier That is really the only good thing I can say about this product 
2 0 Comes in just the right hue just wish it lasted I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is I also appreciate how many colors it comes in What I am disappointed with is the durability I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year They are totally falling apart at the elastic Now keep in mind that we use disposable chucks those blue hospital disposable under pads on top of this terry cloth changing pad It makes it less messy especially early on and doesn t require washing as much I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have While it is a nice product while it lasts I just expected them to be more durable 
1 0 Doesn t stay together well The first one of these I had came apart at every seam the first time I washed it I returned it and got another I was pleased with until about the 6th washing and now IT is starting to fall apart They just don t seem to be well made enough to stand up to the frequent washes that something like a changing pad cover will have to endure 
2 0 A bit disappointed I really enjoy the colors that this cover comes in however the quality of the material is less than desirable The cover snagged in the washer and shrank quite a bit in the drier I expected some shrinkage but it seems excessive I still use the covers but am disappointed overall The material is not very soft so admittedly I will look around for other products 
2 0 Manufacturer Defect I have to say that I just 20 min ago recieved this cover in the mail I ordered online because I m so far from a Babies R Us location and I was excited at first The color is great and the cover fit perfectly but I haven t washed it yet Actually I have to return mine already because a manufacturer defect in the fabric The fabric immediately shred along the elastic in one area middle of long side I plan to exchange this cover for another of the same I hope for better luck with the next one but man the hassle of having to mail this back and sit and wait is just frustrating 
2 0 looks cute but shrinks and cant use I had a few of these covers in lilac and sage and i cant use any of them anymore they all shrank so much when washed that they wont even stay on the contoured pad i am now using a white cover from especially for baby which fits and washes great unfortunately dirt shows and it stains easily and they only have white blue and yellow and my daughters room is purple pink green and white 
1 0 save your money I bought this but it s junk My husband and I have both tried it on ourselves and can t get it to register of 95 degrees That s not going to be very helpful trying to gauge a fever on a little one 
1 0 This Seat Stinks Okay were to start This car seat looks good on paper but that is it When it arrived the box was completely smashed and the car seat already had a tear in it If you have the LATCH system in your car you must find and shove all the belts inside the seat Then pull them out the correct places Not so easy Then in order to attach it to the base you must pull out a metal bar and once the seat is attached slide it back This is very hard So once there together it is a pain to take apart For facing backwards if the seat is not level with your car seats use a towel or blanket You shouldn t have to do that Plus with my baby in it his feet are still squished into the rear seat Once you turn it forward to get the belts adjusted you press a button on the bottom of the car seat and pull them towards you This would work fine if the BASE wasn t holding them so you CAN T MOVE THEM We took the car seat off the base so we could adjust the belts What is the point of that Once it is in your car the way you want it does suit it s purpose but I highly suggest buying something of better quality 
1 0 Pretty poor carseat This carseat is hard to install with the booster still attached The fabric is very cheap and it melted in the dryer I wash my carseats after every roadtrip and it didn t even last one roadtrip before melting It ripped the day that I got it trying to adjust the straps I was very disappointed in this carseat I would not purchase it again I loved my previous carseats being the Alpha Omega and a Graco If you are looking for something cheap this is the product There are other products out there that are in the same price range that would be better manufactured Try those ones first This is an awful carseat 
1 0 An OK product I bought the Avent Breastshells because of my sore nipples and a way to collect leaking milk while I was not nursing and relieve some engorment 1 It is very messy when removing the colleting cap 2 My nipples are still sore 3 And the only way to relieve engorment pain is to nurse or to pump If I would have known about these factors I would not have purchased this product 
1 0 did not work for me It made my breasts look funny it made my nipples more irritable it left painful marks on my breasts Hardly ever used it 
1 0 Not for me I tried to use these to relieve the pain but they did not work for me They were hot and of course they also showed right through any top I was wearing I had too much company after having my baby to use these they required too much work and attention 
2 0 Could use some improvements Not wide enough for the shoulders of a 6 month old when in recline position The wheels have a mind of their own The handles make it hard to go up curbs Hard to close up need both hands and foot But can fit a Graco infant car seat compact fold and light 
2 0 bummed out We ordered the double stroller because it had really good reviews and it sounded like it would fit us perefctly Our children are 2 5 and 10 months Our 2 year old has almost outgrown the back as her head is higher than the back support Also with in 6 months we had two different stollers because both has issues with the rain shield and peek a boo window cracking also the black out line seam came apart from the red fabric The kickers was when we pick up our stroller from from the airport in Mexico and the latch mechanism gave away when my two kids were in it It cloapsed because the locking system melted oops I guess someone forgot to check that on part of the test 
2 0 Tried to like it But after ordering it twice from Amazon and having both arrive either defective or damaged I give up on this stroller First one arrived and it turned out after assembly that the front fork was funky one side longer than the other therefore making it impossible for the wheel to sit correctly So we returned it to Amazon and were sent a new one It arrived in a horribly damaged box but we put it together anyway put my almost 3 year old and 2 month old in it and tried it Veered to the right and after close inspection once again we noticed that the front fork was messed up probably during shipping Also my 2 1 2 year old s head was brushing the top of the canopy and this stroller is VERY heavy and hard to turn yes I knew the front wheel would be fixed and had anticipated having to lift it to turn etc Too bad I really wanted to like this stroller but I just don t have much faith in the company anymore 
1 0 A Total Bust The volume control on this is totally lame I can t get it quite enough to put on the crib for bedtime Also the sound quality is poor in general I suppose it s OK for just playing in the room but definitely not for bed You can probably get something with better sound quality for a comprable price 
1 0 NOT USEFUL FOR LARGE BUSTS I bought this item on my own because I read the wonderful reviews it received I really don t know HOW this item can be used Even if you don t use the air vented cups which collect the leaking milk you can plainly see the soft shells in loose clothing I was wearing a sweater you could see the shape of the shells right through it If you do use the cups they supply you look absolutely abnormal I guess this doesn t work for large breasted women 
2 0 Parts were damaged We haven t yet put the bed together so it might be great but I gave it 2 stars because it should arrive intact but it didn t This was a common complaint in reviews Two of the main pieces were seriously scratched or chipped It did was definitely not damaged in shipping because it was packed well There is a phone number to call if parts are damaged We ll do that soon I ll update this review if everything is fixed 
1 0 Very Unhappy We received this item as a Xmas gift last year and within 4 months the legs have broken My two year old twin boys loved playing at the table but sadly the durability of this product was very poor The legs were very unstable upon receipt of the item We were extremely dissapointed which is unusual being that it was a Step 2 product 
2 0 Not very good Unless your baby has very long legs they are not going to be able to push the buttons to spray the water My son is 1 and cannot reach them with his feet in either his convertible seat or the infant seat However he is fascinated with it and leans forward to grab at it when I am trying to buckle him into his seat Also I have had mine about 4 months and the water is evaporated out of it and I am not finding a way to put new water into it The floaty things inside get stuck between the plastic after the water has evaporated and it s kind of ridiculous to have to bring it in every day to keep it out of the heat 
1 0 Poor Engineering Who ever designed this gate has no clue what to expect from a 1 year old child This gate is all look and no function It looks great when you install it but had no strenght to resist a 13 month old child from pushing it in the middle and almost breaking it If you plan on buying this gate be prepared to do a little bit of drilling and bolting to make it work I was finally able to use the thing only after I bought four 8 32 x 1 3 4 long screws with matching washers and nuts and bolted the middle of the gate together I did this by unscrewing the original connection at the middle of the gate and overlapped the pieces together about 6 then drilling two holes about 4 apart on the top and bottom rails and bolting together It works But it s not what someone should have to do after spending thie price for something Good luck 
1 0 Too Flimsy I recently purchased this gate for an opening in my home that is 68 inches wide Within one week of use the wood splintered apart in the center rendering it completely unusable I am returning the gate and puchasing the more expensive metal type This gate is a perfect example of getting what you pay for 
1 0 Not strong or safe I recently purchased this gate as I needed a gate for a space that is 93 inches wide I was so happy when I found this and for the price Well I installed it with no problem at all But it is not secure It actually bends forward and backward with barely any pressure and when my daughter leaned against it the wooden dowels that hold the bars together actually started to break AWFUL and very unsafe Target com was very helpful in sending UPS to pick it up 
1 0 Flimsy Hard to Steer and NO Sun Protection I can t believe anyone would give this stroller a good review We have 10m twins and have been using the stroller for about 4 5 months It s terrible PROBLEMS 1 NO SUN PROTECTION the visors are locked in place Unless the sun is directly overhead or at your back it will be beating in your babies eyes and you ll need to buy a non Peg Perego sunshade accessory 2 HARD TO STEER It gets stuck going across the lawn and on compacted dirt If the sidewalk buckles just an inch common from tree roots the stroller is stopped dead in its tracks It s hard to steer in a straight line so it s easy to get stuck when going through narrow doorways or down narrow sidewalks 3 IT S FLIMSY The bottom of the storage area underneath stretched and sagged after a month of use It now drags on the ground and rubs against the wheels even when nothing is in it The cupholder broke during the first week 4 HARD TO UNFOLD It takes two hands to unfold and you have to give it a vigorous shake to get it to completely unfold and snap into position Don t even THINK about about trying to set it up with a baby in your hands you need both hands free to deal with this thing 5 BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT The stroller comes with no weight height age suggestions When we first tried to put our twins in it they were swimming in it and couldn t be upright When we called Peg Perego and asked how big the kids should be to use it safely the support rep said don t know Yes it s lightweight and folds up nicely But the light weight is actually a drawback it means the handle and legs are flimsy and wobbly resulting in a stroller that s difficult to steer My advice would be to seriously consider jogging strollers Even if you aren t an active parent I m not get something sturdy with big wheels to get you over the dips and bumps and cracks and patches of sand dirt and grass that you will encounter If stroller size is the most important factor to you look at stadium seating strollers 
1 0 Horrible I purchased this when I was due to have my second baby I thought Peg Perego products were supposed to be so great and they are always so much more expensive I don t mind spending the if you get better but this is just a horrible stroller It doesn t turn easily at all the wheels constantly get stuck There is one cup holder that is soooo small and doesn t stay upright There is no room for any storage bags pocket book keys phone snack They trays for the kids in front are so small and narrow the seats are too tight and small they are not comfortable for the children whether they are awake or asleep There is nothing I like about this at all it makes going out where ever not easy at all For the amounnt of money theu have the nerve to charge for this they should be ashamed I actually use my orignal cheap single stroller instead 
1 0 Not Worth The Money Spent This stroller is made of very cheap material Merely after a few months of light use the stroller is already hard to push and wheels are easily stuck whenever I try to make a turn Even for a less than half an inch road bump I have to physically get in front of the stroller and lift the front wheels in order to get pass The shopping basket touches the ground whenever the road is a little uneven and the outside fabrics is already worn out Not to mention the sun shades are no use at all because they are too small Without buying an extention shade they are practically just some decoration to make this product more look like a stroller It is definitely not worth the price BTW their customer service is terrible as well 
2 0 FRUSTRATING for the money I bought this about a year ago based on great reviews I m not surprised to see bad reviews a year later Problems The uneven weight difference causes the Aria to pull The small wheels grab into anything softer than concrete forget the grass at the park The trays are too small for sippy cups and more than a couple of cheerios The fabric storage area underneath is held up with six buttonholes that tore after a few uses with a not very heavy diaper bag The straps are really tricky to figure out and I ve never been able to get them right The shades are very small and next to worthless The drink holder is negligible and sometimes interferes with opening and closing the stroller For the money I spent I wish I d been less afraid of getting something a little heavier and go with a jogger style with a swivel front wheel It s amazing how weight of a stroller is an issue with your first child but how Herculean you become once you have two Also the whole one handed open close feature that I craved on my single stroller is a non issue when you have two kids because it s safest to have them strapped into carseats before dealing with the stroller anyway If I could I d sell this one and get a jogger I need something that moves on the mulch and grass at the playground but I don t think I could sell this one for more than 20 in clear conscience A shame 
2 0 Not durable I have two double strollers 1 front and back Graco and this side by side Aria I don t use the front back Graco much do to not being able to have both children sleeping at the same time 2 1 2 year and 1 year I had the Peg MT single first and loved it So thought the product quality would be the same Used it for 2 years with no problems But have to say stay clear of the aria design Our side by side had numerous pieces fall off cup holder seat clip logo tag clip to hold trays in place etc Its not durable at all We even have to close it using a pen on one side due to the clip you lift on the left side falling off too We took it on a plane trip last week and have sworn the whole stroller off My sister in law had the single and was having the same problems with the product She has since bought the Maclaren single and I am in the process of purchasing the Maclaren Twin Techno It may cost more but it would have been alot cheeper buying it first than second 
2 0 Very overpriced for what you get I bought this stroller for when we had our second child My children are 19 mo apart I had the Aria single stroller for my first and loved it This one is definitely not the same For one thing it is very hard to steer and get over bumps The wheels are always getting stuck Second it is hard to close The most frustrating part is the steering issue Also my Aria decal fell off as well many months ago I ve only had the stroller for nine months One more thing the canopy to block out the sun is basically worthless since it offers very little protection from the sun 
2 0 wheels get stuck If you are walking straight without turning then this stroller is good for you But just try turning and especially sharp turns you ll be stalling and getting stuck the entire way 
2 0 must have for nursing moms My hsuband and and decided that I would nurse Hailey her entire first year I work at a school and was able to pump twice a day I didn t like doing it in school though because there wasn t space for it SO I would go in my car and do it All I had a first was the battery pack I would go through 10 batteries a week and half way through the week I would loose strength suction Once I got the adapter I never had a problem again We could go anywhere and I would always have access to power Including when we drove from VA to GA My husband would drive and I would pump It is great 
2 0 Not really odor less or child proof This diaper pail is affordable and uses regular garbage bags both of which were important to us when buying a diaper pail BEFORE the reality of dirty diapers Even when we emptied the pail often and sprayed it with Lysol between uses it still smelled bad every time we opened it Sometimes the smell seeped out so it made the whole bedroom stink And my kids have no problem pressing the blue lid popping latch and of course adding their toys or other opjects to the contents of the dirty diaper pail The twisting mechanism to remove the full bag is a great idea It helps you not get the face full of odor when you open the pail BUT you cannot let the pail get even close to full or it wont twist And after two years of use the twisting mechanism doesn t work anymore The latch for the small opening is also broken 
1 0 Definitely NOT odorless I bought this diaper pail because it used regular garbage bags and it was less expensive Well I learned my lessen you get what you pay for Like some other reviews the spring on my top broke which is supposed to keep the claw if you will closed after you put the diaper in and keep the smell in I changed the bag often but the pail still absorbed the awful smell and after cleaning it and soaking it it still stunk I am now on my second child and decided to buy the diaper genie I hope this will work out much better 
2 0 Broken Spring I didn t give this pail 1 star because it does keep the stink out and it does take standard garbage bags After a few months of use the spring assembly on the blue cover popped off I assembled it back together and within a few days the spring broke in half I tried to get another spring by calling Safety First They only had the blue top without the spring The guy said I d just have to buy another pail if I wanted a working pop top 
2 0 Unhappy Customer This diaper pail is certainly the worst I have used It works ok for about a week and by the end of that first week I was ready to get a new diaper pail It does not keep oders in much at all and I don t even put poopy diapers in it After about a week the springs started constantly falling off of the thing inside that supposedly keeps the bag closed and the oder out so it doesn t do any good Yes a plus is the using regular bags but so does the Diaper Champ and it also keeps oders in much better than this I m definitely going back to the Diaper Champ I only bought this one because it was the only one at my store now I know it was worth the wait for the Diaper Champ in the mail 
2 0 Not exactly ODORLESS My husband and I bought this with the hopes that it would keep the odor inside and we could save the money on refills Well it did not control odor The plastic disk that is included to neutralize the odor works for about a week The odor escaped even when the pail was closed You do save money on refills at first But when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows you have to change the bag more often I used A LOT of baking soda and Lysol spray to help control the stink Also the button on the top that opens the pail can fail easily and it is also very easy for a child to get into once they start pulling up on things I would not recommend this product 
2 0 Not up to par Pro Inexpensive and can use regular household 13 gallon garbage bags Can add any odor disk in an available cup provided Con Does not mask odors I have 8 month old triplets and it doesn t help at all Even with one baby to change the bag daily is a waste of a big bag unless one baby goes through tons of diapers a day With my triplets they still don t fill the bin in a day about every other day I have the original Diaper Genie with my 10 year old but thought against using it since we d have to buy the refill bags so much more often with triplets The old Genie doesn t hold as much but it sure holds the smell better If I had it to do over again I would not buy this pail which I bought two one for upstairs and one for down If the smell isn t a problem for you go for it But if you re picky with the smell research something else 
2 0 Very heavy and bulky stroller I was very excited to finally recieve this stroller but after I put it together which was pretty simple it was very heavy and bulky to handle I was looking for a stroller to accomodate my big 2 1 2 year old and a new baby due soon I bought this stroller sight unseen because it seemed like the perfect solution I was not able to load it in the back of mt SUV due to the size and weight and it is very long and hard to steer Anyone considering the Ionic color pattern may again want to check it out in person because the silver fabric is very shiney It does not accomodate my Evenflo carrier either so I would have needed to also purchase the Graco carseat I am returning the stroller to Amazon today 
1 0 Not Recommended By Me I wish I would have checked the reviews other people wrote before buying this item These are flimsy thin little sheets that are not snug or even slightly fitted for that matter I m definitely going to have to purchase another brand that will actually fit the play yard pad Fortunately there are other products that work better if this was the only option I might as well not have a sheet on at all 
1 0 Very disappointed I bought the set thinking that it was similar to the newer edition of the Nurser which I already had but needed more bottles for convenience I was very disappointed The lids leaked and the nipple rings leaked and the bottle plastic seemed cheap I used it for about a week and then got rid of it 
1 0 THIS GATE IS GARBAGE It s flimsy breaks at the slightest touch it s a PAIN to open and close My 15 month old figured out that all you have to do is shake the gate a little and it opens I found this out when I was putting groceries away I went to look for her and she was on the 2nd stair from the top I can t say enough bad things about this gate It s worthless If I could rate it MINUS stars I would 
2 0 Adequate for my purposes The problems I had with this gate 1 The instructions for using the template to install the hinges for the fixed gate was not easy to understand I finally gave up and I improvised Doing so the installation went more smoothly 2 The gate is not sturdy If anyone were to bump into it I m pretty sure it would break 3 The mechanism to click unclick the lock is more difficult than it should be Fortunately the people who will using it have a strong enough grip to get it to work Despite these flaws however this gate does serve its purpose in my case I bought this gate to keep my dogs confined to a room which it does They don t go near the gate so fortunately I don t have to worry about them leaning on or jumping on it As for the locking mechanism it s annoying and I m just hoping it doesn t get any worse This gate would not be safe for kids 
1 0 A complete waste of money Worst Gate Ever If I could give it negitive stars I would We bought two of these gates due to a couple of very wide openings that needed to be secured These gates are horrible and very poorly designed Every time someone tries to open the gate it sags and pulls the wood dowels out of the frame and it completely falls apart We have older children that have had to resort to crawling over it to get into the living room just to avoid its eminent collapse And often it collapses anyway Now my 11 month old son has figured out that if he shakes the gate at the joint he can pull it completely apart and crawl right through Now we have to purchase new gates that actually work to replace these 
1 0 Don t waste your money This gate is absolutely worthless If I could give it zero stars I would It was difficult to install and is very flimsy I have it at the top of the stairs and I don t trust that it will hold at all I hate that I spent so much on the gate and now I have to purchase another one 
1 0 Do not buy this gate This is the flimsiest gate ever To boot it is not cheap I couldn t even use the screws that came with the gate I had to use nails and duck tape The instructions were wrong about sizing it up to fit your area and it took me over 1 hour to put it together Unfortunately when I bought this gate there were only 2 reviews posted one was good and one was not so good So I was a little confused but I needed a swing gate So needless to say I wanted to make sure that I put my comments on so that no one else will get swindled This gate isn t even worth 1 0 
1 0 Piece of junk Hard to install ridiculously confounding installation directions and when you re done it s flimsy Don t waste your money 
1 0 buy the configure gate instead This gate is horrible to try to open and close don t try to pinch pennies when it s your little one s safety and YOUR convenience at stake Buy the Configure Gate instead you ll be glad you did It is well worth every penny this one isn t worth a thing 
1 0 Waste of money I bought this car seat because it looked actractive and safe Well after one month I returned it because it is the worst car seat ever The car seat sits so upright that my sons head was always falling completely forward He never looked comfortable The car seat comes with the strap covers that are suppose to make the car seat comfortable These things only make it worse because they are extremely rough and bulky This car seat is extremely heavy even without the infant in it The carrying handle is a joke because you have to push the canopy back to put your arm under it The canopy is also terrible because it barely works It only works when the sun is directly above you in the sky I was constantly having to change the direction I was carrying the car seat to avoid the sun beaming on his face unlike the Graco where you can pull the shade all the way down I hated returning this because I really liked the looks of it but I had to for my sons sake I bought the graco seat in the blackwell print which is an o k looking fabric We are both soooo much happier He looks comfortable and a little more reclined The sun isn t in his face and I have 130 extra dollars that I can spend on something else I think people mainly buy peg perego because they like the way it looks as I did or because they expect it to be high quality because of the high price as I did But in actuality it just sucks I wish that Graco would make their prouducts a little more stylish because they are definitly more practical and functional 
2 0 It s just a car seat These retail now for 229 at BRU Just ridiculous I own one bought it on eBay for 28 since it was a local pickup only sale I got a heckuva deal I ll admit This is a fantastic carseat but folks it s JUST an infant carseat I went looking on eBay for one since having had babies before I couldn t fathom shelling out even 100 for a cheapo often recalled Graco let alone 229 for a Peg Perego All new babies sweat in car seats they can t maintain their own body temp until 4 months of age which is when they grow out of these seats unless your back goes first I understand the precautions about car seats being in car accidents another folly of the infant gear industry If car seats are in accidents they re junk folks they aren t in re saleable condition And when was the last time that you heard of a car accident involving a baby Because how many new parents of newborns who would buy a 229 carseat read first child go out further than a trip to the store It s a regular old car seat They can t do much to these really except change the fabric They pretty much prey on your fear surrounding your new pride and joy so they gauge you on your emotions hey I m a sucker too Infant seats are notoriously small so that you have to buy up the next size faster They get your money on the car seat and then the stroller before you are out of that hazy new parent fog and wise up Save your money your baby or your back muscles will grow out of this in 4 months no matter what and then it s 229 right down the drain faster than a speeding bullet Guess you can save it for baby 2 Think of it this way for the SAME amount of money buy a Britax Roundabout and have it last for 4 years versus 4 months or go on eBay and buy one of these 4 months old and pretty much brand new for less than half the new price 
1 0 it is disappointedly bad for my baby The design is pretty narrow My 3 4 months baby was far more under the pounds as the product described The product tightened her so much that when she was in it she would cry Unless you have a very small and quiet baby otherwise it is not a wise choice 
1 0 Broke after 2 uses don t buy As the other reviewer stated the seal appears to be faulty on this and it stopped working almost straight away I have seen many other bad reviews of this product as well 
1 0 Pity it only worked a couple weeks I bought this thermometer and liked it but after I used it a few times the buttons stopped working and I couldn t turn it off I opened it to remove the battery and found that it had water in it A bath thermometer should at least be waterproof 
2 0 Waste of Money I love the idea of this product Like many of the other reviewer s I don t have the regular traditional style crib Our crib converts to a toddler bed This product is based on traditional cribs and only works on those styles of cribs I would love to use this product to protect my little on when they come out with one s that are more with the current styles of cribs like mine s 
2 0 Great idea wrong crib This is a great idea however if your crib has anything larger than a Jenny Lind style piece of wood on it it won t work We don t have a sleigh style crib but the top edges were still too large for the velcro to even touch It would be great if they would come up with a larger size to work for the more popular larger style cribs everyone seems to be making buying these days 
1 0 DON T WASTE YOUR MONEY I bought this item because our son kept on getting his legs and arms stuck This item was made for a portable small crib not your typical crib I had to go out and spend another 40 on velcro so I can make it long wide enough to fit my son s crib It is not worth the aggravation in altering it to fit the crib Don t waste your money on something that is not going to work 
1 0 Not worth the money Product is not worth the money Made the bassinet very unstable 
2 0 Unsafe unfortunately your options are limited These extensions should have been included with the co sleeper As it is the co sleeper is lower than the average adult bed and the extensions are required if you want your child sleeping on your level The fact that they sell it as a separate item is pure gouging for an extra few bucks which is irritating They are simple pieces of plastic and shouldn t add but a dollar or two to Arms Reach s cost There are twelve pieces so you can use a max of 3 pieces per leg to increase it to the maximum height We had to do just that and found that the three connected pieces are very unstable It s too bad they charge so much for a poorly constructed set of unstable plastic pieces What they should do is provide a set of pieces of varying heights to prevent too many connections to a bed that s holding your precious child 
1 0 just awful do not like this product it is very hard to get rail under bed pops out of rails track and it is sooo hard to get back in trac 
2 0 flimsy as a stroller I found the product highly unsafe as a stroller The handle is very flimsy and is not strong enough to control the direction of the stroller Also the wheels do not lock properly and safely Its ok as a car seat but as a stroller has a lot to improve 
1 0 actually negative 5 stars DO NOT BUY This product was terrible First and foremost this seat did NOT fit on American Airlines Business Class seats Secondly the rear facing car seat tilts so far forward that your baby is falling forward agains the harness and if they fall asleep their face is pressing against the seat belt The wheel covers fell off the first time I used it The stroller is a piece of junk When I called the company to explain my problems they never even called me back so on top of it all they have a horrible product and terribel customer service to match Do not buy 
1 0 Not as useful as I thought it would be I thought that this bathtub would be the best thing because of the shower and spa feature But the shower is so hard to use it s so hard to push the button and hold the shower head at the same time You also have to worry about your baby falling off or sliding down off the sling beacause it s just not positiioned right it sits too high up and she just looks uncomfortable on it You also have to worry about your baby hurting their toes on the shower and spa unit It wasn t worth 40 the sling and the spa and shower unit isn t useful or helpfula t all 
2 0 More Features Not Always Better When I saw this tub I thought WoW this is great It had everything Well after receiving the tub as a gift for my shower I decided to try it before the baby came I am so glad that I did The pump for the spa and shower was super loud and had a leak The shower was very difficult to operate I had to press really hard The only thing that I loved about the tub was the sling It is very nice I think when it comes to buying a tub for a baby simple is better in the beginning speed is key the baby gets to cold to really enjoy the features of this tub In my opinion get a simple tub and splurge on something else 
2 0 Not sure it is worth the money We don t have our baby yet but have tried the tub to see if it works The first one we bought did not work at all so we exchanged it this second one the spa works but the shower doesn t The company is sending me a new motor saying that is must be the motor Will try it again with the new motor of if the third one doesn t work we will return it and get a different tub and probably something else for that money 
2 0 Pretty useless In theory this sounds awesome but in reality is comes really close to being useless 1 The spa is nothing more than a light flow of water which isn t even enough to create bubbles it comes out of the corner of the pump unit so hardly any of the stream will reach your baby 2 The shower head has a button that is nearly impossible to keep pressed in for longer than 10 seconds the flow of water is very weak so is not powerful enough to rinse out hair A cup does a better job than this 3 The tub itself is pretty decent the plateau used to lay your baby on seems nice and comfy and the temperature indicator is a nice bonus All in all I wish we had saved our money and just gone with a normal tub I advise anyone else to do the same 
1 0 Stinky mold trap I liked this tub at first The size was nice and the sling was comfortable and good support for my preemie newborn After about a month of use though there was a horrible odor emitting from the mesh sling This was after squeezing it out as best I could and propping it up to dry after every use The sling is not machine washable and therefore unusable after it gets ruined by mold I stopped using the sprayer after the first couple days It was just too much of a pain to fill it up everytime especially since it doesn t even spray well The other reviewers are correct in saying that the button on the sprayer is difficult to press Especially when your hands are wet and slippery It s a good thing BRU will take back anything I am off to return it and purchase the old faithful cheapie tub 
2 0 Not worth all the hype I registered for this tub wanting it very bad for my newborn I thought what a great idea for fussy babies to have a spa and not to mention the shower rinse Well the first time I used this it took more time to set it up than I did using it Also the button on the shower head IS hard to press and the sprayer needs to remain upside down or it will leak water allover your bathroom found that out the hard way When you use the spa bubbles it makes the water cold very quick My daughter does love the spa effect but I think she prefers warm water throughout her bath The one thing that has really annoyed me is the baby sling has a moldy smell to it I have washed and dried it many times and cannot get this smell out Needless to say I had to purchase another insert for the tub which doesn t fit very well so Im a bit irritated Overall this is a good idea it needs some kinks worked out of it Just not worth 40 So now Im off to target to purchase a new tub 
1 0 piece of junk This is my first amazon review b c I feel this is such junk I had to review it and epinions didnt have it listed Usually I can find something to do with a junky product but this is so junky I can t do anything with it I might as well have just washed the money down the drain The fabric is rough too rough for a new baby the hole is too big for a tiny baby to lay atop it well but a bigger baby laying on it even on the bottom of the tub as intended is unstable As a seat it immediately fills up with water if you even touch it once filled it sinks How can it support a baby if baby can t touch it or it sinks You have to ring it out in order to use the plastic hanger it comes with b c it absorbs so much water it is way to heavy for the convenient hanger the hanger ends up bending so much the thing slips off or it looks like it is going to break Not easy to do with baby in hand so you have to leave it sitting in the tub while you get baby out and get a chance to go back later I have 4 kids and have tried a lot of tubs seats and supports for the tub some I disliked but none even come close to the uselessness of thi 
1 0 Great if you want your kid to sink I ve never written a negative review if I could give this zero stars I would First of all it sinks the instant you put it in the tub like all the way to the bottom of the tub The tag says to ring it out if it sinks hmmm how do you do that when your kid is in it Second of all it weighs about 100 lbs when you take it out of the tub I swear this is the worst baby product I ve ever owned and I ve owned a LOT My 6mo son sits up great on his own was slipping and sliding around in this falling backwards I had to hold him the entire time with both hands pathetic Don t waste your money Tomorrow we will be going out to get the traditional plastic bath seat good grief 
1 0 Get a seat instead I would recommend a seat that clamps to the side of the tub over this if your baby moves at all This seemed like a good idea but my little guy was kicking and moving all over It barely floats and sucks up water so it is extremely heavy to lift up and hang to dry when you are done with the bath It also says that it is for 0 months on up but I definitely wouldn t use this if your baby can t sit 
2 0 Maybe okay for a girl but not a boy Seems like a good idea for a seat I liked the handles for them to hold on to more sanitary and it sits okay on a big adult seat But the opening is just too small It is not the lack of a deflector I have another brand with a bigger opening for our other bathroom and my son does fine on that one This one the pee gets all over his legs the seat the stool and the floor each and every time This is a big hassle unsanitary and a pain to clean up each time he tries to go potty Maybe it would be okay for a petite girl but not for a boy We are shopping for a replacement now I don t want a deflector type because the doctors warn that they can scrape a little boys private area and cause them to not want to sit on the potty because it might hurt We just teach him to point it down and on a potty with a bigger opening that works just fine 
1 0 no splash guard my 2 1 2 year was interested in this seat right away much more so than his small potty However he cries every time because the small bump in the front is not sufficient enough of a splash guard He gets wet the floor and his step stool are all wet Clean up is a nightmare It s in the trash now 
2 0 Okay but not great I bought this seat for my son when he was probably around 6 months old and just starting on solid foods Ten months later I hardly ever use the darn thing It worked okay for us for a little while but it was not one of my better baby purchases My complaints with the product Not particularly sturdy The backrest portion in particular seems to pop off way too easily The straps that secure it to the kitchen chair are annoyingly long and in the way Not such a problem when the seat is secured to the chair because you can just tuck the straps in somewhere However everytime I remove the seat from the chair the straps prove to be a real pain in the rear And unfortunately it seems I need to unstrap and remove the seat after every meal to clean the bits of food that inevitably end up on the big chair to which this seat is secured another complaint The second tray which pops on over the swing away tray at least on my particular model is very easily removed by my son He lifts it up and dumps his food on the floor The point of this second tray was to make food prep and cleanup easier but it fails miserably This seat is not at all sturdy or useful as a stand alone seat It HAS to be strapped to a chair or it will easily tip over The good things about this product are that it is relatively inexpensive and is a good spacesaving alternative to a regular highchair which sucks up so much floor space It is also fairly easy to clean due to the plastic design Overall it is not a bad product but not on my list of favorites If I had it to do over I would have bought a similar type of chair but probably a different brand 
1 0 Terrible Design We had been researching booster seats for our 2 year old and we found this seat and thought it was an large enough and sturdy enough for our rambunctious son Boy were we wrong The first time we put our son in it the seat fell apart So we popped it back into place and all he has to do is wiggle a bit and the seat pops out again He only weighs 30 pounds and it specs for up to 50 I would definitely not recommend this to anyone 
1 0 what were they thinking this idea is nice but the tray is hard to fit up to your child its tight or too loose were food is in there lap next the tray is hard to get off and wash next mine came with a tray to cover or use as a tray and that is really hard to get off by the time i got it off i was ready toss it in the trash unless you are super woman i would not bu 
2 0 It lasted a year It lasted a year and it goes in the dishwasher and that is all the good there is to say about it Now the bad The pivot point where the back attaches to the chair is poorly engineered and comes off way to easy Mine is warn to the point that my 20 month old can pull it off when he is sitting in it First he takes the tray off also very easy for him and then he pulls the back off At that point he shimmies out of the straps and is out of the whole thing Don t plan on it lasting through more than one child 
2 0 Problems with seat popping out of base unit I purchased two of these seats for my twins over a year ago when they were about 18 mos or so I have had consistent problems with both seats frequently popping out of the base units The sides and back height positions are set at the same levels so that is not the problem Weight of the children is not an issue as the weight limit is 50 lbs per the specs and my boys are not even close to that I would not recommend these seats based upon my experience with them 
2 0 OK for smaller children maybe We bought this booster when my son was 18 months old as he loved to sit like his parents However he is a very large boy 35 and 34 lbs and the tray could not fit over his legs comfortably So we took off the tray so he could sit at the table and he uses the holes where the tray attaches to stick food We went back to the high chair without the tray and he is perfectly happy We use this seat when visiting relatives which is nice it is so portable but then spend time afterwards cleaning up the food underneath the seat where he stuck the food 
1 0 VERY UNSAFE We bought the bumbo seat for our five month old baby By her fifth month she fell on her face with it still attached to her bottom She was hurt pretty bad No way this seat can keep the baby in place with its own weight Please beware of how unsafe this product is Not at all what is advertised 
2 0 Seat UNSAFE My son received a Bumbo seat for Christmas At five months of age he rolled out of it and was laying on top of the seat At six months of age he turned in the seat and fell on to his HEAD on two different occassions The seat was on a flat surface He did this and I was standing or sitting right next to him I loved this seat when he first got it I told everyone I knew about it He has two older siblings and he loved to be able to watch them play His siblings loved him sitting in the seat because he was at their level Now I have absolutely NO confidence in the safety of this seat It is completely useless as his own body weight DOES NOT keep baby in place as advertised The seat has been rendered useless in my home because it is NOT safe and it is safer to put him in a traditional bouncy seat or on the floor 
2 0 Alright but overated I received this seat for a gift and was told how wonderful it is I have a large baby He was almost 17 lbs at four months old So his thighs and bottom barely fit in it after three to four months of age He also was able to get out of it bu straightening his back and legs He didn t seem very happy in it It may work better if you have a smaller baby but the chubbier ones will never fit for long 
1 0 What are all you people talking about I am SO perplexed at the popularity of this item When it first came out I purchased one for my son he was around six months old at the time He immediately figured out how to get out of the seat by leaning back extending his arms behind him and straightening his legs so I returned it By the time I had my second child a girl Bumbomania had kicked in and these seats were EVERYWHERE I began to think that my son s experience was a fluke and I purchased another one for my daughter Low and behold she immediately figured out how to get out of the seat in the EXACT SAME WAY So I returned the second Bumbo as well but not before noticing that the instructions did contain a warning that some children may be able to get out of the seat In conclusion although the Bumbo may work great for some BEWARE If you have little Houdinis like I do this product is simply not safe 
2 0 ok but not all that it was cracked up to be the monitor is ok but sometimes is staticky and other times just needs a new channel and the problem with that is that the button that changes the channel is in the baby s room not on the parent unit Also we like to have a second child unit elsewhere in our house and if both are on at the same time it seems to cause additional static broken signal only to be reset by changing the channel and no signal Overall i am very disappointed it got tremendous reviews and i expected a better product than the first years model i had previouly and i am goig back to my old one 
1 0 one of the worst purchases i have made for my baby i bought this item as so many people has said how much they loved it i find it a nightmare if you stand in the corridor between the monitor and the receiver it cuts out it does not work when on the charger it does not work unless there is a clear line between the two parts what a piece of junk I would in no way recommend this product to anyone 
1 0 purchase witth caution I will state that this monitor is very clear and has no interference BUT ours died after five months of just nighttime use and neither charger works we tried plugging the monitors directly into the wall charging for days at a time and even searched endlessly for replacement batteries with no luck I had ignored a review I read similar to the one I m writing just before I purchased this imonitor I learned my lesson Purchase with caution 
1 0 Waste of money I bought this pump because it was recommended by a lactation consultant I thought it would be the only pump I would need but it didn t work I found this out at the worst possible time the third day after giving birth when my milk came in I was completely engorged and my daughter was not able to latch on I tried this pump and it would not maintain suction I didn t have another pump handy and had to express milk by hand very painful at the time just so my daughter could latch on I have retried it several times using all the tips in the instruction manual and it never expressed any milk for me I was very disappointed with this pump and not able to return it A waste of money at a time when there was not much to spare 
2 0 not what expected I bought this for my daughter and I too had one light that worked my husband had to take light apart and play with the wires and somehow got the lights to work I am not crazy about the bar where the blocks go because it keeps falling off along with the hood on the front of the bus My daughter barely plays with it and the music only plays when we turn the bus on Needless to say I am very disappointed with this toy 
2 0 Worthless My baby got this for Christmas He was about 7 months old Now a couple months later he still doesn t play with it My 3 year old doesn t play with it either and he loves most of our other baby toys This toy is just not that interesting I wish my mother in law would have saved her money or bought shoes or anything useful at all 
2 0 Fun but BEWARE My daughter really LOVES this BUS Whenever it is in the room she rolls over to it and loves to sit up next to it She plays with the blocks and likes to discover how to hold them and also look at what is inside them The BAD thing with this is that it rolls when she is holding onto it and the little piece with the shapes flaps up My daughter was playing with it one day and the piece flaped up and she ended up with her arm stuck in between it and the toy and she was leaning on the flap putting pressure on it against her arm But since that snaps off we took it off and there has not been an issue since 
2 0 Regret asking for this I gave my father in law a couple ideas for my son s 1 year old Christmas gift and this was one of the items Boy do I regret giving him this as an idea It is a cheaply constructed toy The bus s hood doesn t even work correctly The toy does not do much of interest and it constantly makes this annoying noise The toy held my son s attention for less than 5 minutes My suggestion to anyone considering this toy is there are many more worthwhile toys on the market skip this one 
1 0 Poorly designed constructed toy I bought this toy for my 6 month old son to grow into over the next year because it seemed to offer a variety of ways to learn and play When putting it together Christmas morning the pieces did not snap together securely and kept falling off Also one light does not work The poor construction of this toy is disappointing coming from Fischer Price I will be returning not exchanging this toy Luckily my son is young enough that he will not miss it 
2 0 15 99 Get Over Yourself Baby Bjorn It s a chunk of plastic with some bits of rubber attached Effectively serves its purpose but for nearly 16 bucks Puleeeeeeeease 
1 0 This stool is unsafe My daughter has tipped this stool over 2 times I am returning it first thing in the morning I should have never let her on it a second time If she steps down on it on one side the whole thing tips over Please do not buy this product 
1 0 HUGE WASTE OF MONEY This was nothing but a cheap piece of masonite board that you can have cut for about 5 00 at any hardware store It cost me a total of 23 00 after shipping for this product It doesn t even look like the picture It isn t black with Angelcare written on it It is literally a normal brown piece of board It s blatant false advertizing I feel sick not to mention a total idiot for thinking I would actually need this particular board to go with my monitor If you have the Angelcare Movement Sensor monitor and don t have a flat bottomed crib then all you need is any old piece of wood or thick cardboard Do not buy this It is a disgrace 
1 0 Do not use on bed I was looking for something portable and to keep the baby close by I tried it out with a baby doll first and I ended up covering the Snuggle Nest with my blankets in the middle of the night 
1 0 The worst product EVER This is such a ridiculous excuse for a toilet seat lid It s easy enough to install but hello What s to stop anybody especially a toddler from lifting the entire seat and lid together Not a thing The kit that comes with it to secure it to the toilet rim is a joke in that it rattles around like crazy and when it s closed it doesn t fit snuggly around the seat so it s completely loose Total and complete piece of junk 
2 0 chest clip are uncomfortable We bought this travel system because it is light to be lifted and comfortable but the chest clips are so uncomfortable to close and hard to open specially the one that goes between the legs it is so hard to buckle and unbuckle that I m afraid I m going to hurt my baby every time we have to close or open them and is complicated to align them to finally buckle In fact I had an emergency with my baby and took a lot of time to open these clips 
2 0 horrible in so many ways At first loved it because the travel system with stroller is so light and doesn t look doudy like other systems But the harness buckle is so difficult to fasten that the baby gets irritated before we even get to the car The straps never tangled but it is extremely difficult to adjust as needed The carrying handle has to moved up down with two hands a button on each that must be simultaneously pushed to lower the handle Difficult to perform when you re already reaching into the center of the car to even get to the baby Yes it is a trendy color with the gray but it is not cotton and is not padded well and does not breathe It is horribly hot for the baby Still love the stroller by combi but I never recommend the car seat to ANYONE Luckily time to move 5 month old to a larger seat anyway 
2 0 We loved it At first Now we ve returned it We started out really liking this seat Its colors are not horrid like most of the others and it doesn t cry I have a baby It just looks nice and stylish Also our baby seemed very comfortable in this seat HOWEVER the 1 problem of this seat is its straps belts First you clip them together at the baby s midsection easy Then you need to try to get these 2 pieces to fit together at the bottom so you can clip them as one into the female end of the lap belt clip This is easier said than done as these 2 pieces are very difficult to hold together as you clip them as one into the other part of the belt clip It s hard to explain properly but really it s not easy to do especially if you have only one hand free Second the belts get twisted The 2 pieces at the base of the belt which need to be held together so they can clip into the female end of the belt clip they get reversed because the belt twists Think of taking your seat belt in your car and somehow twisting the belt itself so the seat belt clip now faces the wrong way If this has ever happened to you you know what I mean and it s a pain to fix Just like with this seat It seems to get screwed up effortlessly but then to fix it takes several minutes FORGET THIS THING We bit the bullet and exchanged it for a Peg Perego after we used a friend s when we went to visit them for a long weekend and realized that not all the infant seats sucked like ours did The final problem we noticed is that this seat was that our 14 pound son was basically already too big for it Yet the Peg Perego had plenty of growing room Yes it cost us about 100 more but it s well worth it for the ease of use and the fact that our son will fit in it until it s time for the standard non infant car seat 
2 0 OK Seat I was disappointed that the cup holders come off too easy they button onto the car seat and it isn t strong enough so when my boys try to stuff their juice or water in them they snap right back off The are no longer attached to the seats because I refuse to keep putting them back on I guess this seat is okay it is nice and plush but the downside to getting a backless seat which I didn t think about before I purchased this was the fact that the kids can t fall asleep in these seats My kids like I am sure most kids are when they go for a drive the motion knocks them right out But because there is nothing to support their head and neck they slump over and are very uncomfortable so they usually don t fall asleep unless they are just really beat and then I worry because I don t want them to get a crook in their neck I can say that this seat is very lightweight which is a big change coming from the regular child seat 
2 0 Probably not worth it I ordered this product for my 3 year old who just moved into a toddler seat and had head slumping problems The two major problems with this product is that 1 it s quite bulky and so her head would tend to fall forward anyway and 2 check if it will fit in your carseat I have the apex toddler seat that is quite wide and you can t leave the pillows in place they stand up at a 45 degree angle I attached elastic to the bottom in order to fix them to the plastic that holds the seat pad in place This works but obviously only if you re sitting next to them when they fall asleep Other than that you d have to stop the car get out and attach them then go again by which time the child is probably awake anyway To be honest I haven t seen a better alternative yet though It s quite good to pull around and use as a pillow for your own head on long trips though 
2 0 Doesn t work well with certain carseats When my son was in a convertible car seat which was tilted back slightly and had head side wings this pillow worked well It was propped well enough to support my son s head when he took a nap But when we had to switch him to a straight back booster seat that had shallow head wings this pillow was not usable at all 
1 0 Does not fit Britax Roundabout carseat I bought this for my three yr old and it does not work at all We have the Britax Roundabout carseat and there is not enough room for the pillow I returned it 
2 0 Waste of my money I bought this because the only way my 6 week old will sleep is in bed with me I bought this to try to reduce the risk of SIDS since his has been sleeping in my bed Unfortunately he kept moving and it was causing his legs to go off of the side of the sleeper Once his legs went off the side his upper body would roll which would cause his face to be almost right against the side of the sleeper Of course this concerned me so each time I woke up I had to move him again Finally after a couple of time of doing this I just took him out of it This is the second sleep positioner I have bought and both have been worthless 
1 0 too weak I couldn t wait to get it I got so excited when it finally arrived so I used it right away sooo disapointed it did not get anything out at all it is soooo weak The one from the hopital is great but broke from using it so much and then we got one from Target and it works but this nasal clear is no good do not buy it 
2 0 not worth it I was so excited about this product because it was sold out everywhere I looked so I figured it must be awesome Not so It is loud which freaked out my 8 month old and did not suck the stuff out of his nose very well I ve tried every aspirator on the market and nothing works better than the one they use at the hospital I took that one home with me and urge you to do the same Very disappointed 
1 0 Low suction This product pulls nothing out of the noses of my one year old twins We had hoped that it would be easier than manual aspirators but it has proven totally useless Unless your child s nose is leaking like a faucet save your money and get the rubber aspirators 
2 0 Disappointed Perhaps if I hadn t already had a different type of bunting I wouldn t be so disappointed with this one My sister loaned me her Eddie Bauer bunting when my son was born She will be having her next baby any week now so I had to return it to her which meant I had to buy a new one I saw nothing but great reviews on this product so I picked one up First of all I followed the washing instructions washing it separately on delicate and drying it on low and it ripped at the one seam Based on that alone I will be returning it Aside from that having used a bunting with a different design I am not thrilled with this one Part of the point of using a bunting is so that when you re in a car where you have heat you can open up the bunting on a longer drive so baby doesn t overheat This bunting zips down both sides to the bottom by the way zipping unzipping is tricky with a baby kicking around the zipper gets stuck in the material a lot rather than down the middle front that style zipper was NEVER a problem Then you have this thick cover at baby s feet and nowhere to go with it as the bottom of the carseat is up against the back seat of the car So you either have to rig it so it is up the back of the seat and tucked under the headrest or you have to leave it on baby s legs Also the top of this bunting does fold over so that baby s face isn t covered unless you want it to be BUT my 5 month old has no problem picking it up and pulling it up over his own face He did it this morning on the way to daycare This bunting is too thick for me to feel comfortable with him doing that And I can t be reaching in the back seat to pull it down off his face There is no disputing that the concept of a bunting is great and that this particular bunting is toasty warm It is wonderful being able to put the baby in his carseat and strap him in safely w out a snowsuit being in the way or having to bundle him up before going out and unbundle him every time you get to your destination But I don t think the design of the Urban Bundle Me is great and I actually think this bunting is TOO warm even with the bunting open on a long car ride the other day my son s back was all sweaty when we took him out of the carseat After calling several stores and looking at all my options at Babies R Us I ended up ordering a new Eddie Bauer All Season Bunting from Target com which cost less than 20 including shipping I can t wait till it gets here I will be returning the 60 Urban Bundle Me as soon as I can 
1 0 Broken headboard on upon delivery buyer beware I ordered this through Walmart Com and received it damaged but Walmart and or Storkcraft use a distributor called SEKO Worldwide The Seko delivery truck delivered the crib So either this is a Storkcraft problem or a SEKO problem but the head board had a piece completely split off in two and the other pieces were dented or chipped off Walmart is re odering another crib and having this one picked up for me as it is an 80 pound box Hopefully the next crib won t be damaged but if so I am giving up on Storkcraft completely Walmart didn t have a rating system to leave comments and when I saw others on this website that had damage problems I wanted to relay my experience as well Walmart graciously refunded my shipping fee which was large I then received the second crib and it was spotless The delivery man from Seko Worldwide said that they hear complaints on this a lot and blamed the air carrier that flies the boxes out to the ground shipping location I also emailed Storkcraft about what happen and the other negative reviews they offered to send a replacement piece for the broken piece but no mention about the dented chipped piece and then proceeded to place the blame on the retailer I was not impressed I was willing to take my chances on the reorder and was one of the fortunate customers who recieved an unmarked crib I put it together myself all the parts were accounted for and the drawer works great I only bought this for the price and the convertable feature but will not buy Storkcraft in the future 
1 0 Awful do not buy this chair I bought this chair used and I don t think it s worth the 50 I paid for it I also have the Fisher Price chair I have twins and that one is SO much better I wish I had 2 of those First like everyone has said it is ridiculous to clean Those people who said it s easy to clean must either not be really cleaning it or have babies that make very little mess Gross food particles collect in every crease and corner especially under the seat Most importantly the tray is way too high even at 1 yrs old my girls are uncomfortable reaching food on it and they are an average height weight The tray also doesn t come close enough so there is a big gap between the baby and the chair not dangerous but perfect for all the food to fall through and collect in the sides of the chair and on the lap Finally the tray is too big for an average size dishwasher so must always be washed by hand The FP high chair tray can go right into the dishwasher ONLY BUY THIS CHAIR IF THE ONLY THING YOU CARE ABOUT IS HOW IT LOOKS 
2 0 Not the greatest Now that I have this chair I m not going to replace it but I have two major complaints about it Our son is 20 months old and I still have to put a book wrapped in a dishtowel in the seat so he can comfortably reach the tray or our dining table Raising the height doesn t help because the arms of the chair come up so high and so far forward you can t scoot the chair in any closer to a table The chair also has a very large footprint unless you have a very spacious dining area it s hard maneuvering around it If I could do it over again I wouldn t buy this high chair 
2 0 Just OK I m on child number 2 with this chair and my complaints are the same 1 They tray is way too high for an infant young toddler to reach anything My son is 8 months old and he can barely see what is placed on top of the tray 2 It is a cleaning nightmare I am still finding food from my first born hidden in this chair Good points pop off tray divider that keeps them from slipping out cool colors I tried a friend s cheap Evenflo chair and I loved it 100 times better and it cost over 100 dollars less 
1 0 HATE IT I received this highchair as a hand me down Looks lovely mine is pale blue and lime green but is infuriating to clean I have never seen more cracks crevices screw holes all where baby food and slobber collect After one feeding with my hyper 7 month old the chair is beyond filthy You will need to buy toothpicks to get in all the crevices A friend of mine has a Fisher Price high chair which is much less complicated and easier to clean The price is insane glad mine was free I would never buy this chair even as a gift I would advise anyone considering this chair to go with something cheaper and easier to clean I would give it zero stars if I could 
1 0 very disappointed I agree with several others about it being VERY difficult to clean There are so many nooks and crannies I used it for my daughter and hated it and then tried it again when I had my son and it was no different My son is 16 months old and has been learning to feed himself and there are times that I do not want to let him practice because I dread how long it takes me to clean after each meal I went out and bought an inexpensive highchair without all of the bells and whistles and it works great Now I have more time to spend playing with him instead of cleaning a highchair 
2 0 nightmare to clean We had to clean this high chair nearly every day and the process itself would take 30 minutes I am not a neat freek in any way shape or form But you kind of have to clean this frequently as the food goes into every nook and cranny If i had to buy another chair I would get a wood one We have the Eddie Bauer booster now that our son is older We clean that once a day with a sponge which takes all of 1 minute and take the cushion off for a super clean once a week The Prima Pappa is comfortable and secure In the end I realized that we didn t need all the bells and whistles 
1 0 NO STARS First the adhesive velcro fasteners which attach this cover to the stroller were inadequate to say the least Second it is opaque so the kids couldn t even take in their surroundings Since it resembles a parachute the only reason that the kids even got fresh air was because the stupid thing wouldn t stay attached to the stroller the kids probably wouldn t have had fresh air Go for hats and sunscreen protective garments instead 
1 0 baby can t see out I bought this to keep sun out of my little ones eyes when we re out running Not only do the tabs not stick as any toddler would she protested being behind a curtain during when she just wanted to see the world Wouldn t you 
1 0 Awful Interference We LOVE this monitor but only when it does not have awful interference Unfortunately in the evening for some reason the interference is really bad and all we hear is static off and on for hours We do not live in an apartment or townhouse which I read was not recommended for this product but we do have wireless internet Only we aren t using it when there is static so who knows I love being able to see my boy but the static makes the monitor REALLY annoying 
2 0 Not a recommended walker The walker has a few flaws First of all the toy bar on the front table is not ideal It is too close to the child and only a few inches away from the child s head My son keeps bumping his forhead on the toybar when he is riding in the walker constantly The seat is too tight and the crotch area on the seat is too high it should be roomier and drop lower 
2 0 it only goes forward This is a nicely designed walker and my baby likes it for the most part but we are not exactly satisfied by it for one reason The front wheels turn all directions but the rear wheels don t Just like a car it can only go forward and backward but not sideways Sometimes my baby turns her upper body to the side and tries to reach something on her left or right but she can t push the walker that way because of the design and she gets frustrated If both front wheels and rear wheels were the types that turn any direction it would have had much greater mobility 
1 0 Unavaility of walkers I tried to buy a walker for my grandson and all the walkers were unavailiable You didnt even have one walker availiable How is it possible that such a big outlet like yours not to have one walker I was very disapionted I guess that I would have to rate you with a zero And I would like to know when will there be any walkers available I like to shop with Amazon 
2 0 Toy Doesn t Work We couldn t wait until our daughter was ready for a walker Unfortunately after countless times of putting in new batteries we realized that the toy didn t work I immediately contacted Kolcraft and they are sending me another toy I also wished I had gotten the one with the mirror instead I have the one with the spinning toy and my daughter keeps hitting her forehead on it And to add to that she only stays in it for about 15 20 minutes Other than that I really like the walker lol I think it will be better once we get a new toy 
2 0 Hard to Clean I saw this and I thought it would be great It would keep my daughter s food off of a dirty table and catch the food that she drops It does do those things but it is hard to clean It gets pretty dirty and in the catching pouch there are grooves that make it hard to wipe the mess out of I used it twice and will never use it again I recommend the Table Toppers they are disposable mats that you stick to the table and throw away when you are done They stay in place better and you can wrap them around the edge of the table so baby will not put mouth on table I use the mats with a crumb catcher bib from walmart that catches her messes better that this one did Her lap says clean and clean up is a lot easier You do not have to worry about putting the dirty mat back into your diaper bag 
2 0 not what I expected I was given this as a gift and I was very excited to use it out and about But when we were out in the restaurant they did not stick and my daughter could easily pull it off Plus when we were all done I had to try to clean it off as best I could then put it in my diaper bag yuck I much prefer the plastic disposable tablemats that stick on the table 
1 0 30 pounds I don t think so to see how worthless the Graco Lovin Hug swing is The baby in the swing is lying perfectly still and is 21 pounds the swing has a supposed 30 pound limit The swing is on hard floors is brand new as are the batteries and still the swing barely moves at all even on the highest level When I contacted the company they told me that the swing won t go as high when a baby gets larger but this brief movie proves that it won t go at all Instead I highly recommend the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Swing I only wish it held a larger baby so I could continue to use it 
1 0 Dont FIT in every CRIB Besides the fact that the straps wheren t long enough to hold on to my son crib it ended up on the floor every other day Save your money and don t buy it 
1 0 Don t bother with this item The quot sticky quot pads that are supposed to hold the organizer don t even stick so every morning I would wake up to find the organizer sitting in a pile on the floor next to the changing table and this was with absolutely NO items in it The organizer doesn t come with any information so I had no idea if there were alternate ways to hang the organizer or not This is a great idea but it is very poorly constructed 
1 0 Poor Quality The shelves are not sturdy and the pockets are very small don t waste your money it s not worth it 
1 0 Don t Bother I got two of these as shower gifts I thought that they would be so handy WRONG The velcro kept slipping and sounded as if it would fall off of the changing table The openings that are shown holding the powder and lotion are VERY small They will only hold the travel size or the next size up It was made cheep The quot shelves quot are not sturdy at all Save your money 
2 0 Didn t last long We loved the monitor at first The features are nice and the price was reasonable Then without event or explanation it died one day and we haven t been able to recharge one of the handheld units Maybe we got a dud 
1 0 Don t waste your money We purchased this because of the walkie talkie feature between the 2 parent units Don t bother Whenever any of the 3 units get within 10 feet of each other they let out a squeal that would wake the neighbor s baby What s the point of having a feature that allows you to clip the parent unit onto your belt if you can t then walk into the baby s room wearing it without it sounding like a police siren They are getting returned right away 
1 0 boooh You really do get what you pay for I got this for around 53 but I did NOT like this product at all The bumper is very scratchy and cheaply made The comforter is pretty cheap too The only thing I saved was the sheet and crib skirt which really only sit in a drawer as backup 
1 0 Worst Monitor Ever Tired of hearing your baby cry This is the monitor for you You ll be lucky to hear any sounds from your baby on this thing Looks like Evenflo was being literal when they named the product Whisper Connect You can barely hear anything at full volume I m going to return it tomorrow if I can resist backing over it with our car 
1 0 Useless The monitor was terrible It would only pick up our baby s voice when she was screaming It had a metallic sound to it and the different volume settings did not seem to make any difference It is going back to the store and I am looking for something else I wish I would have checked ratings first Choose something else 
1 0 Terrible quality We have the 49MHz Whisper Connect and love it see our review of that one We needed a second monitor to replace a 900MHz Fisher Price monitor that is 4+ years old and decided to try this one out We set the base across the room from our daughter and had her talk at her normal voice and we could barely hear here with the volume turned up We thought we must have a defective unit so we returned it and got another and we had the same problem There is no interference or static with the monitor but also no sound We re very unhappy with it and would not recommend it 
1 0 Highly Unreliable My son is 5 months old now and for the first 4 months the monitor worked pretty well We got a bit of static from time to time but I would have given it 4 stars BUT one night I woke up to reassure myself with the little green on light and saw that the monitor was not on Thinking it was a fluke I turned it back on checked the baby and went to bed But over the course of a couple of weeks it became more and more unreliable turning off at will It was also hard to turn it back on I had to flip the switch several times before it would work And this is not a battery issue since it was plugged in the entire time I went to the Evenflo website and read the FAQs There s a mention of a problem with the power light going out but nothing about the monitor itself going out Needless to say we ve thrown it away and have gotten a different brand I mentioned this to my friend with an 8 month old the other day and she said the same exact thing happened to hers just stopped working reliably She s bought a different monitor too Both of our new monitors are working perfectly now with less static I wouldn t recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes 
2 0 Too much static and alarm This monitor didn t work for us at all We heard a lot of static and the alarm would go off too It wouldn t work anywhere in my livingroom or kitchen The alarm was always going off 
2 0 still looking for the right one I thought I d try this monitor since it was a 900Mhz and had a far range Well I have problems similar to Sara s When I used the alternate channel to avoid the intermittant loss of signal and beeps I would get horrible static when my cordless phones rang or were being used When there was no beeping or loss of signal it s reception was clear That s why I gave it a 2nd star This product is going back to the store tomorrow and I will continue my quest to search for the right monitor 
2 0 Very disappointed I was so excited to buy this stroller It seemed perfect for my 1 yr old daughter The mesh back would be ideal for the hot humid weather It s light and easy to travel with It seemed sturdy Most of this was true until I used it for a month Honestly the seat is way too big My daughter was forever uncomfortable b c the straps were too loose even at their tightest to hold her and the seat was too deep With minimal padding and no recline she would bump her head on the side frame when riding around And to top it off the frame bent after basic use All we did was take it in and out of the car I was very disappointed Maybe this would be a great stroller for a 4 year old but don t buy this stroller b c you re looking for something smaller than your Graco but better than an umbrella stroller for your young toddler I think for the price and minimal features it should be of better quality Every review mentioned the carrying strap b c that s the ONLY extra feature This stroller was not for us 
1 0 Not the best I read all the Amazon reviews but still decided to go with the Avent sippy cup since I had relatively good experiences with the Avent bottles Unfortunately leaking is a real problem with these cups Not only does the milk seem to pour out of the sides no matter how well I try to fasten the lid but it does not flow easily for my son when he sips He ends up with a mouth full of milk So much for my efforts to get him to start using a cup I orginally used Playtex and he liked that well enough I only switched because the Playtex valve was hard to clean and easy to tear Now after wasting money on Avent I ll go back to Playtex and hopefully my son will be willing to give sippy cups another try I don t usually write Amazon reviews but I figured it was worth it in this case to save someone else the trouble Unless you want milk EVERYWHERE I would definitely avoid these cups 
1 0 Avent Leaks I ve heard Avent bottles leak but never experienced it myself I just bought the toddler cups and 18mths spouts and BOTH link Not just a littler either but with every use My daughter can shake milk all over the house if she pleases I find this odd b c the 6mths cups don t link at all I think these products are very hit or miss You may get a leaky cup or you they may work great 
2 0 Too many Parts This is an okay product with many many parts to clean The spout the ring for the top of the cup the handles and the plastic leak stopper oh and the cup All the parts fly around the dishwahser I ve lost many stoppers so I ve had to order through Avent The good thing is they don t leak 
1 0 I don t feel Magical when cleaning the leaks up I am so disappointed by another Avent product that is just no good Short term or long term these cups are not worth anything since they leak My son s cups have leaked on him on the floor in his diaper bag and in the car I don t understand why anyone if they say they have leaked would give this product anything but 1 star Mom s have enough too do running around cleaning after leaky unreliable products is not fun especially for the price of the Avent Magic Cup 
1 0 Constant Leaking I too thought that since we had such great luck with Avent bottles that we would love their magic cups I am constantly cleaning up leaks from these cups It seems like the lid and cup don t seal together well enough to withstand any activity I m sad to have to give Avent a bad rating but don t waste your money on these cups 
1 0 These are the worst Avent makes the best washable baby bottles around so we felt that their sippy cups would be just as good Well we were wrong Of the five cups we had all of them leaked and have since been thrown out The cups are five different pieces vs other brands that use three pieces which makes them harder to wash harder to put together and more pieces to lose As far as sippy cups go these are among the most expensive you can buy and worst that we used out five different brands We have had great luck with Greber s and Playtex s Please avoid 
1 0 Cheaply made The screws that come with the brackets are so soft they strip almost immediately was about to use my own then read the review below and decided I d be better off just screwing the furniture into the wall 
1 0 Broke in two after a year Don t buy I would have rated this item 0 stars if that were an option We discovered approximately a year after installing these that the plastic strap had become so brittle that it snapped in two with little manipulation Fortunately we discovered this because we were moving not because a piece of furniture fell I shudder to think what might have happened if our furniture had tipped 
2 0 Don t bother We got this as a gift and have used it 0 times It s expensive and poorly designed A large receiving blanket works well and is cheaper easier to fold and nicer looking 
2 0 Don t bother This did not work for us at all I found that I couldn t get it wrapped around our newborn without her kicking it off If you know how to swaddle then use the hospital blanket or another thin blanket made of cotton 
2 0 We had problems too I agree with the first reviewer Cindy I love the concept but the proportions on this swaddler just aren t right unless you have a really tiny baby or one that doesn t kick his her legs much my one month old boy weighs 11 lbs and is 23 inches long The velcro doesn t hold because the patches are too small and the knit fabric is too stretchy However I put him in the larger size SwaddleMe today and it fits much better 
2 0 Didn t measure up I am unhappy with this product My newborn baby is 22 long and weighs 7 pounds I purchased this item after speaking to the rep about size I ve found that my son can easily get his legs out of the bottom pouch through the opening I think that if there was a longer strip of velcro instead of the short square this would be prevented He also can get his arms out of the top If the velcro strip could be larger going more toward the back and side of the product this would not happen Maybe my son is more narrow at the top than some children and this is not a problem for many but I think this would make the product more useable one size fits all Also he is long and the small size was too cramped I m assuming the next size up would have been too wide for him and therefore making it impossible for his arms to stay inside which is happening anyway I like the product idea and the fabric and construction which is why I gave it 2 stars but this product did not work for me I have recently purchased The First Years swaddle blanket but have issues with that one as well I am currently searching for one to fit 
1 0 Good Monitor if you enjoy your neighbors listening in on your everyday living We have had this monitor for 18 months and have zero problems hearing our son in his crib and apparently our neighbors three houses down from us also have no problem hearing us We were outside today when our neighbor who also has a toddler just so happened to mention this to us So now we are looking to purchase a more secure monitor If you live out in the middle of no where or you don t mind other people listening to your everyday conversations this monitor is perfect for you 
2 0 They re just okay I purchased these monitors thinking I wouldn t need to use them at all since the baby s room is right next door I m glad I did buy them because my son ended up with acid reflux and spit up in his sleep constantly for awhile there so being able to hear him and go to him is a comfort Anyways there are only 2 channels on these monitors which is a bummer since I live in a big apartment complex I get interference of all kinds from telephone conversations to other people s babies crying which really weirded me out the first time I heard it I tried using a battery with it when I brought it with me to check the mail yes the door was locked no I am not a bad mother and was only able to hear static I wish I had bought a monitor with more channels Note to self keep reciepts and packaging from now on 
1 0 Cheaply made I bought this bundle me in Nov and it did not even last 2 5 months The zipper broke It is not well made Stick with the other bundle mes The urban bundle me is cheaply made Not worth the pric 
1 0 pretty much useless Very useless pants I bought them and tried them on my toddler twins and they did not work at all on a boy or girl and I did buy the correct size They even leaked when used over diapers at night They bascially do nothing 
2 0 bad zipper the middle back pocket broke within the first week we used the item and were unable to fix the problem 
2 0 Poor Quality 2 stars because the style is cool this was a christmas gift from my husband this year as our son is a big boy 19 1 2 lbs 4 months and it was too much to carry him his carrier and a heavy diaper bag everyday to daycare so this seemed like the perfect solution and it was until the bag started coming apart 7 days after I received it And I was careful I had read some of the other reviews about the stitches coming apart and I had thought they had just over filled the bag nope The bottle holder has ripped all the way down the side you can t overfill that there s just room for one bottle isn t that what it is made for My husband really loved this bag because it wasn t girly or babyish but put the on something that will hold a bottle 
2 0 disappointed I received this toy as a gift for my one year old daughter I thought it was a wonderful toy and so did my daughter After playing a while with it on the floor my daughter picked it up and started walking around the kitchen with it in her hands and fell down and the toy dropped on the floor At this point the toy started to malfunction The music would play sometimes and not others And after being dropped to the floor a couple more times it stopped working altogether I think a toy designed for young children should be more durable than this toy turned out to be Great toy but it didn t last long 
1 0 junk This carrier didn t survive one airline trip The bag was ripped and the wheels torn off upon our 1st trip This carrier is junk Waste of my money 
1 0 Horrible I used this bag once when traveling and then the zipper completely fell off because it was improperly made then I got a new bag customer service was very nice and helpful and it has a huge rip in the bottom after only traveling with it once and gate checking it my stroller wasn t damaged so I have concluded that it is horribly made and a waste of money still waiting on a refund 
2 0 bad design I agree with another reviewer whose information I read only after I d purchased the clean shopper It is impossible to keep track of an unattached strap I returned this product as soon as I saw the strap which you need to attach your child to the cart is separate from the cover This was not specified in the description Also it just bothered me that the printed material the cute jungle animals that are supposed to stimulate your child not you for heaven s sake are printed upside down to their eye Sorry but I have enough to look at when I m grocery shopping I am very disappointed that I still do not have a cart cover for my child The clean shopper was at least reasonably priced All of the other cart covers I ve seen which are large enough to cover the whole cart and are well designed start at 60 
2 0 Cannot find replacement filters I like this humidifier alot but now I cannot find replacement filters for it I only had it for about 3 months and now I cannot find replacement filters This unit was not cheap either it did cost money and now for it to basically be brand new and not to be able to find filters is really fustrating I would not recommend this humidifier for this reason only 
2 0 IT BLOWS Don t buy this humidifier It is MUCH too loud 
1 0 Wakes my baby up I was so excited when I recieved this humidifier at my baby shower But after several tries I finally returned it This product has a sensor so it turns on and off automatically Well the darn thing is so loud that each time it turns on my baby wakes up crying Note that I live 2 miles from an airforce base and the planes don t even wake her Don t buy this product 
1 0 Disappointed Brooklyn Mom Too loud and the water evaporates way too quickly I feel like I m constantly filling the container w water Though my son is a sound sleeper it is difficult to hear him through the baby monitor b c of the loudness of the humidificr I would not buy this item 
2 0 Cute But Did Not Get All I was looking forward to getting this toy for my son But when I opened it up I was disappointed to see that there were only three tools inside the bag I thought the picture showed several more tools Maybe my tool kit was not complete Either way my son never really showed much interest in it 
1 0 disappointed I have many of the fisher price items and have most of the rainforest products but found this disappointing Child showed very little interest in it and had no growth potential for her I will continue buying the rainforest collection hope to have better luck 
1 0 Don t waste your money I bought these bottles thinking that since my daughter likes her soothie pacifier then this would be a good transition bottle from breast to bottle WRONG She hated these bottles I would put the pacifier in her mouth and then try to get her to take the bottle and she would scream bloody murder I gave these bottles one star because I think it is a good concept but unfortunately didn t work for us The only bottle she would take was the Playtex bottles with the big nipples that she could grasp good with her mouth 
2 0 Mislead by reviews of this stroller I spent a lot of time researching strollers and after reading all of the reviews for the Aria I decided to register for one Out of the box it was fairly easy to assemble and lightweight but I have not been pleased with it since The shoulder straps on the 5 point harness are cheap and fall out of the back of the seat The snack cup has never stayed in place Steering this stroller is impossible we took it to Disney last month and I almost left it in Florida All in all I expected a lot more from Peg Perego 
1 0 TERRIBLE I just bought the knobs and they are terrible I have so much trouble opening them DO NOT BUY IT IT S A WASTE OF MONEY it s better to just remove all knobs off your stove and use one when you need it 
2 0 Not worth the cost With our knobs being on the front of the stove these covers hung down over the oven door and either got in the way or were popped off on a regular basis or pulled off by our 16 month old We found it easier to just remove the knobs and put them on the counter when the stovetop wasn t in use 
1 0 Oy vey our little mechanical genius defeated them in seconds I agree with the other one star reviewers here had I come to Amazon first I would not have wasted my money I got these because our two year old grandson was staying with us and being a curious kid who likes to push every button and turn every knob in sight he was soon trying to turn on the gas oven and stove So we got and installed these covers Within minutes he discovered them and became even MORE fascinated with the stove He immediately began spinning them around on the knobs and it took less than a minute for him to figure out that if you pull upward the cover and the knob come right off together Now he had a fascinating new rattle to carry around and probably lose my stove knob in the bargain Our solution We took the real knobs off the stove period We keep them in a high cupboard and only get one out when we need it to cook As for these clear covers they re are still in the closet maybe I can use them to display insect specimens or something Useful as knob locks they are NOT 
1 0 Terrible they are pulled off too easily My 15 month old son pulled these off and broke one within about 5 minutes of installing them Also he was able to turn the covers which ended up turning on the gas Bad design Don t waste your money 
2 0 Questionable investment I bought these after we moved because our new house had knobs on the front instead of on the counter surface THey fit my oven knobs very loosely so my son likes to make them spin around and around Also a few of my knobs pull off easily My son just grabs hold of the covers and off they come both knob and cover Then it s a neat toy with the knob rattling around inside the cover They do keep him from turning on the stove so they do what their suppose to I m just not sure if it s worth it It probably depends on your stove 
1 0 get the Isis instead This pump is REALLY slow and absolutely KILLS your hand For about the same price get the Avent Isis manual pump it is WAAAAAAY faster and because of the massaging petals you get way more milk per pump so it doesn t hurt your hand I haven t found that it hurts my hand at all because you use it for way less time and have to pump far less often 
2 0 not for breastfeeding mothers the high walls on the snuggle nest made it impossible to try to breast feed over and pulling the baby down to the open area as suggested defeats the purpose of having the walls in the first place I would fall asleep breastfeeding and wake up later only to realize my daughter was unprotected 
1 0 Makes co sleeping difficult There is no need for this item It is a huge inconvenience to have this big stiff box in the middle of your bed I hated having a wall between my baby and me When I woke up to nurse I had to take her out of it anyway Co sleeping is intuitive naturally safe and easy easy easy please don t spend your money on this unnecessary complication of a natural arrangement 
2 0 eh Not bad but not great either I used one of these with my son he s 3 so it wasn t that long ago but as I was getting ready to use it again with my daughter I started thinking about what a pain the Floppy Seat was to use Getting it back into it s bag was such a hassle I used to just plunk the thing back into the backseat of the car after shopping which made the convienent small space self storage a waste of time and money This thing is named well as it really is floppy floppy to put into the cart and floppy to try to put away again I started reading reviews of other seat covers trying to find a better option and I sure found it I was really hesitant at the price of the Buggy Bagg but I could tell when I took it out of the box that it was worth the extra money I ve only had the Buggy Bagg for 3 days and I am already thrilled that I spent the money on it definitely worth the extra 20 It is super well padded and can really truly be put into the cart with ONE HAND The Floppy Seat needs at least two hands to go well into the cart DON T waste your money on the Floppy Seat it s a flop of a product 
1 0 Floppy is right a flopping fumbling mess One reviewer though she raves about it admits its flaw it cant be put back into its carrying form Indeed it s a floppy illconceived mess It basically works but there is a much better option out there the BuggyBag This floppy is not an easy one hand install it doesnt TOTALLY protect the child as A one belt feeds through to hold baby and cart allowing unnecessary contact not ALL covers do that as one reviewer proposes and B because it doesnt install in one clean drop and doesnt fold into the carrying shape neatly you and baby are in contact with both floppy sides of this floppy mess as you try to flop it in and out of the cart and your car After trying the Floppy mess and a MISERABLE seat called the Shop n Dine I ve found the BuggyBag to be the perfect solution Truly a neat one hand install easy zip back into its carrying shape 2 belts one for baby one for cart neat and simply storage options Read my AMApedia article Dont take my word for it go to a big Baby store and try out both Just standing there you ll see that there s no comparison I m shocked that there are people who liked the Floppy but SURE they never tried the BuggyBag 
2 0 Great concept poor execution I think the Floppy Seat is a great idea aside from the cleanliness factor my son would be too small to just sit in the regular cart seat area this way I can pad him in and he s secure However I find it very difficult to manage I see that the previous reviewer said that she puts it in the cart with one hand I say kudos to her because I find it extraordinarily difficult to hold my almost 20 lb baby in one hand and put the floppy seat in the cart with the other The elastic keeps it on when it s on but it also makes it so that you have to physically stretch it over the sides of the cart I challenge you to do it with one hand Also I think that the act of strapping the baby in can be dangerous I am trying to hold him in the seat with one hand and feed the strap through the tiny hole in the back of the floppy seat with the other you have to really be aware of what your baby is doing because at that point s he is not strapped in and can easily fall out All of that being said once baby is properly installed it does make for a convenient trip down the grocery aisles 
2 0 Not what I expected The item is sloppy looking and feeling unlike the photo of the black Ellaroo I didn t feel that the baby was secure and she rode so low on my side that one could hardly call it a hip Maybe I just never got it adjusted correctly but I read the instructions and gave it many tries However on a positive note I was refunded my money with no problem There was a small restock fee which was disclosed up front So I have no problem with the seller 
1 0 Great manual Pump This is a great pump for a mom who only needs to pump once or twice a day Let down happens very quickly and I can get 3 oz in 15 to 20 min My baby is a month old and I use this pump so I can occasionally leave my baby with a sitter Geat pump at a great price 
2 0 Dissapointed I got this as a gift and registered for it for I was pregnant with my daughter This was the biggest mistake The canopy does not cover my daughter when she sits in it To make it recline is a chore My husband has the hardest time to unfold and fold it up not to make fun of him he only noce thing is the cup holder comes out to make it easy to take her out But even still it is not a good purchase and do not buy We did however buy the peg pergo piko full size stroller even though it is a littl but more money Well worth it I would suggest that and we also have a macleran light weight stroller and that is also very good 
1 0 HORRIBLE Product and WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE Don t buy peg perego their customer service is horrible I will NEVER buy from them again 
1 0 Not what I expected I purchased the Peg Perego Aria stroller last month for my 3rd son Needless to say I have lots of experience in the stroller world This was my first Peg Perego stroller purchase as I have used Graco and Maclaren in the past I had been using my Maclaren umbrella stroller which I purchased in 2000 when my first son was 6 months old and thought I would buy a new stroller since the other was a bit old My girlfriend recommended the Aria so I purchased it Anyways it was a huge disappointment The steering is AWFUL You definately need TWO hands for this stroller The stroller is also extrememly wobbly I was shocked as I figured such an upscale brand would be quality enough not to wobble so much The 5 point restraint is hard to stay in place as the back straps are attached into a little envelope type holder but it always comes out as there is no device to actually secure it in place It is bulky in that it doesn t fold into a small compact stroller I used this 3 times and just gave it away what a waste of I m back to using my Maclaren which looks thrashed but is a wonderful stroller I could kick myself for wasting the money My advice to you is TEST it out before you buy it don t rely on the name 
1 0 STEERING ugh I absolutely agree with this review You will NOT get your moneys worth February 26 2006 We bought this stroller per the recommendation of a friend of ours We have the sable color which I see is not sold this year but I digress We have been using this stroller for eight months with our eight month old and are absolutely fed up with it My biggest complaint is the steering The front wheels slide sideways over any smooth surface and if we re not on a smooth surface it feels like I am pushing the stroller into a brick wall because they don t rotate to allow me to push the stroller forwards I am always backing up and turning in order to get the front wheels to align so I can get where I want to go Shopping is a joke with this stroller because I cannot get it to navigate the aisles easily The shoulder straps are attached to the back of the stroller with a little plastic tab which really doesn t seem like the best way to keep a child s shoulders restrained It ends up coming out from the tab holder and my son is virtually only wearing a lap belt This is fine now that he is able to handle a 3 point instead of a 5 point harness but when he was younger this got on my nerves The adult cup holder is a joke so we took it off and my son figured out how to take the kid s cupholder out so it doesn t stay in any longer as well Oh and the thing folding down so that the handlebar catches the sunshade complaint is spot on SO FRUSTRATING Not a big deal really but poor design because the sunshade prevents the handlebar from locking the folded up stroller in the folded up position most of the time I just remembered also that the sides of the padding in the seat area when I used this stroller with our Graco Snugride car seat would bunch up and prevent the car seat from sitting securely I would have to prop the edges of the padding in the seat area underneath the arm rests of the seat area the parts that say Aria before I put the car seat into the stroller seat area so that it would sit deep enough to latch onto the cup area and allow the security strap to go over the carseat snugly If Peg Perego could fix the steering I think I would be able to live with the rest of my complaints but the steering factor is enough for me to trash the whole 9 pound thing now that I found another stroller that steers so much easier with my 22 pound 8 month old son 
1 0 Do NOT buy Combi Wipe Warmer After reading the reviews this sounded like an easy choice I was VERY wrong When I first plugged it in I could not believe how quickly the wipes heated I thought it was great I did think they were way too hot after they were in a while but a quick shake after I pulled one out cooled it down enough to make it safe Then a few days later I was pulling them out and the inner lid popped open and kept popping open with every change THEN when I lifed the unit to put new wipes in my 700 changing table dresser was flooded and warped I had it replaced I had not known it because the pad and a basket were on the table too Same problems kept happening So I called Combi Customer Service told me the Instruction Manual states that the wipes are to be left in the packaging She said that the excess moisture which caused the flooding would be held by the packaging Of course I could not measure the amount of fluid but I am not exaggerating when I say CUPS Even if it did hold the CUPS of water so when the plastic pacaking is empty and no longer has wipes it is filled with excess cups of moisture and then you have to remove that to dispose of it And although it is stated a there should be a warning to NEVER use wipes not in a package and b WHY I bought a large bag of Huggies wipes there is no package to pop in Second she told me that the unit is not supposed to stay plugged in all the time and that this too is in the Manual So I lookeed at that too Not in the Usage part but on the back under Cautions it states this Unplug power cord when not in use Okay when you have a newborn when are you NOT using your wipes LOL She said it should be plugged in and unplugged several times a day to keep them warm I guess a new mom is supposed to schedule that AND if that was an acceptable property of the product shouldn t there be a switch I would have to move the dresser every time or get an extention cord of course Crazy Combi gave me what I consider ridiculous answers They also need to get real when they write the Manual For the record I have written a review one other time to rave about my Little Bissell This frustrated me so much I HAD to share the info Also this is baby 4 so I am quite familiar with baby products 
1 0 Horrible It worked great for a few days then as I got to the bottom of the batch of wipes they were totally dry Also the whole thing flooded my changing table not sure why but I am returning this unit 
2 0 No Second Chance My husband and I purchased this set with my first son but are going to choose another bottle manufacturer for our second son The difficultly we experienced was securing the nipple ring onto the base it had to be in perfect alignment or there were definately leaks sometimes more than that It is quite frustrating when you are conducting late night feedings or traveling I hope a new second chose will brings easier bottle feedings 
2 0 Leaky Leaky Leaky I used these through out my daughter s infancy largely because I bought a whole set of them the milk storage contraptions the breast pump and the pacifiers Plus once she was used to the pacifiers and nipples she wouldn t take any other kind But the bottles routinely leaked ruining several diaper bags clothing and nighttime feedings Apparently you have to screw the cap on just right which is really difficult at 3 AM My daughter didn t seem to have the gas and colic that other reviews talk about but we did use quite a bit of gas medicine between 3 and 6 months All in All I think the paci s are great the rest of it I could do without 
2 0 Convenient but unreasonable The ideas for the bottles interchanging is great But unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas When they re using the bottle you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips Every time my little girl uses them it seems as though she just can t get comfortable with them I would recommend Dr Brown s or Playtex VentAire bottles over any of these Ultimately the convenience and features aren t worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause 
1 0 Baby swallows too much air I started my newborn out using the Avent bottles After a few weeks she began crying alot You could hear the gas moving in her tummy and every time her tummy would grumble she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain She would also pass gas constantly It was so difficult to feed her because she would cough spit and cry the whole time Then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards I tried switching formulas didn t work Tried mylicon Zantac gripe water bicycling her legs etc etc etc nothing worked The pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do that she would outgrow it Finally we decided to switch bottles I switched to Playtex nursers Instantly we noticed a difference She was extremely quiet during feedings didn t squirm or cry She began ingesting almost TWICE as much formula per feeding probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the Avent bottles and would go longer between feeds And when she swallowed it sounded different you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air Something about those Avent bottles made her swallow tons of air I think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate With the Playtex nursers the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats eliminating any air bubbles She is a completely different baby now She is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying So if you decide to buy these bottles BEWARE If you are already using them and your baby has colic switch immediately Don t just assume that colic is normal or will be outgrown Babies don t deserve to suffer this way 
1 0 Leaky Bottles I bought the Avent bottles when I was pregnant because they were babiesrus s Best Pick Yeah right I wonder how many are returned on a daily basis Aparently this company spends all their time and money on advertising and not enough on preventing their bottles from leaking I would not recomend these bottles unless you like waisting your money 
2 0 Good Idea Poor Design The idea for this product is great The problem is with its design and or choice of materials regarding the buckles The buckles are plastic and as such they bend and flex This caused one of the buckles to regularly separate when any weight was applied to the strap as the outer teeth were not rigid enough to stay in place They instead tended to bend towards the center of the male end of the buckle causing it to slip out of the female end of the buckle which then caused the car seat to fall off the luggage If another material had been used for the buckles or another type of buckle or fastener was used this product would have been perfect 
1 0 Poor Quality I bought this set for my daughter The bedding is such a poor quality that my daughter won t sleep in her bed She says the sheets are itchy The comforter is so hard it is like a big piece of cardboard I WOULD NOT RECOMEND this set to anyone 
1 0 DO NOT BUY FROM BABY AGE Do not buy this or any item from Baby Age Their customer service is horrible Amazon should remove all of their listings 
1 0 Very Disappointed I placed this order on July 25th Amazon s estimated delivery date is Aug 18th 25th I contacted BabyAge and my order wont be sent until the 6th of Sept Very disappointed 
1 0 Nice idea but doesn t work This sounded like a great item However it has proven to be useless First it won t stop a child from opening the door Second when the door is opened the guard falls out When the door is opened the guard is supposed to block the door from being shut thus the child can t pinch their fingers However the catch which goes behind the door is too small enabling it to fall through 
2 0 Remote doesn t work I bought this product for my 3 month old for Christmas and when I went to play with it the remote didn t work I did everything it said to do and it still didn t work So I took it back and just exchanged it for another thinking it was just faulty When I took it out the remote to it also didn t work It says it has to be on Play not Try me or Off and it has to do it s short musical fanfare after you push the button on the front and then you can use the remote but nope You should be able to control the volume the song options and be able to switch from colors to music but no It just plain doesn t work I really want it to work because it would be great in the car but sadly I will have to take it back but this time I ll get my money back I do not suggest buying this product 
2 0 Worked for only a short period of time Our 4 month old loved this toy at first But we have had to replace the batteries so frequently that in the end it didn t work more than it did Runs through batteries much too quickly Also unable to start it from the remote control so we had to reach over the carseat and push the button to begin But now it is in the trash because I touched the straps holding it up and they disintegrated into blue dust Not very safe Very disappointed 
1 0 Broke almost immediately I was really hopeful about this diaper bag when I ordered it through Amazon The size is small and convenient but I found it awkward when placing it around my arm and neck Also the clasp broke after I had it for only 2 weeks I am really disappointed and would recommend looking elsewhere for a diaper bag 
1 0 Poor quality The third time I wore it as I tried to zip the bottom most compartment with one hand other arm is carrying my 14 month old the plastic piece on the main strap simply broke and pieces just flew off and now it is completely unusable I do not recommend this product because of its poor construction 
2 0 Sounded great I bought this hoping it would help me organise all my baby diapering needs Unless you have a changing station or crib wherever you want to hang it that has slits or slots able to hold it the velcro will NOT hold it well And the shelves are a bit insecure It s a great idea but just didn t pan out 
1 0 Great Idea in Theory I saw this at the store and I just had to buy it I loved all the little pockets for storing different things it would keep all my baby changing gear and other necessities all in one place The picture on the cover shows it stocked full and hanging on the side of a dresser which can be used as a changing table What a marvelous concept So I took it out of the package attached it to the dresser and put all of my gear onto it It looked very smart hanging there and so practical When I came in the room the next day it was on the floor in a crumpled lump So a little disheartened but not wanting to give up I hooked it up to my crib instead It was the next best thing and I really did like the device I put all of my gear on there once more the wipes on the top shelf just like the picture but the top shelf is so flimsy that the wipes topple off of it So not only can I not hook it up to my changing table I also can t keep all of the changing gear on it This essentially makes this ill made product completely worthless for the purpose it was designed 
1 0 An unstable safety hazard Zero stars I purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my Delta Luv changing table because there was no storage space on top I had high hopes for it Munchkin products are usually high in quality However the cloth on this organizer sags When I tried to fill it with my wipes box baby powder and lotion as shown in the picture the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out I wouldn t want a toddler getting near this organizer A much safer option is the plastic Diaper Depot by Prince Lionheart 
1 0 Terrible product Even though it comes with instructions it is way too complicated to use I was hoping to use it around the house but you need to know some acrobatics and balancing skills to get the baby securely in this thing Not to mention it shrunk 2 feet after I washed it following the instructions mind you Now I have to tighten it in the back versus the front It s now destined for the donation pile The Baby Bjorn is easier to use 
1 0 Flimsy Weak Damaged I bought the volo after reading many reviews However it was utter disappointment As soon as I took out the stroller from a box and the carrying strap was off with broken piece of plastic holding piece Yes the stroller is light and very very flimsy I returned it right away 
2 0 we can t decide whether we like it or we ve been had We purchased this stroller for its convenience in the car and for frequent travel I think it s safe to say that we have an ambivalent relationship with the Volo not including my 12 month old daughter who would give it a definite thumbs down On the up side it is very light and folds easily and is compact Not to mention that everyone gets to see you have a Maclaren stroller in a wonderful shade of orange The stroller is great for the airport and quick shopping trips when you are in and out of the car We first purchased the volo without springing for the seat pad This was a mistake as our daughter was clearly uncomfortable and was unwilling to spend significant time in the stroller The seat pad did increase her comfort level but she still grows tired of the volo much more quickly than her larger stroller I think this has to do with the fact that she is not very upright in the volo and cannot shift much in the seat as it offers no support On top of it the velcro on the seat pad becomes unhinged each time you fold the stroller a minor annoyance but a hassle all the same The awning offers very little sun protection The mesh cargo area holds very little and is difficult to access On top of that you need to empty it completely in order to fold the stroller When it comes to travel the volo leaves much to be desired With limited cargo room it becomes quite unstable if you hang anything on the handles It has no recline making it difficult for children to sleep well a problem when you want to spend the day wandering Further while it is great to have such a lightweight stroller when getting it in and out of the car riding escalators and getting on and off the bus the Volo flounders once you get off well paved surfaces We encountered potholes dirt paths cobblestones and sand in our tavels and the Volo was a disaster The wheels would spin erratically and catch in large divets and gutters Locking the front wheels so they would not swivel provided little relief Cobblestones were particularly disastrous as the stroller was so hard to manage and such an uncomfortable ride that we ended up carrying both the child and the volo If I had to do it over I would opt for a compact stroller that weighs a bit more but offers larger wheels easy access storage and a supported reclining seat 
1 0 dumb dumb dumb This is the most stupid product you can buy It makes opening doors even easier Maybe instead of selling this as a door knob lock it may be sold to be useful with people with arthritis This doesn t even deserve one star 
1 0 Two Toddler Mummy We just purchased these after our 3 year old worked out how to open the covers by Safety 1st and Parents This cover lasted about one minute Seriously By the time my husband was placing the third cover in our hallway of doors my son had opened the first one my husband had installed The tapered end makes this cover the easiest of all for little hands to open 
1 0 Broken after Two Days I installed this mirror in our car two days ago Today it was in my daughter s lap when I went to get her out of the car The mirror broke off from the base I bought it because it seemed safer than the other types of mirrors suction cup attachment etc I would not recommend this product 
1 0 Poor product Bought this mirror at target along with many other Eddie Bauer baby products available there This mirror is hard to install and everytime you hit a bump it falls down rendering it useless It is just very poorly made from cheap materials I am very disappointed with the Eddie Bauer line at Target Almost every Eddie Bauer product I bought ended up breaking in a week or I just returned due to such poor design Target needs to stop selling these items they are a waste of money 
2 0 good concept poor design we bought this mirror because of the swivel feature which worked a little too good the mirror kinda sticks out so that every time i got in the back seat to get baby out i d hit it and knock it out of place so i had to readjust it all over again sometimes when we d hit bumps it would fall and become worthless finally my little girl s arms got long enough that she could reach it and it ended up breaking 
1 0 Easy to use but not reliable We received this thermometer as a baby shower gift For a few months it worked very well easy to use After about 8 months it started acting strange giving us inaccurate readings The final straw was when the thermometer read 104 8 degrees sending us to the ER at midnight only to find out our son s temperature wasn t even over 100 The thermometer ended up in the trash can on our way out of the hospital 
1 0 Don t bother drapes are wrong color and pattern When I purchased these drapes I assumed that they would match the tan plaid material used in the Zanzibar valences sheets etc Wrong The material is striped and is a darker different shade of brown than the rest of the set I love the other items in this set but don t waste your money on these drapes they look awful 
1 0 Please read this before buying I bought this buggy board because I was told it was better than my previous wood buggy board wheel kept unscrewing however I have two strollers I like to use so I had to pay 30 extra dollars to get a second set of connectors to attach it to my second board Today I called customer service because one strap broke I was told it is normal if you live in a cold climate in my case Manhattan for the rubber to snap and break luckily my daughter was not on it at the time I was told not to use it in cold weather I only use it on the weekends anyway so it s not out a lot and it snapped in less than three months Please save yourself money and grief and get another board 
2 0 disappointed I really was disappointed with this product Our tub has rounded corners and tile above and the cubby wont stick to tile 
2 0 Bath Cubby Did not stick to tile Sucktions were big but it just sit in the corner 
2 0 One side won t stick to my walls Decent size cubby to hold toys in the bath but one side doesn t seem to want to stick to the walls 
2 0 What good are suction cups that don t SUCK So I recieved this as a gift at my babyshower even though I didn t register for it and finally pulled it out to use it the other day now that my son is older and we re moved into the larger tub only to find out that it doesn t stick to the wall At first I thought maybe it was my older son bumping it whenever he was taking a shower but oh no that s not it at all Then I thought maybe it was that I had something too heavy inside when really all I had were some rubber rings and I think maybe one tube of crayola draw on the walls crayon But yet again the darn thing came un stuck So basically the moral of this story is whenever you recieve something that you didn t register for investigate whether or not it s not a piece of garbage before you open up the box and get past the point of no return Literally 
1 0 useless I can t get it to stick I might be able to get one or two of the cups to hold but as soon as I put toys in it it falls 
1 0 won t stick to the walls The whole purpose is to store toys up off the floor of the tub but that is impossible since it won t stick to tile above the tub I hadn t even put any toys in it and it wouldn t stick I returned it and found something on One Step Ahead 
1 0 Do I have to give it a star Terrible Terrible Terrible The first one broke within 5 uses the second one lasted about 15 uses There have got to be better ones out there 
1 0 Suction cups don t work but the animals are nice The suction cups were bent and just did not stick to the high chair or anything else for that matter My 6 month old daughter just likes to play with the animals they crinkle and delight her 
1 0 Good Idea Bad Design The suctions are pretty weak dont stick well to the tray Also had a hard time keeping the arch standing up The arch kept bending forward and falling in my sons face When I was able to get the suctions to finally stick as soon as my son would touch it it would bend right above the suction part and it would end up in his face They should have added some kids of reinforcemnt so that it could stand upright all the time I took this back the next day I bought the Sassy Fascination Station instead It has a giant suction at the bottom and serves its purpose even I had a hard time pulling it off the tray 
2 0 doesn t work This is a cute idea but the suction cups are misshapen and don t stick to my son s highchair at all Very disappointing 
1 0 where is the refund For some reason the product was not delivered UPS returned it This was send for charity After many emails and phone calls the company refuses to respond or refund the money SHipping was more than the product 
1 0 Nothing but a headache I read other reviews that said it was headache but I went ahead and purchased this item because it s less expense than anything I else I saw I should have listened I ordered it in Feb it is now May and we still don t have the dresser together There were pieces missing and a major piece broken When you try to call the line is busy I had to hang up and redial what felt like forever They said my piece would come in 3 weeks it was more like 7 weeks The piece that was broken had the drawer rails on it but when it came it had no rails So I said I wanted to return the entire thing they were fine with it but it can take up to 8 weeks to get your money back So at this point in time we are going to go to the hardware store to buy what we need so that I can have a dresser in my son s room 
1 0 BUYER BEWARE This item is packaged horribly If you are lucky enough to get intact a great product for a great price Received changing hutch and tower crib and toybox intact Very happy Ordered this dresser twice both times damaged Good luck trying to put back in crummy box to return and good luck trying to get damaged parts replaced unless you can wait 6 8 plus weeks My suggestion is to order two dressers take the best pieces from each and return the rest Believe me you will be glad you did 
2 0 Came in broken still waiting for new parts I have a feeling that this item is simply not packaged correctly The two main parts left side board and right side board both came in totally cracked When I called in to order replacements the customer service rep knew exactly what I m calling to re order If it s a known problem why not fix it The customer service reps are very nice but the fact that the spare parts take forever to ship really doesn t make this product very attractive The processing itself takes 2 3 weeks In my case 3 weeks later I found out that my 2 parts are on back order awaiting shipment by container from Brazil So it will be at least 2 more weeks until they arrive and 1 more week until I receive it I hope the dresser arrives before the baby 
1 0 DO NOT ORDER STORKCRAFT PRODUCTS I have had nothing but problems with this company I was missing bolts for an item I contacted the company but it took me a month to get back to me They then told me that I need to pay 10 dollars because the parts were not under warranty Took care of that but still waiting on bolts Order the piece in December it is now April and still not able to assemble 
1 0 Poor quality many chips and cracks Do not order this item I ordered and returned this item FOUR times due to cracked pieces Storkcraft either has very poor quality control or an inability to provide adequate packing to avoid shipping damage I refuse to reorder a fifth time so now my nursery will have to have mismatched furniture What a disaster and diappointment 
1 0 Total Crap This brand is just awful It s made of cheap flimsy particle board It dents and dings very easily Most inportantly the runners are too narrow for the wheels so the drawers fall out Not only is it horribly made but it s dangerous DO NOT BUY 
1 0 Very Poor This item is packaged very poorly You have to literally rip the box apart to open it I did this TWICE and both times the very last item was completely cracked in half Very inconveniently shipped and packaged 
2 0 not pleased i own these bottles they seemed nice but there is a design flaw with the nipples there are two pin sized holes on each nipple over time filth and germs built up in these holes they are imposible to clean i didnt notice until one day i started seeing filth floating in the bottle im thowing mine out 
1 0 Gassy baby I have used these bottles fot two weeks with my newborn and I am not impressed My daughter was very difficult to burp and was vomiting frequently because of trapped gas I experimented with the Dr Brown bottle and the Playtex Vent Air Both seemed to help but the Playtex is by far the best People complain about the extra pieces but it is worth it to have a baby who is comfortable 
1 0 Dangerous I used to love these bottles until the nipple collapsed twice while feeding my 4 month old daughter causing almost the entire bottle to spill in her mouth and nose The first time it happened I thought I didn t screw the top on but then it happened again After doing some research this is a common problem with these bottles 
1 0 TOO LEAKY As a nursing mother I researched many different brands of bottles to find the easiest one for my little one to make the transition I read from so many sources that Soothie would make the transition the easiest for babies I bought a starter kit and several other bottles I was greatly dissapointed to learn that out of all the bottle that I purchased only one did not leak I tried repositioning the nipple and I tried to tighten the lid Nothing helped My son was soaked everytime we tried to use them I switched to another brand and now we are very dry 
1 0 Useless Doesn t stay in place too expensive I do better with a waterproof diaper changing pad I cut slits in it for the buckle and straps to go through and it works TONS better Save your money on this one 
2 0 Great Music Poor Potty Training I bought this for my grand daughter and here is my daughter s reviews of how this product is working or not Hmmmmm she LOVES the music more than the potty itself We listen and dance to the potty song everyday but there has been little progress with the actual potty I think the way to go for her may be the attachable seat that goes on top of the real toliet Otherwise she carries the potty around from room to room and treats it like a seat I think getting something that looks more like a real toliet would have worked better Or perhaps she was going thru a phase that is not over yet so maybe she will get into it again after a few weeks Thanks anyway I don t find this very encouraging so I wish I had purchased something else 
1 0 Misleading information I bought this item because the FAQ on the breathable baby website said that the bumper would fit any style crib including ones with solid headboards However once I received the bumper I realized it clearly does not work with cribs with a solid headboard Upon writing customer service at breathable baby for advice on how it would fit I was told the following The Breathable Bumper will wrap if your crib has a space on either side of the corner posts If it does wrap around the outside of the posts If the Breathable Bumper won t fit your crib you should try the CribShield which has four separate pieces so you can eliminate the foot and head board pieces and just use the long rail sides Look online and see that the crib must have straight railings and not too thick so the padded rail cover can fit and attach over it When I responded that this information was basically too little too late and that it disagreed with what they said in their FAQ s I was then told The other option moms have been doing is buying 2 Breathable Bumpers and using the short pieces on front and back rails This way they have the padding In the future we will be selling them as a package that way but for now you can still have the safety and comfort you desire I think it s really poor customer service to mislead the customer into buying an item and then tell them in order to make it work they need to purchase a different item or more of the same Customer Service at Breathable Baby has since removed the misleading FAQ however I now am inconvenience with returning the item I am truly disappointed and wish they could be more upfront on their website about the abilities of the product 
1 0 Be careful of width of cabinets These don t fit my cabinets because the width between knobs is too large I m not sure how but if possible verify the width on your cabinets against what these offer 
2 0 Beautiful but broken I ordered this three times and each time the same piece was broken The first two times I ordered it through walmart com because it s cheaper but they wouldn t replace the part The third time I ordered it through babyage com and was able to replace the part but I m still waiting on it This is a beautiful armoire and matches my nursery set but it s a major pain I originally ordered it in July and to re order and send it back three times has taken 5 months My son is now 3 months old without an armoire or any kind of dresser 
2 0 Not Satisfied I was very excited to receive the Armoire this past weekend However after opening the package we found a crack on one of the pieces I called Strokcraft directly to see what the alternatives were for this type of issue The only way to compensate for the issue was replacement of the part The rep indicated that the delivery of the new part can take anywhere from 3 4 weeks With the baby coming in within a week or so who has the time to wait The product is what you pay for 
1 0 Not worth ordering I was very disappointed in the product The picture does not accurately represent the armoire The entire back is just cardboard paneling and the inside of the armoire is white plywood not cherry wood at all The pictures should show the inside view of the cabinet in addition to the outside Also pieces did come chipped cracked and one piece was also split into two I returned the item and wish I hadn t ordered in the first place 
1 0 useless potty way too small This potty is completely useless It is so small that my three years olds knees are up by his shoulders when he sits on it It is unstable on those little plastic legs and it s opening is too small for their little bottoms and it hurts them to sit on it This potty only stands about four inches off the ground so unless your toddler is the size of a six month old this thing is useless 
2 0 Nice idea but too small I was so excited to find a portable potty b c we like to travel and my son is finally potty training Well I opened it for the first time about 4 months ago and what a disappointment My son is 2 and absolutely could not stand sitting on this the first time It s too small and pinches I tried to maneuvere his bottom so that it would be more comfortable no positioning worked if your child has a tiny bottom then go for it otherwise skip this one 
2 0 How can I expect her to sit on this I took this on a short trip it proved useless It s unstable has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby s bottom I can t understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this especially a potty training child My daughter was fairly young when we tried it we did some early PT and she was about 10 months old She s now 2 fully pt but will still not go near it If it was so flimpsy for a 10 months old how would it do under the weight of an older child Beyond me I still give it 2 stars because it s an otherwise neat idea Impractical execution though 
1 0 Shoddy product frustrating as heck Never buy this This piece took forever to assemble arriving in no fewer than 30 pieces The directions are vague everything in the diagrams is a rectangle But the actual parts aren t labeled so you never know which of the 7 types of rectangular parts they mean When finished all of the front slats between the drawers fell out anytime we moved it they have no bolts to hold them in the just sit in shallow slots The drawers are shaky and the whole unit is unstable Also as many of the holes are not lined up so I couldn t even put in some of the bolts 
1 0 zipper problems This was a good product for a few weeks and kept my babe warm BUT the zipper does not work well and it broke already I tried to repair it but after that broke the quilting came apart and was too much trouble to fix I would not recommend this JJ Cole product as I had the same problem with another one we inherited 
2 0 It Leaks I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes I wouldn t even say getting this as a pump for when you re on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing which it says you can do They don t sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part It cost nearly 30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it The entire system just isn t durable or made for much use Also cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible 
1 0 Dont waste your money I thought these would be great specially for the but I was soo WRONG I ve only washed them once to have everything clean b f baby gets here and they are covered in fuzz balls The fleese is covered in lil balls and strings of balls way to many to even remove by hand And on top of that on some of the edges the layers just came apart at the seam It looks like a 20yr old fallen apart hand me down after one wash DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY 
2 0 Works for a little while This lock works good for a little while then the push mechanism breaks It may or may not break completely off so it could still work even when it breaks I ve gone through two of these already and they only lasted a few months before they broke 
1 0 Doesn t work with my lazy susan I have about an inch and a half of space between my lazy susan and the adjacent bank of drawers If I install this lock the base of it will block one of the drawers from opening It also means that I would have to drill into the formica trim on the cabinet I m returning it 
1 0 Returned it before wasting my time Once we took this net out of the box I knew it wouldn t work Our balcony railing was not only longer but shorter in height than the net so we had to wrap it around the top railing The quot strings quot used to secure the net did not look strong enough to me and the whole set up looked ridiculous I am searching for an alternative 
2 0 Its cute but I ve had better high chairs that were less expensive After 5 boys my first daughter just HAD to have a pink highchair for her Princess 1st Birthday Party so I retired the boys trusty BLUE Graco still in great shape after 4 years into the basment and ordered this Pink one After what we paid for it I don t know how to tell my husband I want the blue one back Maybe I can fnd a pink cover My daughter is 12 months old 20 pounds and cannot reach the tray without dropping food into her lap There is a 3inch gap between her the tray so half her food she tries to feed herself drops into her lap The thick padded seat is adorable comfy for her but it has such deep crevices you really have to dig deep to get every crumb cleaned up The base is very large her food falls down onto it after every meal so I am not only cleaning the floor but the base as well The buckles are awkward impossible to do with one hand If you have a petite baby this is not the highchair for you 
1 0 I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HIGH CHAIR I really don t like this high chair at all My little girl is 10 months old and 19 lbs and she CANNOT sit in this chair without me putting a pillow or towel under her so that she can reach When sitting on the regular seat she is so low that she cannot get her arms above the tray to feed herself This is a huge pain because I have to constantly take out the pillow or towel that she must sit on top of out to clean A 10 month old should be able to comfortably sit in a high chair I have had her in friends high chairs that are a Graco and she fits perfectly If I could do it over I would have opted for a less expensive model that she fits in properly Don t buy this product 
1 0 USELESS Don t waste your money on this high chair By the time your infant can safely sit in it they will have almost outgrown it You re just paying for the name brand not the quality Stick w a Graco instead 
2 0 Poor Design of a fun idea Our baby boy loves jumping and swinging but this product is not well designed and I m an industrial designer Dad so I should know It can hit the door frame easily the seat is way too deep even though our baby is above average height He s banged his mouth a few times into the hard plastic portion when he swings in or jumps in it He has fun in it at first but it always seem a disappointment in the end Save your time and money and get the Baby Einstein Excersaucer THAT is agreat toy and better for development skills 
1 0 WARNING one model deemed unsafe by CR Serious Warning Consumer Reports the independent consumer magazine called a specific model of this walker model 14565 unacceptable because it s unsafe See their Dec 8 2006 blog on their website Anohter similar model 14570 is okay Model 14565 is deemed unsafe by CR because it does not prevent the walker and the baby from falling downstairs as it should CR points out that the 14565 is still in the retail channel Unfortunately it s impossible to tell which model Amazon is selling Your best bet is another brand or check one out in a retail store Be sure to avoid model 14565 
1 0 useless This thermometer is totally worthless It doesn t read the correct temp on myself husband or baby When my little one was sick at 3 months old this thing read 96 7 degrees on all three of us I picked up a digital under the tongue type and simply used it under his arm Works great cost me 3 I can t GIVE this one away 
2 0 Can t get it right Maybe it s just me but I can never seem to get it to angle just right to take an accurate temperature 
1 0 No Probe Cover Refills I have looked EVERYWHERE and there are no probe covers to be found ANYWHERE Who would sell a 30 thermometer that can only be used 20 times This is insane If anyone finds them please let me know where I have checked BabysRUs USA Baby Wal Mart Target Walgreens Snyder s Drugstores every grocery store every discount store every drugstore I have been to in two states over the last 3 months This is crazy I recommend not getting it 
2 0 probe covers I have only found ONE place to buy probe covers for this thing so I bought a lot They aren t the same manufacturer but they are the exact type of probe covers Hope this helps others looking for covers for this If the first years doesn t sell probe covers for this anymore they shouldn t let companies sell the thermometer either http www shoplet com office db g2512530 htm 
1 0 Probe covers unavailable Product Discontinued Not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over Internet it seems that First Years has discontinued the product At least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website We searched for model 4290 the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer Apparently they don t see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued Furthermore the site is full of broken image links The thermometer works well but without probe covers it s not a good investment You can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers If the store you re buying the thermometer at doesn t have covers there find another product with covers available 
1 0 Too good to be true I purchased this item after hearing comments that a unit that heats from top down works better I was highly disappointed with this unit as it does not heat the entire wipe wipes must always be filled to the top and the wipe cools down too quickly Unfortunately I don t have the original box therefore cannot return the item I am now going to purchase a warmer that is sold from One Step Ahead that also heats wipes from top down but is not something that attaches to a wipe box Through friends I have heard this other unit works great and have been reassured that I won t be disappointed Hopefully BabiesRUs will sell this other item in the future 
1 0 Great idea falls short The idea of a nice warm wipe is great but the product falls short in perfomance The warmer is designed for a non popup type of wipe box If you use pop up wipes just the part sticking out of the box gets warm and the rest is cold If you use the other type of wipe box it works ok as long as you always keep the wipe box full which isn t always realistic for a moms and dads I am returning mine to the store 
1 0 Not very good at all Only the top 1 4 of the wipes are warm if you don t refill the container continously wipes get cold Plus you might consider the ease of use with a pop up warmer 
1 0 Not good at all I purchased this wipe warmer because I didn t want a warmer that heats all the wipes Those cause the bottom wipes to dry out and thus be useless The top down warmer is supposed to heat only the top few wipes Well this warmer only heated the top section of the top wipe that sticks out of the top of the box It didn t even heat the whole wipe I am returning the warmer It is a complete waste of money 
1 0 Be VERY careful with this sleeper First I agree with other reviewers who say that this helps their baby s sleep better That I cannot deny Our two+ week old little girl seems to love it and seems to sleep for longer stretches on it without waking However the trade off in better sleep is NOT worth the risk I woke up last night to find that she had slipped down and her face was right between the bolsters She could have easily suffocated This is a very common complaint with this product both here on Amazon s web site as well as on Target s web site where there are many parents who have reporting having the same scary moment that I had Some reviews seem say that if you have a real squirmy older baby that that is the true problem with this product I have to tell you that that is not quite the case Our little two week old is tightly swaddled at night and doesn t move a whole lot yet she slipped down to a position where she could have suffocated The bolsters were very tight to her sides and so that doesn t explain things either If you choose to purchase this product please be very careful with it I understand that those of you who have infant with reflux don t really have a choice about this but I recommend that you try it first in the daytime with your infant closely supervised so you can see if they are likely to slip down As for us we may try to keep using it by elevating the bottom a little with a blanket underneath but we are absolutely getting rid of the bolsters 
1 0 Not secure at all My daughter is only two months old and she slides off this thing all the time I even tried to put a towell to make it less steep but it didn t work Worst yet her head would slide off the edge I guess it will work for baby who is small and less than one month old and does not move around 
2 0 makes me nervous I like the concept of an elevated design They should make the sides breathable I have had my son sleeping on this since he came home This has been 6 weeks so far He twitches and moves his legs and arms and such Typical baby stuff He ends up slidding down in between the wedges I tried putting a rolled up towell at his feet to keep him up You would be surprised how tight he pulls his legs in He slides no matter what When I put the towell to high his head slid off the edge Good Idea needs work 
2 0 Not so great This product has been a disappointment The pillow portion is good in theory only The baby s head tends to fall off the edge more times than not So the baby is on the sleeper and the head is hanging off the top edge to the left or the right Wouldn t recommend good concept bad design 
1 0 Defective Unit My wife purchased this toy box at our local Toys R Us It went together fine but ours must have been factory defective because the entire thing smelled like WET PAINT In fact we had to return the unit because the fumes were making our daughters cry whenever they went into their room Little Tykes makes this unit but they were of no help when I called customer satisfaction They told me just to return it and that they ve never heard of this problem 
2 0 Amerciana Wood Toy Box with Bin The toy box is nice but im not happy with the product The directions were difficult to understand and I didn t like the top being made of cloth material My little boy already made a tear on it I had to remove it I was afraid my little boy would tear it 
1 0 Review HI I bought this seat thinking it would be great with the arm extension I was so wrong If your tub isnt made just right then it will not work and the seat itself is not secure There are no suction cups to hold the seat in place either I ended up breaking the arm lever off just so the seat would set level in the tub But I have since purchased the aquababy seat ring and love it It has the suction cups on the bottom and a release lever also toys on the front so baby can play So if you are searching for a bath seat I dont recommend the safety 1st at all 
2 0 needs an update Unless you have an older inexpensive bathtub this won t work The side pad won t open wide enough to fit on a thicker rim and the seat won t go deep enough Too bad It looked great 
1 0 Returning this item We bought this tubside seat just today and tried it out for the first time with our baby who is 5 5 months old and just sitting up on his own Initially it looked great seemed very sturdy and we thought he would love being able to sit and play with his toys However getting him in and out we noticed that the plastic edges around where his legs go is actually very sharp and as our baby is on the tall end of the spectrum it was impossible to get him in and out of the seat without scraping up his little legs and knees It s not as if he is going to get any shorter so I don t think there is any solution to the problem I think Safety 1st could have done a better job of making the plastic in that area more comfortable or even put some padding at that location I m surprised more reviewers didn t have this problem For our baby who normally loves bathtime it was a painful and frightening experience We will be returning the item Since you can t leave your baby unattended in water anyway we might as well just get a non slip mat and hold him until he gains more balance I recommend you save your money on this one 
1 0 What a disappointment My mother inlaw bought this dresser for us as a gift for her first grandson As most parents can imagine knowing your going to be a first time mom can be a very very exciting feeling When we recieved our dresser we did not open it right away Once we decided to get the nursery together and my husband opened the box to our surprise the right side panel was completely split in half We called stork craft and reordered the part The representative advised us that the part will take 2 weeks before it can be shipped to us My husband and I wait a little more than 2 weeks and still no right side panel I then called again and the same representative stated that it will take another 2 3 weeks before the package can be shipped That same day I called Amazon and before the week was over we had a brand new dresser delivered to our house Til this very day we are still waiting for the right side panel My suggestion Please read every review before purchasing any items rom fSTORK CRAFT There furniture and customer service is not reliable OUR BABIES DESERVE BETTER DON T YOU THINK 
2 0 Not worth it I ordered this online and got the pieces in the mail 3 pieces were damaged so we called the manufacturer for replacements They said it would take 2 to 3 weeks Its been 3 weeks when I called again they said it would take another 2 weeks How hard is it to get replacements My baby is due anytime now and the changing table is still in pieces Would like to get the nursery done preferrably before my child goes to college We purposely ordered it early to give us time but apparently that wasnt enough I tell you its very frustrating and so not worth it 
1 0 DO NOT ORDER ANY STORKCRAFT ITEMS I have had nothing but problems with this company I was missing bolts for an item I contacted the company but it took me a month to get back to me They then told me that I need to pay 10 dollars because the parts were not under warranty Took care of that but still waiting on bolts Order the piece in December it is now April and still not able to assemble 
2 0 DAMAGED THERE WAS A CRACK DOWN THE SIDE WHERE IT WAS PUT TOGETHER AND NICKS IN THE WOOD WE DIDN T HAVE TIME TO SEND IT BACK AND THEY ONLY OFFERED US 20 OO FOR A DISCOUNT VERY DISSASTISFIED WILL NEVER ORDER FORM HERE AGAI 
1 0 Cheap Well they say that you get what you pay for That would be true if you can find this on sale for 50 of less If you are used to particle board furniture this will suit you fine If you have higher standards spend more and avoid this Some of the pieces cracked as screws went into the pre drilled holes in the particle board Several pieces arrived damaged We had to request 3 replacement parts from the manufacturer and are still not happy with it but now it is assembled and impossible to ship back so we are stuck with it If you do buy this and get it assembled try not to move it around too much as it may fall apart Also the drawers are very shallow Don t expect to store much in this It did arrive promptly but the shipper and Target would have done me a favor if they had lost it instead of delivering it 
1 0 Motor lasted 3 months I could go into a long explanation of how I searched and did tons of research before buying an occasional use pump for myself who is a stay at home mom I could explain in detail about everything I did to try and get this pump to work in the meantime before figuring out the motor was not working of how I was freaking out my supply was dwindling so I went out to buy fenugreek But suffice it to say the motor lasted me 3 months of once twice a week useage It didn t completely die which is why it took me a while to figure it out but after paying attention I could see the vaccum losing more and more power until when I couldn t even get a quarter ounce from one side and I was nearly engorged At least Medela is shipping me out a new motor this one I hope will at least last longer Especially since my warranty runs out in 2 months 6 month total warranty which to me is too little for a product that costs over 100 Even though I m staying at home and only use the pump occasionally I wish I d just spent the extra 150 and gotten a Pump in Style 
1 0 The motor broke and now its useless I used this pump less than 10 times with my first child and just got it out to use with my second since I m engorged and found out the motor is broken I m very disappointed since I trusted the Medela name If I could afford it I d replace it with the Pump in Style but unfortunately I ll have to try a manual pump 
2 0 Bad experience I bought this pump the day I was discharged from the hospital 12 11 05 I have used it on a part time basis since I am staying home and nurse directly However the motor broke and couldn t pump anymore My baby is only 5 months and this pump already broke I have only used it during nights to keep a storage for my baby I was lucky to call Medela on time since this pump is still under its 6 month warranty period so I could get my money back 
1 0 Lasted 1 day or less This is not a good product unless you re willing to screw one of the parts into your door which we were not since it was a newly installed hi quality door and the way the door was designed was not conducive to doing so As a result the double backed tape which was required for the use of this product quickly came off You can t really expect a piece of plastic which is held to a wooden door with just two sided tape to withstead the pressures of a person large or small trying to open the door It just isn t going to hold up It s a nice try but in the end was a waste of my money 
1 0 didn t work for us I ordered two of these cots for twin 4 year old grandsons to use when staying at my home I expected the cots to be fairly sturdy perhaps along the line of a porta crib Instead the frame doesn t lock in place and looks like it would bend fairly easily The twins tried them out after being cautioned not to jump on them the cots didn t look like they would holdup with a little boy rolling around on them I returned the cots to Target 
1 0 Not comfortable I did not like this hammock It cuts across your neck and I do not feel like my son is securely in there I always have to have at least one hand holding him The front carriers are the way to go since they leave your hands free to do things 
1 0 Very Painful Great idea but not comfortable for me I thought I would love this but just returned it It hurt my neck so badly after only wearing it a short time 10 minutes Maybe I m too small 5 2 or my baby 5 months and 18 pounds is too large Either way I still find the Bjorn much more comfortable I would like something where the baby is more sideways on my hip like this than either facing me or facing out and so confined as he is in the Bjorn but I couldn t stand wearing Very painful 
2 0 Why is cheaper at Walmart How annoying to pay 25 more here than at Walmart Same price at Babies R Us Is it really the same exact thing Very frustrating 
1 0 Hard to clean I found all of the Avent cups really hard to clean I couldn t get the stopper out of the top of the cup The Playtex cups are WAY easier to use 
1 0 Buyer Beware Loved the car seat until my Daughter was able to reach down and lift the velcro strap and release the harness portion of the straps I would hope that the manufacturer would address this and move the harness tightening straps under the seat That is my only complaint and it has indeed been a great car seat 
1 0 UNSAFE Loved our Marathon until our 18 month old reached down and pushed the release lever and leaned forward loosening the straps and started trying to climb out of the seat Since this happened he s figured out how to climb out with the harness still locked into place just by loosening the harness Although a highly rated seat I would think that this would be addressed by a company so proud of their high price tag product I have seen several other same experiences on this site today and am appalled that nothing has been done to correct this Not very happy 
1 0 Worthless threw it away I tried to put this oven lock on my oven Unless you have lots of space between your cabinet and your oven unit you will have trouble even getting this thing to stick I finally fenagled it into place sticking the first piece to the side of the oven then applied the part that goes across the front and latched it in place Upon opening the oven door with very very very little force I just barely cracked the door open the latch teeth snapped open as if the latch wasn t even there Tried several times even sort of holding the teeth and no luck In the trash it went I also tried another lock also from Safety first that seems like it would work great it has a heavy duty hinge but the half of the lock with the adhesive surface too short so that there is not enough length on the adhesive edge to adequately anchor it to your oven and still have the hinge lock in place and the hinge locks in place at less than a 90 degree angle So this left the latch anchored with only about 1 4 of the adhesive strip on the oven Pop off it came when I tried to open the door In the trash it went as well I m very concerned about oven safety for my little guy and completely disappointed in the options out there for ovens 
2 0 Another so so product from Safety First The kneeling stool is great The padding is sufficient and I love that it flips over to convert to a stool Very useful BUT the elbow pad is a joke There is a hard plastic honey comb underneath it and hard plastic surrounding it that force you to put your elbows into two tiny areas or risk severe pain from the plastic Not to mention that to two measley suction cups that are suppose to hold it onto the side of the tub do not work at all It constantly pops off the tub whenever I put any weight on it I don t regret my purchase because of the stool which works really great I suggest that if you still want this product after reading the reviews you try to find it used so that you don t have to pay retail 
2 0 Very Uncomfortable Not only does this kneeler fall off of the tub whenever it wants it is not high enough and very combersome to use Its cheaper and more comfortable to fold a big fluffy towel next to the tub HOWEVER the step stool will be great when my son gets bigger 
1 0 Cannot be cleaned thoroughly I inherited this product from my neightbor last week I have attempted to wash and clean it thoroughly before using it I cannot get the seat apart and it is incredibly dirty and moldy inbetween the seat and the swivel part Other reviewers have noted similar experiences but their seats broke when they tried to take it apart I would love to try this product but as long as it is dirty and cannot be cleaned properly it will not be used What a shame baby products should be made so that they clean up easily 
2 0 Doesn t Fit Every Tub I had to return this item because it was too short for the side of my tub I would have to kneel on the knee pad to make it stretch and then sometimes the elbow pad would pop off I ended up trying it by just removing the stretch fabric and elbow pad but then it became just an expensive knee stool The knee stool portion of this product was the only useful part to me and that is why I give it 2 stars rather than 1 I returned it because you can get just the kneel stool from other companies for half the price 
2 0 Safety Issue I recently purchased this product to ease my bach aches when bathing my 3 year old son It definetly relieved some of that uncomfortableness however the problem I encountered with this product is the top portion elbow pad adhering to the side of the tub It does not always suction properly and often times would fall off the edge of the tub The other day my son tried putting it back and suctioning it to the side of the tub There was a little moisture on the edge of the tub the top slipped and he slammed his mouth onto the top of the tub He sustained a severly cut lip and jammed his top front teeth There was blood everywhere His teeth are loose now but should be okay His lip is healing up but he was in pain for quite a while I would like other parents to be aware of this potential accident in hopes that their child will not be injured 
1 0 Diferent as offered The colors are very diferent they supposed to be blue yellow and white and I recived in a pale yellow The material is not very good I don t recomend this product 
1 0 the display image is wrong for this item The image showing for this spoon set is not correct The image is for Bendable Spoon which used to feed the baby before 12 month old and the description for the image is for baby after 12 month old When you place the order they send you the set of spoon and fork with metal end for feeding the toddler not the plastic one for feeding the infant 
2 0 Good for the first ten minutes I bought this bag in hopes that it will make traveling with a one year old slightly easier This bag was ok to start and fit my britax a feat in itself BUT 10 minutes into carrying it into the airport it BROKE I would not buy it I emailed the company and have yet to hear back 
1 0 Gate with Missing Parts Recieved the gate with parts missing When I notified Amazon they indicated repair replacement parts were not available and I would have to return and reorder the product As my wife needed it this was not possible This is not a reflection of Amazon but on hte manufacturer 
2 0 Trainer ring doesn t fit every seat Even though I think this is a very good idea no mess to clean up like there is on a roaming stand alone potty the ring doesn t fit our toilet seats well We have the oblong seats not the round ones and the ring slides back and forth especially when my 2 yr old daughter tries to get up on it It doesn t make her feel very stable so so far at least she has refused to use it 
2 0 Disappointed I ordered two of these training rings one for when my daughter is at home and one for when she is at her grandparents during the week One arrived in perfect condition the other was disappointingly split at the seams So I returned it and had another one shipped back to replace it I received it yesterday and was upset to find that it too was also split at the seams So I am returning it once again and asking for a refund since I feel I will be better just going to the store to buy one that I can inspect before hand To be honest the one that arrived in tact works just fine I guess it is just the luck of the draw depending on if you receive one that is in good condition or defective Good luck if you decide to order this 
1 0 Not so comfortable This toilet seat made it very discouraging for my son to start potty training since the splash gaurd left him with a rash on his inner thighs and lower tummy The splash guard does not have a smooth finish and when it rubs against his skin it can be quite painful I plan on trying the baby bjorn seat it looks like it would be more comfortabl 
2 0 Not a stable potty seat I was so excited to buy my son a potty seat He is two and has been using it since he was about 22 months He picked out the pooh and loved it and I love the splash guard Unfortunately the seat tips when he leans over to pick up a book from a bucket on the floor He is not leaning over to the floor the books are about 1 and a half feet from the floor This seat is quite tipsy 
1 0 Not a good option I was very disppointed in this product I found it great that the containers would easily stack in the freezer but this was the only good quality I had to throw out all of my containers because they leaked and the plastic was obviously leaching You could smell the plastic in the milk I m not going to expose my baby to extra chemicals especially when her liver isn t developed enough to fully detoxify them I really wanted to love this product but leaching plastic that leaks is not an acceptable option 
1 0 PLEASE don t waste your money on these 1 they leak 2 too expensive 3 they don t supply enough lids so you have to buy more containers 4 doesn t work well for feedin 
1 0 Lost Breastmilk I have used these containers and the milk escaped by the time I reached home 
2 0 not a fan I bought the Isis pump that came with these containers and also purchased a 10 pack of them at the same time After using the ones that came with the pump a few times i didn t like them They are good in the fridge but once you freeze them they tend to leak when thawing I returned the unopened 10 pack and bought some of the 4oz bottles with storage caps instead They were a little more expensive but well worth it I love those and highly reccomend them They also sell just the sealing disc if you already have plenty of bottles 
1 0 pain to use store and expensive I wish I had put storage bags on my registry instead They work okay as a multipurpose container but my freezer is full of these things Moreover I got the 8 oz ones so they are only 1 2 full as my newborn only drinks 3 4 oz right now One of the major pains about these is that you have to buy the lids and the containers seperately Plus you need an adapter to fit the pump something I didnt know I needed and didn t get Another waste of money from Avent 
2 0 Not worth the money I have used the Avent Isis pump for all three of my children and thought this product would be just as good and liked the fact that it works with the pump I was wrong Problems encountered include it is very difficult to screw the caps on tight they tend to leak expensive instructions recommend only using about 4 times and then discarding measurements are hard to read they do not hold a full 8 ozs due to the shape narrow on the bottom and wide on the top they tend to tip over easily and the adaptor for the pump is incovenient as I forgot to pack it more than once Save your money use bags or pump into the bottles directly if you are not freezing 
2 0 I like bags too They are messy when they opened I get milk on my hands and they cost way too much I don t have much room in my freezer when you buy the refills you have to purchase the tops and the containers seperate it s like 17 for ten 
2 0 I prefer storage bags I didn t like these for a few reasons They take up too much room in my freezer They take too long to thaw I don t care for the avent isis pump I have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and I can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker 
2 0 poor quality Great idea but a few more pennies could have been added to construction It would be a better idea to put the money toward a changing table really 
1 0 NOT for summer baby I am returning my Roxy safe seat It was like eye candy when i saw it online but then it shipped to my door The material is not breathable and my baby is dripping with persperation when i take him anywhere in the seat At a grocery store the seat JUST fits into the whole cart and I have no room for groceries Its not worth the hastle I admit it looks very nice but its like lugging around a herd of cattle its so heavy The seat belt itself is dangerously close to the babys neck and leaves red marks on his neck almost immediately after buckling him into place Sorry GRACO the idea was good but the carseat is awfull 
1 0 Cheap Material Too Big Bad Instructions Graco might be making a killing with this product as they charge over 100 for something that appears to be made with less than 20 worth of materials The seat is MUCH too big to fit in a regular compact car such as a 2006 Nissan Sentra unless you decide to install in a center seat location which has the advantage of being safer but much more inconvenient The documentation in my opinion is very poor and I ve installed Linux systems from scratch w less documentation Bad documentation could lead to unnecessary infant injuries and deaths if people don t completely understand the instructions Let s not talk about the styling wasn t black red and gray popular in the 80 s or did I miss the come back somewhere I hope I can find something better I m giving this product TWO stars because it will do the job but I expect much more from a product 
2 0 Not for use with bassinet Do not purchase this product if you plan to use your play yard with the bassinet The tent snaps on in the same spot and you can not use both 
1 0 waiting Well we ordered this for a trip and it s delayed even though it says it s in stock We got a vauge email that says delayed but no promise of delivery don t order it from Amazon if you re exhausted chasing an escaping baby Go to a local store and purchase it waiting waiting waiting 
2 0 Not so magical This mirror really isn t worth the money You d be better off just buying a plain mirror for baby to look in and for you to look at baby that s about all this thing does The remote control has to be pointed directly at the mirror kinda hard to do driving down the road Also the music isn t very loud atleast not loud enough to get baby s attention when upset which is what I was hoping for And the lights aren t very bright Really can t see that they even light up unless it s very dark out Also the positioner works fairly well when baby is facing backwards but once you turn baby around and have to attach the mirror to the back of the front seat it doesn t stay in place that well You could spend alot less money for just a plain baby in sight mirror 
2 0 Not impressed I was very disappointed in this mirror I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I do use the mirror I have a 2000 VW Passat with a headrest in the middle seat so I had no problem installing it It s great to watch my little one while I drive I do see the other reviewer s point about it being a safety issue because you kind of get obsessed with watching your baby and you should keep your eyes on the road However it never obstructed my view at all I registered for this because of the remote control feature Well the remote control only turns the unit on and off and you have to keep the switch on the unit on remote control access mode in order for it to work There s a switch on the unit to play music OR turn the lights on and play music You cannot control that feature from the remote control You also cannot control the volume from the remote It s really a pain I m keeping it because I like the mirror but I m not happy with it Save your money and buy the SafeFit Baby In Sight mirror 
1 0 NOT RECOMMENDED BY CHP I went to the CHP office to get my car seat checked and the officer said that auto mirrors are not approved and considered a major safety hazard during an automobile crash because they can become a projectile possibly injuring or killing your child DO NOT BUY 
1 0 May limit visability With the rear facing infant seat in the recommended middle seat of our sedan this mirror limits driver visability When the mirror is positioned so the driver can see the baby in the rearview mirror a large section of the back windshield is blocked I m glad we kept the box so we can exchange it for a different mirror 
2 0 Good in theory I bought this thinking it would be great but have been VERY disappointed The suction cups don t stick very well especially on wood even if you wet them first My daughter is able pull it right off the table and dump the mess on the floor 
1 0 Not worth the money I don t even know where to begin Eeyore has a creepy voice that scared both of my kids 1 1 2 and 6 months old Instead of getting my daughter to crawl with him she would cover her face and cry He would go off all by himself which was really creepy in the middle of the night And he broke after a couple of months Now his voice is distorted and we are going to yard sale him to get him out of the house He s defantly not worth the mone 
1 0 Do not buy this item It is very difficult to attach it to anything The straps are to short and under strange angel My son did not play with it 
4 0 Love it My daughter loves this activity center I wish they would change two things about it I wish we could change out the toys and it folded up 
5 0 Great entertainer and travels well too I got this when my daughter was 4 months old She would sit in it for about 5 minutes then want to get out But now that she is 6 1 2 months she loves this and stays in it for about 30+ minutes and just entertains herself She has great coordination now and she loves to smack and grab the toys and she coos at the little sun and loves to pull on everything and put it in her mouth When we go to family functions or just to someone s house we always grab the entertainer It is very easy to break down and put right back together if it doesn t fit in the car This by far is the best toy that she enjoys and LEARNS from She is quite tall for her age 27 1 4 inches and we still have 2 more height adjustments on this This is the best we have spent so far 
4 0 Great product I purchased this toy for my son when he was 4 months old At first he seemed a little intimidated by the toys and would cry when I put him in it Once he got used to it he really enjoyed it Now he plays with all the toys and he likes that it wobbles around His favorite toy seems to be the sun and the counting beads I did not experience the problem with the feet that others wrote about Just lucky I guess The seat is really hard to remove for washing which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 
5 0 Really fun for baby peace of mind for mommy My son loved this I purchased this item because I was not comfortable with the idea of hanging something from a door frame I was nervous that the one that hangs from a door might somehow come down I felt that my baby was very safe in this and I could put it anywhere in the house that I was Once he was walking he didn t use it again 
5 0 Best Buy We finally broke down and spent the money on the Jumperoo and were happy we did We have to limit the time our son spends in it because he d jump for hours on end if we didn t limit him to 5 10 minutes a day The Jumperoo has sturdy construction and the 4 settings are useful I was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because I was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it but he s been fine He doesn t play with the toy attachment I think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame 
5 0 Fun for Baby but Loud for Mommy I and more importantly my twin boys really like this jumper It seems safer than the doorway jumper mainly because their fingers won t get mushed I like that it has multiple height settings and that it s on a sturdy frame They love to jump in it and before they were able to crawl it was one of the few ways for them to get out some of that excess energy and get some exercise Plus it s a nice safe place for times when I d like to get something done without having to keep a constant eye on one of the babies The cons that wouldn t keep me from buying it again are it takes up more room than a doorway jumper the rattly bear is pretty loud and the music is obnoxious There is an on off switch and two volume settings for the music though 
5 0 A Great Gift Set I received this Gerber gift set for my baby shower The products lather up really well and they smell great They are gentle and they don t make my daughter get a rash You get a lot of product for the price too My daughter really relaxes with the Lavender scent wash and lotion and we used the Menthol wash when she had a cold Now that my daughter is teething she drools a lot which causes chapped skin on her cheeks and chin The moisturizing stick works great for this We love this gift set and would recommend it 
5 0 Great shower gift If you need a shower gift this is it I got one and I love it the Gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing Mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it I keep all of the out grown small bottles in the container and it works great The lotion is good smelling but you can t beat Johnsons and johnstons pink stuff also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom to be 
5 0 Great Monitor for the price I picked this monitor after reading many reviews The reviews didn t lie This monitor does great on distance I have a 2400 sq ft home that has 3 floors The bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor I can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound I could hear him grunt even I don t know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss You re given many channels in order to find the right strength I could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal he was on opposite end of house upstairs I also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times not getting it soaked Also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound no radio or tv or mobile playing Great product strongly recommend My son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great This monitor is the right choice for the average household Interference may come if you re on the same channel I have wifi network cordless digital phones and nextels and do not have any interference with this monitor so others just don t know how to resolve thier issue before blaming the product 
5 0 working just fine This is the first baby monitor we ve tried and we are quite happy with it We did a good bit of research ahead of time and chose this one because of its features and the reliability I like that the receiver unit can plug into the wall I don t really like to use the voice activated mode but my husband does and says it works great When in the normal mode I can hear little birds outside my baby s window and cars passing our house it s quite sensitive I also like the lights on the receiver you can turn the volume all the way down if you re watching a movie or something 
5 0 A Must Have In terms of pre natal resources this is the best I have found The positive results are proven I can not think of a reason not to buy this product Every expectant parent wants the most and best for their unborn child This system is wonderful for interacting with your child before he or she is born You will even notice a response from your baby It s very exciting 
5 0 Great item great price I purchased this item not from Amazon and my child loved it The puppet provides hours of entertainment and the music is great not the usual kid drivel that usually is part of any kid item Some HBB s come with contemporary music and I will be picking up one of those soon Highly recommended 
5 0 Best buy convenient durable I bought this 2 years ago when I had my first daughter I used it in her stroller on cool days and could quickly install it on the jogger when going for a run at the beach where it s usually windy and cooler during the fall It s very easy to switch from to any stroller less than 1 minute When we visited relatives in Canada at Xmas I installed the bundleMe on the infant car seat and it kept her warm during our trek from the airport to the parking spot In San Diego one fall day when she went down a slide at the park that was still wet she ended up wearing only a diaper but the BundleMe kept her warm as we walked back home Never had to worry about losing a blanket on the road or having enough blankets to keep baby warm or whether her feet were sticking out of the blankets lost a shoe sock etc I am now using the same bundle me with my second child I d recommend it to anyone who spends lots of time outdoor taking walks etc 
5 0 EXCELLENT WHAT A GREAT PRODUCT IT REALLY KEEPS THE BABY WARM EVEN IN THE COLDEST WINTER WHEN THE WIND IS WHIPPING THE GENEROUS FRONT FLAP FLIPS UP OVER THE CARRYING ARM OF THE BABY SEAT AND ALSO KEEPS THE BABY WARM NO FUSSY COATS AND HUNDREDS OF BLANKETS I HOPE TO USE IT NEXT WINTER ALSO 
5 0 excellent very colorful playpen I got this as a gift on my baby shower was so happy to receive it This playpen is so wonderful very colorful sooo easy to set it up I m pretty sure our unborn child will be thrilled about it I received great reviews on this gear also so don t be dissapointed to grab one like it awesome playpen 
5 0 Wonderful Colorful Product I received this pack n play for a shower present this weekend and it is absolutely adorable set up It is very colorful and the the toys are cute It was very easy to set up I am not good at putting things together and it took me about 5 minutes total The matress comes out so you can put it on the floor with the toys overhead It is very multi functional 
5 0 Excellent info on skin rashes A recent reviewer noted that she had trouble finding information on skin rashes in this book I had to post a review responding to her review because this book has tons of information on skin and scalp conditions in the table on pages 404 412 which talks about everything from impetigo to eczema The information on teething is a bit more meager I agree that this is something that the author needs to expand upon in the next edition of this book But I still think this is an outstanding baby book It provides tons of information and is reassuring and contains just the right amount of humor to keep you reading at a time in your life when it s hard to find the time or energy to read 
4 0 great customer service The strap on mine broke and I was very quickly sent a replacement I expressed my concerns about the size of the belt I have a small frame and it is big on me and I was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it s done Very friendly amazing customer service that s hard to find these days 
5 0 A Wonderful Investment This has to be the best investment you can make towards your child before they are born and the results will effect them for their whole life It felt like a big commitment for me to have to run the program 2 times a day and near the end of my pregnancy I was annoyed with having anything strapped across my belly but I am so glad I pushed through My daughter is AMAZING I am in awe at her sweet spirit and her advancement Baby Plus did everything it promised and more Here are some examples At birth eyes wide open hands open instant excellent nurser slept 4 6 hours at night very calm and happy cried only when hungry At 1 month smiling all the time at everyone sleeping 8 10 hrs at night recognized mom and dad s faces At 2 months laughing holding head up At 3 months pressing buttons on toys for 6mos + rolling both directions holding own bottle At 4 months sitting with support At 5 months sitting without support drinking from sippy cup singing saying first words At 6 months puts self to sleep pulled self to standing position creeping and now almost crawling I am completely amazed at her advancements People mistake her for being 3 6 months older than she is and they say she is the happiest baby they have ever known I am totally sold on Baby Plus 
5 0 Much improved over the earlier version I purchased the earlier version of this product two years ago I was disappointed that I wasn t able to use it for my second pregnancy most likely because it had been dropped too many times This new version comes with a cloth pouch that makes it MUCH MORE user friendly Also one set of batteries 4 AA lasted for 4 1 2 weeks The batteries in my old one would last 5 days IF I was lucky My daughter just turned two in January 06 and is extremely smart verbally advanced and a joy to be around By 16 months she knew all of her colors and could recite the ABC s By 18 months she could recognize all of the letters I believe we are well on our way to having a reading child by the age of 3 Do I credit the Baby Plus Who really knows but we decided not to chance it and are using it again for baby 2 
5 0 Great service from BabyPlus A friend of mine introduced me to the BabyPlus system I am just now beginning my third trimester and have been using the BabyPlus since week 20 I enjoy the 2 hours a day I use the system I feel like I am doing a good thing for my little boy on the way While using BabyPlus the battery cover clips snapped off I emailed customer service and they happily offered to replace the cover no questions asked BabyPlus is a company that seems more concerned with a positive experience for the baby rather than making sure I had all the required paperwork for replacement parts 
5 0 Mary Jane S RN mother of Faith and 23 weeks pregnant I am using the babyplus system for the second time and am looking forward to the same benefits as it produced with my 5 year old Faith was born alert calm and hardly cried at all as an infant She slept through the night right away with only waking to eat She is now in her last year of preschool and she enjoys to write sing and listen to music and loves arts and crafts Her teachers tell us how she is constantly helping other students in class with writing letters and words when they have had trouble Her disposition has always been happy and eager to learn She has great coordination with activities and sports I am a nurse and I tell all my patients and friends about the BabyPlus system I am pregnant with my second child and there was no question at all that I would use the BabyPlus system again Do not be afraid to try something new Just read the studies and reviews they speak for themselves You will not be sorry that you purchased this product for your unborn child 
5 0 7 week old loves it I bought this swing because our first baby had colic reflux and I heard someone else say that the side to side swinging action really calmed their babies colic I thought this baby might be too so we bought this swing No colic this time but she already loves to watch the birds and butterflies turn around the top She follows them around with her eyes Very stimulating for the young ones 
4 0 Great swing but motor may wear out I love this swing my fussy first child could not live without it I had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud I called Fisher Price and they said that the motor will wear out with use So now mine sounds like a metronome it clicks back and forth If I had to do it all over again I would still buy this swing b c of the design I just wish that FP would build a motor that was more durable and better yet that plugs into the wall 
5 0 It s Useful Our 21 month old daughter has been using this tub since birth and we love it It does hold water and she can splash around and play with her toys The sunctions are great since they do stick pretty good to the tub Easy to clean and easy to put away when my husband or I need to use our regular tub 
5 0 willow baskey I purchases this basket for a friend I was very pleased with its usefullness style It arrived in two days of ordering 
4 0 Simple Baby Organizer I am a Mother of 6 and this works You can put a few baby neccessities in it I use it for a few diapers baby wipes desitin and the bulb syringe I can move it around and it does not take much space 
5 0 Nice I orignally bought this to hold all of my babies bath things It got too heavy everything wouldn t fit So now I use it to hold his baby tylenol etc It is really nice 
5 0 Perfect for the changing table I purchased this to put on the changing table I was looking for something that would fit on top of the table next to the changing mat and would hold diapers wipes lotions etc I purchased and returned two other baskets for various reasons then I found this one It fits perfectly and holds the wipes container several diapers lotion hair brush etc I love that it has separate pockets to hold small items so that they dont fall over This allows everything to be within easy reach while changing the baby The price was also reasonable I was looking at buying one from Pottery Barn for twice the amount This basket is a great buy 
5 0 Love it We originally registered for this item because we have a 2 level house and thought this would help us from trudging up and down the stairs so much But since my 2 month old still lives in our room in her bassinet that part has not yet been an issue However we keep this basket in our living room fully stocked and we don t even have to get up off the couch to change a diaper Sounds lazy but if you already have kids you understand The sides of the liner have pockets which we use to hold hand sanitizer diaper rash cream a thermometer baby brush aspirator baby nail clippers lotion a couple rattles toys and some chapstick and nursing pads for me We put the diapers a changing pad and a wipe holder in the main center part I also have two wrist rattles attached to either side of the handle and my baby loves to look at them while she s getting her diaper changed I put the basket next to her head so she can see one of them The basket itself is well made and I have no fears of it falling apart any time soon In fact we plan to put it to other use once baby is out of diapers We have not yet had to wash the liner but it appears to be well made and I have no fears of it falling apart although I am going to throw it in a laundry bag and use the delicate cycle 
5 0 Like this tub best When my third child was born we got this tub It has been the best yet for us From infant stage to now 6 months old my daughter has fit snugly As an infant the sling is perfect because you can t immerse the baby while the stump is still attached We used the tub on the counter by the bathroom sink which worked very well while she was in the hammock stage Once her stump fell off and she was able to control her head well we lowered the bottom half of the hammock into the tub and let baby s bottom rest in the nook that is created between the hump and the top part of the tub A perfect angle for baby to rest comfortably while getting a bath This is the position in which we currently use our tub Now however we bathe her in the Aquarium tub instide the bathtub so we don t have to worry about where the water lands Finally once baby is old enough to sit without support we ll remove the sling altogether and let her sit in the wide end of the tub to play during bath time No doubt our daughter will enjoy this final transition in the short weeks ahead 
4 0 Aquarium Healthy Care High Chair Great product Son enjoys being in the chair He especially likes the toys that attach to the side of the tray Only thing I don t like is it is difficult to clean in the creases of the seat cushion 
4 0 Fun My mother in law bought these for my daughter At first I was skeptical about how entertaining they would be but my daughter took to them right away In the beginning she would just chew on them and smile at the quacking duck noise but now she interacts more and seems to love feeling all the different textures She also loves to knock them down when I stack them up They won t entertain her for hours but she s always thrilled to see them when I break them out for the first time that day 
5 0 GREAT for infants Our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old My husband enjoyed them more at first but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these He probably couldn t hold on to them well until he was 5 months old so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier At 10 months he still enjoys playing with them They have lasted through both children I would highly recommend these blocks for infants and so far even into the toddler age he enjoys playing with them 
5 0 Great for little ones My 6 month old got these for Christmas They were among the first toys she expressed any interest in She loved the frog that vibrated when you pull the leg but it broke I emailed Baby Einstein and asked if I could buy a replacement for the green block because it is her all time favorite They are sending a free replacement We love Baby Einstein and our daughter loves these blocks 
5 0 great toy My son loves these blocks We ve also purchased the number blocks to go along with this set He loves saying the colors numbers and stacking them 
5 0 LOVE THIS TOY My daughter loves this toy All the activites keep her entertained and it gives us a break too 
4 0 Love it My daughter loves this activity center I wish they would change two things about it I wish we could change out the toys and it folded up 
5 0 Great entertainer and travels well too I got this when my daughter was 4 months old She would sit in it for about 5 minutes then want to get out But now that she is 6 1 2 months she loves this and stays in it for about 30+ minutes and just entertains herself She has great coordination now and she loves to smack and grab the toys and she coos at the little sun and loves to pull on everything and put it in her mouth When we go to family functions or just to someone s house we always grab the entertainer It is very easy to break down and put right back together if it doesn t fit in the car This by far is the best toy that she enjoys and LEARNS from She is quite tall for her age 27 1 4 inches and we still have 2 more height adjustments on this This is the best we have spent so far 
5 0 Top notch toy We waited until our daughter was to get her this and it s fantastic She s now and it s in storage but she was using it until she was about I like that the height is adjustable the springs are covered and the seat comes out easily to wash it It was a poop eroo for us too A few things that I learned using this though is The blue spinning toy doesn t come out and yucky stuff can collect underneath it It is incredibly hard to clean The one that I got was a pain in the tush to get the batteries in so once the batteries died we set the kangaroo part aside My daughter s feet got rubbed raw when we first got this because she loved jumping in it I recommend using a pair of Robeez or at very least a pair of socks to protect their feet 
5 0 Really fun for baby peace of mind for mommy My son loved this I purchased this item because I was not comfortable with the idea of hanging something from a door frame I was nervous that the one that hangs from a door might somehow come down I felt that my baby was very safe in this and I could put it anywhere in the house that I was Once he was walking he didn t use it again 
5 0 Best Buy We finally broke down and spent the money on the Jumperoo and were happy we did We have to limit the time our son spends in it because he d jump for hours on end if we didn t limit him to 5 10 minutes a day The Jumperoo has sturdy construction and the 4 settings are useful I was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because I was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it but he s been fine He doesn t play with the toy attachment I think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame 
5 0 Great shower gift If you need a shower gift this is it I got one and I love it the Gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing Mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it I keep all of the out grown small bottles in the container and it works great The lotion is good smelling but you can t beat Johnsons and johnstons pink stuff also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom to be 
5 0 So glad we got this I registered for this kit and got two at first I considered taking one back but I am glad I didn t It is great to have way more of these necessities to start off with that s months of not having to remember to buy any I love the bucket thing this comes in one currently holds all our bath stuff for easy toting to the bathroom The other one is our bib holder since we have a TON of bibs It keeps them neat all in one place and closes and can be put away for guests The vapor bath is fantastic We just got over my son s first cold and it worked like a charm He loves baths to begin with and this filled the whole bathroom with that soothing vapor and within minutes I could hear the difference in his breathing When I caught the cold a few days later I have to admit I also took a vapor bath and it was better than a hot shower for clearing my congestion I don t know that the Lavendar one necessarily calms or soothes the baby but it smells nice We ve gotten shampoo in his eye at least once with no tears or fuss so it must not burn I definitely recommend getting this for new moms to be 
5 0 THE BEST SOUND QUALITY BETTER THAN DIGITAL THIS MONITOR HAS THE BEST SOUND QUALITY YOU CAN PUT THE RADIO ON THE MONITOR AND LISTEN ON THE RECEVER IT WILL SOUND LIKE THE RADIO IS NEXT TO YOU I HAD THE MONITOR FOR 2 YEAR WITH OUT PROBLEMS WITH RANGE OR INTERFERANCE MY MONITOR IS BEEN ON AND IN THE SAME CHANNEL ALL THAT TIME I TRY THREE OTHER MONITORS ONE OF THEM DIGITAL THE SONY SOUND QUALITY IS UNTOUCHABLE VERY SENSITIVE I CAN HEAR MY BABY MOVE AT NIGHT I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH RANGE I WORK OUT ON THE BASEMENT DURING HER NAP IT HAS THE BEST VOLUME I CAN HEAR HER OVER A LOUD TREADMILL AND MUSIC I WAS HAPPY TO RETURN THE OTHER MONITORS TO GET THIS ONE THE ONE PROBLEN I FOUND IS THE MONITOR AND THE RECEVER CAN NOT BE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE A HORRIBLE LOUD NOISE TO AVOID THIS I TURN OFF THE MONITOR BEFORE GETTING CLOSE TO THE ROOM THE BABY IS SLEEPING IN THE WATER RESISTANT FEATURE IS GREAT I CAN PUT THE RECEVER RIGHT IN THE SHOWER AND LISTEN OR WATCH THE LIGHTS IT IS NOT WATERPROOF YOU DON T WANT TO GET IT WET BUT THE HUMIDITY OR A LITTLE SPLASHING WON T HURT IT 
5 0 Great Monitor for the price I picked this monitor after reading many reviews The reviews didn t lie This monitor does great on distance I have a 2400 sq ft home that has 3 floors The bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor I can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound I could hear him grunt even I don t know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss You re given many channels in order to find the right strength I could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal he was on opposite end of house upstairs I also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times not getting it soaked Also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound no radio or tv or mobile playing Great product strongly recommend My son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great This monitor is the right choice for the average household Interference may come if you re on the same channel I have wifi network cordless digital phones and nextels and do not have any interference with this monitor so others just don t know how to resolve thier issue before blaming the product 
5 0 Totally happy I ve been very pleased with the performance of this monitor We have a two story house with wifi and cordless phones and have never had a problem with interference I ve use the monitor in every room in the house and had no problems with reception I think this is a really high quality monitor and would definitely recommend it 
4 0 Great Monitor for Baby My husband and I adore this monitor It picks up on every little noise our little one makes which is great We occasionally get some interference but all I have to do is move the monitor and it goes away The interference never occurs on the unit in my baby s room just on the parent unit so you do not have to worry about waking the little one up I love the rechargeable battery option and the ability to carry around the unit with me throughout our 2 story house I plug it in at night by my bed and it then runs all day long You can defintely trust this monitor 
5 0 We love our Bundle Me We live in the cold rainy Northwest part of the country This product has been essential since our little boy was born in December It has been in his carseat since the day we took him home from the hospital We never need to use blankets or bundle him up in heavy clothes when we take him out in the carseat He stays warm and protected in the Bundle Me This is definitely the best and most used product we have bought for our baby It is a must for Winter babies It is well worth the money 
5 0 No need to bundle up with the Bundle Me Wow This is the best thing I received for my baby It has saved me sooo much time I would normally have to layer my daughter before heading out the door but I just don t need to worry with this I feel sorry for all the people who bought my daughter thick sweaters and the aunt who bought her a snow suit We just never use them I can zip her into the Bundle Me and head out for a walk in the stroller She usually falls asleep because she finds it so cozy When she was smaller we used it in the infant car seat which fit into our stroller It meant she was zipped in before we opened the door and unzipped when we reached our destination She never felt the cold It is really easy to use and fits on our two different strollers and car seats 
4 0 Great playard LOVE bassinet This is a great pack n play It s easy to set up and take any place The bassinet is great very sturdy and larger than another one that I have The colors are bright and the music piece keeps our baby s attention My only problem is the piece for the top Whenever I try to use it the arms bow in and it doesn t look very sturdy I also have trouble using this piece and the mat on the ground It just doesn t seem very sturdy and I have tried everything Other than that I am glad that I bought this 
4 0 Great for the money My little girl loves this play space The colors and over head bar keep her amused for long enough that I can get dinner on or help with home work The only thing that might make it better would be if the music in the push button play mat lasted longer than 2 minutes 
5 0 great playard great value I think for your money you get a great value for this playard It comes with an interactive musical toy that no other playard comes with anything like this It also comes with overhead bars that you can hang toys from and the baby can play with The mattress seems very comfortable and I bought this playpen because the bassinet part looked more reinforced than the others It has bars that snap in place and also has plastic parts that hang over the tops The mat can also be used as a playmat on the floor with the overhead bars 
5 0 The thumper worked for us Our daughter is turning 2 years old this week and I felt it time to finally write a review of this amazing product From the very beginning she has been an incredibly alert and interested baby She was born c section at 38 weeks with eyes and hands wide open Once they were finished cleaning her up my husband and I were thrilled to just cuddle her and talk to her while she looked at us both with wide eyes and made little coo coo sounds Right away she was great at nursing with a very good latch She rarely ever cried and when she did it was a quiet little lay lay lay sound not the wild Waa waa s Throughout infancy she was always capable of adapting to every situation quickly and without emotional outburst Where it would seem other children would be over stimulated in an environment she would thrive and seem to want more stimulation At only three months of age people thought she was older because of her alertness and interest in people and animals She hit every developmental milestone months early especially in language sign and speech music appreciation and colors shape letter number recognition Her pediatrician has been happily surprised by her and suggested that I should have five more just like her When we bought the BabyPlus we thought if it helps only 10 as well as the testimonials say it does it will be worth it We re certain it has contributed positively in helping develop this little miracle of ours We re now expecting child 2 25 weeks along and although not using the Baby Plus could be an interesting experiment same gene pool same parenting etc we re too interested in the possibilities of how much it may contribute to our next child for us to withhold it 
5 0 Exceptiona product exceptional baby ok so how many people think their baby is exceptional Well pretty much everyone i know and they are all right of course Each baby is exceptional in their own way But how many babies are rated as exceptional by pediatricians nurses and early childhood educators Well I know one MINE I faithfully used the babyplus system when I was pregnant One time when using it he started knocking back Yeap i actually felt him knock back at it in rhythm It only happened once but I told my husband that i think this is going to be one special kid I was about 7 months pregnant then Well lo and behold after he was born people professionals don t stop telling us how amazing he is He is the most aware newborn you will ever meet He is 2 months old now and has been sleeping through the night 11 hours at a time since he was 2 weeks He cries when he needs something and never cries for no reason but i do make sure to respond quickly to his needs so i don t know how much that has to do with it Yesterday he started reaching for objects Can t quite grab them yet but it doesn t stop him from trying The pediatrician and the nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he is how aware he seems and the fact that he vocalizes to music is unheard of at this age He s been holding his head up since the day he was born 3 days late and has been making eye contact since about 2 weeks So i don t really know what if anything the baby plus system had to do with it I mean it could be just an accident but all I can say is that I will definitely use this product with our future children I would pay thousands if i had to and we are not rich people because its worth every penny 
4 0 great customer service The strap on mine broke and I was very quickly sent a replacement I expressed my concerns about the size of the belt I have a small frame and it is big on me and I was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it s done Very friendly amazing customer service that s hard to find these days 
5 0 A Wonderful Investment This has to be the best investment you can make towards your child before they are born and the results will effect them for their whole life It felt like a big commitment for me to have to run the program 2 times a day and near the end of my pregnancy I was annoyed with having anything strapped across my belly but I am so glad I pushed through My daughter is AMAZING I am in awe at her sweet spirit and her advancement Baby Plus did everything it promised and more Here are some examples At birth eyes wide open hands open instant excellent nurser slept 4 6 hours at night very calm and happy cried only when hungry At 1 month smiling all the time at everyone sleeping 8 10 hrs at night recognized mom and dad s faces At 2 months laughing holding head up At 3 months pressing buttons on toys for 6mos + rolling both directions holding own bottle At 4 months sitting with support At 5 months sitting without support drinking from sippy cup singing saying first words At 6 months puts self to sleep pulled self to standing position creeping and now almost crawling I am completely amazed at her advancements People mistake her for being 3 6 months older than she is and they say she is the happiest baby they have ever known I am totally sold on Baby Plus 
5 0 7 week old loves it I bought this swing because our first baby had colic reflux and I heard someone else say that the side to side swinging action really calmed their babies colic I thought this baby might be too so we bought this swing No colic this time but she already loves to watch the birds and butterflies turn around the top She follows them around with her eyes Very stimulating for the young ones 
4 0 Great swing but motor may wear out I love this swing my fussy first child could not live without it I had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud I called Fisher Price and they said that the motor will wear out with use So now mine sounds like a metronome it clicks back and forth If I had to do it all over again I would still buy this swing b c of the design I just wish that FP would build a motor that was more durable and better yet that plugs into the wall

5 0 Love it We originally registered for this item because we have a 2 level house and thought this would help us from trudging up and down the stairs so much But since my 2 month old still lives in our room in her bassinet that part has not yet been an issue However we keep this basket in our living room fully stocked and we don t even have to get up off the couch to change a diaper Sounds lazy but if you already have kids you understand The sides of the liner have pockets which we use to hold hand sanitizer diaper rash cream a thermometer baby brush aspirator baby nail clippers lotion a couple rattles toys and some chapstick and nursing pads for me We put the diapers a changing pad and a wipe holder in the main center part I also have two wrist rattles attached to either side of the handle and my baby loves to look at them while she s getting her diaper changed I put the basket next to her head so she can see one of them The basket itself is well made and I have no fears of it falling apart any time soon In fact we plan to put it to other use once baby is out of diapers We have not yet had to wash the liner but it appears to be well made and I have no fears of it falling apart although I am going to throw it in a laundry bag and use the delicate cycle 
5 0 Price reduced after I purchased this item I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon This bath tub is a good purchase but as soon as I bought it the price reduced on Amazon This had been a constant problem on Amazon and I think somebody should do something about it I think I should get a refund Thanks Shobhn 
5 0 Awesome I got this for my baby girl and both she and I love it She doesn t slip and it is really comfortable for her She really enjoys bathtime And if you follow the way the hammock should be used for the size of your baby you will really enjoy it I wanted this prior to my baby being born but I read some of the reviews and I didn t buy it for her After the first month of her using another tub and having trouble with the product I decided to buy this Aquarium tub that I wanted in the first place Caution Please use the hammock as directed for your baby s size This tub is perfect if you do that The reviews that I read about the hammock being too small or the bump in the middle of the tub were laughable when I actually read the directions before use Please read the directions Both you and your child will appreciate that you did 
5 0 GREAT for infants Our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old My husband enjoyed them more at first but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these He probably couldn t hold on to them well until he was 5 months old so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier At 10 months he still enjoys playing with them They have lasted through both children I would highly recommend these blocks for infants and so far even into the toddler age he enjoys playing with them 
5 0 Great for little ones My 6 month old got these for Christmas They were among the first toys she expressed any interest in She loved the frog that vibrated when you pull the leg but it broke I emailed Baby Einstein and asked if I could buy a replacement for the green block because it is her all time favorite They are sending a free replacement We love Baby Einstein and our daughter loves these blocks 
5 0 great toy My son loves these blocks We ve also purchased the number blocks to go along with this set He loves saying the colors numbers and stacking them 
5 0 All you could want in a toy These blocks contain everything you could want in a toy Each has different textures images and something unique about it The yellow block has a duck on the one side that quacks when pressed On the other side is a sun whose face flips up to reveal a tiny mirror Another side has a picture of some bananas with a clear plastic over them to make for an interesting texture and yet another side contains a circle motif The red block rattles has a picture of a robin on the one side a square pattern motif on another side and a picture of strawberries on another The green block has a frog with 3D legs and the one leg is a pull toy that will cause the block to shake It also has a picture of a green apple mine does at least although this picture shows a leaf a silky fabric with leaf prints and a triangle motif The blue block is another rattle It has a picture of the BE turtle on one side some jeans made from real denim on another and a star motif on another All blocks have a side with the color s name I bought mine at Target and they have the name in english spanish and french although these pictured only show it in English The rest of the sides are filled with textured fabrics such as a soft fluffly fur or a bumpy texture like the material found on the bottom of some slippers to prevent skidding My three month old loves to look at these blocks and I rub the different sides against her skin while saying soft smooth or bumpy and she loves the feelings My friend s daughter who is five months loves to pick up and throw down the blocks It s one of her favorite games I d reccomend these blocks as a must have for any infant 
5 0 So cute i really liked this swing i have the older model papasan swing nothing was wrong with it i just wanted the new model i loved the pink and the fact that i could plug it in 
5 0 The best swing for babies I have recently had my FIFTH child and so I have experienced many baby items including swings and this one is the BEST It has a cushiony comfy seat for baby with different recline options soothing lights and mobile for baby to have something to look at several musical tunes with adjustable volume control There is also a dial to set the swing motion to go slowly or faster and the best feature of all is that this cradle swing can be changed to swing side to side or front to back Sometimes we put our baby in swinging front to back and she ll cry we then change the swing position to go side to side and she immediately stops crying and starts to fall asleep And vice versa sometimes we put her in side to side and she wants to swing front to back how great to have that option so she can swing whatever way she s in the mood for As my husband says this is the best money we ve ever spent 
4 0 Great idea I received this stroller today and was pleasantly surprised I put it together all you have to do is attach the wheels and the canopy which took all of 5 mins and my 3yr old jumped on the back seat and loves it I have the Chicco Key Fit infant car seat and it fits just fine with the infant carrier bar in place my baby slept in the car seat in the stroller all afternoon There is a nice seatbelt that goes over the infant car seat to hold it firmly in the stroller The only reason I didn t give it 5 stars is that it s a bit heavy bulky I hope I don t have any problems getting it in and out of my van I can t wait to try it out at the mall 
5 0 Recommend to anyone I like this product It is very stylish and lightweight Definitely I highly recommend to anyone 
4 0 Great entertainer for parties and housework The first time I used this excersaucer I was at my sister in laws house and she advised to put my six month old in it At first I was hesitant because I thought it looked too high and kind of unsturdy compared to my excersaucer deluxe and my excersaucer 3in1 I did end up putting Daireeann in it and she loved it so much that I bought one two days later to take to my after baptism party at a restaurant where I might add was so compact that she did not get bumped into at all The only thing is mine did not come with a musical pad at the bottom Just a little tip if you bend the bar back a little bit it will not bump the babies head and the mirror can be flipped facing a way from the baby I do recommend this one and trust me I am very picky when it comes to my kids so this is a good choice 
5 0 Wonderful I love the bather I hated the old plastic ones with this my daughter is more comfortable and doesn t cry when I give her a bath I wish I had it with my first child 
5 0 Incline sleeper We loved the wedge for our little boy He slept on it until he outgrew it It really helped him breathe better when he had a stuffy nose 
5 0 perfect for a fussy baby We had a very fussy baby and we used these and blankets and just about anything to keep him propped up or positioned I was forever reaching for these because of their reliable size and shape I considered it money well spent and carefully packed it away with my newborn clothing so I could use it over with child number two 
5 0 I used mine correctly This item is invaluable in preventing Plagiocephaly flattening of the head I wish we had known about it for our twins Newborns especially need a very soft surface for their very soft and malleable skulls We used it for our third baby and as a result he has a perfectly round head and proportioned features The incline greatly reduced spit up as the flap between their esophagus and stomach is not developed yet Gravity prevents the milk formula from traveling back up and causing gas and or spit up I ve noticed the biggest complaint about this item is that infants seem to slip down in it during the night This is true however rolling up a receiving blanket real tight and placing it in a U shape under our son s bottom prevented this from happening ever again As a result he slept soundly never spit up once never woke us up with gas pain and has a perfectly round head I strongly recommend the Boppy Noggin Nest as well to keep the pressure off the head when your baby is not in his crib Also if your baby is old enough to roll over this item is not for you One other note the foam wedges on either side do trap some body heat so don t over swaddle or put too many layers on adjust the thickness of your blanket to the ambient temperature I would say this is a good item for newborns to about 5 months It made an enourmous difference in the well being of our third child compared to his older twin siblings 
4 0 Mostly Good This monitor is pretty good It pick up my little one s little noises so I can get to her before she awakens It does have a clicking sound with it if the reception in less then 4 bars which it is less then 4 bars most of the time as my house is long I do have high praise for the Fisher Price exchange service I had bought a monitor before my little one was born and so therefor didn t use it until after the 30 day return allowance from Amazon was up Then after about 6 hours of use the monitor stopped working I was able to send it to Fisher Price and they exchanged it in less then ten days no questions asked 
5 0 Big improvment over previous generation monitors Pros + 900MHz Communication for less interference and long range + Rechargeable batteries + 10 channel selection + LCD display showing signal strength battery gauge channel + Alerts if monitor has different channel then base + Visual light indicator for voice Cons + No light on the base Bought this model after trying out 49MHz version 
4 0 So far so good I just bought this one for the top of the stairs and a pressure mounted gate for the bottom of the stairs My first impressions is that a pressure mounted gate is fine for the bottom of stairs However gates which attach to walls with screws are way more sturdy than even the best pressure mounted alternative We considered this model and the Evenflo Top of Stair Gate After inspecting both gates in the store we opted for this one because the wood spindles on the Evenflo seemeed less sturdy and potentially prone to breaking If one of the spindles breaks you have to replace the entire unit Also why take the chance with safety Anyway here are a few things to consider when installing this item 1 I took the advice of others and only used the template for the swing side hardware only This is a must do It would be a wall damaging crapshoot to try to get both sides lined up exactly right using templates on both sides of the wall 2 Unless you are screwing the hardward into a banister and don t want to damage them by having screws go all the way through use longer screws than the dinky 1 4 to 1 2 screws that are provided in the kit I went with 2 screws for additional strength 3 Installation isn t that big of a deal Just take your time to avoid silly mistakes that result in extra holes in your walls I found the picture based instructions at the back of the booklet far more useful than the word based instructions at the front of the booklet It wasn t a five minute job but it was not hard at all I ll be back in a few months to post my thoughts on the gate after it has had some wear and tear from our 11 months old son and our 100lb dog 
5 0 Comfy enough to sleep in I love this bra It is very comfortable I hardly notice I have it on The soft stretchy material is perfect The closure hooks are easy to use once you use them a few times and get familiar with how to open and close them I am glad I bought this nursing bra and I highly recommend it 
4 0 Comfey but needs 5 hands This nursing bra is extremely comfortable ONCE you get it on It is difficult to get over the chest and back You practically need 5 hands because it tends to roll under as you re pulling it down your back I ve been wearing it during my pregnancy I can t imagine how much more difficult it may be to put on when my breasts have grown after the delivery I give it 4 stars though for it s comfort Once it s on you hardly know you re wearing a bra and the snaps have been easy to undo and resnap with one hand Because they are plastic snaps though I m wondering how long they will last with 7 8 feedings a day I will write more on this once the baby arrives 5 more weeks 
5 0 Great Bra I love this bra I have 2 so that one is always in the wash It is the most comfrotable thing I have ever put on I bought it a week after my son was born and my milk came in It was so much more comfortable then my other nursing bra I felt so much better after I put it on for the first time I felt like I could breathe again 
5 0 The only nursing bra I still wear I bought several different kinds of nursing bras before my baby was born including this one This is the only one I still wear Traditional nursing bras are uncomfortable and obvious under clothes I bought larger sizes of my favorite bra and wear those when I go out I sleep in the Medela bra and wear it around the house I am quite large breasted and I find they have plenty of support I even do low impact aerobics in it It is worth every penny 
5 0 The Greatest Baby Care Kit of All Time This is the most wonderful and handy kit I have ever had Everything about it was perfectly made from the iteams inside to the case it is just wonderful 
5 0 Love it I don t have twins however I have an infant and a toddler and it works great for them I go jogging every morning with the kids and it is the most comfortable stroller I have used yet Thank you 
4 0 Well Ok but it s not the greatest My Mom always said that the Rectal thermometer was the best but when she used the speed one on me I found out my temperature right away and that was so cool and I like how it even does it quicker rectally than orally so I dont mind a rectal temp now and you know what My brothers are even doing it that way and one of them is 16 yrs old 
5 0 Excellent idea We registered for this product since it includes so many items necessary for a baby Upon receiving it as a shower gift I knew this was going to be great I love the convenient pouch that all the tools and accessories come in It s small enough to carry around in a diaper bag This is a must have for every new parent 
5 0 Great potty that does not leak I had wished that I had bought this potty chair from the very begining I bought my son the royal potty throne from fisher price it ended up leaking I never could find the place that is was leaking So I purchased Babybjorn Green potty chair My son loved it the moment that I took it out of the box He wanted to use it in the family room I love it because it is only 2 pieces It s so super easy to clean And it is green my sons favorite color Great price and great size I recommend this item 
5 0 great potty we got an inexpensive potty first and it was not comfortable for our baby to sit on he wouldn t use that potty but he went on the bjorn the first time he sat on it the bjorn is shaped perfectly with a comfy back support and an oval shaped bowl so there is enough space for a boy to sit and pee it s so comfy that he will sit and read a book looks great too simple and easy to clean 
5 0 Great Starter Just started introducing the potty to my 19 month old and he loves to sit on it and practice So far so good 
4 0 Good Buy if your back is good I purchased this carrier when my son was just a week old and used it for nearly one year It was on clearance at Babies R Us for only fifteen dollars It was well worth the price The only problem I ever encountered with it was the back support was minimal I do have frequent back problems and it does not take much to aggravate it The weight of my son did get a little daunting at about the six month mark My brother would also use the carrier and he claims the support was fine for him I would say if you have back problems think hard about this purchase if you don t go ahead I personally would still make this purchase Another plus is that is does not look as silly as those women carrying around their child in a Sling People never gave me those looks with this 
5 0 Most helpful travel aid for a parent My daughter was flying to Virginia Beach Virginia to see her husband off to Kuwait where he is serving our country She flew alone with two toddlers one still in diapers I had bought her a Jeep brand Double umbrella stroller I purchased this to free her hands up and help her navigate the airport alone Now that she is home she has raved repeatedly how super helpful this item was It was thee most helpful item I purchased for he 
5 0 Finally Finally The Joovy is the best double stroller out there it was just missing one key element a cup holder organizer for parents Well here it is I would imagine these will eventually be included with the stroller but for now if you buy the stroller this is a must 
5 0 Out of kid s reach This was a great addition to the Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem I can pretty much empty the essentials out of my purse have everything discreetly on hand and not have to lug around yet another bag Organizer is easy to slip onto the handle and doesn t shift around at all Have found this product to be really helpful 
4 0 Good for minor storage I do like this organizer since the stroller I have doesn t have any holders on itself for the pusher There is a nice zippered area for keys to go into and stay secure and one drink holder I don t have any problem with this organizer at all but I put it at 4 stars because I would like to say that the majority of time that I m out using the stroller I m with another adult who could also use a drink holder We re used to the Graco designed strollers that DO come with 2 drink holders It s not the end of the world that someone holds their drink but it would be nice if they could include another pocket for a drink 
5 0 Love it We love this item I was so upset when we got this stroller due to the fact of not having a spot for a drink This item solved the problem Highly recommended 
5 0 Worth the Money The wedge along with a vaporizer helps my three month old sleep better at night sometimes she slides down but she used to slide around before the wedge too Most nights she stays on the wedge just as I positioned her and i think it helps with winter s stuffy noses It s easy to use and not that expensive 
5 0 VERY PLEASED I am very pleased with this product It arrived quickly same as pictured keeps baby in place insuring a goodnights sleep im glad the headrest was not elevated elevated positioners make baby sink into bedding and could cause suffication again im pleased would purchase for any future children i might have 
5 0 Adjustable Positioner 2 thumbs up I liked this positioner because it came with an adjustable head piece My baby kept wiggling up to the top of the headboard and this piece kept him from doing so I also liked the fact that as my baby grew wider I could adjust the wedges One more thing this comes with a mat This saved me from changing the sheet because he puked up so much I bought two and would flipp flopp them when he would get sick 
5 0 Great distraction for hungry baby This is a great toy for my baby to play with in his high chair while he s waiting for breakfast There are lots of things to shake spin and rattle The suction actually works and they stay on his tray unless he pulls really hard Also it s very durable because he s dropped it about a hundred times on a tile floor and it hasn t broken yet At first I wasn t crazy about the fact that the cow over the moon toy doesn t play but one verse at a time with each press of the button because he was only hearing the first verse but in no time at all my baby learned that if he wanted to hear the rest of the song he needed to push the button Now he does it on his own and hears the whole song I think that s great I would recommend this set to anyone 
5 0 I only own part of it I found one of these at a yard sale and it didn t have the suction cup portion So I have no idea if it s a good high chair toy However the toy part gets 5 stars from my daughter She has been fascinated by this toy since she was 3 months old Now she is 5 months and she chooses this toy over all others It is her favorite to chew on bang around grab and study The black and white handle that goes into the suction cup is very easy for her to hold She can grasp it with both hands and bring it to her mouth The mirror smiley face ball is fun to watch The rattle and noises it makes are fun but not annoying 
5 0 Easy to Use for Customizing Kidco Configure Gate I used one of these 24 inch extensions to cover a 90 inch space The Kidco configure gate contains three 24 inch pieces i e 72 inches total so if you need extra length you can purchase 8 or 24 inch extensions to customize your gate to any length The extension was easy to use and is very sturdy The gate looks uniformed and you cannot tell it is several separate pieces The only issue is you have to connect the extensions to either the section w the door i e 24 inch section with the open close swing door or use it as an end piece I was not able to continously connect extensions to one another not sure if I did this incorrectly or not But nonetheless the extension worked fine and I love my new gate 
5 0 Great gate for dog Bought this gate to keep a small dog in a room The entry area is not symmetrical and the gate was configurable to fit perfectly Works well looks good and feels solid Highly recommend for this use 
5 0 Piece of Cake to Add extensions We bought two different kinds of Gates for our living room area We bought the Kidco Configure gate and the Kidco Elongate The elongate was to cover an area of 84 The elongate can only go straight across and opening It s extension are screwed together and have an overlap So the gate is not actually straight across We are very disappointed in this purchase and wished we had bought two Configure gates Took us some time to screw the extension in and then to screw the supports in and then to mark it on the wall Took us over an hour The Configure gate is on the pricey side We almost did not buy it But it has two different size extension pieces and you can bend and configure it to the space you need We use it at the bottom of our stairs and it bows out to give you an area so that the gate is not up against the stairs It was so easy to add the extension piece on You just snap out the pole and add the extension piece You can bend the gate different ways to fit in the opening To Mount on the wall you just mark the screw holes and screw in the plate then snap the gate on It was mounted on the wall in less then 20 minutes It was very sturdy I highly recommend this gate 
5 0 EXCELLANT GATE There is NO way my daughter will be able to get through this gate She is the most rambunctious little girl too And she is only 10 months old She is already running around and able to walk really well on her own And she loves the stairs This gate is perfect in front of our stairs and they re not even with the wall either The banaster and the very top stair are totally uneven and our opening is about 7 feet wide And with the Configure Gate and one extension there is no way I will ever have to worry about my daughter falling down the staris or breaking our gates which she has done due to the way the top of our stairs are This is the only gate that I have found that works perfect for our home Plus the door in the gate is easy to use You don t have to squeeze hard on the handle to open it but it s not easy enough for a 4 year old to squeeze the handle I love that this is a heavy duty metal gate it won t break or fall apart on me and it was easy to install I m so happy that my husband and I bought this gate It is an all around Great Investment If you are considering buying a baby gate you should really invest in a great baby gate And I HIGHLY recommend this gate And with the extensions it can fit ANYWHERE in your home or you can make it into a circle for a play yard If you want a gate for your home and you want one that will last and protect your child no matter how hard they are on it get this gate 
5 0 One of a kind This gate us a lifesaver Not only do I pets I have a very adventurus toddler This gate is sturdy and very durable It is very convienent because it is designed to fit in an area that isnt straight My living room has a curve to it so it fits great A wonderful item Thank you 
4 0 Almost perfect My 14 month old daughter loves these snack cups She can monitor her snack time eating as much or as little as she needs She loves carrying around a snack cup in one hand and a sippy cup in the other The only reason I give it 4 stars is because she has a tendency of keeping her hand in the flaps while walking around This makes single Cheerios fall out here and there But nothing compared to giving her snacks in an open bowl I ve only used them on Cheerios so I can t comment on other snacks she tends to choke on Goldfish so she only gets those while sitting in the high chair She hasn t tried taking off the lid like other reviewers so that s not a problem for us at least not yet We use them all the time and I definitely recommend them 
5 0 Love these cups I just love our snack trap cups My 19 month old has been using them for 4 or 5 months and enjoys doing it himself They re great for shopping driving or anywhere ABSOLUTELY NO SPILLS Highly reccommend this product Happy mom of 1 so fa 
5 0 Vive La Piddle Pad I love this product I works graet as a barrier between your little one and whatever surface he or she is on e g a car seat high chair stroller etc It really saves you from having to wash your furniture when the little one has bathroom accidents that leak out of their diapers It is great for any aged baby infant toddler It will really make your life easier I highly recommend it 
5 0 This sling is a must have for us These slings have been an essential part of being parents Both my husband and I use New Native slings on a daily basis We ve been wearing our daughter since day one and continue to now that she is three months This helped me tremendously in getting to know my baby It allows me to be responsive immediately to her needs because I can read her cues before she gets to a full blown cry It helps me accomplish tasks around the house and makes shopping running errands easy We do not even own the detachable infant carseats I cannot imagine having to lug one of those things around I feel like this had helped her transition from her womb environment to the outside world It gives her a sense of security even in new situations Unlike front facing carriers she can turn her head into our chests if she feels insecure or overstimulated There are endless benefits to wearing your baby and I feel like this sling has made it incredibly easy for me and my husband to do so There are no buckles or rings or fasteners just slide it on If at first you don t succeed try again later It may be more comfortable for you and baby at a different stage Another tip get moving The motion is what soothes babies and brings them comfort Again baby wearing is such a wonderful thing I suggest you read up on the benefits and find a sling carrier that works well for you We recommend this one to all new parents and have never had anyone complain 
5 0 A must have baby item I love my New Native sling I have used it so many times and find it very easy to use and very versatile My baby is a very chubby guy and at 9 months he is 24 pounds and still fits in the sling He loves it too whenever we are out shopping or even at home and he is a little fussy I put him in the sling and he calms right down and snuggles in I ve even nursed while walking around in many places Costco Disneyland Walmart Very discreet I also love the fact that it is small enough to fold up and put in my diaper bag so I always have it No bulky rings or padding I m buying them for all my family with babies I love it and I ve gotten lots of compliments on it A must have item Erica Washington stat 
5 0 Terrific I used the older type bed rails with my now 6 year old son that doesn t overlap the mattress and he had fallen inbetween the mattress and the bed rail quite a few times I remember one particular instance when he was so wedged in there that I was panicked and thought he had suffocated I was extremely happy when I discovered this one for my 1 year old daughter that transitioned to a big bed She is now two and I haven t had one problem with it I at one point had three on her bed I went down to two as I pushed her bed up against the wall which only left 2 sides open I have not had one problem with them I take them off her bed and use them when we travel I can sleep at night not worrying that she is going to fall inbetween I wish they had these when my son was younger 
4 0 Sure Position N Lock Bedrail It s a good product My 3 1 2 year old son finally graduated into his big boy bed with our move into our first house That meant we needed to make sure he continued to be as safe in this bed as he was in his crib We opted for the Sure Position N Lock Bedrail I gave it 4 out of 5 stars mostly because it really does Lock into its Position and stay there The weird thing about it however is that the pressure bars POP You ll get the rail in place on the bed push down on the pressure bars so that they show green to indicate they re locked then after a while they ll go POP and begin to inch their way UP into the red zone meaning unlocked It s weird It doesn t seem to get to the point where the rail is loose on his bed but it s a loud noise that until he was used to it would wake him out of a dead sleep All in all I DO recommend this bedrail for toddlers moving into big beds It s been a great source of safety and roll out of bed prevention and it s given my husband and me much peace of mind at night 
5 0 A must have for anyone with a baby We have several of these in both the cotton and the fleece They are by far better than other baby sleep bags on the market They are made well stand up to a lot of washing and are soft and comfortable for baby The dual direction zipper makes changing a drowsy baby a cinch Note that the small is size 1 month up to 6 months not for a newborn We started using these every night once our son outgrew his swaddling blankets Two fabric options for keeping baby warm and safe at night all you need over pj s to make baby feel more secure and comfortable A great night s sleep for all 
5 0 LOVE My baby loves it by the way it is bigger than it looks on picture I was afraid that it would be too small for my 12lb baby but it fits her perfect 
5 0 Love This I registered for this item as one of those I wouldn t buy it but it s a nice thing to have I did receive it and am so glad I did My son loves this He gets so comfy and warm and will sleep for hours in this boppy lounger I would defninitely recommend this and would buy more if I needed them 
5 0 A Godsend This item is a Godsend and one of the most useful things I received I cannot imagine my day without it my daughter loves it 
5 0 Awesome pillow What a lifesaver this pillow has been for my 2 month old daughter When my son wants me to play a game puzzle or play on the floor I just lay her on the pillow so she can watch us and feel apart of our play time I have also found it helpful when I fold laundry I can lay her down right beside me and she can watch what I am doing It props the baby s head up just enough better than just laying flat on the floor The lounger also cradles the baby I wish that I had found this when my son was a baby I recomend this lounger to every new mommy 
5 0 Cute bath toy This is a super cute bath toy My daughter enjoys putting her toys into the sink and then pulling them back out again She also enjoys playing with the cute accessories that come with this Love it 
5 0 Fantastic Product This is really a great product I ordered it for my 6 month old who has only been sitting up a few weeks It took me a couple of minutes to get it attached to the shopping cart the first time but once I got the hang of it it s very easy to use It comes in two pieces one to use a seat with the harness and a second to secure over the shopping cart handle I haven t used the handle portion yet as my baby is so interested in looking around she hasn t tried to mouth the handle She is quite squirmy so the harness keeps her safe and she doesn t mind it a bit She is very comfortable and can look around and I m not as concerned about her squirming or climbing out of the cart I m very happy with this product and highly recommend it 
4 0 A definate winner I got this tray for my son s daily rides in the car and it has been terrific He can eat on it put his sippy cup into the cup holder and be totally independent He can also play on it cars crayons etc and it holds his books too After approximately 9 months of constant use it cracked It is very stiff of course but I don t recall anything significant happening to it when it cracked Worth the money as far as I am concerned 
5 0 lush soft and comfy I love this cover because it is so comfy for the baby I have had my boppy for almost a year now and I used it the whole time I nursed my baby Love it 
5 0 Versatile and durable We purchased this gate for an odd sized opening because it is expandable It attaches to both sides of the opening so you open it on either side We have the gate in a very high traffic opening and it is not only easy to open and close but has stood up to the bigger kids going in out In the evening when the kids go to sleep we simply unlatch both sides and set it off to the side I love it so much I m buying 2 more to replace those pitiful pressure mounted gates we have Works well to keep the dog contained from the baby area also Quality durable product I definitely recommend it Target is the only place I have found this gate 
4 0 Cute baby bedding This is an awfully cute bedding set and I m very pleased with it It arrived quickly and is good quality though the fitted sheet is a little thin it will still be a good backup 
5 0 Buy If you are gonna breastfeed buy the a boppy pillow they are awesome and easy you can wash them they have covers for them and they come in handy when you want to put the baby somewhere Love it +++ 
5 0 Gets lots of compliments After checking out all of the boppys I decided to get the bare naked one and purchase slipcovers I have received so many compliments on the pink slipcover even the nurses at the hospital loved it It is so soft and I have washed it a few times with no problems I haven t put it in the dryer though It does not protect the boppy itself from spit up etc of course since it is not a waterproof cover However I was not expecting it to be waterproof and the regular boppys without slipcovers are not waterproof so it s not a big deal to me Since I have the plain white boppy nothing shows through but this might be an issue for decorated boppys 
5 0 love it very efficiently drains about as much milk as I can get with the Pump in Style Advanced for me and very portable and easy to clean I use it when I have a little more time or when I don t expect to pump more than a couple ounces between feedings Despite Medela s warnings I would say you could use this to pump daily aslong as you are careful to fully drain the breast massage but maybe not okay for maintaining supply for multiple pumping in a row 
5 0 Great for stay at home moms I bought this upon the recommendation of my lactation consultant and so far I ve been very pleased I wanted to have a few bottles of breastmilk available so my husband could feed our baby when I m out running errands There are just a few parts so assembly disassembly and cleaning is very easy But the best part about the pump is that you can buy different sized breastshields to use with it I needed a larger one than what came standard with it It makes pumping more comfortable The first few times I used it I considered switching to an electric pump because I wasn t pumping much milk But the more I pumped the more milk I produced This breastpump is worth every penny I recommend it to anyone who primarly breastfeeds but wants the option of being able to have someone else occasionally feed the baby 
5 0 Love It I have had the Harmony for seven months and use it about 2 3 times a day It it still working great with all the original parts I have not had to buy replacement anything I do admit I recently tried another pump It was supposed to more closly mimic a suckling baby With in two days I called the company I got a refund and am back to my Harmony This is a great pump and I am so happy that we bought it Stop searching and buy this pump 
5 0 Great This potty is simple and very easy to clean with only two pieces It is also more stable than others we used We like it 
5 0 simply wonderful i love this simply designed sturdy potty my son loves it which is most important he has no trouble sitting down on it no pinching no crampedness no tipping over the well sized arm rests help him up down the splash gaurd is high enough to prevent him peeing all over having only 2 pieces no crevices or anywhere for stuff to get trapped it is so incredibly easy to clean the first few days we had it my son thought it was so comfy that he would bring into the living room to sit on read books great product great price i am now planning on getting another one to leave at my mother s 
4 0 Pretty Good I bought this swing for our first child specially because it has many features overall I am happy with it and our son seems to enjoy it but few things I wish it had is one that the seat could be reclined and two is that the toys made some kind of noise to get attention Overall for the price it is good 
5 0 The Superyard XT Play Gate Extention is Great I purchased the extention kit for the Superyard XT Play Gate to go with the Play Gate that I purchased It works great for my new Pomeranian Puppies The Play Yard is wonderful for keeping the puppies all in one place and knowing that they are safe It will also be nice to pick up and take outside as the weather improves The fact that is is portable makes it nice to pick up and take it as we travel so I can still provide a safe place for them where ever we happen to be I love this item and I am very happy I purchased it I feel the gate is great for animals I have not used it with Children as of this time 
5 0 Love this gate system I bought the whole superyard play yard kit and absolutely loved it The extra extensions you can buy for it are great I have it set up in a living room to keep my son from getting near my entertainment center and leaving my living room I found it to be very durable and sturdy When my son was younger it worked great as a place for him to play in As he got a little older and became more mobile I set the play yard up in my living room to keep him from getting close to my television set You can bend the pieces to form almost any design you choose I would say that if you child is getting close to 3 years old not to buy this though It s sturdy but probably not for that age It can also be used as a place to put your pet in and can be used outside I d recommend this highly 
5 0 If I could give this a 10+ star rating I would My daughter was the most happy when she was in her Halo I love these sleep blankets the cotton ones for use in Florida weather were just perfect and then the colder months the toasty warm fleece I wish they would have come in a longer size since she outgrew them in height well before the weight limits I recommend them for anyone who wants a good night sleep your baby will always be just warm enough and not to warm in these fantastic sleepers 
5 0 Love these sleepsacks Once my daughter grew out of her carters sleeved sleepsacks I was glad I bought these halo sleepsacks They are made from awesome fabrics and I like that the zipper ends at their feet for easy diaper changes I highly recommend these to any new mom or experienced mom It left me assured that my daughter didn t wake up in the morning with a blanket over her head She is a active baby in her crib 
5 0 Love this station There is a place for everything in this drying station I use wide mouth bottles and it s a little tight on space but it works great for me It s convenient on the counter when I have to grab a bottle for the baby 
5 0 Great product I really like this I have had some water leakage on the counter but not enough to really make a mess I think sometimes the excess water is going to get through the cracks no matter what My bottles fit just fine I use the Avent bottles 
4 0 Great dryer for all kinds of bottles This is a great organizer I read the other reviews and was a bit skeptical until I received this one It is great We use the Avent bottles and they and all of their parts fit very well There are even hooks at the bottom so hang items such a pacifiers It did take a little while to figure out how to make it not leak water on the counter but once we mastered that all is well 
5 0 Absolutely In Love We bought this stroller today in Honolulu at The Bike Factory Our son is 18 months old 48 pounds and 40 inches tall Yes we know we got a linebacker on our hands so we had to find something that might last him for the next year or so We love that the max weight is 70 pounds but wonder if the harness system will grow with him being that we have already let out all the slack that is there I think I am going to read the instructions again to see if I might have missed something But other than that the stroller is very sturdy well made and light weight It handles like a dream and I wouldn t be afraid to take it to the mall shopping because it is not any wider or more cumbersome than our old Graco It folds up to a nice tiny package and fits perfectly in the back our Explorer where the Graco did not I can t wait to take it running down along the beach in the morning Oh and our son loves it too by the way he watched Elmo in the living room and wouldn t get out until we bribed him with a bath so it must be pretty comfortable Definitely worth every dime we love it I can t say enough good things about BOB either they are very helpful and their website is pretty informative too 
5 0 Great buy My son is and aside from getting too big for his crib my sister is having a baby and needs it I was a bit concerned about making the transition for my son due to his crib attachment but this bed made it easy as pie It s adorable sturdy and fun My little boy slept all night in his big boy bed from the very first night and we ve never had a problem we ve had it for a month He loves to drive his match box cars up and down the tracks and stand on the toy box saying choo choo It s just been great I m so glad we spent the money 
5 0 LOVE this bed My first son had a race car bed which wasn t made very well We moved him to a big bed when our second child was ready for the toddler bed Well we decided to get rid of the old car bed and get him his own Thomas bed for his 2nd birthday since he is OBSESSED with Thomas BEST DECISION EVER It is SO much better made that the other plastic beds And I m so glad I read the reviews the springs from the crib fits PERFECTLY in the THomas bed and it s pretty strong because I can lay in the bed with him at night if I have to It is really worth the money If you are looking into a cute toddler bed for a boy I d skip the other cute beds and go straight to this one We all love it 
5 0 Excellent Car Seat So many convertibles car seat to choose from but the Britax Marathon name kept coming up in every online review as well as every online forum I was very pleased that the Marathon can handle a child up to 65lbs in a five point harness No other seat that I reviewed offered this feature I also liked the fact that the seat was very easy to use and install with the latch and tether strap My son fit nicely at age 7 months and the transition from infant car seat was very pleasant for him as he did not like his Peg Perego Primo Viaggio They offered a great selection of colors to choose from and had the color I wanted in stock I believe I made the best choice after very carefull review and hope that this add if published help those whom review my comments 
5 0 Works Like It Should This lock gives piece of mind It s easy for adults to use and almost impossible for kids to open It s sturdy and doesn t require drilling into any cabinetry I started out with four and ordered more to have all over the house 
4 0 great for small spaces I bought this seat because we have a small eating area in our kitchen too small for a full size high chair The seat has worked wonderfully from age 5 months to now age 21 months I do find the seat hard to recline or sit up but I have only had to do that a handful of times as once you find the right setting for your child it stays there until he she is ready for the next setting The cloth lining is very easy to remove wash and put back and the plastic under the seat cover is easy to wipe clean The tray is easy to put on remove and again wipe clean or wash off in the sink I have also found the seat easy to take on and off the dining chair when I need the chair for entertaining others My daughter has never complained about sitting in the seat and now that we are no longer using the tray but still using the seat as a booster enjoys having her own place at the table I highly recommend this seat for parents looking to conserve space in their dining areas but not sacrifice convenience or comfort 
4 0 Great booster seat but reclining isn t very easy Our little 2 year old loves the feeding seat We love the fact that she is safely secured while feeding I was looking forward to the reclining feature as well but it is very difficult to adjust and we never use that feature 
5 0 Better than a traditional highchair We have a very small kitchen so I knew I could never have a large highchair I registered for the Healthy Chair by Fisher Price but after putting my son in it once to try it out I returned it for this one and never regretted it This one has a higher back reclines and has a comfortable cushion that is removable and washable the one I have is better than the one shown I bought it at babiesrus It actually comes with 2 cushions and 2 abc 123 plastic mats that go on the tray My son is very comfortable in it and I love that we can take it anywhere 
4 0 The Shade Works Great I ordered this shade hoping that it would cover all of my baby when we re out strolling in the sun It does a pretty good job only my son s feet and ankles are exposed when he is reclined my only beef about the product but I can cover his little piggies and ankles with sunscreen or shoes with no problem I like the fact that the shade protects from UV rays and is easily adjustable I leave it on my stroller all the time and can still fold up the stroller with it attached I think the side pouches are an excellent plus I am very pleased with this product and will recommend it to my friends and family 
5 0 GREAT sunny weather product I tried to use my other kiddopotamus shade with my 16 mt old the other day while taking a stroll on the beach He would not hear of it He wanted to see out I searched the web trying to find another shade to cover him This was the answer I did not want to pay more than 20 00 for the shade and at 15 00 this is a bagin I have found it extemely easy to use on my baby jogger One windy day it did blow in but that was OK with me because I knew it was also blocking the wind from my son s face If you are looking to extend your stroller s shade area this is the product for you I only wish I had found it before I got rid of my Inglesina stroller because I could not move the shade forward to block the son from my fair skinned child 
5 0 A great toy My son LOVES this toy although I think the version we have is an older version as it is a different color He is 10 5 months old and gets really excited when he sees this toy A good buy and will keep them busy 
5 0 Great Buy If you re worried about SIDS loose blankets in the crib or whether or not your little one is warm at night look no more HALO SleepSack Wearable Cotton or Fleece is the way to go I love them and know that my little guy is warm during those chilly nights 
4 0 Cute faucet cover I ve had the Hippo faucet cover for over six months and I think it s great My son is always sitting near the faucet and this definitely prevents him from getting hurt It is a little bit of a pain to take off if you need to use the shower but otherwise I think it s worth it The only problem I found with the Hippo cover is that it doesn t really dispense bubble bath well 
5 0 Funny and functional This thing cracks us up We ordered the elephant and our one year old absolutely loves it He can play with it but its secure enough that he can t pull it off It was also an absolute necessity for us now that he crawls around the tub during bathtime it was only a matter of time before he knocked his head on the faucet It puts our minds at ease while entertaining him at the same time 
5 0 A potty training must have We had just started to potty train my 2 year old little girl when a trip to Disney World came To be honest I didn t know what to do because she wouldn t go potty on the big potty I felt like we were going to have to take a whole week off from potty training her A full week at Disney World was not going to be fun carrying a potty seat around Then I found this at babies r us What a little blessing to little ones It fits perfect on any potty and she can go without being afraid of the potty Plus it fit perfect in my Wendy Bellissimo diaper bag I carry it everywhere I don t leave home without it Thanks for such a wonderful product that helped make our first trip to Disney World so much better 
5 0 MUST HAVE FOR NEW PARENTS i doubt i could have made it through the first three months without this product my daughter had undiagnosed acid reflux and this was recommended as a help after she was diagnosed we were given zantac but still used this as well it s a true godsend we d add a dropperful to her formula and presto she was content this works far better than mylicon it is expensive but it is completely worth the price we called it liquid gold in our house 
5 0 Stops Hiccups Immediately Works great We tried other brands of Gripe Water which didn t seem to do much Something about Baby s Bliss does the trick 
5 0 Gassy Hiccupy little girl This is amazing I tell ya Seriously I ve doubted it since my first child and then my twins never got it with them just assumed it was some Hype Well with my last baby and finally a girl I caved Its hard to hold a baby all day long when you hve 3 other children and a home to keep in order or try anyway her screams were out of no where she wasn t happy being put anywhere to sleep other than on you and sometimes that wasn t good enough she cried and cried and waled it really drove us all bonkers she isn t a pacifyer baby either so we were at loss she was obviously really gassy she got hiccups ALOT She s breastfed and we couldn t figure out what it was that maybe I was eating Sure enough today we tried it and she s peacefully sleeping without stirring I recomend it 110 My husband got it at his work with a 20 discount I m so relieved 
4 0 Baby and I like this Swing I recently received this swing as a gift for my 2 month old preemie She LOVES the lights the rotating stuffed animals and the sounds And she seems comfortable in the seat too The seat snaps into two positions a reclined position and a sitting position Additionally you can set the swing up to go from side to side or forward and backward I did have an incident last week where we had some power surges here in the neighborhood WHILE we were using this swing When the power came back on I tried all the different switches to turn it on and it didn t work then later on it finally did work This swing has so many switches on it and I admit to being too lazy to read the instructions for all of the functions that each of the switches perform That said I don t know if the failure was user error or a quality issue It appears to be functioning just fine as of this writing so I think it was me Another user cites instability of the stand on this swing I have had no problem with this as I tested it carefully before putting baby in Also we leave the swing set up in one place in our house all the time so we haven t had have to worry about not opening the stand up all the way beyond the initial setup This might be more of a concern for someone who needs to put it away and take it back out a lot I personally like the fact that the mobile the rocking and the sounds are independent of each other so you have a lot of variety to entertain baby with I LOVE the fact that you can use batteries OR the wall outlet to power this thing Thank GOODNESS for not being held hostage to battery manufacturers anymore but having that option if we wanted to use it where electricity isn t available I would recommend this swing but I would check for a reasonable return policy first before buying and keep the packaging for a couple of weeks after you receive it just to be sure you and your baby are happy with it 
5 0 bob the builder talking phone is great My two year old son loves this talking phone he carries the thing everywhere We love the time and quailty that he spends playing with this wonderful toy 
4 0 Multi functional We also used this netting last spring summer fall on our double stroller limosine style and our pack n play In addition to bugs it keeps leaves etc from falling into the play pen My in laws loaned us a second play pen that was older and larger than the one s sold these days The netting also fit that but not as snugly 
4 0 Multi use netting I actually bought this netting to use as a cover for our baby s cradle we have two cats and didn t want them to nap in it while the baby wasn t in it I ve used it once for my Pak n Play while outside but found it especially useful when my daughter fell asleep in her jogging stroller after a walk in our neighborhood Since it was such a nice day I let her nap in in the stroller it fully reclines with netting covering the entire stroller I feel that for such a low price this netting is worth it for whatever reason you chose to use it for 
5 0 Must Have The Pack and Play Netting is a must have if you intend to ever have your Pack and Play outside The netting keeps the bugs out It is very light weight so you can easily pack it in your diaper bag It also fits easily over the Graco Pack and Plays 
5 0 it works Diaper Genie Stage 2 Refills have helped us eliminate odors in our twins room Easy to install and discard Our one year old twins use a lot of diapers and they have been eating solid foods for 6 months But you have to install them tightly on the Diaper Genie If the refill wabbles on its place then you need to see what s wrong before starting using it Otherwise the odors will come out The real fact is that it works And you know its great to be at home with my twins in their room and have everything tidy We used to throw the diapers in the bathroom garbage can but after a few hours we couldn t stand going in there Note I am the father and just spend a couple of hours a day with them My wife could tell you more on how she loves this diaper genie 
5 0 Diaper Genie As I am not personally using this I can only pass on what I have been told It does a great job of trapping odors and making terrific sausages which are easily thrown away 
5 0 Perfect fit with both the basic fence 5 piece HearthGate system and a great fit with the decor of our home Highly recommend the entire system Kare 
5 0 Sturdy attractive and versatile We received the original co sleeper as a gift We also considered getting a mini co sleeper and a pack n play or similar playard The main advantage of the co sleeper is that you can attach it to your bed so you can reach your baby without getting up The original co sleeper can also be used as a playard The playard capacity is up to 50 pounds most brands are only rated to 30 lb Similarly the bassinet level rating is 30 lb and most brands go to 15 The co sleeper itself is about 2 or 3 pounds heavier than a typical playard The width is 28 so the co sleeper can go through our 29 doorways without collapsing unlike several playards that are around 31 There is a trick to collapsing the top bars you have to pull the bar upwards when you press the buttons then it s easy otherwise you can push until your thumbs are purple and nothing happens This is explained on their website and SHOULD have been included in the manual I had a lot of reservations after reading other reviews here but am glad I chose to keep the co sleeper and expect it to use it constantly Also the Arm s Reach canopy is really strong and beautiful and I m confident it ll keep the cats out 
5 0 No assembly troubles Not sure what all the fuss is regarding assembly I just unpacked and assembled it a few minutes ago with no trouble Assemble is probably too strong a word there is no actual assembly or tools involved As for the weight maybe 15 pounds certainly nowhere near 50 The instructions seemed sufficient although I didn t really need to use them Basically if the fear of difficult assembly reported here is your only concern don t let that stand in the way of choosing this item 
4 0 Great product needs better mattress I ve been co bedding with my 5 month old son since he s been with us but we recently decided to move to a co sleeper to give my husband and I a bit more space I have friends who used it and read all the amazing reviews so it was a no brainer We ve run into a few problems First we have a modern platform bed that is low to the ground and even at it s lowest the co sleeper is several inches to high so we ve had to switch bed frames for now Second the co sleeper mattress is rock hard and actually sits down about 4 inches from the divider since I m used to having him in my arms for night nursing I didn t want to have to reach in and pick him up We solved both of these issues by purchasing 2 portable crib mattresses Now he has a softer surface to snooze on and I can simply slide him over to nurse or roll myself right up to him we ll have to remove one of the mattresses once he s a bit bigger so he doesn t fall out but for now it works Hope this helps I m adding this a few months after use I like the idea of the extra space offered by having the co sleeper attached to the bed but our son is now 9 months old and has actually slept in it only a handful of times still prefer to have him in the bed with us 
4 0 Okay but a little large for an infant I think this is a great quality product and I love the idea of it However I find that my son whose 7 weeks old is just not comfortable in it It s not very soft and it s just so big for him right now I can get him to sleep in it only if he s completely zonked out beforehand I think the mini co sleeper might have worked better for us in the beginning The original might be better as he gets older and can use the play pen part of it I do have to add that directions were somewhat difficult to understand without going over them many many times 
5 0 Love this product I bought this product because it has two most important things I am looking for portable and the splash guard My son feels very comfortable with it that he has been using this since last August when we got it The parts are all plastic for easy cleaning The cushion part of the seat and the the splash guard are all one piece unlike some other potty seat where the splash guard is an attachment So that s very easy to clean The entire potty can be disembled to be cleaned and sanitized from inside out no hard to reach spots The seat is soft and contoured with oval opening which is best unlike a lot of potty I found with a circular small opening The seat can be put on adult toilet seat which I started training my son after several use to avoid cleaning the bowl The only thing I wish is that this product comes in just the seat without the bowl then that would be even better 
5 0 perfect I ordered this potty chair after seeing the others all had some negative aspects This seat is perfect My almost 2 5 year old daughter took to it immediately It s not too small she s very tall but not too big she has a petite bottom It cleans up easily and is not so lightweight or small that it becomes a toy for her The seat part itself comes off to use on a regular toilet and has handles for the child to steady him herself The bowl insert is large and removes easily for cleaning There are also handles on the base that overlap with the handles on the seat so you can easily pick it up and move it The lid closes just like mommy s potty and becomes a wide flat step stool Perfect product 
5 0 Easy to use great for nighttime Very easy to use and comfortable it didn t bother my daughter when she was asleep Stayed put pretty well considering how restless my daughter can be Easy to change off the bed when wet without having to change sheets in the middle of the night Washed about 30 times and still together and ready to use for my son next year 
5 0 Our baby loves this I replaced our old Ocean Wonders Aquarium soother with this Rainforest Waterfall version about a month and a half ago The Aquarium was still working and our baby liked the lights and music but I was looking for something that would play for a longer period of time With the Aquarium I had to go in her room and press the button a couple of times before she would fall back asleep Not fun at 3 or 4 in the morning when all I want to do is fall back asleep I had read that the Waterfall soother plays for up to 18 minutes so I thought I d check it out The soother has 3 different length settings lights music sounds and movement for 6 minutes lights and music sounds for 12 minutes music sounds only for 18 minutes There are 3 settings for the sounds rainforest sounds without music rainforest sounds and lullabies rainforest sounds and classical music There are 3 volume settings as well I have ours set for 12 minutes of sounds and lullabies and I rarely have to go back in her room and press the button a second time She almost instantly settles down once the music starts If I happen to put her down for a nap or for bed while she s still awake she ll quietly watch the lights and fall asleep on her own And I ll admit that hearing the songs and rainforest noises over the baby monitor is soothing and relaxing as I try to fall back asleep My only complaint is that the lights seem REALLY bright for something that is supposed to lull a baby to sleep I ended up covering ours with a light flannel blanket to dull the light a bit The baby can t see the critters but since I don t have them set to move it s not really a big deal Despite the bright lights we re happy with this soother 
5 0 BABY ENTERTAINER I LOVE THIS ITEM IT HAS SOOTHING MUSIC SOUNDS AND ANIMATION EASY OPERATION BABY LOVES IT TOO ARRIVED QUICKLY AND WELL PACKAGED INSTRUCTIONS ON MANUFACTURERS BOX THANKS FISHER PRIC 
4 0 good solid item I ordered this changing pad because it has the ends curved up and not just the sides This is also sometimes refered to as a 4 sided changing pad since all 4 edges are raised It seems very sturdy and fits very well on top of my dresser effectively converting the dresser to a changing table The only reason I didn t rate this higher was that it didn t include a non skid pad on the bottom of the pad Also it would have been nice if it included a sheet or cover Next I need to order some covers for it since the baby doesn t like being directly against the smooth plastic surface I am not sure which covers to order 
4 0 Perfect for tiny babies My son is tiny born at 5lbs 6oz and very much a preemie I simply cannot imagine putting him in the infant seat without this It keeps his entire body in place not just his head It provides great support and the soft white fuzzy side is very warm we havnt used the other side yet My only complaint is its a bit akward to get the shoulder straps in the correct place around baby but thats mostly because our baby is still very tiny once he s bigger and we can move the headpiece up it shouldnt be a problem 
4 0 We like the Snuzzler The Snuzzler works well for our small baby in his Graco Metrolite stroller It supports his head well and he seems very comfortable sitting on it 
5 0 good car seat i like this car seat it is very soft for a bab 
4 0 Good value for the money This carseat is a good value The pad in the bottom of the seat secures my 4 month old quite well and is removable as well as the head pillow I did have to add the infant head support for her neck but that s expected in a 4 month old It reclines far enough that her head doesn t fall forward and it s so simple to adjust the straps Overall very nice carseat for the money I spent 
5 0 Must have I got one of these for my baby shower I loved it so much I went back and bought another one Very easy to use I just put my baby in it before she s going to sleep for the night There is no need for blankets when using the sleepsack Puts your mind at ease no loose blankets in the crib Also reccomend getting the thinner cotton one for the warmer nights 
5 0 Best Friend This pillow has become my preganant wife s best freind She snuggles with this pillow way more than she snuggles with me 
4 0 Another great item for your baby soothing arsenal We purchased the Fisher Price Open Top Take Along Swing a few months ago for our daughter and have been very pleased with its quality and performance We haven t had any problems with the operation of the swing even as our little one has grown to her present weight of 18+ lbs It runs on C batteries which for us seem to last almost a month with moderate use This swing has several great features It folds up very easily and really is as portable as claimed It pops right in the trunk for trips to Grandma s house and I ve also used it quite a bit in the backyard when I want to do yard work Having a 5 year old in the house I also appreciate being able to quickly carry it from room to room Being only a flat 5 foot tall with short and admittedly weak arms I have a lot of difficulty carrying the swing with the baby in it but the swing is lightweight enough to carry one handed while the baby s in the other arm Though I m pleased with this swing I d really recommend it in addition to a traditional baby swing rather than instead of one The compact nature of this swing means that the rocking motion is very fast moving unlike the slow soothing motion of taller swings My daughter seems to like the Take Along Swing just fine when she s in an alert awake mood When she s tired however it just goes too quickly even on the lowest setting and seems to overstimulate her rather than calm her down I d originally purchased this with the idea of replacing our full sized Graco swing but we ve ended up keeping both around as they seem to fill different needs Overall I d certainly recommend this swing but if you re only going to have one swing in your house you might consider whether you d be more grateful for a big swing that rocks your baby to sleep or this little one that entertains during those fussy bouncy times 
5 0 gift This was a baby shower gift and although the baby is still too little to use it I can say that it is exactly as described and the parents were thrilled to receive it 
5 0 What a great product These are perfect for my one year old who insists on feeding himself Whenever we are out at a restaurant I just grab one from the diaper bag and stick it to the table Who knows what they wipe those tables with This is a safer and more sanitary surface for your little ones to eat on 
5 0 Perfect for messy toddlers These placemats are perfect for a toddler who loves to dump food out and spread it out on the table especially for when you re out in public places They stick onto anything and have fun things for kids to look at my son is obsessed with anything Sesame Street esp Elmo so he loves staring at the placemat They re easy to fit into any purse diaper bag pocket so they re always accessible 
5 0 Fantastic Love these I use them everywhere I really can t imagine not having them since my son throws down all plates and napkins still 
5 0 Don t leave home without these I wouldn t eat out with my 14 month old and 4 year old without taking along a Table Topper for each of them The self sticking tabs on the top and bottom hold them securely in place creating a clean surface for toddlers and pre schoolers to munch on finger foods and place their utensils without worry of restaurant table germs I wish I had thought of these They re a great invention for families on the go 
4 0 Love the Fresh Food Feeder This product is amazing I know a few people with little ones that use these and they LOVE them Super easy to clean and use When ordering these I was under the impression that there were 2 per package FYI they re not Only one per 
4 0 I love this Stroller I recently purchased the Zooper Tango Sidy by Side Double Stroller I had done some looking at stores extensive research online Suddenly I found this on Amazon of all places The reviews were great the price was right I bought it a little hesitant that I hadn t gotten to test drive it This stroller is great It fits through doorways it s a little tight in an aisle but we re talking about a double stroller here it s going to be a little wide I have a 2 year old 1 year old so I do find that it veers to the side that my 2 year old sits on just slightly It is heavier than the Peg Perego Aria is but it feels much more solid Folds easily somewhat compactly again it s a double stroller It fits into the back of my Honda Odyssey with room for bags whatnot I would recommend this stroller to anyone with twins or 2 little ones My 2 year old likes to nap recline the seat while we are walking The back zips off she likes to look out the back A 5 point harness keeps everyone safe but I find that I usually just use it as a waist seat belt Storage is limited my husband wants to customize the basket area it sounded like his plans involved a hack saw There is a spot for a bottle of water or misc items a hanging net type basket just big enough for a bottle of water a zip pocket on the back of the stroller However if you unzip the back remove it you have lost this pocket I did read that McClaren has a stroller organizer for about we were planning on buying this to carry more stuff Overall I do love our new stroller would highly recommend it 
5 0 Great buy We really enjoy this travel system Having a car seat that fits into both the base and the stroller allowed us to leave our sleeping daughter undisturbed when moving her in out of the car Being off of work for 3 months I didn t have to feel cooped at home when I could easily take my daughter to the store or the park As big as the stroller is compared to umbrella strollers we still prefer to take it because the diaper bag and other items fit easily underneath the seat back folds down allowing sleep or diaper changes and it has THREE cupholders 2 side pockets that can hold other items burp cloth bottled water toys and a little compartment for sunglasses or cell phone The basket underneath is accessible hands free by pressing up or down on the basket with your foot The stroller fits in the trunk of our compact Saturn 4 door or if necessary in the front passenger seat upside down to fit in the wide wheels which are anyway relatively easy to remove The loaded stroller is easy to guide with one hand so I can push it if I happen to be carrying my daughter The stroller is sturdy and smooth enough to take down the street on paved park paths and we always use it on the packed sand at the beach it even works over the brief path over the unpacked sand if you go backwards In her car seat in the stroller she could get complete protection from the sun and light rain with the two canopies although I found that a draped blanket allowed for more air flow We took the whole system on a 10 day trip which included a flight out of town and I felt like our load was lighter than those we took before our daughter was born At 6 months she has just outgrown the car seat but she s basically off the charts in her height weight but we still use the stroller now that she can sit up Drawbacks all fairly minor Not easy to close stroller one handed Wheels are wider than the carriage appears from the top so I m always banging the wheels on something It takes a few minutes to remove replace washable carseat cover but this is probably necessary due to the straps As with any carseat we would suggest getting help by certified people with proper installation of the carseeat in your car we had many questions on installation particularly since our car lacked the LATCH system We purchased a second base so we didn t have to remove the one in our car for our trip or for our babysitter s car 
5 0 Great I received this as a baby shower gift from my Mom and love it It is so easy to manuever you can do it with one hand The stroller has ample space for bags purse etc below and side pockets for cell phone or smaller items The drink cup holders for mom and baby are a plus The material is so pretty and the colors are great The best feature is how the system allows you to completely protect the baby should you get stuck in the rain or other bad weather I would highly recommend this item 
5 0 Nice product My wife bought this one when my daughter was 2 months old We feed our daughter with bottles mix formula with breast milk and since each time we need to take the bottled breast milk from ref my wife did breast bumping and mix with formula we use this warmer all the time Also when we travel out this one is quite useful Generally with only a little small amount of water the bottle is warm enough to feed my baby Also it is quite compact to put in the diaper bag well not compact bag though 
5 0 Great Travel Stroller I think that this is a great stroller for traveling I have a 4 year old and she loved riding in it We used it on our Vacation to disney World and it was wonderful for all of the walking we had to do It fit in tight spaces and was very easy to manuever It was light weight and easy to use Overall I am glad that I had this great strolle 
5 0 Good second stroller for outdoor use This seems like a really sturdy lightweight stroller I just wanted something simple and strong that can get us out of the house quickly we live in a very hilly sort of rustic area so I needed something I could take my son to the park in without hauling out the big buggy This is really light and it folds and has a carrying strap in case the boy wants to walk a bit There is also a storage bag for travel The tires have treads on them so they can handle steep terrain and they give a pretty smooth ride over bumps The fabric is sort of a thick canvas sy polyester not removable but it seems like it could easily be scrubbed hosed clean if necessary The seat also has some padding and back support although on the con side it s probably not the coolest compared to mesh The weight limit is given as 37 lbs so my 19 month old still has plenty of room to grow his shoulders are comfortable and his feet don t reach the footrest yet he is 27 pounds and about 33 inches tall On the plus side it seems bigger than the Wrangler All Weather umbrella stroller plus it reclines a bit you unzip unbutton the sides to allow the fabric to unfold unlike the Volo The square canopy is maybe not the greatest it only covers the face and could actually sit a little higher I think but as for everyone complaining that it falls off I have found that when you flip the canopy to the back if you then detach the back flap from the seat you can attach the side flaps to that velcro on the back to keep it from sliding off Some people have also mentioned kicking the wheels but I m 5 6 and haven t had any problems I think it s a matter of not standing right on top of the thing since it s an umbrella stroller and doesn t have a superwide wheelbase I would give it 4 5 stars I think but am giving 5 because of the great price I m pretty happy with this and my son is constantly trying to climb in so he must like it too I figure that with the money we saved we can buy a nice Kettrike or some other form of transportation the boy can grow into 
5 0 Nice light stroller We ve used this since my daughter was about 7 1 2 months old she s now 2 1 2 and we ve never had any problems with it This is the best stroller for quick trips to the mall park etc The sunshade is great and the built in carrying strap is a good idea too We ve never used the rain cover so I can t comment on that It doesn t have a storage basket but I don t know many umbrella strollers that do For longer trips we just take our full size Combi stroller if we need the storage or full recline option I would definitely recommend this stroller for a light quick outing stroller to keep in the car 
5 0 The best tub I love this bath tub We were not happy with my son s infant bath tub so we were anxious to move into this one It fits so nicely in the big tub and offers my son the added protection he needs When you re done with it it just suctions to the bathroom wall to dry The best part is that we ll be able to deflate it and store it easily It s also great for traveling 
5 0 Baby loved it I actually got the Snug Tub Deluxe This version comes with inflatable rings that baby can stack on the inflatable post It also has an attached inflatable fish that wheezes when you squeeze it I used it for the first time tonight and my 6 month old baby enjoyed the freedom to splash and play My only caution is to use something to keep baby from slipping I put her baby sponge underneath her to elevate her and propr her up This was also good to lean her back to wash her hair and to keep her from slipping I m glad I bought this instead of the EuroBath 
5 0 Fabulous Tub We bought this tub because our son struggled with the bath seats He was too big for the infant bath tubs but certainly couldn t handle the full size version This tub is a perfect in between option The only thing that could make this product better is a slip resistant bottom to the tub 
5 0 We love this tub My son has now graduated to the regular tub but we used this tub for a year It is perfect for when they are too big for the seats and your tub doesn t accomdate the rings In fact this is much better than a ring the babies sit in because there is pleanty to cusion them when they tumble over or slip trying to stand Ours has withstood a year of use so far and we ll be using it with the next baby too 
5 0 Great bottle I have used this system for 9 weeks now The bottle will leak if you do not tighten the ring enough or correctly I test shake before I feed and if its wrong I unscrew and reseat the nipple My daughter has less gas with these bottles than with the Playtex bottles I tried If your child gags as one reviewer commented you need a slower nipple I use the standard nipples and not the adjustable flow nipples I have the adapter system that allows me to pump into the bottle and I like the convenience of being able to cap that bottle when done and refrigerator it until feeding time These bottles do well in the dishwasher and clean up easily 
5 0 Half as much at Walmart This is a great item I paid 17 95 for it at Walmart though Get it there 
4 0 Dex Products Universal Safe Sleeper Bed Rail This is the best bed rail if you DO NOT have a box spring My 2 year old recently moved into his toddler bed and I purchased this rail because he has a bunkie board instead of a box spring The length is satisfactory and the fold down mechanism is perfect because of the raised hinges It is easy to make the bed as well We also purchased it for the grandparent s house because they have a platform bed It works equally as well My only complaint is that maybe the rail isn t high enough but my son hasn t been tempted to climb over it I would recommend this bed rail for a good transition to a big boy bed that doesn t have a box spring although the manufacturer recommends it 
5 0 Perfect for Infants with Reflux Gerd I am a pretty picky shopper but I have fallen in love with this product My now 6 1 2 month old daughter has terrible reflux and this is the only place I could ever get her to sleep comfortably She still sleeps in it at 18 pounds it is still safe up to 25 or when they can crawl out There is a cushion for newborns and it is removable for use for older babies Save the money you d spend on a co sleeper swing or a bassinet and try this instead I buy it for every baby shower I attend 
5 0 Wonderful Product We love this glider as does our 6 week old She has reflux so this has been a life saver She sleeps in it and enjoys the gentle gliding back and forth as she falls alsleep We swaddle her and tuck her turn on the side to side glide and set her womb bear on the edge of the glider off to slumber land she goes We highly recommend this 
5 0 Better than expected Ok so I purchased this when my son was 4 months old I always thought it was pretty neat but figured he wouldn t sleep in it because it seems to glide too slow My son wouldn t sleep in anything but his swing I wanted to get him something bigger that may slightly imitate the swing that I know he ll sleep in So based on reviews I got this product At first I was a little disappointed because at night as soon as I laid him in it he would start too fuss like he did everything else except his swing I just figured maybe I should have bought it a couple of months ago But what I did was put one of his big blankets in it and laid him on top of it and whadduya know He sleeps in it more than his swing now I guess it wasn t as cushiony as he wanted it to be I kind of noticed that too when I got it that it appeared not to be as cushiony Another disappointing thing is that the music volume is a little loud even on the lowest setting so I don t even use it Aside from that it s great The motor noise doesn t seem to bother me or my son It isn t very loud to me But anyway he sleeps in it which allows me to get more me time and sleep time at night I would say my money is well spent 
5 0 Helps baby sleep through the night Sizing information This product helps my colicky baby sleep through the night especially since she can t kick off the blankets I highly recommend it Sizing is different than baby r us I m probably going to have to do some exchanges so thought I d provide info X Small Newborn 5 to 10 lbs Small up to 6 months 10 to 18 lbs Medium 6 12 months 16 to 24 lbs Large 12 18 months 22 to 28 lbs X Large 18 24 months 26 to 36 lb 
5 0 Sizing Info I haven t been able to find the sizing info for the sleepsacks on this site so I called the Right Start they also carry them but for 24 99 and they said that the large size is for 22 28 pounds Just thought I d put this info out there for everyone hope it helps 
5 0 Great product As we all know you re supposed to put your baby to sleep on his back to help prevent SIDS The SleepSack is a great product It keeps baby nice and warm yet you don t have to worry about a blanket And there s space down in the bottom for his feet so he s not too restricted Also the great thing is that it zips from top to bottom so you don t have a big zipper poking baby in the face 
5 0 question about product would someone be able to give me the dimensions measurements for this mattress Thanks so much I DO NOT HAVE THIS HOWEVER IT MADE ME PUT IN A RATING IN ORDER TO POST A QUESTION 
5 0 Good mattress good price I bought this same mattress in 2004 for my first son and we never had any problems Easy to clean and firm yet soft enough for my son to sleep through the night starting at 3 months When we were surprised at the news of a second I bought this from Amazon on sale the fabric design is different blue and white checks but otherwise it seems the same to me But one comment if you don t get it on sale here you might try to buy it in store because the shipping is around 20 It depends on what you re willing to pay for convenience 
5 0 Works great We purchased this because my newborn was having trouble sleeping She always woke up congested and strangled Since we started using the wedge she hasn t had any problems at all she is 5 months old now 
5 0 Walgreen s brand probe covers work I would like to ditto and thank the reviewer who suggested the CVS brand covers After reading her review I purchased the covers from cvs com Then I thought about checking at Walgreen s and sure enough they carry them same price as CVS 40 for 5 99 I just picked up a box today So I will soon have a bunch of covers but I don t care I just love this thermometer I actually have the one with the light on it Outstanding product 
5 0 awesome this stroller is the BEST 250 00 that i have spent in a long time we live in texas and were using a regular double stroller to walk the dog with our 2 daughters aged 16 mo s and 3 around a one mile loop in our neighborhood depending on weather and moods sometimes we d do 3 laps it was such a CHORE pushing that old stroller up and down our neighborhood hills plus i can actually JOG or even RUN i can t tell who loves it more me the dog or my girls it s light easy to steer worth EVERY penny plus i love the fold out visors for shade for the girls oh and it was incredibly easy to put together 
5 0 Where s the Smell We had the forerunner Diaper Genie 1 No matter what I did it still stunk I would add baking soda after poopy diapers line it with an odor protecting garbage bag as well as the normal liners It always smelled like poop One day it broke so we looked for a replacement I was a little hesitant to purchase this product because of our previous one but we thought we would give it a try It s amazing My daughter had diareha and a day later still no stench Also it s so easy No twisting Just put the diaper thru the trap door It s easy to load and change cartridges This is definately a great buy 
4 0 Good swing I love the plug in feature there s been many times I ve left the swing on have to rush to change a diaper and left it on True it will stop if lightly touched or a blanket falls The swing isn t incredibly fast but for my 2 month old it s worked well There are two volume levels for the music but I ve only used the lowest setting 
5 0 High chair This high chair is so easy to put together and use My grand daughter loves this chair the music and toys on top occupy her I like how it changes height and reclines My grand daughter was using this chair when she was 3 months The recline position came in handy I would buy this chair again and highly recommend it to friends and family 
5 0 Very nice I love this chair and so does my 6 month old It s super easy to clean to recline the seat or to adjust the height The toy that comes with it is cute too I love the music it plays 
5 0 Love this High Chair I bought this chair for my third child and wish I would ve had it for the first two as well It is easy to assemble easy to use and easy to clean I like the recline feature and 5 point strap because my baby could sit lay in it at a fairly young age I love the wheels because I could rock him with my foot and talk to him while doing dishes or making dinner The one hand release on the tray is a dream for Moms who could use eight hands My son seems to enjoy the toys too I only wish it came with extra trays 
5 0 Great tub for a baby Love this tub The hammock attachment works well for small infants 
5 0 great little tub We love this tub still use it with our daughter that is now almost 9 months old The incline position is great when they aren t quite ready to sit on their own We used to just place this over our kitchen sink give her baths there Now we place it inside our regular bathtub because she isn t quite ready to be in the big tub yet 
4 0 Much better than normal sheets I like this sheet so much better than the thin ones It offers more padding and seems so much more comfy It is a tight fit but I had no problem fitting the sheet onto my Eddie Bauer pack n play So I would assume it should fit any pack n play Just make sure to wash in cold water and hang dry I never put this in the dryer The only thing I don t like is the color It happens to match my navy blue playard but I wish it came in some lighter colors 
5 0 The ONLY thing that works I have two children now and I wish this item had been available when my older daughter was born I have tried everything to keep my babies heads from slumping over in the car and nothing worked 100 of the time This however does It is one of the best things I have ever purchased for my child and it s very inexpensive 
5 0 Toy Chest It works really well It s stable the little guy is trying to climb and holds a lot 
5 0 Great toy box This is one of the best on the market Looks good and holds tons of toys and the 2 drawers on the bottom are really nice for holding books A Must Buy 
5 0 At Long Last Finally A big spacious nice looking toy box I looked for a long time for a toy box that could set out in our family room and still blend in to the rest of the decor but was bigger than the little wooden toy boxes that are out there The lid has finally improved from the old ones where the lid never stayed up The drawers on the bottom are small but hold a few things and don t take anything away from the big interior of the box It makes the box look more sofisticated Love the new colors and design Thanks Little Tikes 
4 0 What is there to say It fits our Baby Trend car seat hooks easily to the LATCH anchor points and in our mid size sedan leaves enough room in the back seat for an adult to sit on each side 
4 0 Very appealing toy This toy is a favorite of my 10 month old He likes the crinckle fin and the mirror He also loves the music which calms him down when he is crying The music is soothing and doesn t grate on our nerves even though we ve heard it many times My only complaints are that there are just two short tunes that play alternatively and you have to press his belly fairly hard each time you want one to play It would be nice if there was a setting to have them play a few or more times There are pictures with words on one fin that are useless and there to fit the Einstein theme All in all a good product that I would buy again By the way the thing he is wearing on his head is a diving mask and a snorkle 
4 0 great toy All rubbery squirt toys have the issue of the black stuff there s no avoiding it We squirt them til empty at the end of every bath My kids love the net and little fish as well as the other toys No problem with paint loss on the net as of yet and we ve had it over 2 years 
4 0 Good purchase doesn t hurt your back Used an infantino front carrier for several hours a day until my back started to hurt Purchased the ultimate baby wrap based on the reviews here I liked the idea of even weight distribution and being able to put baby in different positions While using the wrap isn t intuitive ie watch the dvd it s easy to learn My back problems are gone and baby is more snug in the wrap tummy to tummy than in traditional front carriers I wanted to use the sling position but baby is too big length and width wise Only gripe is that there is no neck support in the tummy to tummy position so I have to hold baby s head while I rock her to sleep Would recommend this product great price too 
5 0 Wonderful Based upon reviews I decided to go with Dr Brown s from the start We ve been very happy with them A friend had given me some Avent bottles she had never used so I decided to try them compare My baby had a terrible tummy ache had never before burped so much Those Avents now sit in the back of the cabinet gathering dust For folks who complain about leakage the rare times that has happened to me was when I accidentally added milk past the top marker Otherwise I ve never had a single problem with any sort of leakage Another plus is that they re very easy to clean I just pop all the pieces into the top rack of the dishwasher I use a toddler basket to hold some of the smaller pieces If you re comparing the wide mouth to the standard forget the standard They re a pain to get liquid into but still good bottles I absolutely love this product would never consider another bottle 
5 0 Great gate I have been using two gates for the last year to keep my 2 year old off of the stairs The gates are attached to the walls I have not had any problems with the either gate For those of you searching for a gate for a dog the gate works will with by 70 pound Boxer 
5 0 excellent I was very cautious with my first child concerning the crib Nothing was inside except the sheets and baby As you can imagine this led to many sleepless nights of baby waking due to legs and arms getting tangled in the rails So number two baby reaped the benefit of me not being such an over cautious parent and utalizing this wonderful bumper I still worry about SIDS but I feel this bumper has allowed for many restful nights for baby and mommy Highly recommend 
4 0 Good idea and let me sleep better This is great for young babies once my son became more active which is when it s safe to use a regular crib bumper anyway he would put his legs on it and it would scrunch down since it s very thin unlike the big padded more sturdy bumpers that come w a crib set I think that is the only flaw but I will definitely use it again for my next infant baby 
5 0 A Lifesaver I bought this after fidning my 2nd child who is 4 months old caught under the headboard bumper that came with his bedding This is my 2nd child I have never been told of this danger I highly recommend this bumper It comes in 2 pieces the shorter one goes across the front railing that you move up down the longer piece goes from the last slat on the headboard to the last slat on the footboard There are only 2 gaps which are where the handles for the railing are I was also able to weave a few places along the sides to make sure he couldnt get underneath I love that it s wide so that it reaches down to the mattress it velcros at each end across both the top bottom for a tight fit it will collapse if an older baby tries to step on it but is still very tight that it s very breathable but still has a little cushion to it I just wish that I had known of the danger of traditional crib bumpers Thankfully I heard my son screaming when I did HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT or one like it to avoid suffocation hazard from stuffed bumpers 
4 0 Pretty Good Breathable Bumper I replaced my baby s old bumper with this one when she became mobile It works fairly well in keeping her from getting her arms or legs caught in between the crib slats The only complaint I have is that the short section of the bumper can be pushed down quite easily by the baby thus defeating the purpose of keeping arms legs inside the crib 
4 0 Tad too wide This protects our leather seats well but is much wider than the infant carrier base which crowds the other passengers sitting next to the baby Otherwise a good product 
5 0 Awesome and sturdy This is one of the best products I have seen for the car seat I am very particular about my car and did not want the leather to get messed up This product is the best and will prevent items from spilling onto the sea 
4 0 Satisfied This seatsaver is one of the few wide enough and tall enough for SUVs In contrast to one of the other reviews and I am NOT affiliated with the seat manufacturer this seat does the job adequately and one should not post a poor rating without researching the specs measurements fit etc IMHO There is no quot universal quot seat saver or for that matter car seat that will fit every car This one manages to catch most of the itty bitty things that kids manage to somehow accumulate and is sturdy enough for the car seat not to make indentations on the actual seat and hence serves its purpose well 
4 0 Nice toddler step I like this because it is a nice construction I bought the white and it blends in nicely I just wish it was a little higher We have a newer construction home and the bathroom counters are high so it is still too low for her to wash hands by herself for now 
4 0 Works great but a bit pricey My 3 yr old son use it everyday to brush his teeth and comb his hair He doesn t tip over and fall anymore like he did on the other step chair The babybjorn is a bit expensive I found a similar chair at Ikea for a fraction of the cost 
5 0 Gotta Get One If you re going to get the Baby Bjorn potty chair you ve got to get a matching stool I love how the stool has a rubbery grip top to prevent slipping My son also uses the stool to read his books on while sitting in his matching potty chair You ve gotta get one now 
4 0 great step stays in place I really like how this step was designed to stay in place We have a cheaper plastic stool in another bathroom that tends to scoot too easily as our son climbs up on it This one stays put The only reason this stool didn t get 5 stars from me is because of the textured top It is a little difficult to clean Since this is a potty step stool it has gotten some messes on it that I wish would have been easier to get rid of 
5 0 actually works I bought this thinking it was a gimic Worse case was my daughter would get a night light on her bed Turns out this actually works Her bedroom is filled with stars She uses it every night and I use it to check on her It is still using the original batteries 30+ days The amber color does not work so good but her walls are pink On white it might work better Get it for something diffrent that works 
4 0 Nice product This is a great light shines stars all over the room Constellations aren t quite right but they re close The different color options are great For the price it s a great deal 
4 0 Tricky at first but overall very good I ve had this seat for some time and I saw all of the negative reviews It took a bit to figure out the quirks but once I did it was fine The seat has to go on the very front of the public toilet not the back or in the middle like mine at home You have to make sure that it is on securely with the lip in the front against the front of the seat Otherwise it will fold which is probably what happened to the other reviewer It will slid off as you come off if you re not careful My five year old uses it by herself and I use it with my 2 year old It is so compact that I can stick it in my purse I carry in in a zippy bag and very easy to clean There aren t too many of this type of product out there but for me it works just fine 
4 0 Great Product My sister has a small one bedroon apt and this product was perfect 
5 0 Best Bathtub By Far After using a smaller plastic tub and a blow up tub this one is the best I only wish I would ve just bought this one to begin with My little guy is 6 months old 24 pounds but can t sit up yet He still uses the side that lays him down in the water and he loves it Don t waste your money on other tubs this one is the best This one will grow with your child while saving water too 
5 0 I love this pack I ordered this pack after my friend s baby shower she received this as a gift and I was amazed at how nice it was It fit both her and her husband very well so I ordered one to carry our 7 month old daughter in WE love it It is easily adjustable and fits my husband and myself great Our daughter squeals in delight whenever she is in it it has made our walks more enjoyable I have free hands to hold our dogs leashes and she likes being up to see everything I only have one complaint and that is the pocket on the belt is almost impossible to access when wearing the pack but it is so minute of a complaint I still give it 5 stars Oh yeah the price is amazing for the pack you get I cannot wait to go on a day hike I had been pricing other packs and they were close to 200 this was 90 w free shipping a huge price break plus I got it in about 3 days thanks Amazon 
5 0 GREAT baby backpack I bought this backpack after reading several of the other reviews and I am glad I did I did some shopping around at local stores and all of the other backpacks I found were either MUCH more expensive or were the same price but had fewer features My 7 month old daughter loves this backpack In addition we don t need the diaper bag because it has so many pockets I did not have any trouble putting on the sun visor and the backpack is very easy to store and use I originally bought this backpack to take abroad in place of a stroller but I can see that it is going to be handy in places like the zoo and grocery shopping as well I don t know how it would do for serious campers but for every day use it has been GREAT 
5 0 Excellent Carrier I bought this carrier for a recent trip my family took and I am so glad I had it I used it for my 8 month old to carry her around instead of using a stroller There are many pockets which have plenty of room to store all your needed items and the stand works well to set down on the ground when not wearing it My daughter seemed to be quite comfortable in it and at one point even fell asleep She loved being able to see everything around her at our level I am 5 3 and my husband is 6 1 and we both wore it comfortably I would recommend this item to anyone needing something smaller than a stroller 
5 0 This is the right carrier AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME My hubby is an enginner and extremely picky about quality design and function about products and he loves this carrier I liked the price and my son loves to be at the same level as everyone else He tolerates being in this more than his stroller This was my first choice based on all the feedback Thanks 
4 0 Very happy with these sheets I bought these sheets online since I couldn t find any in the local Babies R Us store and did so with hesitation But when I received them I couldn t be happier with them The best thing about these sheets besides that they fit perfectly is the velcro strips on the bottom of the sheets to insure they stay snug 
5 0 Wonderful These are wonderful My baby was getting uncomfortable being swaddled at about three months so we decided to make the switch to sleep sacks We were worried that with her arms free that she might have a hard time falling and or staying asleep This was true at first so we started by only putting her in these during the daytime in a light cotton one After about a week she was not waking early from her naps anymore and after two weeks we tried her in it at night and she slept straight through the night as she did when she was swaddled So the transition was painless and she seemed a much happier baby to be able to reach her hands and move her arms While I didn t notice shrinkage I did notice that the zipper does bunch up a bit but this hasn t been a problem Sometimes my daughter sucks on it if it gets close to her mouth but she has to reach for it it doesn t cover her face at all or trap air that she could rebreathe I didn t like that these don t have sleeves so I tried Carter s sleep sacks and found the sleeves to be too short and hard to get on my daughter Those sacks only come in one size which my daughter has already outgrown at four months 14 lbs 24 inches She has also outgrown the small size sleep sack but the medium size fits her perfectly with some room to grow I didn t want to use fleece at first since it is polyester I wanted to use cotton But we ve found that she sleeps longer and seems to prefer he heavier fabric of the fleece one Also we only bought these in blue even though we have a girl because the color is calming to our easily overstimulated baby We ve washed these many times and they look just as good and hold together just as well as they did originally We ve also found you can put your baby into the next larger size without it being so big that they can get their arms out or that it bunches up around their face So after everything we ve tried we ve loved these sleep sacks from day one 
5 0 a definite must my baby is now 5 months old and we ve been using the Halo sleep sac since she started moving around more I was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face Now I never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night This product really gives me peace of mind and I ll be sure to give this to any new parent friends 
5 0 My wife is Very happy This particular pillow is wonderful because it is not cumbersome or too large to manage yet does everything my wife needs it to do I hardly know this pillow is in bed with us and when I do notice it I can t help but to think of how nice and soft it is A great thing about the main squeeze is it is so versatile The pillow can be twisted and bent into any desired position This is a great product and I highly recommend it to all who are looking for something that will support all legs pregnant belly and face and hands One nice thing I forgot to mention is because it is sleek my wife has no problem turning with it when she feels the need to be on her other side 
4 0 Good product My daughter recently had her second child and spends alot of time breastfeeding This product allows her to pump at her convenience She can have others hold and feed the baby while she spends some time with her other child The product works very well She said it takes a little bit of experimenting and adjusting to get it set to work best for her but it is an excellent product She previously had a less expensive product by another manufacturer and heard how good the Medela brand was from a friend This brand is a pleasure to work with after using the less productive noisier pump she had before We would highly recommend this product and the product is well worth the price paid 
5 0 Definitely worth the money It s expensive but worth it It s nice to take to work because it looks professional many people didn t even know what it was and it comes with a cooler so I didn t have to put my milk in the fridge next to everyone s lunch A friend also bought one around the same time and says she got it much cheaper on eBay for a brand new one 
5 0 A must for breastfeeding moms I LOVE this pump If you re going to breastfeed you NEED this pump It s expensive but worth the investment I pump at least 10 times a week and it s just so much easier than the manual pump I tried 
5 0 Great pump Watch for different size flanges I got this pump as a hand me down from my friend It worked great even after many years I eventually purchased the Pump In Style Advanced Limited Edition where the pump can be separated from the bag It takes up less desk space no extra space required for the bag Also it s more portable if all you need is the pump I pump all over the house study bedroom living room while watching TV with my husband Just a note to some people having problems getting milk out with the Medelas It may not be the pump itself but the size of the flanges Every woman s breast and nipples are different sizes Initially I was using the standard 24mm flanges suction cup things that go over your breasts It was painful to pump and my milk would not come out even though I was engorged with plenty of milk It would take me 2 hours just to get 2 oz of milk I went to see a lactation consultant who suggested I try the next size up flanges 27mm She got me one to try and it made a world of difference I could immediately pump 2oz in under 5 mins Now I pump daily to stock up and can get 4 oz from both breasts in under 10 mins estimate since I don t really time it cause it s so fast I am now planning to pump to donate my milk to a milk bank This pump made a world of difference I think Medela makes flanges in 3 different sizes The standard 24mm that comes with all their pumps the 27mm and a 30mm 
5 0 So much better than potty chairs This is so much better than any potty chair and it is never in the way Very easy to put on and my daughter loves it She ahs been potty trained for a year but my nephew who is just now potty training loves it also 
5 0 Great seat This potty seat is the only toilet training item I have bought I highly recomend it My daughter thinks she is a big girl on the big potty You need a step stool for them to get up on their own I like that the seat is sturdy enough to withstand a 30 lb 3 ft 2 yro climbing up situating her self with out my help because ultimatly that is the goal this product I feel helps get to that goal 
5 0 warm sleepsack This sleepsack keeps our little bundle warm toasty on those cold san francisco nights it is really easy to use to move from the carset to the stroller i do wish it zipped up just a little higher on the sides but it s the best thing around we ve seen 
5 0 Toasty is right This fit very easily into my daughter s Graco infant car seat As the other reviewers said it is very convenient and keeps my daughter nice and warm Wind has not seemed to be a problem but then I only carry her between the car and my destination in it I would recommend this to a friend 
5 0 We love it Our baby was born in early October and we put the Bundleme on her carrier immediately We live in Chicago and have had warm weather 75 degrees and cold weather 10 below since then We love this cover The top easily zips off for those rare warm days or if we are strolling though the mall It also has kept her very warm and toasty on cold windy days The day when it was 10 below freezing she was zipped up in the cover with only a winter hat on and your typical outfit I was concerned for her warmth but when we unzipped her she was as toasty warm as could be We have not had to buy a winter jacket It has also kept her dry through a couple of rain storms I have gotten numerous compliments on this cover almost every time we take her out and it still looks like new even though many things have gotten spilled on it I would highly recommend this product 
5 0 Love these bottles I love how wide they are This makes them much easier to clean and to handle Since they are shorter I can fit them on short shelves in my fridge when I use the stopper caps on them I can also fit them in my milk cooler in my breast pump because they are short My baby is able to hold them with ease since they are wider than other bottles Her arms don t have to stretch as far I haven t had any real problems with these bottles I was weary to use them after a friend complained about the leaking problem I went ahead with them because my sisters said they didn t have any problems with them They have leaked twice but only because I didn t screw the lid on all the way because my hands were wet Any bottle will leak if you don t screw the lid on sufficiently I have used plenty of other brands that has worse leaking issues when I watched my twin cousins We tried three different brands and weren t ever really happy with any of them 
4 0 Very cute baby seat but not a rocker I wouldn t call this a rocker seat The kick stand on it makes it look like a rocker if you put the stand down the legs almost touch the floor You can make it move a little if you have wood floors but not enough to call it a rocker If you have a very mellow baby this chair is perfect My baby likes to sit and stare at the toys But if you need any type of movement for your baby to stay calm I wouldn t recommend this chair The music sounds on it is very nice not annoying at all I don t use the vibration on it yet until my baby can itch his cheeks if needed The only reason I say 4 stars and not 5 is because it is falsely advertised as a rocker other than that it is very cute and my baby enjoys it alot 
5 0 Get over the price and just buy it It s worth every penny I wish I would have bought this bouncer when I first found it My son was heavier and quickly outgrew his other bouncer This one holds up to 40 pounds I didn t buy it right away as it was a bit pricey for me So I tried to get it on ebay but was always outbid at the last minute Then I realized that if those people could get 35+ then I could too when I was done with it So I finally ordered it when my son was 6 months old and 19 pounds He loves it I love it It s made very well If I had bought it when I first found it I would have gotten 4 more months of use out of it So don t hesitate You won t be sorry 
4 0 Overall fantastic one big con and a few small ones I have had two kids use my Evenflo carseat I HATED it It was like they never even tried it out to see how well its features worked I finally got so sick of it when my 2nd child was 4 months old that I ordered a Babytrend Flexloc At first I was seduced by the high safety ratings but even after that Consumer Reports article was rescinded I still liked a lot of the features Pros very comfy seat good padding the canopy is twice as long as my Evenflo so it can cover baby almost completely the canopy stays in place it doesn t fall forward or backward behind the seat the tightening mechanism under the baby s feet is easy to reach and VERY easy to adjust to make the straps tighter or looser depending on what baby is wearing the harness mechanism is very easy to adjust the shoulder strap height My Evenflo had to be rethreaded every few months and even my mechanically inclined husband said it was horrible The Flexloc is just a dial on the back that you turn it s a breeze The seat can be transfered between cars without the base It can be strapped directly to the car by using a seat belt on the car seat or by using the LATCH system if your car has it the triangular handle has a nice grip and is easy to hold in any position this carseat is lighter than my Evenflo The cloth is very wipeable not as absorbant of spills and stains as my Evenflo Cons I found a few minor cons that definitely would not deter me from buying this carseat and one that might depending on how I can resolve it once I contact Babytrend The release button to take the seat off its base is at the toes under the seat It s a little harder to reach than the ones behind the head if the carseat is backward facing As others have said the buttons to move the handle are a bit stiff but not horribly so I was prepared for them to be way worse The handle is thinner and doesn t FEEL as sturdy as my Evenflo when carrying baby around but it hasn t had any problems This is the one BIG one that I have to check with Babytrend on Twice when I have turned a corner sharply the carseat has tipped to a 45 degree angle I have tightened down the seatbelt as much as I could putting my full weight on it and using the seatbelt retracting mechanism But maybe I m still not doing it right The base is narrower than my Evenflo s was so maybe that s why So I need to contact Babytrend and see if they have any suggestions Until then I guess I ll take the corners slower Overall I have felt like this seat was a MAJOR improvement over my Evenflo and even over the Graco Snugrides I checked out at the store It was intelligently designed to be easy to use and adjust as baby grows I would recommend it for sure Just make sure you strap it in tightly or use the LATCH system if you have it 
5 0 Superbly designed car seat I don t generally write reviews but wanted to praise Baby Trend on the design of this car seat We were directed to it after the January 07 Consumer Reports review showing this as one of only two infant car seats to pass their more stringent crash tests TV news showed alarming video of various car seats flying around the passenger compartment after being struck by a vehicle Compared to our still new Safety 1st seat this one is so much better engineered in a number of ways 1 The base is super easy to install Click twice into each of the car s two anchor points then tug on each of the two straps to tighten the base That s it Our old seat had paragraphs of confusing directions that didn t leave me as confident as this one 2 The base has an easily adjustable tilting mechanism and leveling indicator to insure you get the right angle for the baby s head no flopping Our old seat had no such system we used rolled up towels 3 The seat has a dial to quickly adjust the seat height as the baby grows No such system on our old seat 4 The handle has an ergonomic triangle shape on top for more secure grasp when reaching into the car from the left or right 5 If the base is not available the seat can be strapped directly into a car using the car s lap belt 6 The seat is overall more narrow than our old seat allowing our two other kids to fit in the back seat with a little more breathing room Every inch helps 7 The seat is lighter than our old seat although it feels just as secure and solid as the old one All this and the seat is the same price as our old one Unfortunately Amazon Target was sold out when the Consumer Reports issue came out but I found them in stock online at Wally World if you are looking to get one quickly The one for sale here is a better color combo than Wally s unless you like lime green but the seats themselves are all the same superb design Summary super easy to install and adjust well thought out features fair price Makes me want to have more kids just to buy more of these 
5 0 Awesome I think that this crib toy is awesome Since my son was 3 months old we ve turned it on every night at bedtime for him He just watches the fishies swim around while the lights dance and the music plays My son is now 7 months old and he still seems to like it And the cool thing is that now he is old enough to be able to interact with it If I switch it to manual MODE he can turn on the music himself He can also play with the crackling feet and feel the silky material Plus he has another friend to keep him company in his crib a big happy turtle with fish in his belly Thus far the straps haven t broken or cracked and I have removed it from the crib a couple of times Also the fish do swim around and the music does last for 15 minutes Its just a matter of which MODE you switch it to Reading the instructions really helps I strongly recommend this 
4 0 my son loves it I read some other reviews that were poor but I disagree My son loves this toy He smiles when he sees the turtle from across his room It plays music continually for 12 minutes So in the middle of the night when he wakes up I turn it on and he s asleep by the time it runs out We have moved it twice and the straps seemed sturdy However it is recommended that this toy be removed when the child is 5 months old or is able to get on hands and knees This completely contradicts the interactive play mode since the baby needs to be both physically and mentally developed to a stage beyond 5 months to reach all the buttons 
5 0 Love these bottles I tried several different bottles with my daughter and these have worked wonderfully for us We actually came across them when Walmart stopped carrying the Parent s Choice Anti Colic bottles we had been using which are similar in design These bottles really seem to decrease the amount of air my daughter takes in while she s feeding This is a blessing as she has had problems with gas since birth She also has reflux I can t tell you if the bottles are a major factor in her improvement in that area because she is now on meds However I have to think they ve helped a bit They are also comfy to hold for me I ve read a lot of reviews that talk about leaking I had this problem once and that was because I heated the bottle with the valve system in it So I learned to not do so and have not had a problem since They are a bit pricy but I believe that you get what you pay for Lastly I don t think that the small parts are difficult to wash Yes it s a bit more time consuming if you don t have a dish washer but for us it s been well worth the extra time 
5 0 We Love These Bottles We started with Dr Brown s when my daughter was just three weeks old she s now 10 months and have loved them from the very beginning We ve used them both for breastmilk and for formula and they ve been great for both We ve never had trouble with gas and have had very few spitting up episodes and I give all the credit to the bottles They re comfortable for me to hold light enough that even a young ish baby can hold them on their own and easy to fill The cleaning is a bit of a pain more parts than in other brands of bottles but it s worth it And we haven t found that Dr Brown s leaks any more than any other brand Definitely give these a try they re great 
4 0 Thin but does the job This is a thin sheet but it fits my full size Pack N Play bassinet perfectly I would recommend getting 2 of them because my son wets through it often 
5 0 Great sheet for playard bassinet I purchased this despite the reviews I read out of desperation But have been very happy with the fit on my Eddie Bauer Morgan Gingham playard bassinet It is a little thin however I use a Carter s mattress pad underneath anyway so I am not concerned with absorbancy It does the job as a nice surface to lay my son s head on and I purchased one more in Navy to switch out when it is laundry time 
5 0 Perfect I purchased these for my Pack N Play and they are soft and durable A real must have for pack n play owners 
5 0 Great find I have never seen any inflatable tubs quite like this and we are so pleased Our 8 month old daughter loves in the independence she can have in her own tub and we feel that she is much safer than in the big tub at this age We love how you can hang it up on the shower wall to dry Just make sure the suction cup is wet and it won t fall off the wall Sizewize it s basically a perfect fit in our tub which is slightly tapered from head to toe but I could see how it would be snug if you have a small rectangular tub 
4 0 Good product but a bit small for two When I saw the pictures I thought I could fit both kids They fit but with little room for two No room for play I will purchase another one Still a good product safe and sturdy and easy to clean 
5 0 Excellent Infant Tub I ve been searching for the perfect tub for my baby and I think I ve found it We ve been using a plastic reclined tub since he was born but he has clearly outgrown it I tried one of those seat tubs but he hated it and it seemed to scratch his legs TERRIBLE tub Thankfully I was able to return that one I found this one here on Amazon and reluctantly purchased it Glad I did It allows a lot more freedom for him to explore and play now that he can sit up unsupported Bath time has become much more fun for both mom baby UPDATE i first reviewed this after we purchased the item I ve been using it for just over 1 month now and one of the seams has already torn I don t think i ve used this item improperly to cause it to happen sooner than expected Unfortunately the patch kit piece that came with the tub is significantly too small to patch it up completely Very unfortunate because we loved the tub New rating 3 stars because of how quickly the seam tore 
5 0 Gets the job done It s kind of hard to get really excited about a changing pad it gets the job done it folds rather compactly I think it s well worth the money 
5 0 Contoured changing pad cover Love it Fits the pad beautifully and seems to get softer everytime you wash it 
4 0 the product is good but the color is drab I expected a sage or mint to come in the package when I ordered this since it was the vague green used for children but it is lacking I don t like bright colors so that is not where this is coming from but the color is just not right Kiwi is bette 
5 0 No problems I was a bit nervous about buying these covers after reading the negative reviews but I did it anyway and I m glad The covers are durable the color hasn t faded and it still fits perfectly over the changing pad I think they re soft enough for diaper changing I wouldn t put my baby to sleep on it but then who would 
5 0 Works great I bought this beacause I needed my gate to be just a little bit wider It attached very easily and was easy to install Also it is very hard to find in stores 
5 0 I AM SO HAPPY TO HAVE THIS LOVE IT This has been such a huge help with warming breastmilk formula and now baby food jars It heats the jars evenly and we have never had an issue with it I wish this was around 12 years ago when we had our first child I think that this is a very good investment especially when you yourself have used a microwave and found that it doesn t heat ANYTHING evenly 
4 0 works well Heats milk and food esecially when frozen I use a clean baby food jar to heat frozen baby food I ve made 
5 0 Nice Product After reading some of the reviews I felt compelled to share my experience with this product I love it I m not sure if they made a different model before but mine has an on off switch that works just fine its on the back Its not rocket science if you follow the directions I never have problems with the bottle floating If you put the bottle in first and then fill the warmer with water like the directions tell you to then the bottle won t float The warmer itself has a chart on it that tells you how long to leave the bottle in the warmer and at what setting It also has a light that flashes on and off when the warmer has reached a constant temperature There are no dings or timers but that hasn t presented any problems for me Overall this product does what it is supposed to do and it does it well As a first time mom I highly recommend it 
4 0 Like it don t use it much I thought a fold up tub was a great idea but we ve used this only maybe 10 times before my daughter turned 6 months the maximum age of use I paid only 10 so not much loss She objected the first time we tried it at about 2 weeks and so we went back to sponge baths for a while I would suggest gradually introducing your baby to the tub Toys helped distract her when she was a little older My daughter seemed too big for it even at 3 months though she was always 97 + in height weight To wash her backside you of course have to take her out of the tub I usually forgot to plug it before filling it and so usually had water all over the floor Instructions say tub is supposed to be supported by a sink it certainly doesn t fit in our oval bath sink Maybe it would fit a 2 part kitchen sink The folding feature did make it easy to store on our closet shelf For a little tub bath I liked it It was good for a quick bath or to really soak her but in the end I prefered a unhurried sponge bath on a waterproof pad on the bed which I think got my daughter cleaner 
5 0 Love this tub I have used many infant tubs and I love this one It folds so nicely I keep it in the kitchen pantry It fits in the sink and I keep the faucet running like a little shower and I can rinse her with fresh water I actually think the angle is great for an infant but with a newborn I use one of those yellow bear sponges in the tub for extra support but I use one with all the infant tubs I have used 
5 0 works great you don t need the whole kit only the loop and latch is needed if you use the plastic it gets really heavy and you end up holding it anyway you just loop the rubber bands to the connector and then attach the tubing this way you can use the softfit breastshield too 
5 0 must have for working mom This product works great You hook it to your medella bra with rubber bands and pump with hands free to do other things I am so glad a coworker told me about this product 
4 0 Low tech but does the job Well I felt a little silly paying about 20 with shipping for 2 pieces of plastic 2 bra hooks and some rubber bands However the kit does work and does allow you to pump hands free One word of caution if you use Medela s Quick Clean steam bags to clean your pump parts TAKE THE HANDS FREE PLASTIC SLEEVES OFF before throwing the bag in the microwave Otherwise they warp and don t fit right 
5 0 I Love This Gate This baby gate is great the top of my stairs both walls going in 2 different angles and i am so glad that i found this gate it works great and i havn t had any problams with it at all I installed it as soon as i got it and i didnt seem to have any problams installing it I have a 2 yr old and all moms and dads out there know how 2 yr olds can be at trying out new things it is a tall gate so he cant lean over it and fall all the bars on it are vertical so he cant climb it and the lock on it is easy to use but he cant unlock it The gate is made out of metal and is welded together so you dont have to worry about the bars coming out like you do with the wooden gates I highly recomend this gate for any room any doorway and its great at the top of the stairs 
5 0 a must have For all new and expecting mothers it s good to get a little help 
4 0 It s a good kit So far I haven t used much in this kit just because my son is only a month old and most the products are for older babies also we haven t run into issues to need it but I have used the nose aspirator and it s great It s soft and I don t fear hurting his nose I m very excited to use the rest of the products 
4 0 I got a different version but I bought the same brand but maybe an newer older version of this It didn t have the book or the decogestant that is only for the older children that others have mentioned However it DID have an Infant Tylenol equivelent which we have been lucky enough to not have had to try yet The gas drops are fantastic thank goodness we had these especially when we had to change his formula Anytime our son was fussy for no reason we tried these drops first and it stopped the fussiness almost every time The saline drops are great and the nose drops have really helped during his colds The aspirator works fine I ve never tried a different one so can t compare He didn t care about the teething toy and doesn t care for the taste of the teething gel but it seems to work It also has two cooling wipes which we haven t had to use no fevers yet Overall I was really glad to have this and to have all these things together in a nice case I slid right under his changing table no need to hunt for things in the middle of the night I d recommend this to all new moms 
5 0 Best System I have bought this set for a gift but also received it as a gift myself from my registry Although my daughter is two and a half now I would recommend the Playtex nursers to everyone They are sanitary and do cause less gas than conventional bottles I definitely like the Drop Ins liners better than the traditional ones from a convenience standpoint paired with the fact that they work so well with the breast milk storage system I m not planning on any more children but I don t dare part with these bottles yet They are stored in my basement for future use either my myself or family members They also helped make the transition from breast to bottle to sippy cup a breeze 
5 0 Easy for baby to latch on This is absolutely the best bottle on the market After working in daycare and as a nanny I had a preference for these Then after my sister had my nephew and used them I knew the minute I found out I was expecting that I would be using them too The reason that I love these bottles so much is that they are very easy for baby to latch onto Most other bottles use very small nipples whereas these use a nipple that is quite large more like a breast If you think about how a woman s body is made and really look at the nipples you will see what I mean Being able to latch on better allows them to eat better and have much less gas and spit up I also love how easy they are to warm up in a bottle warmer or crock pot Because they use the liner the milk can heat up much quicker than a standard bottle with thick plastic a very important thought at 3AM Some people think having to always by liners is costly an annoying But not really 100 eight ounce liners will cost about 8 and will last about 2 to 2 1 2 weeks So not as bad as you might think If this is truly an issue for you consider the Advent bottles They also have relatively large nipples But because they do not use a liner you cannot eliminate the air from the bottle and they take much longer to warm up 
5 0 The best you can get for moms who nurse I m the mother of a 3 1 2 month old baby girl I had intended to only breastfeed for the first year but it turned out that my daughter had a very difficult time at first with latching on So much so that she ended up taking in very little milk and her weight dropped nearly a whole pound from her birth weight in the first week The pediatrician told us we would have to supplement with formula to bring her weight up I chose the Premium Nurser bottles because they said they were good for switching between breast and bottle feeding My daughter took well to the bottles and even started latching on better when I did breast feed I m continuing to use formula along with breastfeeding with no nipple confusion problems whatsoever When people ask me if I breastfeed or bottlefeed my baby I say both and they tell me how lucky I am These bottles are a life saver They re easy to clean I use the top rack of the dishwasher and my baby hasn t had any problems with colic I like the convenience of the disposable bags too And my daughter is now starting to help hold on to the bottle while I feed her These are the best 
4 0 Great but not perfect I wish that it would zip up all the way The top is coming down all the time and I have to adjusted Maybe it s better for a two and up age child 
5 0 bundle me cozy This product was recently purchased for my 5 1 2 month old son s stroller by my mother in law I love it I had an older hand me down version for his infant carrier but the new ones are better I love the fact that the new version has velcro so you can easily move it from car seat to stroller or from one stroller to another I only wish it came in more colors color combinations 
4 0 Mostly Happy with the Product I have been using the Graco Snugride since my son was about 2 months old he s now five months old The seat and the base are both easy to install and the seat is easy to adjust and to carry As the product name suggests my son fits snugly and comfortably into the seat The only problem that I have is with the process for adjusting the harness The buckles to do so are at the back of the seat and do not allow the harness straps to move easily I have found that I have to get behind the seat and really work at the straps and the buckles to adjust the seat properly which is difficult to do if the seat and baby are already in the car Apart from that the seat provides good value for the price 
5 0 Pleased We got this seat in a different color for our first baby We feel very secure with it Easy to install and a little hint they try to get you to buy the second base for the snugride if you have two cars you don t need it you can fasten the seat without the base the directions for it are on the seat I like that we can move the canopy to wherever the sun is to directly block it and that it s transportable to our stroller bough seperatly It comes with a head brace whatever those things are called to cradle the head Those never do anything and are pretty useless but the seat itself is great 
5 0 Octo tastic My wife and I yep a guy reviewing a kids toy bought this as a present for our 7 month old niece She is absolutely hooked on it Having a relatively short attention span with most toys it was rewarding to see how much she likes it and how long it entertains her Just squeezing the musical tentacles for her keeps her happy The big doe eyes have her mesmerized as well When she gets bored learning to play tunes keeps the adults happy Playing is easy you get two color coded tunes on the label and with the help of a musical friend we know a lot more now With my wife 4 months pregnant we have ordered another already Only reason for 4 stars is the one we bought had trouble playing the lowest note red tentacle 
4 0 Great Booster I did a lot of online and store researching before I bought this seat for my 3 1 2 year old son My one concern was that my son is very slim and all the reviews talked about how the seat worked well for larger children Well now I can say it works well for slim ones as well He loves the arm rests and the cup holder It is light weight and so easy to move and fold when necessary We liked it so much we are going to buy another one for when our 2 year son son is ready for that transition 
5 0 I love this booster My husband and I bought a second one after having had the first one for a little while for my 6 year old son He liked it so much that we bought another one for my almost 4 year old The seat is incredibly easy to clean which is wonderful as the boys snack in the car a lot and it s also so easy to fold and throw in the back of the car when we aren t using it Both boys feel very comfortable in it and seem to not mind riding in it for long periods of time 
5 0 I love this product That s just it I love this product and I am so happy that we purchased it It saves time and space and is very safe for my children We bought 2 one for each of my children and they have been wonderful 
5 0 love it I was told to get the diaper genie from many people but liked the looks and reviews of the diaper dekor so decided to put it on my registry I am so glad I did I have only had to empty it about every 6 7days and it is simple and odor free Even when full there is no odor I didnt need to put in a refill for 3months the refills look pricey till you realize how long each one lasts in comparison its cheaper I would recommend this to anyone 
5 0 The Best Diaper Pail on the Market The Diaper Dekor is the best diaper pail on the market It s easy to operate and stays odor free To get rid of a dirty diaper just step on the foot pedal and drop the diaper in the pail Completely hands free You don t have to worry about twisting anything like you do with the Diaper Genie When the pail is full just pull out the bag cut it loose on the door mounted blade and tie a knot in the top Then just tie a knot in the liner that remains in the pail and you re all set for the next batch of dirty diapers The continuous liner concept is genius I ve been using the Diaper Dekor since my daughter s birth and I m still on the same refill that came with the pail I did however stock up on refills for the future by adding them to my baby registry 
5 0 I LOVE this car seat and it works great in our car I did plenty of research for a car seat for my firstborn and the Snugfit got the best safety reviews And we just loved the pring perfect for a boy or a girl I had heard how hard car seats were to install in the car but it was a BREEZE I had it installed in the backseat within five minutes My car has the LATCH system and it has worked great My daughter loves being in her car seat and I have always felt perfectly safe with her in it I was surprised to read the other reviews since I have never experienced a single one of those issues with my car seat I would highly recommend this seat to any parent 
4 0 Definitely helps I got this toy when my baby was 7 months old and he s now 8 1 2 months old We ve used it for lots of local driving and a roundtrip from Los Angeles to Phoenix 7+ hours each way It doesn t work miracles but it does definitely help calm and distract my baby when he starts to fuss about 70 80 of the time And I think it s more effective now than it was when we first got it maybe because the baby has started to look forward to it It might help that I only use it when he starts to fuss I haven t had any problems with the toy working and the volume dial is a nice feature It does have its shortcomings though like some of the other reviewers pointed out It only stays on for about 15 minutes presumably to save batteries so pretty much every time I put the baby in his carseat I push the button to turn it on just in case we need it during the drive It sometimes moves out of place which can affect being able to see the baby in the mirror but it still works to distract him It plays 5 or 6 songs in random order but they are all extremely short so it ends up being very repetitive Overall I think it s a useful tool for calming the baby during car trips and when it doesn t work it s generally because my baby is so tired or hungry that I don t think anything would really help except getting him out of the car And even though the repetitive songs can get annoying it s far better than hearing a baby screaming while everyone is trapped in the car together 
4 0 Great set I bought this set for use with my second child It helps to have more bottles around when she needed to go to daycare and I needed to pump I use the bottles and different nipples to feed her and then use the bottles from this set to pump with She did not take to the nipples that came with this set but they are very nice and if she had it would have been perfect The bottle hold 6 oz so once your baby is taking more than 6 oz you would not be able to use them to feed with Overall I am so happy with the Medela bottles and pump 
4 0 A good choice for 2 sided protection after a comparison with 3 other bed rails Due to the room layout I needed a double bed rail that would protect both sides of the bed We don t live near a store that has a lot of choices and after reading many online product descriptions decided that we were going to need to look at several of these in person and then decide which one best fit our needs So we purchased 4 brands of bed rails After looking at the more detailed information on the box and trying two of them out we decided to keep the Safe and Secure Double Bedrail by the First Years To help others I have attached two customer s photos to this product description These photos are sketches and photos from the side of the box that better describe the bed rail Why amazon Target can t get a least as much information on their website than is on the side of the box is frustrating to me But that seems to happen many times This bedrail took about 30 minutes to assemble the side panels and another 45 minutes to fully assemble the unit to the bed This is in line with the time that the other model we tried out took The reasons why we liked this bed rail the best are as follows 1 It is a double bed rail and is designed to protect both sides of the bed 2 This was the only model we looked at where both sides folded down making mattress pad and sheet changes feasible 3 The quality of the construction especially of the spring loaded Locking Pins was much better than that of the Sleeptite bed rail we looked at from Regalo and One Step Ahead which is also made by Regalo 4 The design made more sense than the Regalo The installation was more straightforward Possible issues with this bed rail are as follows 1 It is only 17 high so measure your mattress and make sure that it will fit In our case our mattress was not a pillowtop and is about 10 11 high depending on where you measure it So we were still satisfied with the height of the rail above our mattress But I could see where if you had a tall mattress this would be an issue 2 This was the easiest rail to pull up to unlock and fold down Others had more substantial locking mechanisms I could see where a toddler who watched you do this could then do it himself So we are planning on not doing this in front of our toddler only during sheet changes Only you know how inquisitive your own child is about these things and how much of a problem this would be Despite these two issues we decided that the good points outweighed the bad and that this bedrail was the best choice for us However if we are later disappointed with this bed rail I will go and update our review 
5 0 Love it This is a good quality item for the money I LOVE that the rails fold down so it is easy to make up the bed and change the sheets I just bought a second one for grandma s house 
4 0 Not the best design but ok and look great I just bought these and my daughter looks adorable The first time I put them on she got a little fussy until she realized she could see through them The shades come with two straps one small and one large My daughter is four months old and the smaller strap barely fits but the larger one is still a little big The velcro on either side of the smaller strap is just barely attached and fits comfortably only if around the bottom of her head In this position her ears are a little pushed down but as the strap is soft it s not a big deal If straight around her head the shades are too tight and squish the area around her eyes Even if adjusted as small as possible the large strap is still a little too big It should fit in another month I think 
5 0 The Perfect Blanket I own this blanket and just bought another I brought this blanket to my playgroup at the park It was perfect on the damp grass and big enough for me my daughter and all of our stuff A few of the other moms liked it so much they bought it too My baby spits up quite a bit especially during tummy time so I decided to buy another one to use in the house It cleans so easily with a baby wipe or a damp cloth Great investment 
5 0 Perfect for Kids Adults I purchased this wonderful blanket for my baby My plan was to carry it along with me whenever I would visit family and friends at their homes I could then lay my baby down or interact with my child on a clean surface The blanket is 16 0 x 4 0 x 11 0 inches which will accommodate adults well I was pleased when I received the blanket to have discovered the excellent craftsmanship that was put into the creation of the piece The quality is absolutely top notch The surface material also seems like it could be easily cleaned if a spill should occur The only slight con I have of the Essentials blanket is that it is a bit on the heavy side This is only a negative if one is expecting to carry it for a long period of time Otherwise I adore this blanket and highly recommend it 
4 0 Best we ve had This is our third baby monitor The first two had static if you would plug anything into the same outlet or get them near other electronic devices This one has worked flawlessly in our home w zero static The talkback feature is also wonderful for a three year old Go back to sleep I ll get you juice in the morning etc Not having to get up and go to the child s room is a real feature The only reason I gave it four stars is because it only has two channels and because the signals aren t encrypted Anyone else with an FM receiver can pick up your conversations but most monitors are this way We took the monitor to a friend s house and it picked up a lot of static interference from something in the house Video monitor TV I don t know Since it only had two channels we were not able to find a clear channel Overall thoughts Best monitor I ve had Stay away from the Fisherprice models I would buy again unless I was in an apartment complex I wouldn t want other people listening in and I would be prepared to take it back if I needed more channels 
5 0 Great bang for the buck I was debating between this analog model and digital models I have never heard the digital models to be honest But this analog model has been great I can hear minor changes in my daughters breathing and talk to her over it to buy time when I am busy and can t get to her immediately I have had none of the problems with noise and interference some have complained about If your family is on a tight budget like mine this is in the best bang for the buck out there today 
5 0 Excellent I have used several monitors in the past 7 years and chose this one due to the walkie talkie feature It works well and has a great range The vibration is a nice feature so that you can turn down the sound when you have company and are having a conversation no one else has to hear your little ones settling down for their sleep 
5 0 AWESOME 100 RECOMMENDED My baby and I just LOVE IT It is so easy to bath her now and SO MUCH FUN I started bathing her everyday in this bathtub and it is just awesome She plays with her toys and has tons of fun The side where her head rests is lifted so she can safely lay down and relax After her bath I just empty the tub and hang it in a knob in our bathroom until the next day I really recommend it it is super practical Please never leave your baby unattended 
5 0 Helps them sleep through the night I love this product I have 5 month old twins that were born 6 weeks early I swaddled them in receiving blankets when they came home from the NICU and they loved sleeping that way I stopped swaddling them at 2 months because I could see they no longer liked it My night nurse told me to continue to swaddle them at night for up to a year She said it would help them sleep through the night I bought this product and while my girl and boy twins didn t like it at first they do go to sleep faster and stay asleep longer when they are wearing them Not long after I started using this product my son slept from 7 to 7 What a dream He is getting better at getting at least one arm out but even when he does he still sleeps better then when he is not swaddled at all I have found that it works better when I put them in it when they are drowsy because then they don t lay in their crib trying to get out of it before they fall asleep We don t use them during the day now I will always give this as a baby gift going forward 
5 0 Taking the pain out of frequent flying with toddler in tow As very frequent often long distance travelers we routinely purchase airline tickets for our daughter so that she can travel safely and comfortably in her car seat on plane trips We really pushed the size limits of the car seat that integrated into a stroller the Graco travel system for ease of use but once she had finally made the dreaded transition into a larger seat we tried practically every method for moving the seat toddler diaper bag collapsible stroller carry on etc from our home to and through the airport without ending up completely exhausted and frustrated Of all of the options that we tried the Pac Back was the most consistently comfortable and convenient I m not very tall 5 5 and find that I can manage to wear the Pac Back stow loose and light objects such as coats or stuffed animals in the car seat itself sling a diaper bag over one shoulder and a purse on the other and still have enough mobility agility to bend down and pick my daughter up or hold her hand Granted I look like a Pac Animal but that s a small price to pay for having free hands at key moments The strap system is intuitive to use and seems well constructed Compared to a car seat bag the Pac Back is much more easily removed from the car seat once on the plane and I have never had any trouble replacing the straps in a minute or two plenty of time to have the seat on my back by the time people start exiting the plane The straps adjust easily enough that my taller husband and I can take turns carrying the seat when we travel together without spending a lot of time situating ourselves The only drawbacks you really have to pay attention while wearing what amounts to a giant rigid backpack that you don t bash someone or something while turning and the straps may have to be removed to go through security IF the x ray machine has an extremely small opening only happened once or twice at regional airports Overall an amazingly simple but incredibly helpful product 
5 0 Great Toy We have had this puzzle toy since my son was one He s 3 now It has provided hours of entertainment and education We started by just showing him a few choices and matching now he can easily do the whole box himself and enjoys it I like the textures vibrant colors and nice large sturdy pieces The nice sturdy box to hold them is great too 
5 0 Worth Its Weight In Gold When my daughter was born I didn t know about swaddling and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep then put her in her crib and she d flail her arms wake up and cry and I had to start all over What a nightmare Then I figured out that since her arms wake her it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn t move them as much so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets It worked It became much easier to get her to sleep But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again When she was a little over a month old somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it It worked great It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it and it stayed put My daughter started sleeping so much better I wish I found those blankets sooner it would ve saved me from so many sleepless nights 2 years later my son was born and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket Out of curiosity I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket and his arms wake him right away exactly the same as my daughter I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep 
5 0 A Nice Shower Gift The mom who received this gift was very pleased with it 
5 0 Must Have for All New Parents I love this Item It was a life saver At around 4 6 weeks my baby would only sleep if held or laying on his side next to me after breastfeeding Since it s impossible to hold a baby all night and laying next to me on his side was a No No for SIDS I was looking for something that could help me get him to sleep in his bassinet on his back as is suggested to prevent SIDS I had tried swaddling my baby in blankets but after a few weeks he had figured out how to get out of it I also didn t like that he could undo the blanket and it was loose around his face another no no for SIDS So I bought these swaddle Me blankets that fasten easily with velcro And shortly after we started using the Swaddle me s he started sleeping through the night occasionally waking up for a 15 minute feeding which I keep him swaddled for and then he falls right back to sleep and I carefully pick him up and put him back in the bassinett for the rest of the night He s 4 months old now and we re still using them Buy a few because if we wets himself which boys do a lot you ll need another one to switch him into 
5 0 How we got her to sleep through the night We love the swaddle me blankets We have the flannel and the fleece This has helped us with getting our daughter to sleep through the night in just two weeks of using them She loves to be swaddled but is very strong and would wiggle out and then wake up and need to be swaddled again With the velcro she is less able to get out of the swaddle and feels safe and secure and sleeps longer The fleece has a little more stretch to it and is easier to use but the flannel is a little lighter weight for the summer so not to overheat Have not tried the cotton ones Definitely worth a try 
5 0 Finally a gate that works HI this is the 5th gate we have had on the top of our stairs Some were difficult to open when you are also holding a child Some were so noisy you could never slip down stairs while baby was sleeping and others simply felt like a strong sneeze would topple them over This one is great I love the fact that the lock is difficult enough that a 4 year has trouble but not difficult enough that grandma has trouble 
5 0 Thank you Protect a Bub I love this shade I am the mother of 2 girls Alice 7 and Samantha 22 months I never had anything like this for my oldest It makes such a difference The little one won t go out without it Even though I always used Sunblock on Alice her skin is still so much darker than Samantha s I really believe it is because of the shade I looked into a lot of other brands before choosing this one and I think it is the best one on the market The others are made from Nylon Lycra and I don t think that would hold up as well as this one does Thank you Protect a bub 
5 0 Best Baby Gym We looked at a lot of different baby gyms and this is by far the best we ve found I love that the arcs are easy to put up and take down it stores flat and that you can add as many toys as you want Our baby has really enjoyed it There is plenty of room to roll around and we can set baby in at all different angles so it can be like a new toy every time 
5 0 Many Months of Great Use My little guy loved this from the start This is a versatile toy that lasted many months The mat is machine washable so it became our take along for travel The hanging toys are on rings that detach so you can rearrange them for variety and take them anywhere such as on the car seat or stroller as baby grows He s now 2 yrs and the mat is still a wall hanging in his room This was a great investment 
4 0 good carrier I love this carrier I bought it in Feb 2007 My daughter loves it too She can sleep very well in it The only problem is it can only hold up to 22lb while mine is already 17lb she is only 3 months I guess I don t have too much time to use it If this company could develop a one which suits for big baby I will definitely buy it ji 
5 0 A must have I definately recommend this product I used it every day for my baby for the first 9 months Great both indoors and outdoors 
5 0 Pricey but worth it I had no idea that the Bjorn was so expensive since I got it as a gift at my Baby Shower But knowing what I know now Id definately spend the cash since its been such a blessing to have it My baby had reflux really bad when she was born and alot of the times the only way to help her feel comfortable was to have her in the Bjorn facing me so that she could fall asleep She needed to be upright or inclined to help her not to spit up so much Being that it was so used Im super glad that its easy to put on and take off The durability of it is awesome also and I still dont see any wear and tear on it after almost daily use Now that my baby is getting older I switch her forward and she loves that She can see everything and grab at whatever is in front of her The ease of the clips is a godsend so that I can clip her in quickly and without the need for someone to assist me I tried some other carriers but all the straps and clips were so confusing Plus alot of the others arent reversible You can only have your baby face inwards This is totally worth the money guys 
4 0 Very Versatile This is my second superyard The first one I bought many years ago when the superyard was made with protruding metal hinges which were somewhat hazardous and invited mouthing by little teethers Aside from being a little stiff to fold which might be because it is new this model is a vast improvment over the old It s a couple of inches taller and seems sturdier Great for blocking off the Christmas tree or any other part of the house Cruising babies love to go round and round the inside and you can hang a busy box or other toys on the side to amuse a crawling baby During football season my friends and I take our superyards to tailgate and join them together to make a super superyard so all the toddlers can safely play together It s easy to clean using the pressure nozzle on the hose outdoors Minor drawback is that it can be scooted across the floor or climbed out of by a determined toddler Do I really need to say that any play yard should always be used only under adult supervision Final comment one of the most useful pieces of child care equipment I ve ever owned The only reason I gave it 4 stars insteat of 5 is because my experiences with North States customer service has been poor 
5 0 Great Buy The Superyard was a fantastic buy for us consider that it has allowed us time to have dinner together in a marginal civilized fashion Our 9 months old loves to play in it specially since she can see us through it You can hook a bunch of toys to it to keep your child entertained 
5 0 Hallejuah Uninterrupted Gardening This play yard is the greatest thing to happen to new mothers espicially ones that garden since the invention of disposable diapers I bought two and an extension panel which make for an ample size playpen Inside I put a Little Tikes climber a Step One ladybug sandbox filled with pea gravel and a Playskool Grow With Me picnic table and he still has plenty of room to romp I can garden without having to pull him out of the fish pond or retrieve him from a newly planted bed of tulips 
4 0 It s good These work really well but be sure to get a couple of the magnets because we lost our first one and then we were all hosed for a while 
4 0 Evenflow Stair guard I will say up front that I use the gate at the bottom of the stairs and not at the top as the product suggests The gate is built well simple and functional It has the optional ability to restrict the direction of movment and the hinges give a great angle of movment and detach easily It went up easy and works as designed It is just a tiny bit awkward to reach for the latch to release and pull back the gate but this is a very minor issue In a similar vien you have to line up the bottom rail at the same time you line up the top rail in order to close My guess is that it would be less awkward if used at the top of the stairs as recommended Overall I would recommend the gate for both locations on the stairs 
4 0 Evenflo Top of Stairs Gate The gate works perfectly However it doesn t get 5 stars because the installation instructions are not very intuitive I am very handy with tools remodeling etc and I found the installation to take longer than I would have expected The latch receptacles are different sizes and the smaller one goes at the top There was a U stamped in it but no mention of that in the instructions Nor did the instructions mention the size difference and that the bigger one goes on the bottom How hard would that be One sentence I went through a dry run and figured it all out but it doubled the installation time took + 1 hour 
5 0 THE BEST HEARTH GUARD I have been canvasing the internet for some type of guard to cover the hearth in our family room I have read countless reviews of the double faced tape foam pads that come off right away with little effort This product attached exactly as described I had the unit installed as well as the pads measured cut and installed in 10 minutes The taupe color is very discrete on our cream red black brick fireplace I can t see how my three little ones would ever get this off even if they tried Great product and gives me the feeling of comfort that if someone falls and hits there head that the chance of sticthes has been greatly reduced An absolute must for your hearth 
5 0 Great time to get back in shape I love this stroller and tell all of my friends about it Our daughter was about 3 months old when I purchased it There was not a better rated stroller available when I researched and there still is not You can run walk or rollerblade behind this stroller and feel confident that your child is safe Lilyana is now 4 1 2 months and loves going for our daily walks and occasional rollerblading She is a fussy girl only when it comes to being strapped down in the carseat but loves the comfort and hammock like feel of BOB We live in Florida and with the sun guard canopy she is well covered Some other factors which made we chose BOB The braking mechanism which is hard to find has a wrist strap which if you should fall locks the back wheels unlike most strollers on the market This feature is great for rollerbladers 5 point safety harness 70 pound weight limit highest that I found Metal frame others have more plastic that metal Shock absorbers great of rocking bouncing her to sleep Swivel front wheel which locks with a simple pin Simple Lily likes it and we tried several others all that Babies R Us has in stock The cost is pretty high but would you put a price on the safety of your child if you were to fall while exercising Thanks for hearing me out 
4 0 This swing is a hit with our baby girl We bought this swing for our 11 month old daughter and she loves it We attached it to our back porch easily enough and she swings in it every day We ve had it for about a month and it is still her favorite toy The only issue that we have had is that it hangs slightly crooked because of the way that they put the hooks on the swing at the factory The aren t both facing the same direction which is something that we cant fix but it isn t bad enough to not use the swing or to cause any problems Its more irritating than anything Also the swing seems secure and safe We ve not had any issues with safety or even any close calls 
5 0 infant toddler swing I love my fisher price infant toddler swing I have two of them for my twin boys They love it and I know it is safe Also is it easy to get them in and out of lynne Ambros 
5 0 Great product Time saver and cheaper than Advent This is a great sterilizer it s chamber is big enough to holder 4 to 5 bottles wide neck bottles and the tray can hold quite a few nipples and cap rings I bought it when my son was born and after a year I m still using it It works great saves time and has an auto shut off function when the steaming cycle is complete 
4 0 Love this item My daughter is just learning how to self feed and these placemats are great I ve always been weary of those restaurant tables and how clean the cloths they use to wipe them are This product solves that problem The only reason I didn t give it 5 stars is because sometimes the corner does come off However I do NOT find this to be a major problem Also I tried the tip from other moms who fold the bottom half over the edge of the table Great tip Thanks This is a great product for kids learning to eat 
5 0 in praise of bouncy seats Now that I ve caved to the power of pink it only took three girls for me to finally give in this turns out to be very cute and was the second cheapest I could find Quality seems fine two weeks post purchase and who doesn t love a tool that keeps the kiddo safe and calm while one does dishes or makes dinner for the rest of the brood For the first babe we were given a different seat that aimed to be an improvement over the classic and very simple bouncy seat but had so many functions it was basically useless This is a case though where the basics are the best In looking around for a new one saw many for 100 if you can stomach the not as posh aesthetic this seems like a great value for a seat that will only used for a few months anyway 
5 0 We love these mats We have gone through a few packages of the Table Toppers and we love them Our toddler went from trying to peel them off the table to helping us stick them down she loves to pull the paper strips off the adhesive and she doesn t try to pull the mat off the table until she is finished eating We finally found the Shopper Toppers at Toys R Us and I was so excited I bought two packages and they don t work worth anything The adhesive on those is down the sides not across the top where it should be to stick on the shopping cart handle In fact we ve decided that the Table Toppers will work better on the shopping cart than the ones made for the shopping cart Also with only a Shopper Topper in our bag while out for lunch recently we used it on the table and it worked just as well at the ones made for the table Well done 
5 0 Great product a must for eating out We have been using these ever since our baby could feed herself and she s almost 2 now We keep them in the trunk of the car along with a box of pocket bibsters Whenever we eat out at a restaurant we stick this down at our toddler s place She sits in her chair and eats with us and if any food spills off of her plate it spills onto this nice clean mat The mat also has entertainment value as she can name the items on it After she s made her mess we just peel the mat off wad it up and throw it away 
4 0 Kept Baby Snuggled and Safe I loved this product My baby slept in it until she was able to turn over She resisted swaddling and this was a good way for us to keep her feeling secure in the crib I agree with the other reviewer that you must be careful particularly with tiny babies to position the velcro sides correctly so baby will not wiggle down 
5 0 Great warmer for cloth wipes This is a great wipes warmer for use with cloth wipes if you are cloth diapering The wipes are nice and warm and don t dry out I have seen no rust like one of the other reviews said Nightlight is also very nice and gives just enough light to see in the middle of the night I change out the wipes every 3 4 days and have had no problems with mildew 
5 0 Great Mobile This mobile is amazing From the time she was 6 weeks old my daughter was mesmerized by the motion and the music She loves watching the animals and can be left in her crib for up to 45 minutes simply glued to the mobile Although it can be noisy it doesn t seem to bother her and she often falls asleep at night to the sights and sounds A MUST for any nursery 
5 0 definitely worth it Its a little hard to adjust but its definitely worth it We ve used it on our double jogging stroller as well as our double umbrella stroller Folds away easily and doesn t take up a lot of space I also love the pockets on the sides where I can store my keys phone water bottle etc 
5 0 It Works Used this for Double stroller while on vacation in Hershey Park fantastic Easy to put on easy to store I don t know why strollers especially doubles have such dinky canopies anyway But this did it s duty 
5 0 Great storage bin I bought this item a year ago and so far it is still in great shape We use it to hold all my little girl s stuffed animals and she has alot of them On occasions we do include her heavy toys no problem at all We live in an apt and it helps having a storage bin that doesn t take up too much space but big enough to store away toys 
4 0 nice little table This is a very cute table perfect for my 2 kids They like having picnics outside sitting at their table that is just the right size for them As far as assembly my husband put it together rather quickly and it is very sturdy I am pleased with my purchase 
5 0 My son loves this table We just bought this for our 3 yr old and he does everything on it It is very durable and also light weight so we can move it around easily This table will last well through our second son as well 
5 0 sturdy n worth every penny Well made and well priced Your kid will find a million and 1 uses for it more than you dreamed of as you loaded it into your cart Buy buy bu 
4 0 Play Table Play Table is sturdy and colorful and my grandson 18 months loves it It is good for small children better than just table and chairs which tend to tip over I wish it were a little bigger but it will fit 4 smalls or 2 larger children nicely 
5 0 A must for moms The bundleme is a must for any mom It works so well It really does eliminate the need for coats or even jackets The first time I used it I thought my daughter might get a little chilly on the top half so I put a jacket on her As soon as I was indoors and took her out of the bundleme I saw that she was too warm She was actually sweating Ever since then I use it without anything else and she stays very warm and cozy We have lots of snow and cold winters where I live and the bundleme original was perfect No more fussing with a blanket that gets kicked off the moment your baby is in the back seat of the car The top piece also has the option to zip all the way off so if it s the only part that needs washed you don t have to take the straps out of the bottom piece You can also unzip both sides to keep from over heating your baby if you ll be indoors for a short period of time I think that every mom should have one and I would definitely buy one again 
5 0 A Must Have for Winter Babies Don t bother with bulky snowsuits This makes it so easy for us to get out of the house with baby We live in the north east so it is a life saver Yummy snuggly 
5 0 Awesome product I had this for my daughter when she fit into the baby carrier car seat It was awesome I never had to worry about blankets falling off or if she was warm enough They did tell me at the hospital however that if you put anything between your baby and the car seat it voids the warranty on the car seat This goes underneath them so it probably does but I figured it was probably safer than putting a blanket over her anyway 
4 0 Adorable but a little uncomfortable I got this hat because it matched the JJ Cole Bundle Me blanket for my son s car seat He looks absolutely adorable in it but he hates wearing it unfortunately The elastic is a little bit tight and it smooshes his whole forehead down Overall if your baby is a hat wearer and this fits him her then it s wonderful It s warm soft and is made very well 
5 0 Cute Topper FINALLY I am a stickler for matching things with my other kids i used the urban bundle me and the original bundler but I LOVE having the matching hat for my December baby I know she s warm 
5 0 diaper depot just as described It is still waiting for the baby to arrive so I haven t used it yet but I do love the utility and design of it 
4 0 Son loves it My son loves this mobile it is a bit quiet but still keeps his attention and he loves to watch the leaves and animals move around 
5 0 By far BEST ON THE MARKET I am a mom of three kids and this is by far the best Pack n Play on the market When 3 came along we needed to purchase a new Pack n Play The Graco Pack N Play with bug toys is absolutely the best we ve ever owned The bright colors and cute toys make it a fun environment for our 8 month old She has loved the bright play mat since about 6 months but now that she is sitting up she enjoys looking in the mirror and pulling on the rattle butterfly wings She actually gets excited about playing in her Pack N Play and mom can get dinner cooked without interruption And best of all it is so much bigger than the other Pack N Plays There is plenty of room for her to play without rolling over the top of her toys The set up and take down is super easy all four sides break down very easily and it folds nicely without any hassle I am also a fan of the much thicker play mat that fits into the floor of the Pack N Play I never worried about her hurting herself if she plopped over when first learning to sit up Overall I can t say enough WONDERFUL things about this product I d put it on the new parent s must have list for sure 
5 0 Nice size play pen I had a hard time finding a play pen for my Grand daughter There are many Pack N Play items but I wanted a larger square playpen like they made years ago This one was exactly what I wanted She has room to roll around and play with toys and it s easy to set up and take down 
5 0 P E R F E C T We bought this stroller for my daughters 4 5 years 38 pounds 42 inches and 2 years 26 pounds We were in the market for a new stroller because one of the wheels on our old double stroller had broken off twice and was about to break off again I was looking for a stroller that wouldn t make my older daughter feel like a baby but gave her the option of sitting during long trips to the mall zoo park etc This stroller was the answer The front seat is perfect for our little one The tray swings open and comes completely off if needed to get her in and out easily I was able to unhook some of the belts and stuff them behind the cushion of her seat because I didn t think a 5 point harness was necessary The tray is large and sturdy as is the foot rest My older daughter is technically taller than the guidelines but we have absolutely no problem because of it She walks with us and then easily climbs onto her seat when she wants to take a break The parent tray is great and something I really missed on our last double stroller We can store keys snacks cellphone etc plus two cups bottles The basket underneath is a good size and very easy to access The side of the basket is elastic and pulls down nicely and even unsnaps if need be The stroller folds and unfolds extremely easily It takes very little room to store The steering is fantastic and it requires very little effort to push The stroller also comes with a contraption to fit an infant carrier for families with a newborn infant The price is fantastic too You can t beat 120 for a double stroller like this I wish we had bought this a year ago 
5 0 Great Stroller Love it This product is great It is a little hard to turn when both kids are in it But I found if you hold it on the outside of the cup holders instead of on the hand grips turning is easier Makes my life a lot easier with my 1 and 3 year old 
5 0 WONDERFUL I have no idea how our parents had us with out these They are the best invention My son likes to play with plates so I can feed him anything he wants on the table directly with out worrying about what else he may be eating I have a toddler and a 9 mo old NEITHER of them have been able to remove these things And beleive me they ve tried So I dont know what that other review was talking about They re inexpensive easy to use and clean 
5 0 CRYSTAL CLEAR WITH NO INTERRUPTION I BOUGHT THIS MONITOR SO I CAN HEAR WHAT GOES ON IN MY SONS ROOM WHO IS UPSTAIRS I HAVE CRYSTAL CLEAR RECEPTION AND I ALSO HAVE ANOTHER MONITOR IN THE HOUSE FOR ANOTHER ROOM AND THEY NEVER GET INTERRUPTED IT IS EXTREMLY SENSITIVE EVERY BREATH IS HEARD AWESOME MONITOR NO PROBLEMS YET SO FAR 
5 0 Great Product I recently purchased this monitor when my old Fisher Price 49 MHz Sounds n Lights monitor stopped working in one of my twins room after only a year I could hear my next door neighbor but not my baby upstairs I figured this one has many channels to choose from so the chances of that happening where slim Well It works and I enjoy this monitor so much better that I am considering replacing my other Fisher Price one With this monitor I do not hear any noise from it unless my child is making noise My other one makes a low static sound all the time it is not bother some but I can still hear it I would highly recommend this model The price is great and I have not tried the rechargeable batteries yet but it is nice to know that I can take it off charge at any time and not have to worry about finding new batteries A great find a great buy a great product 
5 0 Not recalled love this set I love this key and cell phone set so much I m buying another one for a friend I looked into the the recall and found that these keys were not part of the recall My 3 year old loves the recording feature on the cell phone Actually even my older kids think it s pretty neat Great product great price 
5 0 Great for car We bought this for our son now two and he grabs his keys and phone whenever we are going in the car It gives him something to play with and they aren t too noisy for long trips 
5 0 A MUST HAVE FOR NEWBORNS My husband and I just had a wonderful baby girl Apr 9 2007 and I simply could NOT live without this item My daughter loves sleeping in it It is light therefore it can be easily moved from one room to another as needed You could easily travel with it from hotels to the Grandparents house It can be folded compactly and easily stored and there is also a handle for carrying The light at the top is excellent for those who wish to co sleep as well Obviously do not leave your child unsupervised in it It is excellent and I highly recommend it to ALL parents 
5 0 I couldn t live without it This is the single best new baby item that I purchased I was a mom who swore that my baby will never sleep in my bed Needless to say that didn t last 3 nights I got this co sleeper and it was just perfect Felt much more secure with him in there Very portable too I took it everywhere for the first three months 
5 0 perfect for the first 2 months like many new parents I had lots of plans including my newborn sleeping by himself in a charming bassinet and later a crib WELL upon his arrival my son showed us that he slept better between my husband and I for the first 6 weeks plus he helped my husband and I sleep better not having to get up at every new and strange sound he made for a new parent all the sounds are scary we just lifted our heads and knew he was fine and went back to sleep Yes it was a bit tight in a queen size bed but most importantly he was safe and we did not have to get up We used in bed until 6 weeks old and then used it to transition him to his crib for the next 2 weeks overall well worth it plus easy to transport if need to spend the night at someone elses house during the first 2 3 months 
4 0 Great for Convertible car seats This is great for keeping the sun out of my baby s eyes from all angles And those on window shades always fall off and are annoying when you want to roll the window down This does the job just fine Highly recommend it 
4 0 Fun to Play Potty My boys spend more time trying to play with this potty then trying to use it It s fun and it s a miniature size adult potty They love it The seat is a little on the smaller side so one of my two year olds is outgrowing it already but we are making it work We have had other potties where the seat is a little bigger 
5 0 My daughter loved it She really enjoyed tummy time on this mat loves watching the fish and has toys that she can reach and grab 
5 0 I like it This gate is easy to install and simple to operate once you get the hang of how it works My son is one and half years old and has a tendency to rush gates he s broken two already and so far this one s holding up I would not recommend anyone use it at the top of stairs because it doesn t have an installation kit but for hallways and at the bottom of the stairs it works really well It swings closed on its own and is pretty loud if you let it slam shut we use ours in the kitchen so it doesn t wake the babies up however if you were to use it in a hallway near where your kids are sleeping it might be loud enough to disturb their sleep All in all it s a really good deal and I would highly recommend this product 
5 0 The GATE for Mom s who don t have enough hands I love this gate one because of the height It is high enough to even keep my three year old out of trouble I also like that I can operate the Gate with only one hand That is great because like other Mom s my hands are often busy with something else I would and have reccommended this product to anyone who is looking for a gate 
5 0 Very versatile once you know it s many uses I purchased this sling from ebay for 8 and expected to use it to carry my newborn with one arm free and then be done with it we did just that It has been sitting in my get rid of pile now for 8 months and then SURPRISE today I found a website that shows you how to get so much more out of this product and after reading the instructions on the site and SEEING photos of how to do it I now COMFORTABLY have my son HANDS FREE in the sling with a hip straddle position and he is totally secure I am petite and this is one size fits all you CAN pull the sling through the rings more than just the tail to make it tighter If you have problems with the baby being secure you just need to pull up the material high on the back theirs and yours AND tuck it between their legs too see the site for photos to better understand I am now VERY impressed with this product a little knowledge goes a long way The site is polarbearcreations dot com slash pages slash howtouse dot php once you see how to use this product correctly you WILL LOVE IT o I do now 
5 0 Don t know how I lived without them I love these little books they play music good for before bed my girls can chew on them which makes both me and my two year old son happy Just fantastic great buy 
5 0 Great for my 4 month old Such a great product for my baby She loves it as she can hear the music with me singing at the same time It builds confidence for me singing so my baby loves that we sort of sing together The plastic book is so gentle to be held by those tiny hands Such a winne 
5 0 Great Product I absolutely love this walker The songs it plays and the lights that flash really keep a baby entertained I also love the ease of collasping it down so that it can be stored away somewhere There are also great safety features such as the grip strips on the bottom The wheels are very easily manuevered also I would definitely recommend this product to other moms 
5 0 Easier than changing the crib sheet My sister who has 4 kids insisted I buy this and boy was she right Those of you who say it takes time to snap it on and off aren t thinking about what you have to do to change the crib sheet First of all the bumper has to be removed just to get to the mattress in any reasonable fashion and that s a pain to tie on and off Especially when you get it on there just right Then you have to lift up the mattress to get to the sheet bottom and pull it over the corners Did I mention that moving the mattress causes that cute little dust ruffle to get out of poistion Ugh I don t think so I d much rather deal with a few straps and snaps then have my daughter sit on a soaking sheet this pad wicks away the moisutre and have to go through so much trouble to change it As far as the imprint on her face I haven t noticed any and she hasn t been bothered 
4 0 Very Convenient We have twins and these mattress pads are much more convenient than trying to wrestle with getting new sheets on the cribs in the middle of the night They are holding up well through frequent washings and are easy to attach I gave it 4 stars because it s not extremely soft though it isn t bad I also like that the top layer is breathable gives me peace of mind 
4 0 Great Bathtub toy I was looking for something for my darling 1 year old daughter to enjoy in the bathtub She loves this toy and helps her with developing her gross and fine motor skills The only down side is that the crayons get a bit mushy after a bit of time in the water But it the Baby Einstein crayons are a good replacement which are inexpensive as well I look forward to many Van Gogh s from her 
5 0 Tub and Pool Perfect I am not one of those parents who have trouble getting my child in the bath its getting him out that s the problem With the crayons he absolutely loves coloring on the walls in the tub the pallet was useless when he figured out that the tub was just one huge canvas Personally I think these are some of the best tub toys My suggestion is to just buy the crayons and forget the pallet You can also use them in the pool and if you have a vinyl siding house and your children have sprinkler it also makes a great place to color Be careful to wash everything off before it dries 
5 0 My two year old LOVES THIS My two year old thinks this toy is the best thing in the world It s so easy to get him to take a bath now The crayons are great and come off the tub easily I give him a hand towel in the tub and he wipes the desk and tub off The compartment to keep the crayons in is good but a little difficult for my son to open Thank you for making this 
4 0 I bought this today But there are 2 things I don t like One being that the toys hanging from the bar are too low My sons knees hit it and he is only 6 weeks old Second being that the continuous play songs don t actually continually play It actually pauses for about 1 2 minutes My son will fall asleep to the music then it pauses and starts up again waking him i do love the vibration feature which is the main reason i bought it All in all it is worth it 
5 0 Thank Goodness I tried this bottle My daughter was having horrible gas pains and we tried everything under the sun to help her out Then we switched to these bottles and it worked like magic AMEN I don t care how many parts there are it is totally worth the sleep we are now getting 
5 0 No other bottles needed When my son was born in May I tried the Dr Brown s bottles based on a co worker s recommendation and I am so glad I did My kids are all primarily breastfed but for times when I need a bottle Dr Brown s are now the only ones I will use My son is almost 4 months old now and has had very little gas and has never had any problems with colic I wish I had had these bottles when my other children were babies As for those whining about the extra parts to clean Puh leeze I hand wash all my baby s bottles anyway but did you know these bottles also include an extra thin bottle brush to clean the straws with Dr Brown s makes it as easy on the parents as possible but who doesn t take the extra time to make sure their baby has the best With the little brush to use on the straw and vents it really takes no time at all so stop the nonsense Anyone who is even halfway considering trying these bottles really should pick up ONE at least but I know you will go out and get more if you do 
5 0 Wonderful We love it Yes the volume is low but there s a very simple solution to that put it near your head The best things about this device are the AC adapter and the fact that it will run all night I just leave it plugged in and turned on all the time Our cat must think we live by the ocean now A couple of reviewers said their machines stopped working and would only play for 5 seconds If this happens to you turn it over and flip the switch off of DEMO mode it has the 5 second setting so you can try it out in the store We re hooked on this thing now I may have to buy another one someday when my son moves into his own room 
5 0 crib It s perfect for people without a lot of extra room It s very sturdy 
5 0 Truly an Excellent Product Great Value Love it I was worried this looked cheap and too sterile and hospital like for my new baby but it is much more attractive in person Safetly 1st needs to have a new photo taken of this crib theirs looks dated It arrived and took less than five minutes to assemble by myself at 8 months pregnant Completely assembled except for sliding the four leg castors into place and lifting the bars to an open position Click Done Has two adjustable height settings and comes with a nice mattress I would not order another one This is very soft and suitable This rolls easily and the pack and play bedding fits it perfectly The Eddie Bauer sheets from Target come in a fleece fabric that is extremely soft love it My crib skirt from a large crib fits with adjustments and I love the way it turned out In fact I can t believe this is one of the cheapest alternatives since I would say it is nicer than the wooden mini cribs I saw in person at a local store I have a 24 month old and I did not want two cribs but I also did not want to rush her into a toddler bed We bought one but she doesn t want to stay in it at night She feels safe and sleeps well in her crib This crib is stable and will be fine for our second child until the older baby is out of her crib This is a great product and very reasonable too 
5 0 Love this crib The Safety 1st Cosco Portable Crib is great I purchased this for my first grandchild when she visits It s small enough to fit anywhere and it can easily be rolled from one room to another I would recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to a full size crib It is very sturdy and also attractive 
5 0 Satisfied This crib has been a smash hit with our baby girl Not too big yet roomy enough to spread out She loves sleeping in her crib and we like the size and convenience Not sorry for the purchase Carl 
5 0 New Grandma I am a new grandma The size and portability are a plus I was surprised that it came with a mattress I hadn t read that in the description 
5 0 excellent highchair it def is very sturdy doesn t move around once you strap it on to the chair and it looks good too i m very happy with this chair the contoured seat back really hugs the baby yet doesnt constrict his arms i love the size of the tray and the size of the cupholders i find it very easy to hand wash as the bottom only needs a good rinse my son hasn t gotten food under there yet i can t wait to use it as a booster seat 
4 0 Tray is hard to clean too many nooks and crannies This product definitely saves space but I ve had a hard time cleaning the tray Yes it s dishwasher safe but it takes up so much room in our diswasher that I end up hand washing it There are so many little nooks on the underside of the tray that I m always finding places that I misseed washing Trust me the baby will manage to get food there too This product would be greatly improved if there were a smaller tray insert that popped out for washing I ve seen this on some highchair models 
5 0 Great quality I have yet to use this chair as I am a grandma awaiting the arrival of her first grandchild but from what I can see this high chair has everything a larger chair offers but in a lot less space It is very sturdy and well put together and I am already recommending it to friends 
5 0 Great Space Saver This chair is a great space saver Attaches easily to the chair has two cup holders and the tray is the size of a normal high chair The draw back is it s hard to adjust the seat for the infant Was able to with some effort 
4 0 Nice But a little Big right now My son is only 2 months old so they are a little large right now I m sure they will be perfect once he grows into them 
5 0 This thing rocks Being that we had our baby in December this was a godsend Instead of having to bundle her up in heavy clothes thus making it a pain in the neck to strap her into the carseat my wife or I would just clothe the baby normally and not even have to wory about a bulky jacket Works great 
5 0 Great Investment for fall winter babies I bought this for my twin girls and i love it I had them in September and they fit it in all winter It was so much easier to get the girls out to the car then using winter suits and trying to get twins to wear them or even put them on without screaming Using this i was able to just dress them in something less constricting and put them in their car seats before they gave me any hassle Once you re in the car and warm enough all you have to do is unzip the sides and there s no fuss 
5 0 J Cole Bundle Me Infant Cover Absolutely LOVE this product Wish I had had one for my other 3 children We live in cold and windy North Dakota and this is just so easy to use There have been times my little one has gotten too hot when I over bundle him in it I recommend this to any one expecting a little one in the winter months 
4 0 Great product best in very cold weather We got two Bundlemes for our twin infant sons The product handles wears and washes well This product is great for taking your infant for outdoor walks or for very cold climates The only problem we have come across on not so cold winter days the boys often become sweaty and uncomfortable in their car seats during my 30 minute commute 
5 0 Absolutely love it This is so much better than the Bjorn carrier You can wear it on the hip or in front It is very comfortable My baby always felt secure and I never thought he would come out I could wear my 25 pound baby for 2 hours without a problem My back and shoulders were never sore Easy to put on Great way to calm a fussy baby Reversible black for men too 
5 0 God s gift to pregnant women I LOVE this pillow I ve had it for about two and a half months now At first it helped me stay on my side and was just comfy to snuggle up to Now that my belly is getting bigger it gives great support and doesn t let my belly hang down This is great for people who don t always sleep on their sides as once you position it you are unlikely to roll over in your sleep I ve had no problem with the stuffing If you are looking for super firm support try a wedge This is a pillow and feels as such Of course if you are on a budget you can always just use a regular pillow but if you want to pamper yourself the unique shape of this pillow makes it extra comfortable UPDATE I m now 8 months pregnant and love my pillow Mine came covered in a zippered cover so that is what I wash Every few nights I just grab the larger part and shake it HARD until the stuffing falls down then fluff it and it is as good as new I also like that yes it does take up some room but no where near as much room as many pregnancy pillows All in all whether you like this pillow or not will come down to personal choice 
4 0 I wish I had this pillow earlier After months of sleeplessness I received this pillow as a gift from my mom It is WONDERFUL but not for the reasons I thought I thought the big deal would be a nice wedge support for my growing twins which it is but the real relief is that I barely wake up as I flip from one side to the other since it is nicely wedged between my knees 
4 0 Cuddle Pillow I have used this pillow for the last 2 months with 2 to go I do like the shape of the pillow I just wished it was a little longer I had been trying to use a king size pillow to cuddle with but it was TOO big and hard to turn with This pillow makes it easy to keep next to you and to turn over I would just like it to be longer so I can have the little end between my legs and the rest up higher so I can cuddle with it When between my legs which helps the rest of the pillow only is around my stomach and I wish it came up to my breast area so my arms could cuddle around it a little easier I would still give one to a pregnant friend as it is nice to sleep with Beware my husband calls this the Sperm Pillow but if you can get past that it s a nice pillow 
5 0 Finally This is a great potty for boys We had some problems with accidents with some other brands but this one keeps what should happen in the potty in the potty Easy to clean too 
5 0 Functional sturdy easy to clean comfy I spent quite some time online researching on a good reasonable potty and found this product It s a bestseller and even better most of the buyers are very satisfied with it It s functional sturdy easy to clean and seems comfy My son had some success with that one 
5 0 Finally a potty that works This is the third potty I ve purchased for my son The first one was made by Parents and it tipped over the first time my son sat on it The second was First Years Elmo 3 in 1 and the cup pinched his behind in 3 places leaving cuts This one is great Although my son was hesitant to go on it at first which I attribute to his experience with the Elmo potty he fits nicely on it The other potties were too narrow from front to back and I had to adjust him several times to get him situtated so that he could use the front guard The seat lifts out as the cup which lends itself to not pinching his bottom and easy clean up It s low enough to the ground that his legs fit too The back and arm supports fit well also It s a solid construction and good buy 
5 0 great potty seat I bought two potties before I realized that my boy had a big bottom and most other potties have really small opening and no pee guard in the front I broke down and bought this This doesn t have the bells and whistles like some other potty But it s beauty is its simplicity he is able to sit and do his business carry the urine poop container to the toilet and rinse it all by himself he was not even 2 yet I would highly recommed the potty training book Potty training in less than a day it s out of print but you might find an used copy on 
5 0 Great Potty Chair I have twin boys that are 3 and I love this chair It doesn t have a lid or removable splash gurad I have two other sets of chairs that the twins only play with Putting the lids up and down taking out the removable seat and catch basin etc This simply constructed unit has no corners or edges It has smooth contours including the splash guard that does not come off and is attached to the catch basin The catch basin is a combination seat emptying pail which enables you to easily remove and empty It is easily cleaned and because of the simple design less appealing to play with I think the best feature is the smooth built in splash guard which you need with boys This seat does not convert to a toilet seat for the bathroom toilet which I think doesn t work anyway on the other potty chairs I purchased the seats slide and flop when you put it on the real toilet and then becomes unsafe I recommend the Babybjorn toilet trainer for that 
4 0 Nice but limited use Very cozy great for wrapping up after bath to get warm But honestly it s usually in the laundry And since swaddling lasts for a short period of time it s use is pretty limited However when it Is clean I like having it around 
5 0 Baby will SLEEP We have been swaddling our 8 week old since she came home from the hospital We tried the Swaddle Me but I guess she was too small 7 lbs We were using the Miracle Blanket which we loved However as she got stronger she was able to kick and squirm her way out I got worried about her safety with a loose blanket in the crib but she really liked being swaddled I took out the Swaddle Me that I received at a shower and decided to try it again It worked like a champ and she is sleeping 7 hours at night now I stretch it so that it s as tight as possible I bought another one and the velcro for the feet is bigger even better to hold it down We LOVE it and highly recommend 
5 0 Great stroller After I had my 2nd son we bought a Graco double stoller but it was SO long heavy and cumbersome that I only used it a few times before we decided to get rid of it We bought this tandem stroller a few months ago and I love it Great stoller lightweight easy to manuvuer and my 4 year old loves to ride in it b c he can either sit or stand in the back It s much smaller when folded up than most of the other double strollers on the market too I wish that I had known earlier that it also has an infant carseat attachment I highly recommend this stoller but do wish that the parent tray cup holder came standard with the stoller 
5 0 Why Didn t I think of That I LOVE this product All new mothers should include this on their registry how we ve lived without it for this long I ll never know It is a wonderful safety product that has been overlooked until now 
5 0 Don t spend any more money When I first bought this over a year ago I was hesitant about the price it being so low compared to other brands Rest assured this is all you will need My finicky baby had to have his warm Alimentum This bottle warmer is sooo quick and easy I could put the water up to the predetermined line of the measurer that comes with poor it in and left it alone It was ready within a minute and after a few shakes it was the perfect temperature This is also helpful for warming up baby food jars Comes with a special attachment just for that purpose The warmer was dropped twice on the floor so it can defently take a beating Outside is easy to clean the water deposits on the warmer not so much All in all It did the job for my little boy And for 16 GET IT And Get one for the Grandparents Don t spend 30 on a bigger and bulker item that will do the same thing 
4 0 No wet spots on the shirt The only reason it is not a 5 is because they leave my nipples linty Otherwise they work really good Tara Boyc 
4 0 Works great just takes awhile to put on stroller This works great with our Chicco Capri stroller It took a bit of trial and error to get it in the perfect place so the stroller would close However once I figured that out it was great I could take the accessories off and just put them on when needed The swivel is a great concept I actually wish it came with a third clasp so baby could have a cup holder and snack holder one on each side and mommy could have her water bottle clip We just switch them out for baby or they hold their sippy by the handles 
4 0 Loved it but it didn t work for me Seemed like a great system I came with TWO universal clips so you can use two of the holders at once If you want to use more then you have to remove one attachment It DOES NOT FIT MY ARIA TWIN STROLLER because the Aria does not have any tubing anywhere available once you close it up and not much available once it s open 
4 0 Pretty good for the money I will admit that I had absolutely no desire to sterilize bottles the old fashioned way boiling water in a pot on the stove so when I saw this product over seven years ago I bought one immediately I loved that it was so effortless PAY ATTENTION to the instructions that tell you how much water to use based on your microwaves wattage No one wants to wonder if the bottles are sterilized or so so when it comes to their child so read the instructions I also purchased another when my second daughter was born because I gave my sister the first one My only issue is that because of its small size it has to fit in the microwave after all you have to really stack the bottles nipples etc in a way that utilizes all of the available space Once again the instructions clearly tell you the best way to stack So if in your sleep deprived hormonal state you actually manage to read that stupid small instruction booklet you will save yourself a lot of heartache 
5 0 Sterilising is important to protect your baby I have used this product with all three of my children and it has been great Easy to use and quick to sterilise With regard to previous comments about not sterlising equipment I should point out that there is a difference between clean and sterile All babies are vulnerable to the germs that cause diarrhoea and vomiting and so it is best to continue sterilising bottles and teats and breast pump equipment until your baby is one year old and has built up more resistance to bacteria generally Cleaning your baby s bottles and teats in a dishwasher will not always heat them to the right temperature to kill off all known bugs so it s generally still advisable to sterilise after washing If you do want to rely on your dishwasher alone it needs to be run on a hot programme at a minimum temperature of 80 degrees centigrade The bottles then need be filled with feed straight away as the dishwasher will not leave them in a completely sterile condition It may seem pointless to sterilise feeding equipment when your baby is crawling around the floor and putting all sorts of things in his mouth but the bugs that stick to milk curds can be dangerous Your baby s immune system will grow stronger into the second year and he ll be able to combat infections more easily It might seem inconvenient to some but sterilising reduces your baby s chances of ingesting harmful bacteria and it s about the baby s health not what the mother s feels she doesnt have time for 
5 0 Make your like easier Great product It makes your life a lot easier not having to worry about boiling your bottles Please keep in mind that it is a sterilizer not a dishwasher nor a bottle warmer Somehow a bunch of people misunderstand what this product does 
5 0 Boppy Luxe Slipcover review This Boppy slipcover is super soft and wears well We ve washed it in the washing machine several times and it s very durable If you re looking for a soft simple durable Boppy slipcover I d highly recommend this one 
5 0 lasts forever I used this with my third child I washed it over and over and always the stains came right out It s SO soft Definitely a good buy 
5 0 Perfect sights Sounds Whoever designed this toy really understands the mind of the toddler My grandaughter took to this instantly and it became her favorite activity YES activity At a time when so many toys are designed to keep the child in one place this one gets them up and moving no moving no peek a boos It contributed significantly to her becoming steady on her feet and building a healthier baby A good value at any price 
5 0 LOVE IT the fabric is soft and cushion and what s most important it provides good support for my baby She loves it 
5 0 A Baby Must Have We got this before our little one was born She was born a little premature and only 4 lbs We used it in her bedside bassinet and later in her crib Although we had a few false alarms once she started moving around the crib they were worth it for the peace of mind all the other hours Baby girl is now two and we continue to use it She s in a toddler bed now and we can tell if she gets out of bed when she s not supposed to This is a great device and everyone should have one Comparible in price to other nursery monitors you get so much more It also has clear sound and little interference in our house 
5 0 Worth every penny This sensor is all about peace of mind We ve been using it for a few weeks now and it s gone off twice scaring us but making us glad that we have it Both times that its gone off our daughter has been very tightly swaddled so we think that made her breathing shallow and thus set off the alarm You can change the sensitivity on it but the default setting should be fine There is a bit of background noise or static that you can hear My husband solved that issue by placing a piece of regular household tape on the bottom few speaker holes It is still loud enough for us to hear her without the extra noise It does take some getting used to you have to turn off the sensor and put it in sound only mode whenever you remove the baby from the crib otherwise the sensor will go off But this inconvenience is totally worth the peace of mind this sensor gives you I believe they sell this with only one parent unit but you really want to get two Leave one in the bedroom and keep the other mobile we constantly move the second from the kitchen to the bonus room to the living room etc This sensor is an amazing product and worth every penny 
5 0 Wonderful Buy it I am not an expert in anything I am an emergency room nurse though and I hear stories of babies dying from SIDS We thought we d try this product as the reviews are great We love it The sensor pad is so sensitive that it picks up his every respiration I would highly recommend this for every baby as SIDS is a risk up until 12 months of age I feel so much better knowing that the alarm will sound if he stops breathing We plan to take this with us when we travel It is easy to use and it really works If you buy the one with the two parent units you can use the unit as a regular baby monitor instead or as well 
5 0 What an adorable chair The Hello Kitty Chair was just adorable the quality and craftmanship is outstanding My 15 month old grand daughter crawled right up into it on christmas morning and knew just how to start rocking Its just the right size Thank Yo 
5 0 This item is perfect for the beach I shopped around for a cabana to take to the beach for my sons first visit I found this one and let me tell you it was perfect It was so easy to set up and take down and it was sturdy enough to stand up to the high beach winds I saw a lot of other tents cabanas on the beach and this one by far was the best both price and durability wise Excellent find and buy 
4 0 Confusion There are two types of Dekor Refill one regular and one plus The sizes are different and you better be sure to order the right one 
4 0 diaper pail bags These bags work fine in the Dekor diaper pail It would probably be easier if you could just buy trash bags from the store instead of special ordering them But I am borrowing this diaper pail so these are the bags that it uses They do work great keep the smell inside etc If you order be sure if you need regular or Dekor Plus diaper bags There is a difference in the size of the bags 
5 0 Wonderful Product Highly recommended to all parents We love the Diaper Dekor and have referred it to many of our friends and family It is SUPER simple to use and the refills which seem expensive at first are actually cheaper than other brands because they last for 2 3 months vs a week i e Diaper Genie From reading the other reviews I think I can clear a few things up it seems these people have been misled hence their problems with this product First there are 2 versions of this pail a larger called DIAPER DEKOR PLUS and regular size called simply DIAPER DEKOR Thus there are 2 different sizes of refills PLUS and REGULAR You can find out which model you have by simply opening the door on the pail there is a sticker that will have the model on there if you do not see PLUS anywhere you will need to buy REGULAR refills the PLUS will not fit and vice versa Secondly the refills are VERY easy to insert you simply follow the directions which come with the unit Basically you remove the plastic insert wrap the opened refills from the inside of the insert and around the top the excess refill wraps around the outside of the plastic and then you sit it in the pail knot tied in the bottom of the new refill If you have a unit this will make sense if you haven t bought one yet I probably just confused you but you will see once you get it that it is very easy to do Last but not least the refills that have been on the market for the past year have absolutely no scent at all I personally would not mind having a baby powder scent but these have no scent It s not like I will be sniffing inside the pail or anything so it doesn t matter afterall once the refill is in the pail NO SCENT will come out not even dirty diapers Unfortunately it seems these few reviewers who gave this product a poor rating were misinformed by store workers and their poor review actually had nothing to do with the product but rather frustration stemming from unknowledgable employees at baby stores I hope this has helped We ve had this unit for nearly a year and absolutely swear by it It is a GODSEND No smells and how much easier can you get than just dropping a diaper into the pail and not having to do another thing Not many other units will allow you to store up to 3 weeks of diapers without a single scent 
4 0 Diaper Dekor and Diaper Dekor + Diaper Dekor is the small plus is the larger There are TWO sizes + won t fit the smaller unit We have the smaller and our Babies R Us which is where we bought it says oh sorry we only carry the big ones now Nice Now we have to buy liners online I don t mind buying online but I don t appreciate that I can t go buy them where I bought the unit If I d had any idea they would quit carrying the smaller one we d have bought + It s excellent 
4 0 Best on the Market When I purchased mine there was no Diaper Dekor+ which is the larger size However I feel that we have no need for a larger one My child just turned two and it holds a weeks worth of diapers no problem I bought the Diaper Genie because I was told so many things about it and I hate it it goes through bags quickly and the bags have a weird odor to them I am currently pregnant and am sensitive to odors and the Diaper Dekor holds them all in until garbage day comes 
4 0 Really Good Way to Control Odor I bought the smaller version quot Diaper Decor quot as opposed to the larger quot Diaper Decor Plus quot about 18 months ago Although I believe the smaller version has been discontinued about a year ago I have not yet had a problem finding the refill liners at my local Babies R Us or on line here at Amazon I highly recommend the Diaper Decor I do not have any experience with the Diaper Genie so I cannot compare I have not had any odor problems with the Diaper Decor It is very easy to change the liners and there is no mess My foot operated lid opener also broke like some other reviewers but this has not been a problem with me I just open the lid manually and leave it open while I am changing the diaper I would recommend the Diaper Decor in the Plus size 
4 0 Worked well for early training Our daughter started fighting the diapers when she was only 6 7 months old so in a fit of desperation I bought this potty put her on it and never looked back It helped that the potty was really comfortable with a wide flat bottom that left no marks on her tush and stable enough so there were no accidents I only give it 4 stars because I really could not snap the seat to the toilet and because the whole construction is so darn plasticky Ah and the music never worked no loss in my opinion I was there to do the encouraging and the training book seemed a bit cheesy A toddler may also entertain thoughts of removing the easily accessible container while sitting which may lead to a whole new set of problems But overall this potty has made our lives so easy during potty training that I cannot but lavish praise over this little piece of plastic 
5 0 secure little seat This little seat is very secure no slipping or moving around on the toilet yet it is easy to take on and off It also sits tight enough that nothing leaks between the trainer seat and the toilet seat Very easy to clean as well I will warn you that little boys can still shoot over the small guard I am careful to position my little boy so that he is slightly leaning forward so that the projection path is downward I have tried other seats with larger guards but these seem to sit too close and or he easily removes them This seat is a molded plastic and the guard is not removable Because this guard is not so large it would not get in the way of a little girl using this seat too 
5 0 The best potty seat out there This is the best potty seat that you can buy It s one piece so it easy to clean and if you have a boy it has a great splashguard Also I love the handle so that you can hang it on the wall 
5 0 mikey likes it my son loves this jumper it gives him a sense of independence he likes to rock from one leg to the other and then he spins completely around 
5 0 Makes a hard task easier I purchased this video monitor based on the reviews to help me care for my elderly mother who is under hospice care It has been wonderful to be able to check on her without staying constantly at her bedside or running back and forth from one end of the house to the other The picture quality is great and the sound is amazing I can detect changes in her breathing from the other end of the house I would highly recommend one to anyone in a caregiver situation or for parents to watch over their children It will definitely be put to use when grandchildren come along 
4 0 worth the extra money we purchased this monitor based on other great reviews I would have to say that it does work well The only issue we had was that it only worked on one channel for it to have clear reception from my daughters room to our master bedroom Also on that channel if it was on and the cordless phone rang it had a large amount of static and you would have to turn off the monitor It has given me peace of mind that I don t have to run in every sound she makes I can look in on the monitor and see if she really does need me I would recommend this product 
5 0 Great protection I am a disposable diaper mom however for night time or extra protection I throw the bummis wrap over the diaper and have never had a leak They wash up very nice and the velcro stays very strong It is by far the best wrap I ve used 
5 0 NOT As Silly as I thought When registering for baby needs I laughed at the idea of wipes warmer I thought what a waste After my newborn startled and screamed during diaper changes I rethought this This product has been a life changer Baby is much more comfortable now and the warmer works great Easy to use the wipes stay moist and are easy to get out Remember to purchase the pop up wipes however Great product I would give as a gift 
5 0 A good buy I was that parent who said I ll never spoil my child with a wipe warmer it will only encourage her to wear diapers longer And then I woke up and realized that warm wipes at night mean a baby who doesn t cry during changings and goes back to bed more easily this could mean an extra half hour of sleep for me I am now a big fan of the warmer It works very quickly and doesn t dry them out and the light is just bright enough to change the baby at night without waking her up Definately a nice product 
5 0 WOW I have not gotten to use this swing yet but I just wanted to say that assembly was easy and after I had it all put together I played with the toys on the tray and it was the coolest thing ever I highly recommend 
5 0 LOVE IT We got this when our baby was about 6 months old he is now 9 months At first he wasn t sure what to do but once he figured out how to jump in it it was all he wanted to do The adults all get such a kick watching him go crazy in it It s a little awkward to move around but the enjoyment well out weighs that 
5 0 Worth it s weight in gold My son s favorite toy This jumper is worth it s weight in gold My son is 3 1 2 months old and beginning to hold his head up so I decided this would be a great upright toy to start him out on since he loves to be in motion At first he was a little wobbly but after placing a pillow under him he is moving all around I have never heard him coo and giggle as much as he does while in this jumper I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a jumper I am so grateful to have found such a wonderful product that brings my son so much joy 
4 0 Rainforest Jumparoo Our 3 month old was maybe a little too young at first but now that she s 4 months old she loves this toy We recommend it 
5 0 The best toy Great fun product My baby boy plays in it for up to 30 min couple times a day We own it from 2 months he was 4 months old he simply loves it He jumps and plays with the toys Absolutely the best buy 
5 0 I loved this product These can definitely be a life saver during the first 1 2 weeks when you don t want compression on the nipple and you want them to air dry I have small breasts so I could wear them in any bra and I didn t have a huge leakage problem so I changed the foam twice a day The only problem I had was that my skin broke out where the rubber rested against it I think it got damp and wasn t allowed to breathe because it cleared up within 48 hours after I stopped using them Bottom line the relief was worth any minor inconvenience 
5 0 wonderful for soreness in beginning I highly recommend purchasing these shells even before the baby is born if you plan on breastfeeding I was very sore in the first few weeks The shells allowed me to apply lanolin cream on my nipples and let them air out and heal in between feedings I did only use them until my nipples were no longer sore which mentioned before was only a few weeks But they got me through those weeks when I don t know if I d have made it otherwise They were a wonderful product for me 
5 0 a must have You will need this extra base I ordered it thinking it would probably be a good idea to have The day after it arrived my mother in law was sick and couldn t come over and watch the baby so my husband placed an emergency call to a relative and they were able to come over and pick him up I had the original base with me at work 40 minutes away before this all happened 
5 0 We can t live without these We have 3 of them and have no complaints I keep one in my car one in my husbands and have another for travel It s super easy to snap the carrier onto it and very easy to install in any car I just travelled for 2 weeks with my 3 month old and had no problem installing the base into rental cars and other family members cars I could use the latch or just use the seatbelt for older cars I was worried that I would need my husband s help with the installation but I was fine on my own just reading the directions I recommend this for everyone 
5 0 Great product I purchased this product for my hubby s vehicle and we LOVE not have to transfer the carseat back and forth all the time It works great highly recommended 
5 0 Great for second car I bought this extra car seat base for my mom to use in her car and it works great Now I don t have to switch the whole seat when Mom takes the baby I am very happy with this purchase 
5 0 Finally Something to make parents lives easier My husband and I have been trying to reduce our years of accumulated clutter and to our dismay that includes FOUR infant car seats including our brand new DuoGlider SnugRide infant seat We were planning on giving one to my mother in law one to my sister in law and keep the third for my husband s car but then we realized that more than likely if we brought the baby over to their homes chances are the baby would already be in his car seat We were thrilled to find out that Graco sells a SnugRide car seat base separately This way we can bring our son to Grandma s and she can take him for a drive without having to wak him to move him from one seat to another The extra car seat bases simplify our lives and help us get a little closer to getting rid of all the clutter in the garage too Plus the car seat base works with both the Latch system and with a regular seat belt A must have for parents who have more than one car and who have nearby relatives eager to help watch baby 
5 0 Got to Have item I reccommend this item to anyone using disposable diapers I had a Generic diaper throw away system It was awful This is so easy to use once you get the hang of it and it really keps the smell away Try it you l like it 
5 0 Froggy Tales Night Lite Another great purchase received on time and in excellent condition Can t say enough good things about the vendor and the shipping process it was painless and full of customer service a rarity these days 
5 0 works good I had a fabric seat saver for my leather seats before Needless to say fabric doesn t protect leather very well I ended up with deep depressions in the leather Hopefully the leather will go back fingers crossed The firm bottom piece seems to work well to prevent any more indentations from showing up And both of the carseats are as secure as ever I have the rear and forward facing models 
4 0 Little too big The car seat protectors have worked well over the past several months I have owned them They are a little too big and interfere with my kids trying to buckle their seatbelt I own a minivan so if your seats are fairly narrow compared to the seats of a minivan I would consider a different brand Good luck Ke 
5 0 Potty Seat Perfect for Training This seat took us from complete refusal to use a regular plastic potty to be almost completely trained For starters kids like using the same seat as mom and dad this seat allows them to do that comfortably It is not too big and not too small fits any toilet and travels like a dream As the mom of a boy I don t use the plastic guard because it sticks up too much over the seat but even for boys this seat is mess free And with boys there is usually a little mess but because it is plastic you can wipe it easily I love it and my son loves it I wish I hadn t bought the potty because my son refuses to use it only this seat 
5 0 Good solid seat This seat works very well My son feels secure on it and it is EASY to use Highly recommended 
5 0 Evenflo Pressure Gate Even though it looks like it will not fit at the beginning it fits perfecly Evenflo also gives you an extention piece with it We needed this piece for our size opening we really had to squeeze it in but it is a great fit The gate is sturdy and pleasing to the eye It took about 2 days for us to get used to the locking mechanism using 2 hands at first After some practice it was easy to use We liked it so much that we bought another 
5 0 Excellent Dog Gate I need a gate to keep my dogs out of my guest room It s used for an office and playroom and it s the coldest room in the house so I like to keep the door open My daughter s friend broke her arm climbing over a wooden pressure gate that we had when it fell so I bought this one It took 7 minutes to install it s not going anywhere and it s very easy to open and close My dogs can t climb over it because the bars are vertical I love it am very pleased and plan to buy another one for my 8 year old daughter s bedroom 
5 0 Great product We used this every single night with our son and even bought the next size up when he outgrew the small size He was sleeping through the night almost immediately Part of that was because he was so comfy when swaddled We used this for four months until he learned to flip to his belly and needed his arms free A def must have for every baby 
5 0 life saver My daughter had to stay in the hospital for 3 weeks She got very used to being swaddled but after 4 kids I still can not do it right This blanket makes her so comfortable she sleeps 5 to 6 hours at night at 3 weeks old When both the blankets were in the wash she wouldn t sleep that long She was up about every 90 minutes just wanting to be held Thank god for this blanket it lets me get some sleep 
4 0 a great idea for the early days This product was great in the first few weeks after we brought the baby home While others have said that the velcro is very loud for late night diaper changes I found that I could keep it velcro d on the top and just slip her legs out through the bottom My daughter really liked this but quickly outgrew it At just one month old she didn t want her arms tied down so the usefullness of the product is limited For a baby who loves being swaddled this is an indispensible item I ll pass mine on with our hand me downs You never can tell which baby will want to be swaddled 
4 0 Great product for first 2 months only I loved having this easy swaddleme wrap It was so much easier than getting a blanket and swaddling where it might come apart The velcro worked really well as it gave room to grow Swaddling our daughter only lasted for about a month or two she just totally outgrew this It was great while it lasted and it s a fantastic shower gift 
5 0 Don t give up I love this sling But I d like to stress as other people have done that you have to practice with it to find what works for you It may be too big for your newborn I started using it when my son was 4 weeks but he was a large baby I ve found the key is wear it high The instructions say the you and your baby will be more comfortable with baby at chest height It s true If you try to wear it with the baby hanging a little lower near your stomach it s going to hurt your back and shoulder and wear you out and he she s going to squirm and be uncomfortable I used it every day of my sons 3rd month when we were in hotels between moving Now I used it every time I grocery shop because as soon as he s in it he falls asleep no matter the time of day If I try to push him through the whole store sitting in the cart in his carseat he ll start screaming but if I put him in my sling I won t hear a peep out of him the whole trip And you have to admit it s so cute and stylish Several people have stopped to ask me where I got it and I love directing them to Amazon 
4 0 A lifesaver for us but one strong reservation First I must say that this sling was an absolute LIFESAVER when my somewhat colicky son was a newborn No matter how fretful his mewling when we swaddled him and placed him in this sling he would fall asleep Because he otherwise rarely slept in those early weeks he spent a good deal of time in it Three aspects of the design are great 1 The bottom is padded so you can lay baby on a hard surface and use sling as a changing pad 2 The sides are high and have drawstrings that allow the sling to be opened up almost flat 3 It grows with your baby my tiny baby hated the front type Bjorn carriers but loved this and still likes it One aspect of the design is to me dreadful the shoulder strap It should be wider and padded I tried repositioning it every which way and no matter what I did the strap dug into my shoulder In the end I just put a thick mitten under the strap on my shoulder Good use for a mitten that s lost it s mate but I would rather have a better strap 
5 0 wonderful I am 5 5 with a large bust size and had a 7lbs 7 oz baby It took a couple times to find the most comfortable way for me to wear it but after that I have had no problems with it My son will get in there and go straight to sleep and I have never felt he was going to suffocate The pockets are a major plus and now since it is cold and flu time of the year I like it because all the touchy and coughing people can not touch him with any germs they may have since he is completly covered up He is still laying down in it so I don t know how it will work with him sitting up 
5 0 Kidsafe Banister Guard a great solution for us We have a very irregular iron banister with different sized spaces and bars This was the perfect solution because you can place the tie down holes wherever you need to and the ties it comes with are really long so they will fit around large or small bars We had to use a drill to make some holes further from the edge of the plastic because the hole punch it comes with wouldn t reach but it was very easy to do I also like this product because it doesn t take away from the look of the banister or obscure vision 
5 0 Great Safety Product We were very pleased with how easy this was to install despite the fact that we have rather unusual banisters Ours is actually a half wall and half banister but the plastic was just flexible enough to bend over the ledge The directions weren t great but it was fairly self explanatory We feel much more comfortable letting our one year old play upstairs in the loft now 
5 0 I love it This product has really worked well for me My daughter used to love pushing her Barbie dolls in between the posts on our loft to see them crash onto the table below Now we don t have to worry about this anymore She can t reach her arm through these posts anymore either I use window cleaner to clean the smudge 
5 0 Bargain Booster Seat I had checked out booster seats on the Internet and in stores and this was by far the least expensive It s a bargain well made and easy to use My grandkids seem to like it better than a high chair The seat arrived minus the safety straps used to attach it to a chair When I wrote customer service about the problem they sent a whole new booster seat 
5 0 Good Travel Companion Excellent value for money Our 8 month old enthusiastically used this seat as a travelling feeding chair as well as a floor chair and we wouldn t have managed the holidays without it This seat is strong and stable yet easily assembled dis assembled It folded flat to fit in our suitcase and has become a valuable travel companion with our young family We purchased this on 19 Dec and it was delivered prior to Christmas well done Amazon 
5 0 happy shopper Seeing a 1 year old little girl playing these instruments is hysterical My niece absolutely loved them She had such an easy time handling them because they are her size which is unusual All other instrument toys are so much larger and it s hard for them to hold on to them while trying to play them The smiles and giggles are worth everything 
5 0 great toy My eight month old daughter really loves these instruments We bought them when she was about four months old but when she picked them up she d often clunk her head with them when she tried to wave them around I brought them back out when she was six months old and had a lot more arm control Now she really goes wild with them especially the bells 
5 0 brings lots of smiles My daughter plays with this toy at Grandma s house Theses quot instruments quot are usually the first toys she pulls out to play with The bright colors and different noises definitely interest her She loves to shake them and make noise They are great little toys to throw in the diaper bag when you re on the go 
5 0 great for children of all ages My daughter received these instruments as a gift last Christmas and took to them right away She was six months old at the time and they were easy for her to hold and shake to create the sounds We have lots of toys that make noise but these were some of her favorites just the right colors size and shape with just the right sounds She has turned one now and still gets lots of enjoyment from these toys They really encourage musical creativity in even the youngest of children 
5 0 Great twin umbrella stroller for travel Perfect for traveling or packing in the motorhome For the price it has alot to offer It has bags on both sides of the stroller for snacks moveable sunshades to really keep the sun out of their eyes It s not the plushest stroller however for travel or quick errands it s perfect for us 
5 0 Wrangler Stroller I gave this stroller as a gift So far there have been no problems 
5 0 Great umbrella stroller I was looking for a double stroller that I could get in and out of my sedan easily I didn t like the tandems because they not only take up tons of space but they are also very heavy This stroller is light and I can take it in and out of my trunk with one hand Plus because my kids are heavy enough to push I am not pushing an extra 25+ pounds in stroller Because it is side by side it can be a tight fit going through some doors but I have never been unable to get through a door My husband thinks that some of the parts are cheap and look like they can break easily but with 6 months of lots of use we have had no problems The sun visors have bent at an angle when storing but I can still use them fine and I like that they rotate down so you can angle them with the sun I am so glad that I bought this rather than a larger more expensive heavier tandem stroller 
5 0 Sleep Sheep is the Best My daughter loves to cuddle with the soft sleep sheep and I love this product because it puts her right to sleep with the calm soothing sounds I love the rain even I fall asleep listening to it I had originally bought the sleep sheep because my neighbors upstairs have squeaky floors and they are walking around late at night and wake up my daughter So I block out their squeaky noises by turning up the sleep sheep noise blocker I am happy and so is my daughter who is sleeping like a baby 
5 0 sleep sheep I think this product is fantastic the adjustable volume works well and the sounds are very soothing The timer is also a nice feature This is a great present for anyone in your life that is having a baby The sheep is cute and surprisingly cuddly in spite of the digital box in it s tummy 
4 0 Adorable A good friend has this for her daughter I fell in love with it when I saw it Completely adorable and works like a charm Bought one as a baby gift as well but I d kinda like one myself 
5 0 babybjorn is the best It s very safe because of the non slip rubber Our son uses it when he brushes his teeth or when he goes to the potty Nice color too Highly recommended 
4 0 Come Scented Too Other parents told us about these specifically the vanilla scented ones Baby 1 was bottle fed and took to an Advent pacifier right away We used the scented soothies whenever we couldn t get a bottle ready fast enough for her likes Not sure if it was the shape of the soothie pacifier or the scent but she always calmed down wihle we d finish getting the bottle ready Baby 2 was also bottle fed but did not take to any pacifier right away We tried these regular soothies as well as the vanilla ones and the Advent ones too She eventually took to the Advent It really is up to each baby what they will like But these are definately worth trying In addition to the regular and vanilla ones there are also various sizes including preemie pacifiers attached to small stuffed plush animals that are easier for babies to find and put into their mouth and also easier for Mom Dad to in the back of the car the darkened bedroom etc 
5 0 Cooshie Booster The booster works great does not slip on a chair and is easy for my 2 year old to move around on her own I highly recommend this product 
5 0 Finally PINK Finally a cute pink car seat It is duralble and easy to lift around I wish they had this cute color for my other daughter Ihave not deliverd yet so I don t know how she will fit in it But I also have the stroller and everyone who sees the matching combo tells me how cute it is There is not any other pink combo out there I just hope it works as well as it shows off 
4 0 Not perfect but pretty close I am not wild about the colors and design but it s not too bad The fabric is easy to clean machine washable and the sun canopy is GREAT With an adapter I can easily snap it into my Bugaboo stroller for ultimate convenience It s just a great car seat although I wish there were cuter girly designs 
5 0 i couldnt ask for abetter stroller we bought this when my daughter was newborn and we were surprised that her peg perego car seat fit into it so well now shes a year and a half and even if were at home she climbs into it and plays with the steering wheel She has always loved it in the snow and on the ground and on picnics its great a lot better than plastic wheels the front tire swivels and also has a little switch so that it becomes more like a jogging stroller and the front wheel doesnt move Weve really liked it so far except for the harness not fitting a very tiny baby its GREAT the only thing is now i have 2 kids and i cant use it cause i need a double on 
5 0 Excellent replacement for my old Graco We received a Graco travel system from our registry and got some good use out of it However we are in a big city and the stroller just couldn t stand up to the bad sidewalks and roads Not to mention it was so rickety I m positive we could be heard a mile away I broke down and ordered the Jeep Liberty Limited Urban Terrain jogger and I LOVE it 1 It was simple to assemble 2 It is easier on my hands and wrists to steer 3 The air filled tires provide a much smoother ride for my daughter 4 The toy steering wheel She FREAKS out over it in a good way She beeped her horn about 30 consecutive times in the grocery store Since that distracted her from pulling boxes off the shelves I am ultra pleased 5 The price is wonderful We don t use the Music On The Move feature so I can t really comment on it I fill the tires right before we leave the house every time and it s not hard to do so I have no complaints there It is a bulky item so transporting it and carrying it is a bit tricky However the pros all outweigh the cons for me I am extremely pleased with it 
5 0 Son figured it out at age 27 months The crib tent is great We originally got it to keep our cats out but then it served the purpose of keeping our son in too UNTIL at 27 months he learned how to reach through the crib slats undo the zipper o So now we re in a hurry to get a toddler bed this week It is hard to change sheets with the crib tent but just get the ultimate crib sheet it s a piece of cake Also it is possible to put down the side rail of the crib but this does lower the tent too can bop you in the head 
5 0 Awesome chair This is such a versatile chair love the way you can fold it down compactly yet it s incredibly sturdy with the wide base when being used The tray stores on the back legs when not in use nice touch For the reviewer who complained that the thing that separates the legs is attached to the tray you can use the harness system to keep your child in place while removing the tray Plus it s easy to remove the top part of the tray and leave the base to keep the child secure while you clean up My 6 month old loves to sit with us at the table with some toys on the tray terrific product to keep babies happy and parents sane during mealtime 
4 0 Cute book Book looks exactly like the picture and the colors are vivid and nice The only thing is the puppet holes are really small meant for small fingers so you as a parent might not be able to show your child how to use the puppet feature I like this line of books better the the Bright starts and Baby Einstein books 
5 0 On the go Surprisingly its been hard to find a two compartment dish for baby food This one works great and comes with a nice spoon that fits on top of the dish for storage It is a great size and lightweight for taking in the diaper bag for eating out too 
5 0 A definite for babies I think everyone should one of these especially for when their kids are young My 8mo old tries to eat everything I don t want him chewing on the handlebars of grocery cars yuck and it makes it much cleaner when you put him in a highchair at restaurants which are sometimes disgusting The best part it fits over extra large shopping carts at club stores like unlike other types 
5 0 I love this product I didnt know these things exsisted with my first child now that I found them I use it constantly This floppy seat is much better then others you can get for a little cheaper but in the long run this is the best for your money I have washed it at least half a dozen times and its washes great I also am so glad to have one seat the works for the cart as well as the highchair THe other products I saw you had to buy one for each item It was almost double the cost It does take a few minutes to get it hooked up but its worth it for the quiet and GERM free shopping experience and my son is so ccomfy in it I have had lots of people ask me where we got it I love the added extras of having a cup holder pocket and some places to hook up some toys It is very plush and made of great fabric it is not cheap in anyway THis is one item I dont intend to live without I also think this is a great shower gift for anyone expecting I cant say enough about this product 
5 0 I love it The Floppy Seat is a great item No more worrying about baby s hands and mouth touching filthy shopping carts and restaurant highchairs I recommend this to all new moms and give it an A++ 
5 0 Definate Must have I cannot go shopping without my floppy seat I don t know what I am going to do when my infant outgrows either the front pack or car seat as my toddler rides with the floppy I reccommend this to everyone who comments on it to purchase for themselves or as a gift I have seen another seat with a large pillow in front for kids to sleep on or as one mom with a little girl who has siezures could use as protection but I can t remember where babycenter com 60 As other reviewers mentioned I also used mine for the restaurants too when my toddler was too small to fit comfortably in the seats not to mention the gunk in the chairs Buy this product you won t be dissapointed 
5 0 The Floppy Rules We bought our Floppy Seat when our baby boy was about 6 months old Even though he was still a little floppy himself when it came to sitting up the Floppy Seat supported him He s now 18 months old and it s still going strong Although now he wears real shoes and the leg openings tend to get caught on then It took a little practice to get the hang of the threading the belt through the cart but now it s SO fast We also use it EVERY time we go out to eat As a matter of fact the one and ONLY time we forgot to bring it along our son started to choke while sitting in a restaurant highchair The belt buckle on the old restaurant chair became stuck and would NOT open after multiple attempts We were forced to turn the whole chair sideways in order to proceed to clear his airway He was fine but we were all shaken up If we d had our familiar floppy Seat cover we would have been able to help our son a few moments faster Every second counts 
5 0 potty I am very happy with this potty It has a high guard which works well for a little boy 
5 0 Very simple stylish My son is not actually anywhere close to understanding the concept of this but my impression is that it is VERY simple to clean up which I LOVE the idea of It seems comfy he sits in it often and plays with it sometimes 
5 0 Awesome Kissaluvs are the best They keep baby dry while being incredibly breathable Baby s skin doesn t get red like it does with disposable diapers Also great for keeping in those wonderful breastmilk poops 
5 0 Worth the Price This Graco Family Tree Play Yard is perfect for newborns The setup isn t quite as easy as the description implies simply because the instructions are all pictures without corresponding written directions That said a little patience the first time around makes setting up and putting away the play yard incredibly easy afterward The quilted mattress pad serves double duty to wrap around the folded up play yard when you need to take it on the go I find this especially convenient because it guarantees that I won t leave an essential piece at home when I take the yard with me The description is a bit in error in regards to the mobile and the music An attachment that sits on the side of the yard has an incredible variety of settings for vibration music noise and lighting There are different timed settings you can use to help get baby to sleep The music is NOT however directly attached to the mobile Also the mobile sits on its own it does not turn That bothered me at first but I quickly got over it when I realized my newborn didn t seem to care anyway The changing table sits higher than those on other play yards that I ve seen making diaper changes much easier on the back The built in diaper holder and baby wipes holder are convenient for those rush changes The changing table is padded and easy to clean up though you need to use lap pads or something of that sort as there isn t a removable pad on it This is actually to my preference as it s less stuff for my baby to have to contend with but may be bothersome to parents who think their baby needs the extra cushioning When taking this on the go as I said it s easy to pack up One minor drawback is the travel bag that holds the play yard It doesn t have a handle and it doesn t fit all the components of the yard The changing table and the mobile sit at home when I take this on the go The reality is if I m travelling it s more convenient to not have these extra pieces to worry about However I m not sure how I ll pack them up when my baby outgrows the changing table and is just using the yard itself I consider that a very minor consideration though This play yard sits in my living room where it is incredibly convenient because it has space to hold all of my baby essentials so that I m not having to constantly run to the nursery I m not sure what the parent organizers are intended to be for they look like little soft sided cup holders but I ve found them to be convenient places to store extra burp cloths a pacifier and socks that are just too little to stay together anywhere else 
5 0 My Daughter Likes It This seat along with the matching step stool are great My daughter loves having her very own special toilet seat and step for going potty It has encouraged her to potty train it fits the toilet seat nicely and is easy for her to put on the toilet by herself I put a suction hanger on the toilet tank and is easily put out of the way when mommy and daddy need to go potty and she can easily get it and set it up for herself as well 
5 0 Fits easy to install remove and clean We have the Baby Bjorn Step Stool Potty Chair Little Potty and now the Toilet Trainer Hind sight is 20 20 The Toilet Trainer and Step Stool is all you need Our initial thought was to have the Potty Chair for home and the Little Potty for trips The reality is our daughter would sit on her potty then want to sit on the toilet like Mommy and Daddy We balanced her on the toilet before we decided to get the toilet trainer No more balancing acts on the toilet She can use her step stool to get on the Toilet when she wants The toilet trainer travels well fits all types of toilets easy to install remove and clean The Potty Chair and Little Potty are fantastic quality but you might as well go with the Toilet Trainer from the start 
5 0 Fantastic Potty Seat My daughter started with the Baby Bjorn stand alone potty seat which was great when she was just getting started with the idea of using a potty She quickly became too tall to use the stand alone potty seat so I ordered this Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer and it has been fantastic She quickly learned how to put the seat on the toilet herself and adjust the wheel to make it snug It was also easy for her to remove and hang on a small butterfly doorknob my husband attached to the side of the sink cabinet The seat gave her a great sense of independence and allowed her to be comfortable and secure while learning to use the big potty It is also great for traveling I would put it in a zippered canvas tote and carry it with us into rest areas it really does fit any toilet she could sit securely and be protected from unclean surfaces I would carry a small container of Disinfectant wipes to clean her seat off each time we used it in a public restroom I highly recommend this Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer 
5 0 SAVES MY BACK This stool is great right size for young child to seat on the potty It is narrow and doesn t take up a lot of room plus it saves my back from having to pickup grand daughter to set her on the potty 
5 0 BEST BOTTLES PERIOD I have a 10 month old baby and I have tried EVERY BOTTLE I used the AVENT with my 1st baby THESE BOTTLES ARE THE BEST Why Because they DO NOT LEAK NO BUBBLES and the DESIGN is fabulous once the baby holds it her himself The angles top is great for LITTLE or NO AIR IN BABY S TUMMY The little rubber seal disk you put in the bottom is a CINCH Don t wast time or money on any other bottle 
4 0 Overall excellent bottle These are really good bottles I have been using them for 4 weeks now for my newborn son My only complaint is in regard to the stage 1 nipples they come with that you are supposed to use for newborns The flow is MUCH too slow My little boy could not get anything out of it and he tried and tried So if you plan on using these bottles I would recommend going ahead and using the stage 2 for your newborn baby I am not the only person who has had this problem with the stage one nipples Other than that these bottles are great 
4 0 Very cute practical The pacified pod isn s essential but it s definitely good to have You can keep the pacifier clean and easier to find in the diaper bag or in mom s bag or you can simply hook this on the stroller if you are just going for a walk And with all the cute patterns you can definitely find one that suits your taste and matches your stroller or diaper bag 
5 0 Hygienic convenient and environmentally friendly Medela products are all great these containers came sterile and are so convenient to store pumped milk one can add the medela nipple and feed the baby directly from the container Very useful Highly recommended 
5 0 Love the versatility True as other reviewers have stated this is not a gate that will swing open unless you use the hardware which I have not so I cannot comment on how well that works As a tension or pressure mounted gate I love this item I have no problems stepping over it and I m only 5 5 so I never found it to be a nuisance It s easy to use with one hand and snaps into place easily It s also easy to adjust the size to fit different sized door openings although that takes two hands It s light enough that I can carry my 13 month old son on one arm and the gate in the other as I travel from floor to floor My 2 year old is learning to sleep in a room by herself so we use the gate at the doorway so that she can call to us from her room without being free to wander into the hallway or onto the stairs Again we love the fact that we don t have to damage the molding on the doorframes My husband and I are so satisfied with this item that we plan on buying another one 
5 0 Baby Gate This item works for me perfect I had ordered two of them but found one did so well I have returned the second one There was nothing wrong with it I just had no need for it For the record I am not using this for a child It is used to restrain the movements of a pet It works perfect for that so I am sure it would do wonders for a child 
4 0 Perfect for OLD houses My house was built in 1862 and I have struggled with several different gates trying to get one to fit my odd sized crooked doorways This gate when hardware mounted adjusts to fit my doorways where no other gate could I agree that it s not easy to use you have to readjust the size each time it s opened or closed but for me it s worth it to have a gate that fits my crooked doorways Also the hardware mounted installation template that was included made it SUPER easy to install I m very happy with this gate 
5 0 Love it I chose the lighter one based on other reviews of the wool getting all over the baby I m using this one this winter but putting a blanket on top of baby to protect him from the cold Very good quality product 
5 0 Great chair and easy to use and clean This chair is larger than some of the seats out there and fits my average sized 2 1 2 year old boy very well Some seem like they would be really hard for a boy to use as things tend to spray out of the smaller seats The seat is shaped just right for splashes and it seems comfortable Now if only my little guy would use it more than once a day we d be in business I love the simple design my son loves the color he picked it out himself and it s so simple to clean It also has grips on the bottom so that it won t slide on the bathroom floor when he sits in it a must 
5 0 Best potty on the market I love this potty chair It is so simple and that is what I like about it simple to use simple to clean My little boy loves it 
4 0 Great product These are one of two brands that my daughter does not soak through in the night They wash up nicely and seem as good as the day I bought them My only wish is that they had fold back laundry tabs for the velcro They stick to other things in the wash I think this puts extra wear on the velcro too 
5 0 Fantastic cover I am totally a fan of cloth diapering now that I ve actually done it I must admit I was very apprehensive before I actually used them because I thought it would be so much work but it really amounts to doing a load of laundry every other day not hard These diaper covers are fantastic I have not had a single leak with them When my daughter was first born a friend gave us several packs of newborn disposable diapers that we used for the first few weeks and we had numerous leaks We actually used the newborn size of Super Whisper Wrap for the first two months and are on the small size now She was 6 pounds 11 ounces when she was born I use the chinese prefold diapers with them I tried two different types of the Gerber prefold but they re just not as absorbant and were quickly saturated What sold me on these covers is how I can wash them with diapers when they are soiled and I don t have to hand wash them or anything 
5 0 I recommend this ruffle Item is exactly as pictured described Cute design and good quality Adds a nice touch Highly recommend 
5 0 Wonderful comfortable bather We are using this bather for our son who is one month old What we like most about this bather is that the water drains away from the baby The fabric is also very soft quick drying and removable for machine washing The model we have does include straps that can be adjusted around the baby s waist To keep him warm we pour cupfuls of warm water on him throughout his bath Since we don t fill up the tub with water slippage has not been a problem 
5 0 love it I like this product very much It is very soft unlike the other tubs where I was scared that my son would hit his head The only drawback I have about is the belt maybe in the next one they can come up with a good belt that would hold the infant Other than that I would recommend it to anyone It looks very comfortable too Especially if you have taller babies this is the best bathing system 
5 0 A tub seat that grows with your baby My 4 5 month old son has never liked the plastic bathing tubs so right from the very beginning he s been in the big tub with a tub seat He loved bath time until just a few weeks ago when he outgrew our original Especially for Baby the BRU house brand tub seat In desperation we searched the shelves at BRU and settled on the Mother s Touch I can t say enough good things about this tub seat The head support features a soft washcloth like insert to cushion a newborn s delicate head and it can be repositioned or removed as the baby grows The two position back reclines for newborns and sits up straighter for older babies The entire seat is up high enough that quite a bit of water is needed in the tub but I found that it makes it easier to control how deep my baby sits in the water in the old tub seat he had to be up to his ears in order to have enough water to bathe in One of the things my son hated about his previous tub seat was that he couldn t sit up in it The design of the Mother s Touch provides enough support to allow Baby to sit up mostly unassisted and the ample padding makes sure he doesn t bruise himself on the hard edges Even though there s lots of support and padding it s still very important to closely supervise your baby when using this or any tub seat Another reviewer mentioned a couple of things things that I d like to respond to There are no suction cups on the base I have found that the rubber grips provide more than enough traction but tubs may vary She would like a strap the seat that I have does have a strap it s stored underneath the seat so may not be immediately identifiable so I wonder if the seat has been redesigned recently Overall my son and I are very happy with this tub seat and I ve been recommending it to friends They ll have to buy it new instead of getting it as a hand me down though I foresee him being able to use it for most of his first year before he outgrows it 
5 0 Durable We bought this to replace the one that our infant son destroyed by kicking the edge relentlessly This one has curved sides and the ends are open to prevent such a thing from happening again I also like that the surface is taut and easy to clean 
4 0 A Must Have This pillow is totally functional and comes in handy when traveling and space is limited I even use it at home when just watching television It creates a natural relaxing position it is a must have 
5 0 Best Travel Pillow I ve used This pillow works Sleeping in the car used to make my son cranky becausehis head would painfully drop to his chest making him fuss cry Now with this comfy pillow he naps peacefully wakes up happy 
5 0 Cute but not safe for newborns I really love these bumper pads and also the quality after washing is very good the only thing i don acute t like is the way the strings work there are not enough and also they rip off easily not stitched well for the price Generally bumper pads are not recommended for babies before age 12 months since the air gets blocked away from the bed also suffication could be a problem We have bought a convertable crib common in Europe which can be used till approx age 5 and so we will attach the bumper to the bed later anyhow we still love it it looks and matches perfectly to the rest of safari 
5 0 instantaneous customer service It seems like this carseat arrived about five minutes after I hit the purchase button It arrived in great condition too and they even threw in a sippy cup The fabric on this cover the Ashley Floral is very attractive I love that it can be rear or forward facing A friend who had already purchased a different seat helped me install this in my car and she loved it so much more than the one she got that she s getting this one once her newborn is too big for her rear facing only seat If only she d bought this one she said she wouldn t have to go buy another Haven t had my daughter in it yet so update coming soon 
5 0 Great Space Saver While not as portable as I assumed it would be It s been a great space saver over a std highchair and great to have 
4 0 Very compact high chair This chair is very sturdy and we keep it attached to our table as my son s only high chair I love how little space it takes up compared with a conventional high chair However I bought this chair because by about 9 months my son would climb out of anything I thought a chair with nothing under his feet might give him less leverage Even with the shoulder straps as tight as they can go he can wiggle out of it and stand up in the chair If you are looking to downsize your baby accessories and you don t have a climber this is the chair for you but if you have an escape artist this chair is no better than typical high chairs 
5 0 High praise I bought this chair second hand for my six month old son and he loves it whereas he hated the hard wooden restaurant high chairs It s a great size easy to use good color for hiding stains and comfortable for him to sit in Best of all because it folds up so easily and comes with a carry bag we can be sure that he doesn t get exposed to the germs of every other little kid who frequents the restaurants where we eat This is an excellent product and well worth the money 
5 0 Great Space Saver Great Price Limited space in our townhome and this hook on chair has been wonderful for us This is our highchair Make sure you look at the clearance dimensions if you have a lip under your table The chair arms attachments may not clear the lip Strong sturdy easy to clean Knowing we can remove it and take it with us for a weekend visit is one less thing to worry about Great travel drawstring bag Great price Great product If you take the time to read the instructions and not force things that shouldn t be forced this seat will work out for you Something for the manufacturers if they read these comments personnal prefrence The harness straps should be a diffrent color then the seat Very hard to see find when putting a baby in the seat and its 5 00 in the morning 
5 0 Best piece of baby equipment we own I discovered this product recently when I had my second baby I received it as a baby shower gift and I LOVE it It is so much easier than swaddling with a blanket I have now bought the large one and my son 3mos has yet to figure out how to get out of it The other thing that I like about it is that you can wrap the wings around the baby s waist or upper chest leave his arms out and use it during the day like a blanket Voila a blanket that won t fall off when you re holding him or be kicked off when he s lying down Kiddopotamus has really come up with some great products You might also want to check out the Piddle Pad Another great invention product by Kiddopotamus 
5 0 Absolute necesity if you ve got a small bedroom I loved this He was always right next to me but in a safe and separate space It folds up smaller than a pack and play takes up very little room next to the bed and has a netted tent cover for the summer to protect from mosquitos or your cat who is dying to sleep with the baby 
5 0 Loved my Mini Co Sleeper We loved the mini co sleeper Our son used it until he was around 4 months and his trasition into his crib was so easy I loved having him right next to me without the worry of rolling on him or waking him up in our bed I could check on him just by looking at him or putting my hand on him and I didnt even have to roll out of bed The mini co sleeper was so portable that I never even bought a pack n play We traveled a lot the first few months with our son and it was so easy to take his bed with us I highly reccomend the mini co sleeper and the leg extensions were great since our bed was a little high I will use this for our next baby as well 
5 0 I m really glad i bought it This bed is great because our bedroom is small and the bed fits nicely next to my bed It feels so good knowing he s so close Its really convienent because we have to leave town for a night and this bed folds up small enough to throw in the trunk and he will still feel at home when he sleeps Oh yeah and its really cute 
4 0 Very cute toy My 1 1 2 year old son really enjoys this toy he loves putting the little men on top He doesn t play with the toys on the side guess thats for younger kids but he does enjoy the shape sorter and the drawbridge opening is cute and holds his attention I find an advantage over the classic Fisher price is that he can t as easily just rip the cover off and toss the pieces in when he gets frustrated At this age I find the Alphabet pieces a waste and wish there were more shapes to sort Perhaps when he s older he ll enjoy the letters as well but I doubt he ll still be interested Overall cute toy that holds his attention while many do not Main drawback is that there are only 4 shapes to sort 
4 0 It s a must have I bought this item based on previous reviews and recommendations and was not disappointed at all I love the color the material is easy to wash and most of all it keeps my baby warm and comfortable I have a bugaboo cameleon stroller and it fits perfectly My only recommendation would be for parents to purchase the toddler size rather than the infant size if your baby is older than 3 months The bag runs rather small so the size labels can be decieving Other than that what you see is what you get Worth every penny 
5 0 Nice Set We haven t used this set yet because our baby is due in June but have set it up in our crib The fabrics are very nice and contemporary looking The bumper fits well in our crib and the tags say all the fabrics are 100 cotton except the back side of the comforter which is a fleece type material and that is 100 polyester We are very happy with this set for our future little girl 
5 0 The best carseat This is the best carseat out there It s above the Peg Perego and Britax It weighs only 8 pounds so it doesn t break your arm and it is so easy to adjust The best feature is the base is designed so that it does NOT MOVE in the car I ve had Graco infant seats that completely flipped sideways when I made turns because they just weren t secure even with the special belt clip The only down side is the canopy is a bit floppy but it still does it s job 5 stars 
5 0 Essential Baby Item When my daughter was born I didn t know about swaddling and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep then put her in her crib and she d flail her arms wake up and cry and I had to start all over What a nightmare Then I figured out that since her arms wake her it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn t move them as much so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets It worked It became much easier to get her to sleep But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again When she was a little over a month old somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it It worked like a charm It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it and it stayed put My daughter started sleeping so much better I wish I found those blankets sooner it would ve saved me from so many sleepless nights 2 years later my son was born and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket Out of curiosity I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket and his arms wake him right away exactly the same as my daughter I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep 
4 0 Wrangler All Weather Umbrrella Stroller I and my wife have been very pleased with the Jeep Wrangler All Weather umbrella stroller Unlike the cheap umbrella stroller we used to have this one has better construction for the main folding support tubes Plus the handles are longer which means I 5 1 guy don t have to walk like a neanderthal to push my toddler The wheels do work pretty well on most surfaces even in very light snow The brakes are durable plastic and should last longer than my previous stroller The pouches are an added plus for storing snacks or bus passes My only disappointment has been the sun screen It is not that useful for blocking the sun from my son s eyes unless I pull it directly in front of him At that point he can t see anything That s OK if he falls asleep but otherwise he an independent todler will pull the sunscreen off if it blocks his view An added bonus would be a shoulder strap that I could use to carry the stroller for walking more than a few feet While it s light and compact for a stroller it is still cumbersome to carry if you have to fold it on the bus or walk anywhere with it Frequently my son wants to walk so I take the stroller with me because I know he ll get tired So again a shoulder strap would make toting the stroller much easier 
5 0 Good Investment I absolutely recommend this infant seat My son is almost 1 now and I am still using this seat It is fabulous for it s fabric options of colors and most importantly for it s roominess My son is on the chunky side being an exclusively breastfed baby He is still quite comfortable in this seat and I love being able to just attach him to the stroller as i walk my 4 year old into her her preschool The travel system as a whole catches the eyes of many and I am always stopped by people saying what a ride Well it is quite a ride If you buy this car seat it will last you for the entire FIRST YEAR of your baby s life Thank you Graco 
5 0 MUST HAVE FOR FIRST TIME BREASTFEEDERS I thought I would quit breastfeeding because my nipples were soo sore I saw my skin practically peel off my nipple when I started to breastfeed I placed the gelpads on and within two hours I could see the healing begin I tried olive oil nipple cream and didn t even want to try anything with lanolin because I read it wasn t good to ingest and it did not help at all This is a great way to sooth nipples naturally Just let your breast air dry with a little of the breast milk natural oils and then place the pads on the nipples they are LIFE SAVERS I think I only needed three pairs until my nipples were used to the rigors of breast feeding about 2 3 weeks DON T GIVE UP Try these first these work 
5 0 These bibs are great They re a little pricey but they work great They are easy to clean dry quickly and catch almost all the mess my boys make 
5 0 Wonderful bibs These bibs are the best My son is a messy eater and loves to drink water and spit it out When meal time is over his shirt is dry and all the water is in the handy pouch Must have for any new parent 
5 0 Best Bib Out There These are the BEST bibs I have tried many They do not peel crack etc I have used the same set of bibs for 2 years I just bought a set for my sister Worth the money 
4 0 Cup Holder not only for strollers This cup holder works great I attached it to a pull cart that I needed at work to put books etc in after I had foot surgery It also works on walkers 
5 0 My Favorite Sheet This is my favorite sheet for our daughter s crib It is a soft knit material and it washes up so well It fits easily onto the matress and I have never had a problem with it coming loose It is also such an adorable print 
5 0 Pump is great not sure why other ratings are so low I used this pump with my first child 2 years ago I tried to avoid paying the 300+ for the electric pump and this worked great I pumped when I returned to work and pumped for 3 months I loved not having to lug around the big electric pump to and from work every day It s much easier to clean than other manual pumps e g gerber because there are few parts to remove so your chance of losing or breaking parts is much lower The pump has a strong suction so I ve had no problem expressing milk e g up to 8 ounces or more each time I just had my 2nd child a month ago and already I m able to express 5+ ounces of milk at once I highly recommend this especially for occasional users no need to spend lots of money on fancy pumps with lots of removable breakable parts Also I am small chested so no you don t have to be well endowed for this to work 
5 0 Great manual pump I bought this pump after the Avent Isis failed me along with an electric pump The fact that this pump puts so much control over suction power in my hands is great Im able to empty each breast in 15 min or less sometimes Although its a little loud it is a manual pump and all manual pumps are a little noisy From reading the other reviews I think that alot of other mothers expected results from this pump that just arent reasonable Remember most manual pumps arent for constant expressing purposes or for bringing in milk supply If you read tegh package the manufacturer even says that they recommend the pump for emptying breasts occasionally like when spending time away from baby or breastfeeding moms who express once or twice a day so others can feed baby And they discourage it for working moms who have to pump everyday 
4 0 Great product but a little noisey I too was given this pump by a lactation nurse I pump at night after my baby goes to sleep I think the pump is Great It does what I need it to do and it very comfortable The only drawback is that is is kind of loud I would recommend this for a mother who needs to pump occassionally 
4 0 bigger breasts I bought this pump because it did have a hard plastic breast shield I had a double electric breast pump from first years that was soft plastic shields and I wasn t able to get a drop out because the shields didn t stay in place if you have biggre breasts I would suggest using this pump 
5 0 Wish I had found this system sooner The only bottles my daughter would take were the Playtex Original Nursers I am pumping at work with a Medela Pump in Style so I was pumping into the Medela bottles and then we were transfering the milk into the Playtex Drop ins to feed her It was a hassle and I never felt like all of the milk especially the fat made it from the Medela bottles into the Drop ins And then I heard about this kit and bought two immediately I have been so happy with being able to pump directly into the Drop ins The only downside you have to buy at least two kits if you double pump 
5 0 Perfect for a breastfeeding mom I really love this system and find it has met all my needs My son receives only breastmilk and this system has made it SO easy to express store and feed him with a bottle I have not found the liner cost to be a problem Nor was I disturbed by how many kits I needed to buy I think I bought 5 or 6 to make sure I had enough It just depends on how much you re going to need to store But you don t need many actual bottles since the milk doesn t have to be stored in them so the price evened out for me Besides it s much cheaper than buying formula I also don t care about exact measurements of how much my son eats I can get the measurement just by lifting the liner out and taking a look But when he s at the breast I don t know how much he s eaten so I don t track just how much he has from the bottle either I just make sure he has enough dirty diapers I find the system easy to use because I can express directly into a liner put the bottle into the freezer then remove the liner from the bottle when it s frozen This reduces the space needed When it s feeding time just pop one of them into a bottle heat and replace the cap with a nipple Easy 
5 0 One less thing to wash I love love loooooove this system I have been pumping exclusively for 4 months now and only found this about a month ago Before this I was pumping and storing in Medela bottles then transferring to Playtex liners before feeding Then I had to wash all the Medela bottles plus Playtex rings etc With this system I just pump right into the liners They are so easy to just grab out of the fridge and go I can warm a bottle with the car warmer using the self contained liners instead of having to bring a medela bottle to warm PLUS a playtex system Overall this has saved me several steps and less things to wash For the dad who said it threw off the ounce markers that is true However the liners themselves have ounce markings on them Just unscrew the top ring slightly so that the liner sinks back down and then read the ounce marker on the liner Easy I would not buy this system to use for storing frozen milk if you store a lot of it It would get too expensive for my tastes I have two sets and that is perfect for refrigerator storage Make sure you get two because each box only comes with one pump adapter Highly recommended by one happy mamma 
5 0 Excellent Booster We had the Britax Roundabout for our daughters and were so very pleased with them especially with the safety ratings When my older daughter was ready for a booster the choice was easy BRITAX My daughter loves her booster When I first got it in the mail we live overseas I was initially disappointed because I thought she wouldn t like the side supports but she loves them I would like to comment on two previous comments boosters are not FAA approved and shouldn t be used on an airplane Boosters are for use with shoulder seatbelts Second you do not secure a booster down because it is not a carseat It is used because children under 8 and 80 pounds are too small for a shoulder seatbelt I simply want to comment on those because Britax makes a great and SAFE product 
4 0 Seems secure a few small gripes This seems to be a secure seat and our almost 5 year old is comfortable in it The buckling system is a bit inconvenient you really have to get your head down there and put the strap in just right to get the side thingy snapped I wish our son could buckle himself in at this point but this seat makes it too hard It s also not a seat you want to do air travel with as it s unwieldy to carry around But all in all I would say it s a good purchase 
4 0 Rochester Crib The crib arrived much sooner than I was quoted I was told 3 weeks it came in 4 days Very prompt It is a beautiful crib I love it The directions are a bit lax It took my husband and I two hours to put it together Mainly because the instructions only showed how to put together the ends and the drawer and not the rest of the crib We finally figured it out Other than that the crib is beautiful 
5 0 saved my life these are the greatest invention in bottles ever these bottles helped my daughter so much no more gas no spills or leaks the only downside is they are hard to clean but who cares 
5 0 Extremely Sensitive detects even lungs moving or heartbeat I have tested this unit on maximum sensitivity At first I was bothered with the constant tick that is an indication that the baby is ok So I took the sensor out to see what would happen without the baby it stopped ticking The baby was not moving but just it s heart and or lungs working keeps the unit ticking It detects even when you blow on the sensor Maybe it should not be on maximum sensitivity since ceiling fans etc might activate it but I was truly amazed with the sensitivity You can turn the tick down so it is not too bothersome it is like a clock ticking about once a second when baby is ok if it stops ticking for about 30 seconds a noticeable alarm will ring 
5 0 Peace of mind This monitor has kept me from ever wondering if my baby is breathing in the middle of the night I test it frequently and it works There has NEVER been a false alarm everyone warned me I would lose my mind if it went off by accident it hasn t The only drawback the channel is not so clear there is static when you listen to it but the peace of mind knowing he is ok is worth every penny I have a cheaper fisher price monitor for when I just want to monitor noise during the day but I would not have another monitor for his bedroom 
5 0 Buy this monitor This monitor is by far the best baby item we have I love that I can sleep at night and the monitor will alert me if my son stops breathing We have been using it for 4 months and have had no false alarms You just have to remember to turn it off when you pick up the baby I did not have this monitor with my first child and I sure wish that I had It is a must have for any new mom who worries about sids whether this is your first or your fifth baby Well worth the added expense Don t even mess around with other monitors just get this one and get some sleep By far the BEST ITEM I own for my baby 
5 0 Ali s Mommy I love this sack And highly recommend it especially if your child likes to kick the blankets up over their heads Before I purchased this I found her sleeping with the coveres over her head twice 
5 0 Great Deal This is the perfect mattress for my little princess It s nice and cushy while providing the necessary firmness The vinyl cover is easy to wipe off if there are accidents It s also lightweight for easy sheet changings Sealy provides a solid trusted product Not necessary to spend a lot of money on a mattress your child will use for 2 4 years My baby sleeps comfortably on it every night and she s tough to please So I would definitely recommend this product to other parents 
4 0 Looks Beautiful Though Instruction Manual is Terrible The chest looks as in the picture and that is what I liked though the instruction manual can not get any worse than this My husband is very handy so he did not have such a hard time although it took him 5 hours to put together he got through it fine Instructions are not clear and they do not guide you right either but the chest looks nice in my baby room 
5 0 Great booster I bought this Dakota backless booster for my nearly 6 year old She previously was using a Jupiter Komfort Kruiser XL100 which I loved The Komfort Kruiser was a booster with a back and although it still fits her to this day she was eager to move into a backless booster I think the Dakota booster works great It gets her to the height she needs for the seatbelt but allows her to feel more like a big kid by not having a back This booster is a quality item and large enough to fit her until she will be old and large enough to no longer require a booster The pocket on the side is handy as well although does not work well with drinks I advise buying a bottle holder to put on the arm rest 
4 0 Nice Simple Booster This backless booster is a simple last step booster bottom for kids who are ready to buckle themselves and like to change where they sit and are old big enough to know their part The booster is light but well made Its use is super easy but the one piece arms help giude the passive restraint seat belts The fun color was a good bonus 
5 0 Convenient and Stylish It s so difficult to carry a huge diaper bag while having your baby in a carrier This product solves that problem And it s cute too I was shopping at Babys R Us recently and the sales girl asked where I got my super cute diaper bag carrier I told her and she insisted to her manager that the store start carrying the item no word yet on whether or not they will I have recommended this bag to all my friends and bought two as shower gifts It s the ultimate in convenience and fashion 
5 0 Outstanding bag It as a place for everything We ve used this since our baby was born three months ago It has a the perfect combination of space for baby accessories as well as your own It has two small external pockets for extra bottles and a large inside pouch where we keep most of the diapers and larger gear as well as inside compartments It also has a small cell phone pocket outside which we use The bag is excellent quality and not so large as to be awkward to carry around Our baby is still too small to use the convertible sling but I have seen it used on older children We ll be getting these as gifts for our friends who are expecting 
5 0 Wonderful entertainment My son is 5 months old and LOVES this jumper He can keep himself entertained and I am able to do some things with both hands Plus it s so much fun watching him bounce himself up and down laughing I love the tray around it It s big enough to set toys on but not get in the way Also the strap frame at the top makes it so easy to get him in and out We are going on vacation in a month and this WILL be making the trip 
4 0 pretty small this bag is great for a short trip it has enough space for a few pampers up to 2 bottles it depends on how well you can compact objects into a space im a pro with packing things away neatly in a small space so this bag works good for me 
5 0 Great Bag for any use I originally bought this bag for a trip to Disney World It held everything great stayed in place and was less cumbersome than a full backpack Although I was not using it to carry children s gear I carried an umbrella 3 bottles of water granola bars sun glasses cellphone keys wallet a baseball hat and small souvenirs and it always stayed put and fit great I am looking forward to using the bag as a diaper bag it has held up wonderfully as a vacation bag so far 
5 0 Great cover save yourself This is a very easy to use cloth diaper cover and we have very few leaks I had more leaks with disposables We are using these on our newborn and will continue to use them in the larger sizes I am very happy with all the money we are saving by using cloth and delighted with the ease of use of this product 
5 0 My favorite item of safari it is a little costy but worth the money it washes and dries perfectly also with hot water and blanket can be used in many ways since we have tiles in our whole appartment i love to keep the blanket on a little carpet for extra warmth and cleanliness a perfect place to play on when they are little and also to take along since it is very light weight once baby is older it can be used as a sleeping blanket or as a bed cover its size is large enough to last many years 
5 0 So glad I bought it I m a mother of a 21 month old I just got a puppy and was having a hard time managing the stroller AND the leash on our walks This backpack is perfect It fits me well and my daughter loves it She asks to stay in it when we re done I was worried about that because she never liked any of the baby carriers I ve tried before when she was younger You do have to toughen up your shoulders by taking shorter walks at first before going on any long hikes of course I don t understand the chest problem on one of the other reviews because the chest strap is adjustable long and sits just below the shoulders avoiding the busty area very well However it does come out of the box at the shortest setting so you have to loosen it to fit your frame The question of being able to close the frame with the child in it doesn t seem to be an issue on mine The stand part folds up easily under the child once the child is on your back You do need long enough arms to grab it behind you though It makes no difference to you or the child if you leave the frame in the open position during your walk but if you re in tight quarters you ll want to close it I did make the mistake of trying to put Aeryn s my daughter s feet behind me in the frame at first which made her knees rest uncomfortably on the frame The legs are supposed to go naturally forward toward either side of your waist The picture on the box helped me figure that out It is for kids from 6 months up to 36 months and comes with a clear rain shield that easily zips onto the retractable sun shield The rain shield is also helpful in windy conditions my daughter thinks it s cool and leans over to fog it with her breath It s not easy to do with a six month old puppy jumping around on you but I ve even managed to get into the straps and stand up from the floor with Aeryn in the pack I m reasonably fit and she s just under 30 pounds This thing is rugged comfortable good looking and has be prepared features like a cellphone holder and a matching fanny pack that can be carried on the frame if you d rather 
5 0 Great Backpack Great Price I am a six foot tall women with large size ribs and medium chest and this backpack fits me very well As I am large and this pack fits me I would think this would ajust to a small person well I especially like all the padding on the surface that meets your back I hike hills up to two hours with my seven month old 19 lbs in the pack without problems The built in shade cover is great as you dont have to put it on and off as needed The pack is very comfortable for both of us The interior of the pack also adjusts for the baby size and as mine grows taller I can drop him lower in the pack I looked at many other more expensive packs as I thought they would be better fitted out but this pack has all the features I wanted for a lower price I highly recommend this pack 
5 0 Good value for the price This was a gift and in shopping for a pack n play it seemed the best value for the price 
5 0 Baby is happy Baby is happy eating well What better praise for a bottle nipple can be given Note Fast flow is for age six months and up the slow medium flow nipples by Avent are just as good just for younger babies 
5 0 Becoming a good Eater my son was a very fussy bottle eater He would never finish his bottle until I switched to a faster flow nipple Now he finishes his bottle and is a much happier eater He became frustrated that the milk wasn t coming out fast enough for him and with the faster flow it was perfect He is much more content after a feeding and more relaxed Now we are both much happier and look forward to each feeding 
5 0 These bibs are great They re a little pricey but they work great They are easy to clean dry quickly and catch almost all the mess my boys make 
4 0 Pot a Gold Our grandson reciently came to live with us nearly 2 years old and he refused to even sit on a potty The day our 1st pott arrived I opened the package and set the potty up in our bathroom next to the adult version hopeing this location would help About 15 minutes later I noticed Drake had been very quiet As I searched the house for him I discovered him not only sitting on the pot but he had actually used it He is now doing very well with his training The product is well constructed easy to to set up and easy to use 
5 0 After three babies my original New Native sling is finally wearing out I received my original New Native sling as a baby shower gift back in 1997 I wore it nearly every day for 15 months and then again with babies 2 and 3 Now we are expecting our fourth baby and the fabric is a bit faded and worn we have the purple one so I thought it time to buy a second sling The original is still good as far as the stitching goes and we ll still use it but I m a bit tired of the purple color after nine years Pros This sling is the smallest as far as packing it with you It s a simple double band of fabric that can be folded up in your bag or purse easily Men don t mind wearing it at least my husband didn t it comes in basic solid colors and doesn t scream baby when you re out and about Many people couldn t tell I was wearing the baby when she was little It s a good place for the baby to nap and to cover you up a bit when you nurse once you figure that out It s more versatile than other types of baby carriers in that you can use it from newborn to toddler I ve even used it with two year olds for short periods when they are tired of walking and the stroller isn t an option You can carry the baby on your front or back with experience this is doable but mostly for older babies on your hip once your baby can sit strongly It s also easy to throw in the wash when the baby s diaper inevitably leaks or spits up all over it No complicated latches webbing or snaps to clean Cons If you get the wrong size the baby will hang too low and your back will hurt My original is the Large size based on chest measurements from the manufacturer but I m going to order a Medium this time My husband still likes the Large but he has a longer torso than I Newborns may need some support in the New Native sling otherwise you may feel they are swimming in the fabric I always use a tightly rolled up receiving blanket and place it in the sling first then lay the baby s head and back on top of it This pushes the baby up enough toward the opening so that you don t feel like she s lost in there Usually I only do this for the first few weeks After a while your baby will be big enough to peek out on her own and wave at people The trickiest thing with the New Native carrier is learning to sling the baby on your back which enables you to do things like cooking and unloading the dryer while your baby sleeps You have to put the baby in on your front first then shimmy the fabric around with the baby in it If you can master this the sling is ideal for the fussy baby or for all day babywearing Highly recommended Good value for your money 
5 0 Must have for colicky babies A friend recommened that I try her sling for my colicky baby Our dear daughter suffered with severe GERD and would cry for hours As soon as I placed her in the sling she would immediately relax It was like magic and truly kept me sane After doing some reading I found that this was not only great for colicky babies but was better for their spines than other types of carriers and so much easier to take with us Our daughter loved to be held and this helped tremendously When we go on trips I always take it with me as she is sure to tire of her stroller She loves hanging out in the sling and it is very versatile I recently tried one of those baby carriers that are like a backpack thing to take with us on a trip since our dear daughter has somewhat outgrown her old sling and hated it Bought another new native and am thrilled One of the absolute best purchases that I have made as far as baby gear goes 
5 0 Great seat for traveling We have taken this seat on three flights overseas and on a couple of domestic flights as well as on many car trips at home and abroad It is great It is quick and easy to install forward or backward on airplanes and in cars On some plane seats the buckle is under the childs bottom but the cushioning is adequate my son has never complained He seems very comfortable in it Baby Bargains recommended this seat for travel back when my son was a baby and I am online ordering one for my daughter right now If you expect to travel this seat is an essential It is light enough that lugging it around airports cruiseships and such is not a total pain although as with any seat it is nice to have a bag we ve done it both with and without 
4 0 Okay I don t know what one of the reviewies was talking about if you read the manual you will learn that you need to move the leg on the front so that the seat sits Level That will keep your childs head from falling forward If that fails go to Burlington Coat Factory and get a wedge to prop it up more to most moms I know this has been common purchase I think that it is a very Nice and Well built car seat I do agree that it would be nice to have the Seat Belt tabs so that you don t need the base but getting an extra base isn t a bad ideal anyways Remember you should always have your Local Police Department check your seats before your child rides in it this is usualy a free service and is often held at a local Babies R U 
4 0 My daughter loved this I have a independent child SHe will not let you help her do anything so when we got the the potty training stage she had to sit on the potty like mommy She refused to use those little potty chairs also she did not want to be lifted up and she was still to short to get up on her own by a step stool When I found this product she was estatic She started the day we got it and fully trained herself by the end of the week I agree the product if a bit Flimsy and could use another go at it All in all I do not think my daughter was in any danger using this product though Before you buy it though make sure you have a round toilet and not an oblong or else yes it will slide around The manufacture told me this over the phone when I called them about the issues I had read They said it is not made for every family and I agree you have to try something to see if it will work Unfortunatly ever child is different and has a mind of there own 
5 0 Great for potty training EARLY I was a little apprehensive about ordering this product as I read all of the negative comments I ordered it anyway because good comments described the potty as one that would benefit my son When it arrived earlier than expected I noticed that it was easy to assemble and that because it is not made with very thick plastic it probably wouldn t be a good idea to order this for BIG children who are potty training My son is 18 months old and 22 lbs and it is perfect for him sturdy enough for him to climb up and use the potty He really enjoys climbing up himself and it does encourage him to be more independent in the process I let him look at the box and we talked about how the little girl was going potty and he liked seeing the little girl on the box using the potty just like him So if your child is very big or potty training at 3+ years I wouldn t order this they don t need it I would just get a stool 
5 0 LOVE IT I love this chair We have traveled to several family members homes with the booster and it has worked so well I have also referred people to the web site to buy one for themselves 
5 0 Great for the car We love this seat It is great for keeping in the car for those times when you find yourself in a packed restaurant that is out of high chairs Or at mother inlaws without a highchair Or a family holiday dinner where there is no highchair When traveling with a little one or even just at the park or a sporting event There are so many uses for this great little seat It is extremely light weight and compact and comes with a carrying bag 
5 0 Traveling lifesaver I bought this product after reading the many positive reviews below and I was thoroughly satisfied My only complaint was actually with my luggage as the handle on my bag was a little short so I had to stoop a little while I was pushing pulling it Everyone who saw it thought it was the neatest invention ever especially other moms traveling with kids The strap is so simple it s genious just strap on the carseat and go It was a bit of a hassle restrapping at security but everything is a hassle at security Just make sure you have a few extra minutes to get everything back together and it s fine This is a great product that made what could have been a very difficult trip a breeze Bravo 
5 0 Economical and Convenient We used the travelling toddler on our vacation with our 11 month old son to Mexico We always buy him his own seat on the plane for his safety and it was a very convenient way to get through the airport with his seat and luggage He was attached to our rolling carry on curbside and off we went We were able to check our stroller and we had little to carry At 20 you can t beat the price Our friends had to carry their car seat stroller luggage and child and were wishing they would have bought the strap 
5 0 Wonderful invention I found this product after searching for ways to make traveling with my two year old easier She loved riding in her carseat through the airport and 6 people stopped me to ask how it worked The security agent said he wished all parents used this instead of trying to jam enormous strollers through the x ray machine 
5 0 affordable easy The item is so much cheaper than the alternative which is 200 It was easy to use and easy to store when not in use 
5 0 Neat Little Bowls The sizes are perfect especially the small one for my 5 month old The suction works fine so far but we will see as baby gets older 
4 0 Great with practice This is a great product It takes a little practice to get the right amount of water Disposables take much less b c they tend to trap the steam etc I don t see how complaints about burning your hands could possibly be true Sure it boils the water it has to make steam But why would you reach inside there There is no reason I can think of why you d ever need to do that And with the first 2 children we used this on I ve never had a bottle even become remotely stuck snug you name it not even close so don t worry about it I ve used Avent 4oz and 9oz bottles as well as Playtex disposable bag bottles It s not really a good use of money if you re just using formula just make it with warm water But if you re nursing your child and want dad to be able to help at night this is a must have 
5 0 MUST HAVE This is one of my favorite products I have purchased as a new mommy I love it It warms the Avent bottles great It took some trials to determine how much water to add but now I have it down great You can over heat and then you will burn yourself if your not careful It is not like the negative reviews if you pay attention and use the right amount of water It DOES NOT warm the Playtex Ventair bottles I guess because of the vent but I preferred the Avent bottles anyway The cooler DOES keep bottles cold for up to 8 hours if you remember to freeze the freezer pack each day We have a 2 story house and this helped us so much I have the other First year single warmer also and it is in my kitchen and it is great as well This is definitly worth the money 
4 0 POTTY WITH PRIDE My grand daughter is so proud of her big girl potty seat I would have given it a rating of 5 but she said the rim hurts her 
5 0 yay Finally found this item I couldn t find this anywhere locally It is easy for the kids to use and it is easy to clean 
5 0 Primo Privy I am impressed with this seat This seat is far better made than the seat that was on my toilet The training booklet that came with the seat has stickers on 4 different themes PottyPrincess PottyPirate PottyPony and PottySaurus I called the free line 87 POTTYPAL and was able to buy the stool a little cheaper than Amazon s set and 4 dolls to accompany the stickers as rewards I am completely satisfied with the safety and sanitation of this product 
4 0 Fun toy some minor problems My daughter got this toy when she was 2 months old and she still loves it at 8 months It was the only toy that would keep her entertained on car trips at first I took one star off due to some minor problems 1 it is not machine washable unless you don t mind loosing the barking sound and 2 the battery can t be replaced 
5 0 First toy my daughter EVER reached for Pupsqueak is wonderful I am a picky mother about toys I hate toys that are too loud too commercial too cheesy too useless I have high standards But Pupsqueak gets my picky mom seal of approval wholeheartedly Here s why I am very blessed to have a mother who loves to send my children lots of goodies While it s easy to know what to send a 4 year old with distinct likes and interests it can be harder to gauge what a twelve week old baby will enjoy We have no shortage of toys and gadgets to entertain our new daughter with and she clearly enjoys some of them kicking legs cooing waving arms etc The Pupsqueak however took it to a different level She LOVES this thing We showed it to her around 11 12 weeks old and she immediately reacted She laughed she kicked all the signs Then she reached for the little black and white patterned bone that hangs down We were so excited and she s had it attached to the bar on her carseat ever since The real test however was our 10 hour drive from Louisiana to Kentucky for the Thanksgiving holidays But Pupsqueak came through for us with flying colors anytime she would get fussy I could reach back and shake him a bit so he would jingle softly and she would be happy again After my arm would get tired I d make sure he was adjusted where she could get at him and she would at not yet 4 months bat at it herself Pupsqueak is a wonderful toy with a soft gently jingle for young babies and a funny bark that even makes my four year old laugh for older babies He is definitely top dog in my book 
5 0 Love m Had them all My twins loved this one so much we purchased all styles available at the time 
4 0 Decent car seat We like this car seat for the price we paid Likes love the easily adjustable belts we often let the straps out a lot to get her in it without her being uncomfortable and then tighten it appropriately The 5 point harness is great Love that the car seat is compatible with different strollers Dislikes It doesn t recline as much as we d like and the head padding is superficial Our baby s head tends to fall forward a lot The sun canopy seems like it was designed as an afterthought it certainly works more than adequately but doesn t move easily Finally the handle is difficult to move from position to position Overall though for the price it s a good seat 
5 0 Beautiful I was very pleased when I saw just how beautiful this car seat was Now that my daughter is 3 months old I feel I can give it a review I read many things about complaints but I just don t have any Everything works well on it It doesn t fit well in all carts but carts weren t made for baby carriers to fit in them so it s not a bad thing about the car seat itself All infant carriers will have the same problem I recommend this to anyone who wants an infant carrier and likes how it looks It s pretty and fits great in it s stroller All in all it s a great buy Although my next time around I m passing up the infant carrier and going Britax They re much safer imo from what I ve read and heard 
5 0 What a great seat I have always had Graco infant seats for my children I got this one for baby number 4 and love it It is so cute And the cover is just wonderful for the fall and winter months Also I LOVE the color of it 
4 0 Happy with it but This was a great carseat and carrier Easy to install with the level indicator A few drawbacks Once my daughter was a few months old it got really heavy to carry around She also outgrew it by 6 months The harness needs to be longer It doesn t release enough to get taller babies in and out comfortably And for some reason the release levers to move the handle to get the baby in and out were really stiff and difficult to use My mother in law has arthritis and ended up having to either carry the carseat with both arms like a bundle of wood because she couldn t move the handle up or try to slide my daughter out of the top or bottom because she couldn t move the handle back My advice before you buy realisticly test everything on it in the store and compare it directly to another brand 
4 0 Good for small to average babies and short distance carrying Baby size My daughter started out at just over 5 lbs and this seat fit her well from the beginning The straps have adjusted easily as she s rapidly grown I haven t had the adjustment problems other reviewers had The head support worked well too at first we had to use a rolled towel inside it for her tiny head A baby s head will not fall forward as long as the seat is properly leveled according to the convenient indicator on the side of the seat but if the angle is even slightly off this can happen easily The seat can only be leveled in the center seat of some sedan backseats like my Toyota Camry because of this angle requirement but there are leveling accessories you can buy to help with this issue Portability I love the stay in car base which I found easy to install properly It s also very easy to snap the carrier portion in and out and very obvious whether the carrier is secure or not An extra base is great for families with multiple cars as either parent can quickly snap the seat in and go The carrier portion is convenient for quick trips in and out of the car but I find it much too heavy to comfortably carry long distances with a baby over 10 lbs and I m fairly strong It will not fit securely enough for my taste in the child seat portion of a grocery cart but it does fit well when placed sideways across the larger basket portion I just stash groceries in the large space left underneath the carrier and in the rest of the basket The Snap n Go stroller is great if you re taking this seat farther from your car It s much more lightweight than the large travel system Graco also sells with this seat It s easy to maneuver and comfortable for most people to push but a little too short if you re much taller than 6 ft Durability I can t comment on the seat s lifespan as we ve only been using it a little over 2 months A few times I have noticed the sticking carrier handle other reviewers mentioned but it doesn t happen often The canopy seems rather flimsy to me but we only use it occasionally when using the stroller so it hasn t been an issue so far Other considerations Windsor seems to be a fairly gender neutral pattern if this matters to you My baby wears a lot of yellow clothes and people seem to assume she s a boy about 60 of the time when she s in this seat The carrier handle has several different positions up for carrying flat for carseat use and down for resting the carrier portion on a flat surface without letting it wobble With the handle left up the wobble enabled carrier portion can be rocked slightly on the floor to stall a fussy baby as you try to finish an errand before she erupts I would buy this seat again Its only drawbacks are its weight probably unavoidable since it s a carseat and must be sturdy and the rather stringent placement requirement for leveling but at least the indicator lets you know about this problem 
5 0 Great toy My daughter received this as a gift from Mommy when she was about 3 1 2 months At first she was petrified of having the objects so close to her face but if you take off a ring take it higher your child will really appreciate the colors and enjoy the toy The only complaint I have is the mirror it comes with still frightens my child The mirror distorts your child s vision so I took it off and purchased some other hanging toys for it My daughter loves it she could be eating her breakfast or sitting in her swing and all she ll do is stare at her playmat A definite must for all parents 
5 0 Great for securing not germ protection This seat is wonderful My daughter can t quite sit on her own yet but this keeps her secure and comfortable Make sure you loop the belt around your child and the cart or high chair This seat is small and very easy to use it s a great product 
4 0 We like this monitor We got this monitor because of other reviews we read about it We have a Graco for our daughter and it picks up so much static and other back round noice You can hardly hear her on it The Baby Quiet Sounds works great as far as being able to hear the baby clearly The receiver eats up the batteries fast and has some fed back with only batterie use Our Graco does that too so I don t know if that is the norm with monitors The sound is the best when pluged in The nightlight is great The humidity function I have not figured out as of yet It say s it is 19 in every room and I don t know that is correct The temp works fine I have not played enough with it yet to set the controls and how it works I like that the time is on the receiver and that it lights up to see it at night time I haven t used the timer yet but could see how it could be helpful Over all like my choice in the monitor 
5 0 Exactly what we needed We heat our home with a coal stove so when it comes time to put the baby down I worry that the room might become too cold With this monitor I can keep an ear on the baby at the same time as keeping an eye on the temperature and humidity level in her room The humidity level comes in handy during cold season I ve found The night light on this monitor is great it s very adjustable or you can shut it off altogether I ve not owned it very long so I can t comment on durability yet but so far so good My has dropped the parent receiver once or twice and it s still fine I would definitely recommend this monitor thank God the price was right too 
4 0 GoodValue I am quite satisfied with this product overall Sometimes it is too sensative and gets electrical interferrence During armer weaather when the window was opened I also picked up air traffic but over all it is a very good product 
5 0 I wouldn t still be nursing if I didn t have this pump I ve been using this pump for ten months now and it is the main reason I m still nursing my little girl I went back to work when she was four months old and started pumping three times per day At first it was hard to try to be productive for the 20 minutes per session I was pumping because you really do have to hold the breast shield to the breast suction isn t enough Then I got the Easy Expression Hands free Bustier which has solved that problem I can now do e mail talk on conference calls etc while I m pumping so I don t waste time at work and continue to give my baby the benefits of human milk I m able to fit four standard bottles and two of the smaller slimmer Medela bottles into the small cooler with the ice pack so I don t think the cooler is too small Also I don t think the cooler was meant to be transported in the backpack If you don t try to cram the cooler in the backpack there s no problem with storage in the backpack I also reccomend the Medela Micro Steam bags for working moms who choose to pump once they go back to work Also I don t think the suction is too hard yes it may be uncomfortable for the first minute or two until the pressure of engorgement has been reduced but it is by no means painful Pain is what I experience when my daughter bites with her new razor sharp teeth 
5 0 Medela is the best When our first child was born my wife purchased the lower model from Medela With the second child and her having to go back to work sooner we decided to go with this pump and are very satisfied She uses it everyday when she is at work The price might be higher than others but think about all of the money you will save on formul 
5 0 Worth every penny The PISA is an amazing pump and the cost is equal to a few months of formula so my pump has already paid for itself used for 6 months and still going strong I ve tried generic immitations and they just don t compare Invest your money in the real thing it s worth it 
5 0 One of the best purchases ever I am so greatfull to this pump I was able to exclusively breastfeed two children for a year each while working full time taking vacations without the kids etc I also have the car adapter which is awesome I was able to pump to and from my work which is over an hour away while driving I only recommend that for breatfeeding pumping pros The warranty is only good for a year but mine is now three years old and still going strong We are expecting our third child and I hope my pump holds up for another year if not I will still probably spend the money on another pump like this one Best of luck 
5 0 Best potty ever I was looking for something very simple for my little boy and had a lots of troubles Most of the potties I looked at were constructed in a manner of a throne or a spaceship and I didn t want anything like that This potty is very simple and easy to wash and doesn t have no distracting blings Just what the doctor prescribed 
5 0 Awesome for little ones This potty is just right for our little boy He seemed comfortable from the first time we placed him on it His little feet touch the ground and the shape not only supports him but also protects for little boy mishaps and gives him something to hold on to while bearing down I would definitely recommend this especially if you are starting early 
5 0 A godsent Superb product I cannot say enough positive things about this item I absoloutely loved the fact that it helped to keep my son warm on cool nights but it was safe enough for him to use in his crib every night This item needs to be brought mainstream so that it can be available to all parents for their kids 
5 0 they re great I got four of these sleepsacks two fleece and two cotton I found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes but it didn t effect the product They are wonderful If you are buying for a newborn get the 6 12 month size since it ll last a bit longer I ended up giving away the 0 6 month size when my baby was only 3 months old as it was getting a bit small 
5 0 five stars is not enough My son has been wearing the halo sleep sack since the day he came home from the hospital Being a winter baby it was the best thing in the world to know that he would be warm and not have to worry about loose blankets He began sleeping through the night at 7 weeks old I think the sleep sack gives him a feeling of security He was never able to sleep without being in it He is now 30 months old and still won t go to sleep unless he is in his sleep sack We had to have a friend of ours who is a seamstress add additional material to the bottom because he became to tall for it That is how much he loves his sleep sack It is by far the best thing I ever bought for my son 
5 0 Great for little squirmers Like any parent I was concerned about SIDS so the SleepSack seemed like the perfect alternative to blankets Little did I know I would come to LOVE the SleepSack for it s warming capabilities After a few months under their belt babies get VERY squirmy in the middle of the night so blankets are useless and dangerous So I relied heavily on the SleepSacks to keep my little guy warm even after the risk of SIDS passed They come in fleece for winter months and cotton for warmer months and they re generous in size so they are not outgrown easily I only wish I d purchased them in yellow or white in case my next baby is the opposite sex 
5 0 a definite must my baby is now 5 months old and we ve been using the Halo sleep sac since she started moving around more I was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face Now I never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night This product really gives me peace of mind and I ll be sure to give this to any new parent friends 
5 0 great for elmo lovers my son is a very picky eater but loves elmo this set is adorable and practical he loves the spoon and getting his food off the plate and bowl th eonly thing to be ware of is it gets VERY hot in the microwave even if you just put it in for 20 seconds it must cool dow 
5 0 I LOVE THIS I don t know what the reviewers before me were talking about I use this at Kroger Giant Eagle and Target and don t have any problems with it fitting a regular buggy at the store It s sturdy and easy to use Don t pass this one up 
4 0 Great monitor Good things 1 No interference We live in a residential neighborhood in the suburbs 2 Connects with no problem two stories down with the baby on 2nd floor and the monitor in the basement I ve even used it out in the yard without any loss of connection problems 3 You can hear pretty much everything happening in the nursery Only one bad thing the belt clips on the parent units are practically useless They are not large enough to stay on a belt oe waistband with any normal amount of movement and the lip at the end of the clip digs into your side if you have the unit on your waistband 
5 0 Great Monitor We struggled with 2 different monitors before we got the imonitor by graco The first 2 we tried had so much static and interference that they were useless I can t explain how delighted my wife and I were to hook up this monitor and hear nothing but the sounds of our baby It was better than Christmas morning when we were kids We have wireless internet cell phones cordless phones basically if its electronic we got it Despite all the potential for interfence the Graco delivers chrystal clear sound with absolutely no interference A must buy for any parent 
5 0 bright and cheerful the zanzibar collection is bright and cheerful animal images are unusually cute i mounted the wall hangings with velcro so they can be taken off the wall the baby enjoys touching them and seeing them close up 
4 0 Cute but ribbon hooks could be better made This item was very cute The different textures just like the bedding set are a lot of fun I hung 2 on the wall above my sons changing table and he loves to look at them My only complaint is the ribbon loops they ve sewn on to hang them Mine were not sewn into the middle of the square and so they originally hung uneven You can easily use a nail or other type of homemade hook though 
5 0 no issue hanging adorable These wall hangings are lovely The different textures are very cool Maybe mine were different than everyone elses but they came with little ribbon loops on the back and i don t get why there s an issue hanging them They re very very cute and look adorable in the room 
4 0 easy fix for hanging problem I was given these wall hangings as a present I love them and they make the room look great We also were presented with the problem of how to hang them There is what seems to be a dowel pocket in the back but that seemed too complicated to deal with Therefore my husband and I attached a safty pin to the back of each square in the center at the top My husband then used a finish nail in the wall and used the safty pin to hang over the nail The pin is low enough so you do not see it or the nail the square is hanging on It was easy to do and the wall hangings look great I thought there would be a problem with getting them to be straight but they are light enough to manipulate and stay where they are placed I hope this helps others with this problem I still wonder though why on earth the company didn t foresee this problem in the first place 
5 0 No More Searching Through the Diaper Bag Love it love it love it No more digging through the diaper bag or my purse for dirty lint covered binkies It could be a little bigger for my toddlers binky but they do fit inside and it s a great idea 
5 0 Worth EVERY cent I already have a single jogging stroller not a BOB and have been happy with it We are in the process of adopting our second child which we had less than 24 hours notice about so a lot of money is going to legal costs baby stuff and my time off of work and as a result I was concerned about spending this much on a stroller but is was worth every cent With the BOB Duallie I am ecstatic overjoyed delighted thrilled and looking forward to my next trip out For my first trip out I put my 2 year old and 11 week old in and went for a six mile walk The trip was so smooth both kids slept for most of the time The seats recline enough so that my baby is nearly flat no problems with his head bobbing around pardon the pun The shocks give this stroller an incredibly smooth ride which transits to less work for my arms I didn t realize how much effort went into the other stroller pushing it and turning it The smooth ride also allowed us to walk faster a plus when trying to lose weight The stroller can turn in circles on itself allowing for extremely sharp turns Very nice especially when inside a small store like Starbucks The windows up top are well placed enough that I can actually see my kid s face not just their little bodies The straps are the easiest to adjust of any stroller I ve used There is extra padding along the shoulder straps to cushion the kid s shoulders The straps at the waist don t come out of the sides this is kinda hard to explain the strap is attached in the center of the seat and the sides come around the child more like a belt and allowing for a snugger fit Even my 70 year old mother had a great time pushing the stroller As for the Mesa Orange it is more like a burnt orange with brown trim and I am very glad I got it It is not at all like the neon orange it appears in some of the photos Be sure to get the tray I forgot to order it with the stroller The storage is a little shallow but being double wide there is still plenty of room for stuff 
5 0 Was a gift got alot of thanks I bought this as a gift can t give much opinion she told me she loved them so I give it 5 stars Maybe that s not a fair review but it s breast pads They are always useful LO 
5 0 Confusing Amazon Picture Variety Pack I bought the 100 pack thinking it was all the ultra thin kind which I love come to find out only 60 of them are ultra thin Some of the women on here complain about having to change their pads often you really are supposed to do that because otherwise you will get an breast infection especially if you live in the south where it s warm and humid I recommend the ultra thin pads the other ones that come in the variety pack are just OK 
5 0 Can t Go Wrong When I had my daughter I had no clue where to begin with breast pads so I bought several different types A friend gave me these at my baby shower because they were here favorite I wish I had never wasted money on the other pads I did have to change these pads more often than some of the other brands It was worth it because they were so much more comfortable I didn t have any chaffing like with most others Also they stayed in place ten times better than any pads with adhesive 
5 0 The best choice for the task These are the best pads for the task the ultra thin pads are great for during the day they dont leak and are very breathable the heavier flow pads are great for overnight protection depending on the amount of liquid that you are leaking i am now nursing my 2nd daughter and i will forever use these pads the variety pack also offers the best value for your dollar try every kind you get samples are free so use them but when you have to buy these are the most natural and positivly the best 
4 0 sturdy bottle holder it is very sturdy but the brush broke after only 3 weeks i have searched the web and can t find anywhere to buy a replacement brush for this item so the whole thing doesn t look quite as good with a brush that doesn t match 
4 0 best I ve found for video Bought 2 different monitors this one has great features such as the motion sensor auto and scan settings The night vision is weak but daytime looks great Better reception than the other video monitor I bought but not having good night vision is a drawback I really bought the video monitors for keeping an eye on my mother who has alzheimers but using the 2 cameras comes in handy for both baby and mom None of these seem to be as quiet as just a regular baby monitor without video but it is very comforting to see and not just hear It is the best one that I ve found on the market 
5 0 Don t fly without it We purchased this carrier for our sons car seat 4 years ago For perspective we are heavy travelers with 4 6 international trips year and always bring our son s car seat along This carrier has been indispensable for us It fits our large Britax Roundabout plus has space for a bag of diapers soft toys or the extra shopping from our trips We use the back pack or wheels to tote it around airports or onto planes As our son grew large enought to not need the seat on the plane we simply check it through as a piece of luggage The material is lightweight and we have had a few small tears along the bottom of the bag but we were able to repair them easily enough by ourselves with needle and thread We just adopted a second child and bought the same carrier again for her car seat as well 
5 0 lifesaver If you are flying alone with a small child you should not go without this It s a tight fit but it works 
4 0 Good idea poor quality My husband purchased this bag for me when I recently took a trip solo with my daughter It seemed to be more troublesome than helpful I ended up using the backpack strap to pull the bag because I could not pull using the regular strap in a comfortable positition On the 1st flight the bag ripped at the seam on the bottom from scraping on the floor When I arrived at my destination I restitched the bag and thought that maybe I had been careless in my handling On the return flight we had to do more walking since the airport was a little bigger though it was still a small airport When I arrived at my destination the bag had completely separated along the bottom stitch and my car seat base had been scratched and mared as a result The damage to the bag is so bad that I can never use it again This bag should be labeled as disposable Though this is a good concept there needs to be better planning on the overall design and quality I would NOT recommend this product and will think twice before purchasing any other products from this manufacturer 
5 0 Graco No BackTurbo Booster Car Seat Red Any easy to use lightweight booster carseat Highest scores from Consumer Reports made it our first choice 
5 0 Great low cost booster Our second one for a second child We use one with a back one without Easy to use comfortable solid A good choice for a booster seat at a good price 
4 0 Good stroller for the price We like this stroller It seems to be pretty durable and its weight and portability shoulder strap make it ideal for trips especially in airports My husband has a hard time pushing it sometimes because he is so tall 6 4 but it is fine for me 5 3 We like it for our 5 month old son because he is able to recline but still sit up enough to watch what s going on He can hold his head up well but isn t sitting up unsupported yet so the various levels of the reclining back are nice Overall a good stroller for the price 
5 0 Great for older kids and babies We bought two of these to take on a family trip We chose these both for the price and for the higher weight tolerance 45 lb Our 40 pound six year old can swap places with a sibling when he gets tired during a long day at the zoo They recline far enough for an infant also But our 10 month old preferred to sit forward and hold onto the front bar to take in the sights The strollers are compact and light The underneath storage mesh can hold a purse and small diaper bag There is another pocket on the back that can hold a water bottle as well as a latch that can hold small items that have handles The stroller was also easy to maneuver We are very pleased with our purchase The stoller can even hold a Combi carseat but it didn t work with our Graco 
5 0 WONDERFUL I absolutely LOVE these paci keepers and highly recommend them They are the only ones that my son doesn t manage to rip off of himself I got so tired of trying to reach over the backseat to find a dropped paci while my son was in a rear facing car seat That made for a horrible trip I purchased these and they are awesome 
5 0 great gift baby package put together well with a nice assortment of items in the bag nice gift all by itself for the expectant mo 
5 0 Can t do without it I have this exact same soft light green deluxe pillow I bought the pillow when she was about 2 weeks old And I have been wearing it almost all day long every day since She is 11 weeks old today She is so comfortable when nursing on this pillow The cushion is made of firm foam She falls asleep on the pillow while it is around my waist Even when she s not nursing or napping the pillow helps me to support her weight when I m sitting or standing It fits me very comfortably even though I m plus size The only drawback is that I need to order an additional slipcover because it can only be hung to dry although it is machine washable I really love this fabric but apparently this fabric is not available to purchase separately as a slipcover so I guess I ll try the oatmeal twill cover 
5 0 Superbib The best bib around Wash and dry and large enough to catch everything I will never again use another bib 
5 0 The best bibs ever have used these bibs for two kids now wow do they last and unlike some bibs these can go right in the washer and dryer well worth the money Still using them for my messy 3 year old 
4 0 Love the car seat disappointed with the shipping The car seat itself is awesome but the condition it arrived in was awful The box was smashed and caved in and it had been exposed to rain or moisture of some kind There was nothing covering the seat like a plastic bag so debris had gotten into the box and soiled the material on the seat It was a gift for my Grandson for Christmas so I didn t have time to return it and hope for a timely return It took alot of time and effort to clean the spots off the seat Simply packing the seat with a plastic bag over it would have made alot more sense to me 
5 0 I love this stroller This stroller holds up to 55 lbs unlike most umbrella strollers which only hold 35 lbs I love the raised handle bars They cause less strain on your shoulders and back There is a roomy basket under the seat which is a great bonus The 8 wheels make it easier to steer and push over rocks or grass Once my son was able to sit up on his own I have used an umbrella stroller exclusively This is hands down the best one I have ever had It is also very modern looking in black and gray 
4 0 Combi base The base seems to be high quality It is sturdy and easy to install It is very easy to attach and unattach the car seat Other than being pricey there is no complaints 
4 0 Tike Tech All Terrain Double Jogging Stroller Pacific Blue When we first got the stroller it pulled to the left significantly but we got on the phone with Tike Tech and they were extremely helpful and accomodating The stoller works great now I have taken it running with my two girls it is very stable and drives smoothly 
4 0 great jogging outdoor stroller I own a lot of strollers for my twin sons this one the duoglider two small single strollers and a double umbrella stroller and I absolutely LOVE this one First of all if you want to be a satisfied customer you have to know what the purpose of the stroller is which is for jogging or maneuvering outdoors on rough terrain My husband jogs with the stroller at least once a week and has no complaints but I on the other hand just adore it for the outdoors The wheels go over almost any surface including gravel dirt grass concrete brick sand boardwalk anything I love it The seats both fully recline individually and when they do the rear of the seat is mesh so you can see your child from behind although you would most likely have to bend down to get a good look The five point harness on a jogger is a MUST HAVE and this model even comes with comfortable pads as well The basket is HUGE and holds everything we need for a day at the beach park walk around the block which is very important to me It is also removable but I don t see why it would be advantageous to take it off Plenty of other storage is available behind the seats as well handy little pockets and pouches to store little knick knacks Considering the type of stroller it is it folds very easily and I can fit it in the rear of my minivan after removing the rear and front tires which is equally as easy to do rear tires come off with the push of a button and the front has an easy to use release mechanism The canopy is enormous and proves for GREAT sun protection when needed The breaks are FANTASTIC and stop the stroller in its tracks which is very important if you are jogging and need to stop quickly according to my husband anyway The included wind rain shield is also very convenient can be left rolled up to the top of the canopy incase there is a chance of rain you don t have to work for 5 minutes to attach it and get the kiddos wet but I do wish it also came with mesh covers for mosquitos and other bugs I do dislike the fact that it is EXTREMELY difficult to turn although I have kind of gotten it down to a science you need to be prepared for the turn and tilt the stroller a bit the turn is very wide and not that smooth I think it would be better if it had a swivel wheel which had the option to lock in place for jogging a swivel wheel would actually be extremely dangerous if jogging as you could lose control of the stroller but that s just me personally The baskets are near impossible to access if both seats are reclined all the way and I have had to wake sleeping babies on a few occasions that s why I have learned to put things such as my cell phone and wallet in the canopy pouches so I don t have to constantly go into the basket The canopy is quite large and if you are not using it its quite a pain to retract as it doesn t go back neatly and if its a windy day the canopy doesn t always stay up If you are looking for a good stroller for outdoor use and don t mind the large size or getting used to turning then I highly recommend the Tike Tech 
4 0 Step One Have the stroller delivered I am sure this is a good stroller that s why I bought it My review is more of a word of caution this thing takes forever to arrive Don t be fooled Usually ships within 24 hours really means May ship sometime As of 2 8 06 our stroller has not arrived It was ordered January 1 2006 It is not even slated to ship for another week we ll see Meanwhile the local store has several in stock My advice for anyone trying to time this as a gift or for a trip or other occasion go to your local store Otherwise be prepared to wait a very long time 
5 0 The best thing for eating out This is the greatest product They stick to every restaurant table I have ever secured them to are lightweight easy to pack and fun for my daughter to look at Every time I pull one out of the diaper bag she says Elmo Elmo Elmo They keep the germs away from her and the clean up is so simple I wouldn t do without them they are great 
5 0 Great item Table toppers are an awesome product We don t leave the house without them It gives our daughter a clean area to eat and helps the waithelp there is no mess when we leave because it is contained on the Table Topper We just wrap it up after her meal and toss the whole thing The different designs also entertain our daughter while waiting for our food Other people not only parents ask about the Table Toppers and comment about them because it is such a convenient and easy to use product 
5 0 SAFEST OUT THERE I did A TON of research on convertible infant toddler car seats before my son outgrew his Graco SnugRide at 4 months Consumer Reports gave this and another seat the highest safety ratings this seat had the highest rating of all Britax convertible seats I chose this seat because it has EPS side impact protection under the carseat cover It s worth the extra money because it s your child s life Also it s really easy to tighten and loosen the straps and the cover is really silky and comfortable My son falls asleep within minutes of pulling out of the driveway My only gripes are that none of the existing toddler pillow neck head supports fit into the seat but that may be a problem with the manufacturers of the supports not Britax Also the straps don t have soft covers to keep them from digging into my son s neck I just bought some soft terrycloth ones from Babies R Us for 4 99 It works 
4 0 Nifty Baby Gadget If you have an ipod or mp3 player I d recommend getting this I think the baby is going to love it I bought it last week and tested it out our baby hasn t been born yet The speakers are plenty loud enough for a baby s crib or room IMO and I m 1 2 deaf I also like the little nightlight on it that changes color My only criticism is that it takes batteries no AC adapter We may invest in a rechargeable set of batteries if it uses batteries up quickly For 20 I think it s great 
4 0 Great product but batteries only power I was actually surprised at how good the sound quality is from this iCrib sound system It has very nice features like a 15min or 30min shutdown timer so you can put the baby to bed with music and then the iCrib will shut down after the specified time The nightlight is also really neat as it cycles between four different colors The only problem with this product is that it cannot run on AC only on batteries so we ll be buying lots of batteries over the next couple of years but otherwise this is a great product Edit After further consideration I would drop the rating to 3 stars for two reasons First I have found the lack of an AC power source to be very inconvenient Second as the batteries wear down the sound quality from the speakers deteriorates significantly 
4 0 Very Nice Product for the money This Crib is well built and functional The drawer is a nice and convenient feature The finish is good for an inexpensive crib Assembly was easy with good instructions included We plan on using this crib for our next baby as well 
5 0 Love it Just love it I had the Jeep tandem and it was nice until my son got so big 40 lbs 39 inches you couldn t steer it very well The BOB is amazing I have a 3 yr 1 yr old You can t feel the weight difference It rides so nicely Both my children are very tall heavy dense for their age and my eldest has plenty of room to grow which was my biggest concern My husband just loves the shocks go figure It compacts nicely and if you need it even more compact the wheels come off in a snap and can be stored in the seat It s amazing I m so glad I purchased it REI has a great price on it 400+ tried Ebay too but REI was best Have fun in your stroller search and good luck 
5 0 great for spring baby i got this for my baby due in march even though i live in new england area i knew the original bundle me would be too heavy its perfect wieght for the 50 75 degree weather it stays on the infant carseat at all times and that way my husband will never forget to have a blanket for the baby it washes well too if you do get a day here and there when its a lot warmer and you don t need it then the top part zips off and you don t have to take baby out and remove the entire product then the next chilly day zip the top back on great all around 
5 0 tigger bounce seat This is a well constructed cute bounce seat and my baby loves it I am very pleased with the purchas 
4 0 get s the job done this baby gate is ideal for the size and price i had shopped tons of stores and websites before i had found this gate the hardware mount eye hooks are not the sturdiest but this gate definately gets the job done 
5 0 Good as Pet Gate When it comes to using this for your children you d have to first know what your needs are I can t imagine it stopping any determined child without some reinforcing it would be more like a psychological barrier But depending on their temperament and age it may be good to deter them from getting to things they shouldn t have I ordered this to use for my puppy In my case I don t have the problem of her pushing on it so I can t say how long it would last through that For this price I was quite happy with the quality and it was amazingly simply to install 
4 0 Great Product Use this gate for our 9 month old son we have an extra wide opening One minor drawback is the screws seem to get a little loose and have to be tightened every once in awhile All and all it is a very good product 
5 0 great product and really fast shipping This jogger is great I love the quick fold feature and my daughter seems very comfy in it no complaints in fact she seems to look forward to going on runs w mo 
5 0 Great stroller easy to fold This a wonderful stroller I have a large 35lb 2yr old and he is very comfortable Great folding mechanism Folding is easy and I can do it with one hand Nice pockets for storage 
4 0 Great System But Not Perfect Just received this set and my wife and I love it The construction is very solid but not too bulky for us The micro fabric seems to be in high quality and goes along nicely with our furniture The only two complains are 1 The handle s height is not adjustable which seems a bit too high to us I am 5 6 BTW and 2 it would be great to have a hand break i e wheel lock button on the handle We previously thought the red button on the handle is a wheel lock but it is not it is the collapse expand button instead Despite these imperfection we feel it much worth the 195 we paid for 
4 0 just got it in was a snap to put together very soft for baby moves with ease takes some getting used to on putting the carseat in the stroller but that s the only problem 
5 0 Great for pumping I had to return to work after my second daughter was born and had no place to pump I bought this and pumped in my car for several months Great 
5 0 It works It does indeed adapt it so you can run the thing in the car My wife used it on a cross country trip we took and it basically saved our lives Well not our lives but it does work 
4 0 Medela Pump Car Adaptor This is great to have if you are going to be on the road and need to pump The long cord was helpful too so you can sit in the backseat and be discrete It was a bit tough to insert into the outlet in my car but I m hoping that it gets easier the more I use it 
5 0 Works Like a Charm This is excellent I pump in my car while at work and this is the BEST idea ever Nice long cord allows you to pump in the backseat for privacy A must have 
5 0 Fanastic accessory A must have I bought this yesterday when I knew I was going to a tailgate party where I would be away from the baby and having a few drinks and I may have to pump and dump I was nervous at first but this thing worked PERFECTLY It worked just like it was plugged into an electrical outlet It successfully pumped my breasts in 10 minutes and it fits into the case next to the regular plug I also bought the Medela sanitary wipes to clean the breast sheids since there was no sink near by This outlet plug is a must have if you want a quiet clean and safe place to pump your milk The cord is 8ft long so you can go back into the car I love this thing and wish I bought it sooner It will also be great on long trips too so you don t get any clogged milk ducts Highly reccommended 
4 0 Easy pretty odor less I was using the diaper genie and I wasn t at all impressed I was at a shop needing to pick up Genie refills and saw this pail on sale for 14 I bought it From day one I loved it I threw out the genie and I won t go back It only got 4 stars because you do need to buy fresh disks every so often They are nice because when you open the pail you smell a fresh clean sent Also I feel the pail could be taller when I change the kitchen bag which is the only time you really smell the foul diapers my bag was only about 3 4 the way full But other than that its a great investment no smelly nursery and no dang refills to buy 
5 0 great for cloth diapers this bin is great for cloth diapers we love ours keeps odors to a minimum and holds a day or two s worth of diapers which is all i need because we wash every other day Our local Babies R Us sells replacement deodisks or you can buy them online from cloth diaper vendors when the one that comes with it loses it s smell so that you can maintain freshness It s easy to clean and use and pretty inexpensive 
5 0 The best double stroller on the market we love it After reading the reviews and reluctantly we bought the stroller I am glad we didn t listen to those naysayers It was the best decision we made because the stroller is wonderful The comments people wrote about how the stroller is awkward and heavy is a bunch of rubbish Yes the stroller is heavier than its predecessors but they fail to mention how sturdy it is We ve had the stroller for 2 weeks and we hike up some hilly mountains Stanford Dish if you are from Palo Alto and it rides smoothly It gives me comfort that the stroller is well built and protecting our two daughters 2 year old and 4 weeks old enfant I feel secure that the stroller will not fall apart after a few rides like its predecessor Also we love the capabilities spring shocks for a smooth ride shorter so we can navigate through some tight corners and it is not awkwardly long like the other double strollers We have a Toyota Sienna and it fits just fine in our back trunk As for the weight Yes it is heavier but come on it is not 10 times heavier People exaggerate too much If you are accustom to carrying your 30 pound toddler in your arms then the stroller is nothing People are too much of a wimp It is slightly heavier than its predecessors but not by much They made it heavier because the load baring bar is what keeps the stroller steady and sturdy Gives me peace of mind that my precious asset in life my two daughters are protected The only recommendation is that the back two wheels could squeak which can be annoying Just use Silicone spray and they all went away We ve been through rain dirt and hot sun with this stroller and we ve been so happy with it I highly recommend purchasing it but make sure you have a truck mini van or SUV I am not sure if a standard vehicle can house such a stroller But I figured if you have two toddler enfants you may consider getting a bigger car 
5 0 Easy to use LOVE THESE BOTTLES Baby has had less gas and fussiness since we have been using these bottles Quick cleanup quick fill up Love the nipple variety too Because of the liners it is easy to keep two of these bottles in use and not clutter up the kitchen with bottle pieces etc Would highly recommend 
5 0 Granny Tip You can push a 4 oz baby Juice Bottle that juice for your baby comes in at the grocery up into the Playtex Nurser bottles to extract the air from the liners This will prevent punctures from your fingernails Be sure to remove the Juice Bottle before feeding baby 
5 0 mother recommended The original nursers enabled me to return to work after a long maternity leave My baby wouldn t take the bottle until I introduced the brown rubber nipple Thanks Mom 
5 0 Awesome system I have tried these for the first time with my fourth child I wish I would have used this system for all my children I have used all kinds of bottles from the old glass bottles to Vent air to Avent many types with my first 3 children I decided to give these a try considering I was tired of scrubbing bottles My little girl switched to these very easily from the breast it helped tremendously with her colic by cutting down on gas switching from regular formula to soy helped to plus I had to start avoiding all milk products while breastfeeding plus they are so easy to clean and manage I have had no leak problems like I did with Avent Vent air 1 nipple would collapse plus my son would have projectile spit up after feedings when I tried to switch him to the 2 nipples awful system absolutely no problems with the original Playtex bottles My only minor complaint is trying to fit my fingers in the bottle to collapse the liner to rid of air very hard if you do not have tiny hands We bought the easy feed bottles with the lift in the bottom to aid in releasing air alittle easier Store brand liners work just as well as brand name liners I have seen no difference except in price Target brand is very good I would recommend these bottles to everyone 
5 0 Perfect for Once Baby Sits Up I can t find on this website the exact tub I bought for my daughter but this tub looks most like it I tried using a baby tub that converts to sitting up to be placed in the big bath tub but that didn t work at all The small inflatable tub is definately the way to go My daughter can splash and wiggle and not get hurt or uncomfortable at all It is a pain to blow the tub up but our tub has a little hole to hang on a hook so we just constantly keep it inflated and hanging on the tub wall My daughter is nearly 1 year old now and has been using this tub for about 5 months There is still plenty of room for her to grow and I think she ll be using this tub for awhile I feel she is safer in it than if she were placed directly into the big tub 
5 0 Works great and looks nice too We have 4 yr old twins and an 18 month old and selected this gate as a means to block off our dining room from the living room We needed the gate which already came with one extension panel plus one more extension panel we purchased additional for a total of 107 inches across It wasn t that horrible to install just read the directions first and allot your self a couple of hours If you measure well and take your time it s not that difficult Also best to attach it to a stud in the wall for xtra durability As for durability you need an adult sized hand to open this latch my almost 5 yr olds can t do it The extra foot adds stability The baby has tried many times to push it over or break through the latch and never succeeds We like that you can set it to swing only one way if you choose since it prevents it from smacking into our dining room chairs As for appearance the neutral oak on this gate looks soooo much nicer than those pricier metal things We ve received many compliments on our wide spaces gate and matching stairwell gates from guests and it only takes seconds to slide out of the wall brackets and store if we re entertaining company I think some of the previous posters either had way too high expectations for a baby gate it s not a brick wall or installed it wrong I would recommend this gate to anyone especially those with multiples that need to gate off a portion of a large area to create a safe playspace 
4 0 Nice seat I bought this seat a couple weeks ago and my 2 month old nephew is using it when I have him until my son is born in June I love the look style and safety of this seat The only thing that I thought may be a problem was the way the shoulder straps adjust height My nephew is 22 and he is almost on the second to last adjustment Also the side impacts don t leave alot of room for a head positioner for newborns and they are far enough apart for the head to have room to wobble side to side My nephew seems to love it though and seems really comfortable in it The upright position is something I like I have never seen him sweat in it he seems to have growing room the canopy covers him fine and I think it is the most comfortable to carry His parents are using an Eddie Bauer and I know alot of people including me in the past that use Graco and other brands and they seem roomier but not as safe Also I haven t seen a baby over 4 5 months in the infant seats anyways I don t know anyone that would want to lug around a baby over 15 pounds in an infant seat I guess that s just the few of us who aren t body builders My nephew is 11 pounds now and he is getting pretty heavy in the seat it s a good thing that the seat isn t too heavy itself I would recommend this seat but I can t explain the other reviews so mabey trying it out in the store is best for everyone 
5 0 Excellent Product This is an excellent product It is such a good idea given the many warnings that are out about SIDS I felt reassured at night that our child would be able to breathe if she happened to roll to the sides or the ends of the crib and that she wouldn t get her arms or legs stuck between the slats I was expecting that the fabric would be a white cotton and was happily surprised that it is made of a white satin material We even had family members that thought that someone had made the CribShield for us 
4 0 pretty good I got this system for my 18 mo old who was playing a game by sticking his leg through the slats of his crib and then claiming he was stuck They have helped prevent him from doing that any more However if he s in the mood he can easily dismantle the entire contraption so it won t work to keep an older child from tearing it apart if they want to In fact the two end panels had to be removed because he wouldn t leave them alone All in all though I think the mesh bumpers do what they claim and they work well at keeping toys and pluggers in the crib instead of out on the floor 
4 0 We are very happy with this product Overall we are very happy with this product I like that it covers the entire side of the crib and doesn t come up only partway like a traditional bumper Also I like the breathable netting since baby can see out through it and since it gives a bit when baby pushes and kicks it We have a nonstandard length crib Babee Tenda so we do have small gaps at each end of the rail but we had read about this issue in another review from a Babee Tenda crib owner so we knew up front we would have these gaps These small gaps have not been a problem for us as our baby doesn t seem to want to stick her legs through the gaps in this location I think it s difficult since she would have to lie almost flush with the headboard or footboard to do so The white satin edge is very pleasant to look at Overall I like this product much more than the traditional bumpers I have seen 
5 0 Wonderful Pacifier I have been very impressed with every Avent product that I have purchased I have found these pacifiers to be so nice They are completely clear and you are able to see smiles around them My baby LOVES hers We can t live without them 
5 0 Still love it at 6 months We used the small size until our daughter was too long for it around 3 months old and switched to the large size She still loves it and is sleeping great 3 day naps and 10 11 hours uninterrupted sleep at night It is part of her naptime bedtime routine and it travels with us so she can get good sleep in a familiar environment wherever we are The velcro has been a lifesaver and the microfleece helps her stay warm but not overheated 
5 0 I m so glad they make this in a large size My baby outgrew the regular sized Swaddle Me at 2 months of age I ordered this one and when it came in the mail I couldn t believe how huge it looked We didn t actually use it until about 2 5 3 months since it was so big We would fold the top down before we swaddled our son in this so it wasn t as long At 3 5 months our baby weighs 17 pounds so it s hard to find something to swaddle him with and he still needs it I hope he doesn t outgrow this one in the near future I think he ll be one of those kids who has to be swaddled till he s 6 months old and this blanket should work 
5 0 A little tip The Medela breast pump works with Dr Brown s bottles you can pump directly into the bottle Just an added benefit to an already great product I ve been using mine almost daily for 11 months and have had NO problems It s worth the money if you plan on breastfeeding pumping for more than a couple of months 
5 0 My best purchase of year 2006 READ MY REVIEW I have used Medela s Pump In Style Advance for 4 months now after having my first baby This pump is the best in its class and it is the best thing I bought in 2006 Why I gave this item 5 star ratings 1 It helped me to establish a steady milkflow from the 2nd week of breastfeeding I am a working mom and had only 8 weeks off from delivery till I have to get back to work again So it was important for me to rely on a good breast pump to keep the supply going 2 This pump is comfortable to use and I can regulate the speed which is suitable for me The Medela parts are easy to set up for usage and also easy to wash sterilise 3 It never breakdown ever For 4 months now and I m pumping 4 5 times a day I bring this unit to the office and also whenever I am travelling It is very mobile although a little heavy to carry 4 It has a battery pack which is handy whenever I am in a place without power supply 5 I bought this online in Amazon for USD 319 But in Malaysia this unit would have cost MYR1800 USD 500 Just a note for non US users like myself you need to get an adapter which is compatible with this pump This can be easily obtained from any electrical shops This is a good buy if you re looking for a pump then you have found it 
4 0 Leg extensions are best bet To bring the co sleeper up to the height of the bed these leg extensions are the best bet Yes as someone else said they do make it a little shaky So if you are not planning to attach the co sleeper to your bed you may want to leave the height alone You ll be getting up anyway so it probably doesn t matter how tall it is But once attached to the bed with the anchor strap rather than free standing it was very secure 
4 0 Not perfect but does the job We ve had this bed rail for about two months now for our 3 1 2 year old on his full size big boy bed We re quite satisfied with it Construction Very sturdy our son jumps on his bed and rolls around and the bed rail stays put and does not seem like it could possibly give way The mesh is soft which is good for the times when he wedges himself in the corner to sleep We tug on it from time to time and it s not going anywhere Assembly Not too easy the instructions are horrible but once you realize on your own how it s supposed to go the actual assembly is OK but not quick Very easy to adjust the width to your bed with the simple strap feature Hide away feature This is what took away the 5th star It s not very easy to unlock and push it under the bed That feature works but requires some wrangling If you want the hide away feature for once in a while I wouldn t let that stop you from buying it if you plan to hide the rail daily I don t recommend it for that Making the bed Easy to tuck the sheets around it no need to hide away or struggle Overall I would highly recommend this bed rail I read all the reviews and asked many friends and this seemed to be the best in all areas and a good value for the price considering other can be well over xx 
4 0 Car Seat Stroller great for traveling parents I love this car seat stroller It goes from car to airplane in no time flat Great if you travel with small children with just one adult Also great if running errands and your child falls asleep no need to wake them up to get in and out of the car However the older they get and the more they weigh the harder it is to get the whole thing in and out with them in it I still love this product 
5 0 B O B revolution B O B Rocks BOB is very high quality and has held up extremely well for us after nearly 2 years of use We re a little attached to BOB in our house Let me tell you the Revolution is the stroller to get We bought it right after our baby was born choked up 40 or so for the infant seat bar and have used it as our primary stroller ever since Even in the mall department stores etc it s great Baby gets a smooth ride and daddy likes it because it s agile and almost effortless to push I see hundreds of Bugaboo strollers around and I must admit they are nice but B O B is my choice because of price and you can go more places with him Our other seldom used stroller is a Graco something or other and I don t even know where it is However I ve used it enough to compare it to BOB when collapsing it and putting it in the car I must say BOB is easier and faster to fold and go One downside might be that the storage compartment under the seat is smaller than some of those jumbo strollers However BOB is built like a tank We travel with BOB a lot through airports Yes BOB fits through most airport XRAY s while normally collapsed but sometimes I have to take off the back wheels which is easy and we hang stuff off of BOB s handlebars and even carry our jumbo car seat on top of the sun shade until we get to our car Our family is now looking for a double or tandem stroller This get s interesting because I don t see us doing the duallie BOB Revolution since it s a no go in the mall Target etc The Phil Ted s E3 Buggy and Double Buggy are looking tempting but I don t like that the older child sits tucked behind the stroller They can t see anything What I wish B O B Corp would do is come up with an attachment to at least do the same as the Phil Ted s But a tandem stroller that was a revolution would be sweet 
5 0 I have this in the pink chocolate color I love it This is probably one of my most used baby items It is so handy to use while we are out and so easy to clean I ve bought this as a shower gift for several of my pregnant friends 
5 0 Great and Convenient This product was very easy to use quick clean up and very discrete to carry in public My husband and I are constantly using it when we are out with our child I especially like the compartment for diaper storage and wipe storage 
5 0 I love this So much better than hard plastic I use it while my daughter is lying down She loves being in the tub This just makes her float It s great as the get bigger to use like the ring Would buy for a friend and totally recommend 
5 0 Great I feel so bad that this seat has such a low ranking It is perfect for my girl I do understand why people with boys may have issues but if you have a girl it is just wonderful I have a very cheap one that is designed similarly but this one is so much better It has a great weight to it so it s not flimsy and it fits my girls bum so nicely and the cushion is very firm yet soft The handles make is so easy for her to just climb up on the stool sit and pull herself back My friend has the pricey Bjorn and while that is nice I saved 15 on something that works just as well 
5 0 We LOVE this chair I have a home daycare so this chair is used constantly I ve had two of these for well over a year and today I bought a third one I ve tried several different seats in the past and this one is the best by far Nothing beats the swinging tray I would recommend it to anyone 
5 0 GREAT CHAIR We ve used this seat when traveling and everyday use at home When our son was about 15 months old I put the highchair away and started using this It can be taken apart easily and put in the dishwaser It folds down so it can be put away easily if you re having guests unlike a big highchair GREAT CHAIR 
5 0 This chair is great We got this chair as a baby shower gift which I registered for and absolutely love it I don t understand the problems the other reviewers are talking about If used properly this chair gives absolutely no problems The seat locks in at different levels if it s not locked in of course it will fall apart The seat is easy to use folds easily and cleans easily We store it in our van we have Stow and go storage and it fits perfectly We ve used it since my son now 16 months could sit up He lays his body from side to side and the seat doesn t budge very safe The tray does snap off easily and he has done that at times while trying to climb up on it This doesn t bother me since it s not a toy and shouldn t be climbed on anyway The tray hasn t snapped off while in use and hopefully won t We ve used this chair on both a chair and the floor when seating was limited like at family get togethers We haven t had any problems at all Anyway I highly recommend it 
5 0 Sanity Saver This is the best product we have ever used for our little girl yes that includes swings and bouncy seats I stumbled across it when they had just come out She was sitting in it at 4 months BY the time she started crawiling though we couldnt use it because she was able to twist herslef and climb out of it However I see now that they have an attachment for it so it can be used for self feeding I recommend this to everyone we know who is starting their family or already have had a child It allows the caregiver to be hands free and it helps your little one learn to be more independant faster which is a double edged sward Tough fro parents good for kids 
4 0 NOT BAD Does what it should but could be improved I give it 3 1 2 stars VERY IMPORTANT NOTE DOT NOT TURN ON SYSTEM BEFORE READING THIS You have to open up the parent receivers and plug in the battery pack before usage then Charge the system for 16 hours DO NOT TURN SYSTEM ON WHILE CHARGING FOR THIS FIRST TIME I did a lot of research on monitors and found this one to have pretty good feedback on several parents websites With most items there are pros and cons see below Pros You will not pick up any feedback from the neighbors This is a significant improvement from monitors in the past ABSOLUTLY NO INTERFERENCE Great reception You will have no problems picking up your child with this I can take it outside and work in the yard with confidence that I will know when my baby needs me Interchangeable AC power cords make it easy to move the system around to different rooms in the house Lightweight and compact system Cons The biggest issue is battery life HORRIBLE BATTERY LIFE TYPICALLY ONLY 3 4 HOURS at a time The battery drain on this system is almost a deal breaker in my husband s opinion This system comes with the options of 1 or 2 docking stations I HIGHLY RECOMMED the one with two stations because the system is constantly running low on batteries and and can recharge while the parents portion is on the dock Or the second receiver can be used while the other is charging on the dock With any power interruption the child s unit shuts off The parents unit beeps and flashes red to inform you of the issue but it can be irritating at 2 00 A M to have to get up to turn it back on Graco really needs to find a way to have the system stay on at all times that it is plugged in Belt clip does not work well with normal amount of movement The system is better left unattached to belt unless you want to be constantly picking it up from the ground A bit expensive A little of both Pros Cons Sound Pro Great sound very clear In fact I can often hear dogs barking outside with this monitor Con Picks up on every little sound because it is so sensitive For the light sleepers on the softest level still can be very loud Loud every 5 seconds parents warning Pro Beeping will let you know that system is not functioning correctly so you can fix the system This was nice for us one day when the baby s system had fallen and came unplugged If the system had not beeped we would not have known Con Annoying beeping while searching for signal a startling fact in the middle of the night Overall the system does what it should but there a few area s that could be improved I gave it 3 1 2 stars but rounded it up 
4 0 Good Monitor Good baby monitor overall Sound quality is good except we are getting an occasional clicking sound and I can t find where the interference is coming from 
5 0 Digital baby monitor produces clear sound We really like our Graco digital iMonitor It gives very clear sound in a good range of volumes and has a much longer range than any analog monitors that we tried previously We do not get quite the range that is claimed on the box usually it reaches about 1 2 a city block depending on the strength of charge left in the rechargeable batteries The lights that light up for baby s sound are quite bright which can be a problem if you like to sleep in complete darkness I turn the monitor around so that the lights do not keep me awake 
5 0 New York Baby My husband is a NYC doorman so we found it very fitting to decorate our son s room in this theme Since my hubby deals with taxi s and limo s on a daily basis we thought it was very cute that the main theme of this set had those things in it We also love Manhattan and are there often so we brought a little bit of it out to our house in L I The set is very well made and I like the fact that since it feels like it will last my son can grown with it It is also not too pastel and babyish that he can use it well into his toddler and pre school years 
5 0 GREAT manual pump If you are going to get a manual pump get this one I got a Medela from the hospital and it was SOOO slow and killed my hand but this one is way better It takes 5 10 minutes to get the same amount it took 30 minutes to get with the Medela and it doesn t hurt your hand at all because you have to pump the handle far less often because of the massaging petals and because you use it for less time total I have never used an electric pump so I can t compare it to one of those but as far as manuals go this one is AWESOME 
5 0 Some Advice I have had great success with this manual pump My best advice if you are having trouble is to TAKE OUT THE PETALS This helped me immensely Milk was getting sucked under the silicone and my I was getting rubbed by the narrowed opening I took out the petals and the milk started to flow down into the bottle and pumping became a lot more comfortable and effective I used this pump for 2 kids and never had a silicone disk tear on me I highly recommend this pump 
5 0 Love it Great product I heard from other mommies that this was the pump to get I agree 
4 0 Good buy So far our 7 month old son likes this toy He watches the flashing lights listens to the music and noises and seems to like the different shaped blocks we have several other peek a boo blocks He uses the handle to push the bus flips up the shape sorter and kicks at the wheels to make the music come on It keeps his attention while he practices sitting up for long periods of time We thought at first we had a broken one since only one light worked and it didn t flash Well after my husband pounded the light bar down on each side both lights came on and started flashing It also made the hood stay shut better So maybe try that before taking it back to the store if you encounter the same problem 
5 0 I use it as much as my son This is a durable and quality product My son uses it for everything from turning the lights on to getting on the potty I use it to reach the pantry and get to all the permanent markers that I must hide from my 2 and a half year old I must say that I am a hard core fan on Baby Bjorn items as they are durable classic in design and color This is a sturdy non slip item It has supported me for months 120lbs give or take 10 lbs We used it so much that I bought another step stool made by playskool and I wished I had bought another BabyBjorn 
5 0 A MUST HAVE Having only used it once as my baby is just now able to eat table foods when we go out to eat it worked WONDERFUL Having a CLEAN place to put her food on was nice as you never know just how clean the tables really are 
5 0 Perfect I love that it sticks and doesn t slide It is great for my 21 month old to feel part of the family when we eat 
5 0 Terrific Booster This is so much better than those crappy plastic boosters I can t believe we didn t buy it sooner It s easy to clean and doesn t slide off the chair Our son fits in it perfectly and now feels like a big boy It even has a little carrying bag to take on trips Great vendor with quick delivery too 
5 0 Awesome product I m not sure what the other reviewer was talking about the product installs on the bowl and secures the lid and toilet seat It s easy to install and works great 
5 0 Perfect for busy feet My daughter loves to kick the blankets off during the night and I was always worried that she would get cold especially with the very cold weather we have had so far this winter I saw this and knew it would be perfect for my little kicker girl She wears it every night now and I know she stays warm throughout the night The only suggestion I have for anyone thinking of buying this is to make sure you get the right size and length for your little one Mine is growing so fast that I will have to get a bigger size soon just because she is getting so long 
4 0 A little shaky but necessary I bought these extensions because I had to have them so that the co sleeper would fit properly next to my bed However when added the sleeper didn t seem as steady or stable on the floor There was a lot more sway in the sleeper with the extensions than without them While not a big issue because the sleeper was attached to my bed I expected something a little more solid or sturdy 
5 0 Great Item I used this for my daughter who always falls alseep in the car and has her head dangling all over the place It works GREAT Her head actually stays in the right position and she sleeps better which is a plus 
5 0 Highly recommended Our little guy was sleeping comfortably in his stroller for the first several months we brought him home When we tried to transition him to the crib he was startled by the large space and would cry or sleep very poorly As he outgrew the stroller we tried to think of ways to emulate the coziness of the stroller inside his crib lots of attempts not an easy task He s 5 1 2 months old and we now use the Sleep Nest in the crib as well as putting him in the larger sized SwaddleMe at night He loves the closeness and sleeps very soundly The Sleep Nest is small enough to be cozy but large enough for him to move comfortably It fits very nicely into the crib and is also portable which is great since he enjoys being on the go 
5 0 Grandparent s perspective This doll is attractive does everything it is supposed to do comes with appropriate accessories and above all children love it Appears to be well made with a soft cuddly body and our 6 year old granddaughter loves it 
4 0 Haven t traveled yet but seems good I haven t traveled with the bag yet but the quality seems good The bag has a cloth like exterior and the interior fabric is a thick vinal My stroller is a pram style one where the handle bar can reverse and is oversized The stroller fits in the bag with 2 wheels off from the same side because of the thin long ends of the bag the top thin long end is where the zipper is They are removable wheels so its no problem With all the wheels on the bag can t zip closed That is why I gave it only 4 stars I bought the bag because I will be traveling overseas soon and I don t want my stroller damaged during the long flight 
5 0 Great For Travel We got this for our cruise and it worked great It was very easy to carry and load onto the train bus and car when it was needed The material is very think and easy to wipe off if it gets dirty 
5 0 Incredibly Convenient This is such a great idea I just leave mine in my diaper bag so if we end up somewhere without a clean bib we can make our own 
5 0 Great gates We are in Italy with these huge weird shaped stairways These gates are great and just what we were looking for Easy to install easy to use once up They look nice in our house 
4 0 Great For Toddlers We purchased this gate to span an opening near the bottom of our stairs and it works very well We have had this gate in place since my son started crawling and he has yet to breech the perimeter My husband installed it easily one end into a stud in the wall one end into an oak stair banister and it is sturdy even with my son frequently shaking it in the middle it has shown no signs of dislodging I give it 4 stars out of 5 because it is not very attractive and the opening mechanism is somewhat cumbersome and tough for guests to figure out But it definitely does its job and I would recommend this gate to anyone with a long span to cover 
5 0 Love it I can t tell you how much I love this product I live in Colorado and we ve had tons of snow cold weather this winter and now I can t even imagine zipping my 4 month old into a snowsuit It s so easy to slip her right it zip it up and go I have appreciated the flap that can fold up or down this covers her head as we walk from our car to the door when it is snowing or windy I chose this urban style over the original because I liked the way it looked but after having used it a few months there are a few more reasons I like it better First it washes beautifully The liner stays soft and looks the same as the day I bought it unlike sherpa fleece Second the outside fabric is waterproof Once I spilled a small soda on the Bundleme and the soda literally beaded up and poured right off It never soaked into the fabric and left a stain 
5 0 Worth every penny I also own the Bundle me w fluffy heavy winter liner we could not have lived without it I was excited to see this trendy light weight weather resistant version for spring I ll admit I would not have purchased this had it not been on the wrong shelf at 39 99 My 59 99 dismay soon evaporated it is so sleek and functional No more struggling with bulky snowsuits jackets and sweaters which never seem to fit baby anyway Easily unzips so as not to overheat LOVE the little pocket for binky Velcro back openings make it easy to switch to stroller No need to buy two 
4 0 Love it but some problems with newest Peg Perego I love this item It really works well in February winter weather I bought 4 snowsuits and I haven t used one for our newborn because snowsuits are tedious I am able to put her in her car seat put a blanket inside and put a hat on her Forget the suits and mittens I cover her with the cover and she sleeps in the dark and warmth soundly Also it prevents people from touching her all of the time because they can t see her when I cover her up The only problem is that this item didn t fit well with the newest Peg Perego infant car seats I made it work but it doesn t fit perfectly It worked with the old Peg Perego car seat but not the newest one I loved this item so much that I ve made it work though It isn t perfect but it works It actually is so much better than Peg Perego s cover which came with the car seat This cover has made my life pretty easy I found it easy to put on the Peg Perego I love the color It zips up easily It is soft Isabella seems to like to snuggle in it It is comfy for her Be aware though I live in Salt Lake City UT Our winters are mild If you have colder winters you may want to add a snowsuit Still it is worth the money I am glad I bought it 
5 0 Love it already I just received my travel set today and I already love it The bottle pod is more than big enough for the biggest bottle I have The pacifier pod holds my daughters pacifier perfectly and the diapers and wipes pod is just too perfect for quick trips to the store or a friends house I highly recommend it 
5 0 Great dog mattress Well I m sure this is probably a novel use for this product but we bought this for our great dane to sleep on He s giant and old and needed more support that the traditional dog bed but orthopedic giant dog beds STARTED at over 200 We got the idea to try a baby crib mattress and ordered it Very soon thereafter I arrived home from work and was puzzled to find no dog blocking my way into the door waiting for a head pat it seemed the mattress had arrived and he was simply immovable He loves it It is well crafted and everything the ad said Our use is quite unconventional but it works well and we could highly recommnend this for anybody with a large dog 
4 0 great high chair We haven t had any problems cleaning this chair occasionally we need to use the crevice tool on the vacuum but that is simple enough Most of the time we simple take a wet paper towel or wet wipe and run it around the seat sides We d do that with any high chair The tray doesn t fit in our dishwasher but that too has been easy to clean in the sink We love the neutral and plain color of the oatmeal vinyl Our daughter is very happy in her chair She is only 16 months but very big for her age she has no problems fitting in this seat at all Our only complaint is that we have to push the tray release handle in when we put the tray on in order to lock it into place or else our daughter can push the tray almost out that may be a defect on ours rather than a design flaw we just live with it since it isn t that big a deal 
5 0 Superb Quality This is the BMW of all highchairs It s super sturdy and the Italian leather seat is easy to care for Ignore the reviews about being a pain to clean You need to clean EVERY highchair nooks crannies and all 
5 0 Great looking functional bag This diaper bag is a great urban carrier for baby items and can easily pass off as a regular messenger bag for every day use It s functional and has multiple organizers including a place for your cell phone keys and a zippered insulated compartment for baby s bottle or a toddler s drink For parents there are two inside pockets with zippers that are perfect for wallets and other small items The interior has easy stash pockets for storing diapers wipes and other baby essentials Overall it s a stylish looking bag that moms or dads could use The design is trendy without having an appearance that will become easily outdated After nearly two years of daily use it s still in good condition and shows little signs of wear It s also a very convenient on the go type bag that stays put when you re out and about 
5 0 Diaper Bag for dads too It was nice of my ninth month wife to agree upon a diaper bag that I wasn t too embarrassed to carry Now that the baby s here I ve found it to be functional as well as comfortable it easily holds enough clothes diapers and stuff and doesn t feel like you re carrying an elephant No complaints at all it s a great bag 
5 0 Great gift idea Unfortunately the baby I bought this for already had one But I got to see it in action and listen to the parents rave about it It is really neat almsot to the point I wish I had kept it for myself 
5 0 Don t know how we did without it We have had this monitor for about 7 months now and we love it The peace of mind in being able to see that your little one is okay is priceless I used to have to run up and down the stairs constantly and I do not miss that I can cook dinner or watch a TV show in a relaxed state without worry It has always worked well and it something happened to this one we would replace it immediately The picture is clear the sound is excellent You do have to keep charging it if you do not keep it plugged in but the cords are all generous in length We would go nuts without it 
4 0 works better than expected I just got this item for my two story house I was able to see the crib from the upstairs nursery throughout my house and even outside The monitor is not in color so that is misleading but the picture looks grea 
5 0 We love love love this monitor It works fantastically for the purposes we purchased it Sometimes there is a little interference but if you just move the monitor sometimes moving it even just a couple of inches to the left or right will make a difference it will work great We have had no problems whatsoever and we would definitely buy this monitor again The night vision works great even in our son s dark room The color is great as long as there is sufficient light 
5 0 must have this item is worth more than the cost it is a most have at home with a new born baby expecially 1st time parent like me I can get to do other things once my baby is asleep and i can even hear my baby s heart beat when am somewhere else in the house worth more than trhe cos 
5 0 For Peace of Mind My baby had very bad reflux and pediatrician told us not to move her to her room my fear was that she would get use to sleep in our bedroom and moving her became a nightmare When reflux got better at month 4 We finally got to move her and for us this monitor became a very useful tool it has rechargeable batteries image and sound are clear enough night vision works perfect monitor is not bulky at all no color at all though and we managed to tie camera to the crib s headboard and worked great for us 
4 0 Perfect entertainment for active babies I have a 6 month old who absoutely loves this walker We started using this when he was only 4 months old and being the wiggly active baby he is he loved being able to push himself around Now along with his walking he loves to push the buttons to hear the music and see the lights Along with that he likes to pull and pet the plush toys on the side while chatting with them This is a great walker just always remember to keep an eye on baby at all times I highly recommend this for those babies who love to move around on their own It also provides mom and dad with about 25+ minutes of catch up with to do list time 
4 0 Great Walker I purchased the Sesame Beginnings Walker and my daughter loves it There is a mirror in the middle of the toy bar and she loves to look at herself It also has big bird and cookie monster figures on each end and she loves to play with them This walker makes noise and lights up There isn t any paint on her walker and I don t know what the other writer was referring to but this walker is very safe and enjoyable for my daughter 
5 0 great solution for messy eaters This mat works great kids can t throw it on the floor it catches food I love it 
5 0 My New Favorite Baby Gift I bought this for my second son who is a year old I love it It s compact and fits easily in the diaper bag After he eats I take it to the restroom and it rinses right off I ve started using it at home too because the little tray in the front catches food really well and saves my floors I recommend anyone who hates to see their child rub their food all over the germy table buy this 
4 0 I love it I was really nervous about this product after reading the reviews but once I put the organizer up it was great I use the top four slots for thing like mittens and cotton balls and the next two for wipes and larger lotion and bath items The bottom is really good for several diapers I love it 
5 0 Why aren t all bibs like this I love the Baby Bjorn bib it is excellent for protecting my 1 year old son s clothes as he learns to feed himself It is great for car rides too I can place Cheerios in the pocket and he can feed himself a little snack The only drawback is that with my son being small the highchair tray and the pocket are the same height However as he grows taller they won t interfere with each other 
5 0 Amazing I gave birth to a premature infant that had to spend a week in the NICU Because of that I was forced to establish my milk supply w a breastpump The morning after I gave birth my husband went Walmart to pick up some of things that we hadn t purchased I called him crying and told him that he had to find something for my sore nipples Well this is what he brought back The relief was instantaneous I bought a couple more boxes as my daughter learned to breastfeed I use another of their nipple creams for everyday use they re too expensive to use everday but I make sure that there is always a box of these in my cabinet 
4 0 Great monitor I received this monitor as a gift and it has been a life saver How nice that I can monitor my baby s every move and sound without being in the same room every minute The are two different channels so this usually cuts out the extra static or the alarm going off Sometiems it s also just a matter or re positioning the monitor to resolve the noise We were suprised one evening when we picked up what sounded like a phone conversation between two girls but switching to channel B solved that I ve used the Evenflo Whisper Connect for about 3 months now and am quite satisfied 
4 0 a good monitor but it is not worth the money i have this monitor now and i m thinking about return it back cause although i have the volume on high but still my baby s voice still not clear but other than than it is a good monitor i did not have any problem with the battaries or stati 
4 0 Nice comfy seat keeps seatbelt in place I own this seat for my son who is age 6 It is the law in my state that children must in a booster or car seat until age 8 The seat material is high quality and the cushioning is very comfotable The headrest is perfect for long trips since my son can fall asleep without an annoying crick in his neck The price is decent too The only issue I have with this seat is the cupholders If you have a regular sedan and want to fit others in your car the cupholders aren t very usable Additionally the cupholders don t slide out very well when the child is sitting in the seat Personally I leave the cupholders pushed in I have another carseat for a young infant in my sedan and must fit my 10 year old in the back seat I wish carseat and booster seat makers would instead make a mesh bag pocket hang right off the botton front for kid toys and such Furthermore with booster seats in general I think they are very impractical for families who need to fit 3 kids across the backseat My son has a very hard time buckling his seat belt because he must reach to the side where space is at a premium I would love a forward facing booster seat with a 5 point harness that would lock into the LATCH loops for the older child Not only is a 5 point seat harness safer but it is much easier for a child to buckle themselves instead of reaching around to the side As far as the options available for a child who has outgrown a convertible seat but is too small for a regular seat belt this is a nice option 
5 0 Love this Highchair As most of the other reviewers I live in a small townhome This chair is wonderful It takes up very little space and is so easy to clean I remove the straps and throw them in the wash and they come out so clean The rest of the chair is very easy to wipe clean and the tray just gets put in the dishwasher Despite carrots prunes etc being mashed into it the tray hasn t stained at all I recommend this chair to all my pregnant friends 
5 0 Ellie s favorite chair We have a small home and decided to opt for this type of high chair instead of a stand alone We just love it and so does our 6 month old 
5 0 My Daughter Loves This Chair I purchased your Space Saver Highchair for my 9 month old daughter who is severely disabled Finding equipment for the very young disabled child is very difficult This chair works for everything This chair is so comforatable for my daughter and allows her to sit up and play with her toys as she gets very bored laying on her back all day She also has a very difficult time playing with her toys as her grasp is not well controlled and she is constantly dropping toys on her face or off to the side and cannot get them back in her hand I love this chair for its size the way the whole seat tilts not just the back and the 5 point harness The chair is also small so it holds her very nicely My daughter loves nothing more than to sit in this chair all the time 
5 0 So far so good I received this stroller about a week ago and so far we love it The ride is smooth it s very light and I love the salmon color The shade comes in handy too It has all the features I d want while still remaining ight and streamlined It s a little awkward to close but I m a bit of a klutz so I assume others might not have this problem The handles are great though and they re very comfortable for my husband 6 feet and me 5 7 
5 0 Excellent Stroller Lightweight high quality construction We are very pleased with it and our 1 5yr girl just loves it The carrying strap is a very convenient addition Don t waste your money on a 20 umbrella stroller spend a little more and enjoy the high quality of this excellent stroller 
4 0 Great feeding plates I was looking for a decent sized sectioned plate for my 1 year old to have at the dinner table and these were perfect I have not used them to travel with but I do not think the lids would stay on the plates very well in that type of setting They do work great for her leftovers though when I put them in the fridge They are nice and slim and fit well into long skinny areas 
5 0 Great Quality These stickers are great My toddler has a small white table that about every 3 months we decorate with new stuff This quarter its Cars he loves them They are very durable vibrant and colorful Highly recommended 
5 0 fantastic my granddaughter is one year old she absolutly loves her new walker she is small for her age so the adjustable height is perfect 
5 0 Safety 1st Grip N Go Walker I brought this walker for my grandson and he loves it He alway s playing with the objects and is actually walking now This wallker was easy to assemble also 
4 0 Warm and comfy I had my doubts when we first used it b c it closes with just some toggle like buttons and i was worried that the wind would slip through But my baby comes out of this stroller sleeping bag wrap warm every time And we ve had a few days this winter here in the Northeast that have been way below freezing with a wind chill strong enough to sting your face 
4 0 Lots of fun in the tub I actually had put this on my daughter s wish list and then broke down and bought it myself for her because I just couldn t wait to see if she d get it for her 1st birthday I always take tubbies with my daughter so I like to have fun toys in the tubby that I enjoy too My daughter loves her out of water xylophone and thinks this one is pretty neat too I have to admit I play with it more than she does at this point She s only 9 1 2 months right now so I think as she gets a bit older she ll enjoy it more My only complaint and the reason I didn t give it 5 stars it should come with more play sheets and they are NOT waterproof Other than that a fun toy After I got this I did find it at Target for the same price it s listed here with no s h charges but still don t regret getting it 
4 0 interesting toy This is one interesting toy I love the way it creates music when it floats on top of the water You can even create music for it which is something I ve never thought would be possible Kids today have it made 
5 0 I want one If they made one of these things for adults I d get one My daughter LOVES this thing It s got that crinkle sounding paper that babies seem to love and spins really easily The colors are really bright and everything is easily accessable for little arms and hands I have already told my pregnant friends that they need to get one of these 
4 0 Changing pad This seems to be a decent changing pad with the exception of it not being easy to clean I am having a real hard time cleaning it and never had this problem with other changing pads It s almost porous If you get this changing pad plan on having a cover on it at all times to keep it clean 
5 0 good quality for good price It works great for me I have 2 floor + 2 kids + 2 cats and before I didn t know what going on in my house Now I can hear any sound guests coming kids playing watching TV and even when cats jump on dining table to steel some food It makes some fone sound on max volume but I don t care I just reduse volume or change unit position I strongly recomend this Monitor 
5 0 You can hear crickets seriously We were downstairs one night watching TV and kept hearing crickets Turns out her bedroom window was open and we were hearing the crickets through the baby monitor This thing is so good I can hear crickets in the backyard from one story up There is no doubt I can hear anything my daughter needs I can tell from her cry through the monitor whether I need to prep or bottle get a diaper ready or its time for play 
5 0 Finally I can leave my baby while she sleeps Every mother father should definitely purchase a baby monitor Until this came I could not leave my baby while she slept to go do the dishes and what not The receiver side is battery operated so even if I walk around the house I can here my baby Even the smallest sound is picked up Amazing I haven t tried other monitors but this one is perfect and inexpensive so I would recommend it to anyone 
5 0 Urban Me Bundle Lover It is hard when you have an infant to secure them in their car seat with a huge snowsuit on I found myself dredding going out because my daughter would look like an eskimo in her car seat I was delighted when I found the Urban Me Bundle I don t have to worry about bundling her up in heavy gear when we go out We just put on her hat and go The Urban Me Bundle gives your child enough breathing room as well as providing warmth and comfort It helps too that it is rain resistant I have received many compliments on my Urban Me Bundle and found it to be a wise investment It really doesn t compare to the other ones that are on the market because you can definitely see the difference in quality of the fabric inside and out 
5 0 Best Money Spent Out of all the loads of baby gear I bought this is by far the best money I spent I thought its a little spendy but super cute After my preemie came home the 3rd week of November and it was 27 degrees I realized how great this thing was Its super snuggly for her and keeps her warm No need for a jacket that would mess up her straps also in the wind and the rain to just be able to flip it over her face is so great This is way better that the ones with sherpa inside in my opinion My daughter will be able to use it well into Spring Not to mention not a day goes by that I don t get a compliment on the sack and people asking where I got it Love it Love it 
5 0 Great design easy to use It took no time to figure out how to use this seat My daughter meets the minimum height and weight requirements so I am moving here from a 5 point harness Britax to this booster in a second car The seat is easy to install and remove and also easy to stowe in the trunk when not in use by simply pulling the rear latch and folding I can definately see using it for travel on planes as it is easy to fold and light enough to carry My daughter also likes the fold out cup holders for water They are sturdy and easy to tuck back in when storing or carrying the seat Highly recommended 
4 0 Practical Its definitely a practical way to carry the essentials for a baby or a kid or whatever 
4 0 Look at the picture to see what you can fit in the bag I have taken and posted a picture to show what Luke and I carry in this bag We luckily have not had any ripping or stitching problems We have a recieving blanket cell phone first aid kit in the ziplock at top of pic burts bees baby lotion oil and diaper rash ointment 3 diapers bag of wipes bib onsie sleeper burp cloth 2 toys hat and 3 empty ziplocks to hold dirty diapers clothes that have ahd to be changed or trash What is not in the picture is the camera that goes in the middle compartment because that took the picture My cannon S2 powershot goes in the middle compartment We don t have anything in the bottle container but that is where we stuff dirty diaper and clothes ziplocks and there is nothing in the larger front pocket so we have room to spare Excellent design and as other reviewrs have noted the colors are great in person This is a great bag for day hikes and outings with dad And it has held up great for us so far 
5 0 THIS IS A MUST TO HAVE Even though this costs a bit more its worth every penny It is so easy to put in the buggy My son is comfy and fits in it very well 
5 0 Forget the Floppy THIS is the one to buy In my months of experimentation and a few purchases in err this is the best product of its sort out there It s the ONLY product I ve purchased or tried out in the store that truly requires only ONE hand With my 8 month old on my shoulder I drop this bag into the cart seat I unzip it flip the diaper pocket over the back pull the generous elastic edged cover up and over the cart handle and that s just about it Additionally the Buggy Bag is among the few that covers the whole cart and uniquely adds further protection from germs with 2 separate belts one to go around your child s waist the other to secure it to the cart Not to be forgotten the Buggy Bag comfortable apparently has simple convenient storage options and stores itself w ease On the other hand I tried one imitation in a popular Baby store and not only did it not open with one hand a necessity with a baby on your hip in a grocery store parking lot but I could NOT get it back into its carrying shape with two hands I hid it on the shelf and moved away quickly eek Another product I purchased online came in two pieces and had so many clips and belts wrapping it together that I could barely attach it with both hands and help from passersby While it had shoulder straps unlike any other they dont work in most carts that put an advertising placard on the back of the cart seat Finally adjusted that product the Shop n Dine didnt cover most of the cart on its debut shopping trip I threw it back in the car and went home too tired to shop Finally there are lots of imitators out there dont be suckered in by similar names better price points or preferred fabric choices the Buggy Bag will preserve your sanity and perhaps your child s health 
5 0 Neurosmith Music Blocks toy is A++++ We ve had this toy for around 3 years now My second child loves playing with it as much as my firstborn It is also a hit with other children visiting our house The toy is as educational as it is fun We ve used it to practice colors shapes and musical creativity It can get a little pricey as the cartridges to expand the set run 20 new All in all a FANTASTIC toy well worth the price Another upside is how friendly and helpful the Neurosmith company is We lost a block and they were friendly and helpful with the replacement My friend finally broke down and bought this for her 2 kids because they also loved it so much 
5 0 Lovely This 2 in 1 is amazing The scent is wonderful too bad they don t make it for adults A very gentle cleanser that can be used for babies and toddlers alike It actually cleans the skin and leaves it soft and smelling beautifully I love Mustela products so much that I got rid of every other product that I had that wasn t Mustela Fifteen donated bottles later the only products that still remain in our home are these products Try them and you ll see why 
5 0 warmest bundle me bag great sleepsack for our little bundle keeps her warm toasty i love the microfibre interior because it s warm but not too hot also the exterior is wind resistant so it s perfect for san francisco 
4 0 Easy to install This is a good thing to make your home safer for your kids This is a pretty boring product but everything worked just fine 
5 0 If you have children or earthquakes consider this We have these straps all over our house on every piece of furniture taller than two feet because we have two climbers There have been two occasions that I know of where these saved my eldest daughter from injury as she climbed large pieces of furniture The hardest part of installing these is finding them We searched several local stores with little luck and a few odd looks as salespersons didn t understand why we would want to strap our furniture to the walls when we don t live in an earthquake zone But trust me once you find somewhere that sells them buy them up Once you see how well they work you will become addicted to testing to see if you can tip your furniture and will want them everywhere 
5 0 Handy Car Seat Carrier Before realising that there actually was such a thing as a car seat carrier my husband and I used to stuff our car seat into plastic garbage bags and tape them shut It kept the seat clean and we even had plenty of airline staff commend us on even thinking to bag our seat to keep it clean but obviously did nothing to make it easier to tote around the airport Then I found out about car seat carriers and chose this one as it had the most favourable reviews It was purchased just before a trip to Colorado and has since also been to Europe and back I m extremely happy with this item It s relatively easy to put our convertible Evenflo car seat into and the canvas and zippers have held up well with no obvious signs of wear yet even after braving the luggage belts The only tip I can give people is that my husband and I found that the car seat has a tendency to wobble or tip over more when pulled in a more upright position much like small wheelie carry on luggage and was more stable to pull when you had it leaning backward quite far so that it s center of gravity is lower So you might need be able to use the strap that comes with it or something else to attach to the handle so that you have some extra length to tip it back further Both my husband and I were a little too tall for just the handle to do that comfortably For anyone looking for a way to more easily take their carseat along I definitely recommend this product 
5 0 FULL COVERAGE IS GREAT As im sure all mothers can relate my 9mo old son is always trying to eat the shopping cart I looked at a lot of local stores for a cover I couldnt find one that fully covered the front back and sides of the seat that wasnt 80 This one is great its reasonably priced wonderful bright colors and holds up well after several washings i just wish it wasnt so bulk to carry around but i guess thats the price you pay to keep him from sucking who knows what up off the carts 
4 0 Good for the price I bought this for my reluctant potty trainer and he s used it once and tried to go in it several times but the real blessing has been his 6 year old brother using it I have one bathroom and one very messy boy who never lifts the toilet seat This has saved me from having to clean my toilet seat constantly or face unwelcome surprises I do have to check the collection reservoir a lot though because my older son does go a lot as big boys will The flushing mechanism works well and is a necessary part it saves a lot of time you may spend scrubbing and rinsing a traditional training potty Plus the pee collects in a part of the potty the child doesn t have easy access to unlike a trainer potty that they can pee in then stand up and step in or put on their head when your back is turned for a second I speak from experience Makes it much more sanitary The only problems I ve encountered are my kids flushing it constantly mostly when it was new simultaneously filling the collection reservoir and draining the water and therefore creating two jobs for me to repeat every five minutes the fact that my three year old still can t quite get it that he can t sit on it and do 2 and the fact that it s just a little off balance so unless you wall mount it or lean it up against a wall you could have an icky mess Luckily ours has only fallen over when filled with water 
4 0 potty training My two and half year old kept telling me he wanted to stand up to go to the potty like his older brother and daddy A friend recomended this product and when my little one saw it he was so excited He loves the fact that he can flush it all by himself 
5 0 grandson loves it No more worries about being too short and missing the bowl Yea 
5 0 GREAT sheet I bought this sheet for my Graco Pack n Play and it fits great It s very soft and looks great wash after wash 
5 0 A necessity for spring summer months I had one of these with my second son and loved it We just kept it in his car seat and it made it so easy to cover him up when necessary When it was hot out we could uncover him and when we went into somewhere with air conditioning we would just cover him up It is soft and cozy We found it so convenient We will be purchasing another one for number three who s due in May 
5 0 Great lamp This lamp is so much cuter than I was expecting The quality looks excellent I looked at cheaper lamps and you get what you pay for The quality of this lamp is definitely superior to others 
5 0 An adorable must buy This is the absolute cutest general neutral baby bedding set out there The colors are fabulous the material is soft and nice and I was SO pleased by its overall quality We also purchased some of the extras the lamp pillow and wall hangings and were just as pleased I would reccommend this bedding to any person expecting a child that doesn t wish to know the gender before it s born but also any parent that does know be assured it is great for a girl or boy especially if you like animals 
4 0 Good flow too wide I havent had any problems with the bottles leaking like others have stated but I guess I always check and make sure the lid is on right The suction isnt too fast which is great My baby doesnt get choked She latches easily to the nipple since it is the same as the pacifier that she loves My only gripe is that since the bottles are so wide they cover the whole lower part of her face and it smooshes her nose There isnt a curve in the bottle so when the milk gets low you either have to lean the baby back more which I dont like or either mash the bottle on her nose Its avoidable but I tend to do it whithout realizing sometimes Id rather just stick with a bottle like playtex with a curver or a bottle that is slimer I still use the bottles but I just have to make sure the whole time I m feeding that it isnt mashing her nose so she can breath 
5 0 Finally a bottle that works We adopted a little boy when he was 2 days old He was slightly preemie and weighed just over 5 pounds He wouldn t have anything to do with the soothie for preemies but loved the regular soothie pacifier even though it covered half his face We had a hard time finding a bottle that he liked he didn t seem to care for any of the nipples and we tried several avent dr brown gerber and playtex I was strolling the baby aisle in Target when I saw these and was thrilled In the store the 3 pack of 5 oz bottles was half of what they are here on amazon I love the width of the bottles because it s super easy to add in formula and make sure everything is really clean The lid also snaps onto the bottom which helps keep them from mysteriously disappearing Our baby is now 8 weeks old and these are still doing well This bottle has really cut down on the amount of mess our baby makes when eating also Double check to make sure the top is on tight and you shouldn t have any leaking problems I m so glad I found these 
4 0 Great Bottle I tried several different bottles including Avent and Second Nature and this is the only one that my baby could get a good suction on and didn t flow too fast or make her gag The nipples are the same as the pacifier given to me at the hospital which is the only pacifier she will take as well I am breastfeeding and with all of the trouble I was having findnig a bottle I was worried about what would happen when I went back to work and my baby had to be fed from a bottle This bottle has eased my mind Also the wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it will leak if the top is not on really tight but as long as I make sure it is tight I have no problems 
5 0 I love it I bought this stroller after having a 7 year old peg perego hand me down I loved the old one but it looked like it had one thousand miles on it as a friend told me so I gave it to my mom to use I knew it was important to get a good stroller that would last rather than buying cheap ones I am a very price sensitive I shop at consignment shops etc and I still feel the money spent is worth it The reason I like this stroller 1 You can guide it with one hand 2 There is a spot for bags etc underneath 3 The cup holder for mommy and child this is an extra accessory 4 It s lightweight and you can pop it open and closed easily 5 The five point harnes 
5 0 ITS THE BEST I did my research for the best stroller thus this one is the best in market travelling with my baby is much fun and easier I can carry fold and move it with no help its so easy to open and fold Its very cozy my baby can sleep happily in it 
5 0 Fantastic stroller and for the price it couldn t be better For the price how can you go wrong it is absolutely FULL FEATURED besides a lot of features of the stroller itself you get a uv shade cover a raincover and a cover for the legs the boot useful when it is cold Easy to open and close a breeze to push I can even manage with one hand baby is happy in it Only wish it could recline with one hand The two buttons you have to press to recline the stroller get a bit stuck on ours but maybe cos it is new Even if I knew that would happen I still would buy this stroller it is something I can live with It is almost half the price of the 2007 models which only differ from the 2006 in color and fabric The color though is not really what I expected from a teal it is more of a dirty blue 
5 0 great for travel My boys love them They draw in the car and their cup can sit on it Kinda a pain for short drives but wonderful for longer trips 
5 0 Recent purchase of Dr Brown s I bought 3 packages of Dr Brown s through AMAZON COM standard size nipples and I received 2 standard and 1 wide They shipped the wrong item to me I returned the wide to the address in Calabasas California and have not received and feedback that they received it or any refund for the product as well as the postage to send the wrong item back to RIGHT START I enjoy using this product for my child because it is the only one that works for him Since my purchase I still have not received anything except this email from AMAZON COM I rate the product 5 stars but the service 1 star 
4 0 It remembers so you don t have to I bought this when my daughter was 2 weeks old and it is simple to use and extremely helpful for sleep deprived mothers With the touch of one button I can keep track of how long it has been since I fed my baby I don t use the sleep or diaper timers but this is worth it for the feeding timer alone The first unit I was sent was defective and I received terrific customer service when I contacted the company I am rating with 4 stars instead of 5 only because I d like to be able to keep track of the daily total feedings as well Maybe a future model 
5 0 Must have they should issue these in hospitals when you give birth This timer system is beyond helpful it becomes your BRAIN when you have a newborn as the hours feedings and diaper changes become a total blur during this amazing yet totally sleep deprived time of your life While it would be nice to have a few more features like total ounces drank whether the diaper was a wet one or a doodie and tracking of daily totals for everything that d be more of a infantcare PDA and is a bit beyond the scope of this little device All it aims to be is a timer that will keep track of the key stats in your baby s life consequently making your life way easier I wake up in middle of the night and the baby is grunting for example I click the backlight button and see that in fact the baby has only been asleep for an hour and had a diaper and bottle right before that Then I just go back to sleep On the other hand he beguns grunting and making noises and I see the Itzbeen says it s been 2 hours 30 minutes since his last bottle or diaper and I know it s time to get up and feed him It s also great for team caregiving as my husband can hand me the Itzbeen after doing his morning shift and I automatically know when the last change and bottle were We use the wildcard button to track bottle expirations too Thumbs up for the developers of this cool gadget I hope to see an Itzbeen II w some advanced features in time for my next baby although keeping it simple does help keep it easy and quick to use especially in the fog of a 1am 3am and 5am feeding schedule my son never got the memo that full term babies are only supposed to eat every 3 or 4 hours 
5 0 Peace of mind The Snuggle Nest gave my husband and I peace of mind while co sleeping with our son I thought about purchasing the Arm s Reach Co sleeper but my son wanted to be REAL close to us through the night Our son is ten weeks old and it still works It is cumbersome when trying to nurse because you have to sit up and pull the baby out and after a Cesarean that proved to be a little difficult I m hoping the transition to his crib will be easy with the Snuggle Nest by putting the Snuggle Nest into his crib The little light is helpful when trying to get my son to latch on during nursing or chaning diapers in the middle of the night the bedside light wakes my husband 
5 0 nice for the cradle We had an old wooden cradle for the newborn The Snuggle Nest made it snuggly warm and comfy However it didn t work in our bed queen size because it was big and bulky If you plan on using it in your bed buy inclined to sleep with positioners Babies R Us sells it now It s easier to move the sleeping baby from and to your bed when in inclined to sleep 
5 0 Daddy s Relief I am nursing our 2 wk old and it is just easier for me if our baby sleeps with us My husband is always worried he will roll over on the baby so he does not sleep well The snuggle nest has given him peace of mind and now he can sleep Also the DVD has made him more comfortable taking care of the baby by himself because he feels confident that he can calm our baby down without my help I only wish we would have bought this with second child 
5 0 easy to use I ve tried other cart covers and this one is the nicest It s big and well floppy It s padded so it keeps my son comfortable You can put it on the cart with one hand I have to put my son in and then do the seat belt through the back It works great We leave it in the car and use it everywhere I bought it because when my other son was a baby he got really sick a few days after a trip to the grocery store I ve seen programs about what s on those cart seats people put their raw meat in that section of the cart all the time yuck I feel much safer now 
5 0 A Fun Quiet Crib Toy for Babies and Toddlers Our Hungry Pelican is now on child number three and shows no signs of wear despite being a favorite crib toy for many years The bright yellow velour pelican ties onto the crib railing His fat cheeks squeak his wings crinkle and his feet rattle He comes with four sea creatures crab shrimp fish and octopus that are each different textures and colors and make different sounds rattle rustle etc Children can put the little animals into pelican s mouth and watch them drop down into his tummy The large circular tummy opening allows for easy removal of the animals so play can begin all over again I found that babies enjoy quietly investigating the sounds colors and textures of the four little sea creatures Toddlers progress to the eating game I am grateful to Mr Pelican for allowing me an extra half hour of sleep every morning What can be better than that 
5 0 mother must have cheap as well This product saves time and for people that hygiene freak this is a good one Wash yor baby bottle dry them and sterilise as needed also I take to work to sterilise my pump and bottle before pumping with the parts since it is just few minutes 
5 0 The Quick Clean Steam Bags are a GODSEND The fastest way to KNOW your plastic baby wares are CLEAN I love these bags Note I use two bags simultaneously in the microwave to knock out my cleaning faster since there are limits to how many items you can put in each bag without warping You do need to get any smudgy or residue like material off the plastic item BEFORE steaming it for best results Overall I would HIGHLY recommend this product it has been a lifesaver to me 
5 0 Great for quick cleans I only occasionally feed my baby and my apartment doesn t have a dishwasher I usually decide right before going out that I want to take a bottle so this disinfects everything really quick in 3 minutes As opposed to boiling it in a pot of water for 20 minutes ANd I don t use it every days so I don t see the point in keeping everything sterlized cuz I would have to sterilize it again right before using 
4 0 Definitely cloud like I heard about these blankets from a co worker and had to order the mommie blanket for me and the pink baby blanket for my daughter They are the softest blankets I ve ever felt There s a reason this company s name is CloudB The only reason I gave this blanket 4 stars is because of the quality of the sewing the mommie velboa blanket arrived with lots of loose threads hanging off the edges Not a big deal I just snipped them with a scissors but still disappointing to get such a beautiful blanket but have it look a little unfinished 
5 0 Great for part time pumping I bought this pump about 6 weeks after my son was born and I love it He s 5 months old now and I have used it while working since he was 3 months old without any problems I have to pump in the ladies room where I work but this pump is so quiet that no one knows what I m doing I work 10 hour shifts so I pump quite a bit but this pump is so easy to use that I don t have the hand wrist pain that I ve had with other manual pumps Overall the bag is stylish and discreet the bottles are fabulous no nipple confusion problems and I have not had any problems with any part of it The only thing I would suggest to someone looking to purchase one of these is to acquire additional ice packs if you can t keep your milk in the fridge I had to buy two more solid ice packs to keep my milk cold all day Otherwise I have no complaints Excellent product and service 
5 0 Awesome pump even for a full time working mom I LOVE my Avent pump Even though I knew I would be returning to work when my son was just 6 weeks old I was reluctant to spend the money on an expensive electric pump until I knew if breastfeeding would be right for us Now my son is almost 6 months old and I m still using my manual pump I take 2 15 minute breaks each day and find that I can easily keep up with my son s milk needs On the days that I have trouble getting my milk to flow I find that it has much more to do with my stress level than the pump s efficieny On those nights I nurse on one side while I pump on the other I would definitely recommend this pump as a great value for the price 
5 0 Great for occasional use bad for work It s a great manual pump but it s just a manual pump after all Manually pumping both breasts one at a time takes more than twice as long as double electric pumping to get the same amounts of milk It would be impossible for me to keep pumping at work if I had to take that much time out of every work day However I do keep this pump in my desk drawer for emergencies like the time I forgot my other pump at home or for out of office meetings because it s small and discrete It s also great for occasional home use or for women who need to leave the house with a pump every once in a while I m giving it 4 stars because I don t think it should be advertized for use at a full time job 
5 0 Skip Hop Splash I love this bottle dryer It was a little pricey but worth it It holds a lot of stuff and is not in the way on the countertop I never put bottles binkies etc away anymore I just leave them because it is so convienent 
5 0 Changing Pad Just what I wanted A portable waterproof durable padded easy to clean changing pad 
5 0 Convenient I love this containers First of all I am a big fan of the Isis Breast Pump so these containers are perfect for me I express into these containers freeze them thaw them out replace the sealing disc with the nipple warm it up Then my husband is ready to feed the baby It s one of their times together and I get to spend time with my older children Perfect 
5 0 Great storage containers for breast milk I use the Medela pump but their thin bottles and simple caps don t seem like they have the ability to keep the milk fresh I love the heavy Advent bottles and the caps have a rubber ring in them to really seal the bottle 
5 0 Great for BABY My newborn loves this seat The calming music and the vibation helps calm her when she is being fussy Easy to put together and take down if you want to take it with you Great Product 
5 0 Worth it s weight in Gold I love my new stroller I also have a Graco travel system The Graco was just way to big and heavy for me to handle I think the Peg steers very well unlike what some other reviewers have said I even set up an obtacle course in the store I bought it at to make sure that I could steer it one handed with my 1yr old in it It handled like a dream My husband and I went to the mall last weekend and were waiting for an elevator instead of waiting in the long line my husband carried our 1yr old and I carried the stroller up the stairs while it was fully opened It was a breeze We did the same thing when we left the mall only this time I collasped the stroller the carrying handle on it makes it super easy to carry up or down stairs It s still winter so I haven t had much of a chance to test out the sun shade but hopefully that will work out ok I would reccomend this stroller to anyone infact I ve told two of my girlfriends about it and they have already added it to their gift registry You will be happy with this stroller 
4 0 Nice chair for the price If your looking for a no frills chair this is the one I didn t find it terribly difficult to put together but was suprised at how well made the tray and seating area is I didn t want to spend a whole lot of money on a highchair being the fact that my older kids when they were big enough they would rather sit on a booster seat It does recline but I keep the seat in the upright for my 6 month old She seems to like it better that way The only thing I would complain about is I don t care for the way the belt is I may be using it incorrectly at least it seems like that but it holds the baby and that s what it s meant for 
5 0 This is truely the best purchace when it comes to warmers The review before this one is what got me interested with this produce and so I decided to buy it and let me tell you it was the best choice ever I have no real experience with any other wipes but have read reviews of all the promes other have given like wipes dry out or turn color THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN WITH THIS ONE I love that I just put the whole pack in plastic and all and it stays nice and toasty for my son s bottom He loves it and no longer has to deal with cold wipes anymore I love the spring inside to keep the wipes on top I love that it heats from the top The wipes never turn yellow and is ALWAYS moist I also love the little handle on the top so I just have to pull the plug and easily carry it to another room if need be The product is hight recommended 
5 0 only leaks when over tightened I tried several types of bottles when supplementing nursing Even the Playtex nursers which I liked with my older children caused gas and fussiness with my son I had received a free Avent nurser so I tried it and the problem was eliminated I bought the newborn set and some extras not cheap but worth it for a content baby I was quite upset when they began leaking then I discovered that unlike other bottles that leak if you don t tighten as much as possible if you tighten Avent fully and then loosen by about a half turn they don t leak No gas no leaks happy baby 
5 0 Awesome crib set awesome price I wanted this set since I saw it in Babies r us but it was so much more expensive This is perfect for my new baby girl I always loved Hello Kitty and I hope she will too Also there are many cute accessories that you can purchase with this set The lamp rug and mobile are a must = The set comes with only one window valance and as my nursery has 2 windows I had to purchase an additional valance Just something to keep in mind when buying this 
4 0 Essential for First Time Moms This nursery care kit is great Before buying another care kit consider the following points with the time and frustration you will save you ll be glad you did The first week home from the hospital I used the nasal aspirator countless times It is very gentle but very effective The digital thermometer is quick and easy to use So much better than the glass and mercury kind The medicine spoon and dropper are very clearly marked so you know exactly how much you are giving your baby The nail clippers are curved so they can cut better with less chance of cutting your baby s finger Anyone that has ever cut their baby s finger while trimming their nails will appreciate that The items in this kit are small and compact and very easy to store Great to keep in your diaper bag for when you re on the go 
5 0 Good price for a nice set This is a great price for a 4 pc set I got ours at walmart for 35 The comforter is not thick and plushy Its very thin and stiff But then again for the price its ok The sheets are adorable We bought a very soft fuzzy Dora blanket to go with it But the comforter that comes with it is definately cute Maybe after a few washes it will soften up some I would still buy it again for the price But if you are looking for a thick soft warm comfoter then this is not the one you want 
5 0 Very portable and easy to use I purchased this booster seat with the intention of using it on our upcoming vacation only but it has come in very handy while visiting family and friends as well It is easy to set up and take down and is very compact when folded My son weighs 16 pounds and my nephew weighs approximately 25 pounds both have used it and neither one seemed uncomfortable in any way We ve only used it a handful of times so far but I can t think of one bad thing to say about it We re very pleased with our purchase 
4 0 Surprised but my daughter likes it I bought these strap covers 1 because my daughter s neck was being rubbed raw by the straps of her Snugride and 2 because I could get them in PINK and she would no longer be confused for a boy all the time This product solved both problems When I took them out of the packaging and realized how BIG they were I was pretty concerned that my daughter would be uncomfortable even though they are really soft Luckily she adapted easily to them and I think she even likes having them there because she can kind of chew on it and they also hold her head up like a travel pillow when she falls asleep in her carseat 
5 0 It s a GREAT bedding set Absolutely love it and it s a GREAT quality too For this price I just can t believe it 
4 0 It s great but This is a great item but it does have some flaws I got this for my 2 month old and he loved it Now he s 6 months and loves it just as much The thing is you need to manually push the button and then you can use the remote After it plays all the music and it shuts off the only way to turn it back on is to press the button yourself Not great when you re flying on the freeway But it still seems to calm my baby as soon as the music goes on 
5 0 Love this bag Lots of room for more than I need easy to carry cute as a button lots of compliments from strangers has held up for 4 months so far with no problems 
5 0 Love it I have a 7 week old baby and this is the only bag we have used thus far I can carry my baby in a sling on the front and this bag slung over my back at the same time It seem quite rugged and holds a ton I can carry 4 newborn diapers or 2 cloth diapers a travel wipes container a small changing pad a couple of spare onsies a nursing shawl 2 washcloths for spit up an extra receiving blanket a 4 oz bottle of cleanser phone lipstick keys and wallet and that is only in the main compartments The only proplem I ve had was that the fastener on the bottle holder came off before I had even used the bag but I was able to fix it I may want a bigger bag when she starts needing toys and food to come along but for now this is perfect 
5 0 A leash without looking like a leash I am one of those people who used to think horrible things about people who put their kids on leashes Then I became mom to a very busy and independent little girl who started walking at 9 months I bought the Harness Buddy for a cruise we were taking when my daughter was 16 months I couldn t imagine trying to keep up with her on the ship and she will not sit in a stroller for an extended period of time The first time we used it I started having images of her reacting like what happens when you put a cat on a leash but she loved it She enjoys her freedom even if it is limited by the leash I cannot tell you how many people have commented on how cute it is It is so soft and cuddly We now use it in the mall and have seen more and more people with the same Harness Buddy Oh and I think the fact that she is getting exercise instead of sitting in the stroller is fantastic We love it 
5 0 My Daughter loves the big girl chair I love the 5 point harness My daughter needed to get out of the car seat but still need more than a seat belt This seat was easy to install and we love it 
5 0 Great lightweight stroller We got our Maclaren stroller a few weeks ago We love it My husband and I are both tall me 5 7 and him 6 1 Both of us can use this stroller without slouching or kicking the wheels when we walk The stroller folds and unfolds easily and maneuvers beautifully I highly recommend this stroller to anyone who is taller and wants a convenient stroller 
5 0 Terrific travel and all around stroller Our 10 piece of junk umbrella stroller you know the one bit the dust on a 10 day trip to Europe so in a bit of emergency we got this one at Harrod s in London and about had a cow paying 60 pounds for this exact stroller Turns out it s the best one we could have gotten and the price was right You can t go wrong It s sturdy well balanced super easy to fold up and carry around sling it over your shoulder it s that light and has a nice larger sun rain shield ours happened to come with a rain cover as well but this was in London and I don t know if this US version comes with it automatically The color orange is great for boys or girls and bright enough for pedestrian traffic awareness Love it Like many people with two kids we calculated that we ve gone through half a dozen strollers over the past 8 years how does that happen car seats too and this is the best so far Go for it 
5 0 The Best Best stroller we own Our top of the line Graco and Jeep strollers sit in the garage now It is very light weight easy to use and folds up very neat and tidy 
5 0 Best Stroller Ever This new Maclaren stroller is fantastic We just returned from three weeks in France with this great stroller It can roll down an aisle on an airplane and negotiate the rocks and bumps of any street It is very light and we love the new shoulder strap I have 3 kids and this is the best stroller I have ever used 
5 0 Great bottle for smaller babies I bought these bottles because my daughter was having trouble with the flow of other bottles They were to fast for her Like the other reviews this was also the only paci she would take that didn t gag her Great for little babies that can t control their flow control 
4 0 Great Bottle I tried several different bottles including Avent and Second Nature and this is the only one that my baby could get a good suction on and didn t flow too fast or make her gag The nipples are the same as the pacifier given to me at the hospital which is the only pacifier she will take as well I am breastfeeding and with all of the trouble I was having findnig a bottle I was worried about what would happen when I went back to work and my baby had to be fed from a bottle This bottle has eased my mind Also the wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it will leak if the top is not on really tight but as long as I make sure it is tight I have no problems 
4 0 great for the money I was able to put this dresser together by myself and I was 6 months pregnant The overall look is beautiful A great buy for the money I did buy the fabric railing protectors from babies r us to protect the round railings from a teeting baby since it is made of pine and they fit perfectly 
5 0 Great I love this item with my first son and I got them again for my second son Great product keeps them warm without getting overheated and then you don t have to worry about loose blankets at night 
5 0 Smells Great These cloths are awesome They smell great and don t crumble like other brands They work well for sponge baths when there s no time for a real bath Love them 
5 0 Soft economical and yummy smelling I know that after looking at the price tag one might be confused why I say economical however when you only need one wipe to do the job that would take 3 wipes with other brands for those exploding messes they are a value These wipes have the right amount of wetness to them to clean an area thoroughly with one wipe most of the time Of course they smell amazing and are the softest wipe I ve ever seen I have only positive remarks for these wipes 
5 0 Very nice and sturdy I installed this today though I haven t used it that much yet but the quality seems very good and it seems very sturdy I was afraid it might not be sturdy and safe from looking at the photo but after getting it and installing it it seems pretty sturdy and safe to me It also comes with a seat beat to keep the child secure in the seat I m giving the chair five stars because I can t think of anything negative about it 
5 0 Color I wanted to respond to the other review If you choose to purchase window coverings from this set instead of making them or getting them elsewhere please know that the curtains are a darker stripe not the tan plaid But they do match the ruffle on the diaper stacker the border on the wall hangings and quilt the trim on the hamper etc It is not as if there would be this one item with an odd color or pattern 
5 0 Great Items My husband and I ordered these pictures for our sons nursery Our theme is Barn Yard we also got the coordinating lamp light plate switch and night light These pictures really help to complete the room The delivery time was slow pictures arrived two days after set date but they were definately worth waiting for They appear to be actual canvas and acrylic art work I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for the perfect picture to complete their nursery 
4 0 affordable luxury this seat caught my attention because of the higher weight and height capacity 29 inches and 22lbs but this seat is also very well made the padding is exceptional compared to evenflo and graco every where is padded the head rest has additional egg shock support and it comes with an additional body pillow for newborns until the pillow gets snug and you have to remove it my daughter was 13lbs and 8 ounces and 25 inches at her 4 month old wellbaby check up in june now six months old she still fits and is not hanging out at all i have to wonder if the previous reviewer removed the body pillow it does get snug and then you have to use the seat without the pillow why not five stars the instructions are bad the seat is much easier to install without the base but a good seat overall 
4 0 Clean + Pure Feeding I cringe at the idea that I fed my baby from heated up polycarbonate bottles I might not be able to breastfeed my baby but with my new glass bottles at least I know that I am feeding her the purest form of formula I can possibly give She hated the taste of the latex rubber nipples so I bought some silicone ones and was successful When I consider the epidemic of autism in this country I am dedicated to buying pure organic baby products and avoiding using plastic products especially when heating in the microwave 
5 0 Perfect hard to find in stores Excellent product very difficult to find in stores Can safely heat breastmilk and formula in a warmer healthier than heating in plastic 
5 0 Solution to feeding my baby I had trouble getting my breastfed baby to take an Avent bottle which my first took beautifully so I called the lactation consultants at the hospital to ask their advice They suggested the Evenflo classic bottles which are like these except plastic with the clear nipple They worked great After swearing by Avent with my first I never imagined the solution to feeding my second would be an old fashioned type bottle It works though so I will stick with them 
4 0 good product for price I bought this dresser despite some of the negative reviews and believe that it is a good product for the price The dresser seems very sturdy and everything came undamaged It only took my husband and I an hour to put together 
5 0 Excellent product at an affordable price I would like to state that I take issue with the previous reviews in that they claim this piece is flimsy It is NOT at all flimsy nor does it look cheap In fact my husband and I have the entire set changing table and dresser along with the Montery Crib When you receive the boxes there is an instruction booklet that clearly states that the manufacturer not the store will handle all returns exchanges or shipping of missing parts Well we had a question regarging set up of this product and thought there was a defect We spoke with Storkcraft directly and found thqat we were not following the assembly directions properly Storkcraft was exremely helpful and pleasant and promised us that we could return the item at any time to them DIRECTLY and they would arrange for a prompt exchange This piece looks beautiful and serves its purpose as a infant child dresser I am sure that you could spend 1 000 on a high end piece but if you are looking for something that is 1 AFFORDABLE and 2 WELL MADE and 3 BEAUTIFUL then Storkcraft is a good choice 
5 0 Why did I wait I was given a Swaddle Me for my third child She has been my only child that slept through the night at five weeks My oldest did not sleep through the night until nine months and my second still does not I owe it all to the Swaddle Me But at three months she outgrew the small size I thought she was old enough to go without swaddling boy was I wrong It took me a month of sleepless nights to purchase the larger size I have had my large Swaddle Me for two weeks and have had two nights of trouble since then Thank you Swaddle Me for helping me keep my sanity 
5 0 I love this wrap Since I also have a two year old it has been so great to have this wrap I can go to the park with him and not have to leave the baby in a stoller and I can keep my hands free The best part is that my baby falls asleep in the wrap usually within five minutes If he is fussy and I don t really know why it is so easy to put him in here and take the kids for a walk The only drawback is that it is a bit comebersome so I wouldn t use it if I was only going to have it on for a few minutes This is such a great way to get the things done that you need to do while still staying close to your baby And the wide straps keep it from hurting my back at all 
4 0 Great quality perfect match I like the fact that Kidsline offers extra crib sheets to go with the Zanzibar theme and am impressed with the quality of these sheets I have two one came with the bedding set and one was purchased off my baby registry They wash extremely well still looks new are soft and fit the mattress appropriately However I think 16 99 for a crib sheet is a bit pricey and have purchased other crib sheets that match the theme and are just as nice Amy coe sage green at Target for 8 99 and koala baby sage green for 9 99 at BRU Since you need several crib sheets I just don t feel the price is worth it for this one 
4 0 Soothie Bottles made life so much easier My daughter is breastfed but we introduced a bottle around 3 weeks to ensure that she would take one with pumped milk and or formula We originally bought Avent bottles and had no problems until all of a sudden at 2 1 2 months she went bonkers Refused to drink from the bottle Granted we had be a bit lax on giving her bottles not every day but at least once per week I tried a Dr Browns and it was the same problem And it didn t matter if it was breastmilk forumula warm cold room temp etc She just screamed during this time she had been using a Platex ortho pacifier but had begun using the soothie pacifer I got from the Hospital She didn t like the soothie pacifier at all to begin with took several months for her to like it Anyway I randomly had a freebie Soothie bottle from motherhood maternity in the drawer that I thought I might as well try she took it immediately I have since bought several more in preparation for daycare and she still takes them with no problems she s 4 months now I have not had any problem with leaks and in fact she stays much much cleaner with this bottle than she did with Avent My only problem is there is no disc to put underneath the nipple when transporting or mixing in the bottle However the stage 1 nipples are pretty slow so as long as its kept upright it does okay I have been using my old avent bottle with sealing discs as milk transport and pouring into the Soothie to feed 
5 0 Soothie bottles My granddaughter was 6 weeks premature and at 4 lbs she had no problem with the soothie bottle the pacifer she loves the bottles are easy to clean and love that the cap snaps on the bottom of the bottle while feeding like the little cups to hold the powder formual Haven t had a problem with the bottles leaking Love the ones with the designs of Winnie the Pooh on them wish they came in the 3 bottle set also wish you could buy the little snack formula containers seperately not just in the large sets Would recommend for any baby 
5 0 Great This is a very useful item It looks great and holds a lot of stuff You can also carry it around from room to room 
5 0 So soft While these aren t waterPROOF they provide enough additional protection to give you a little more confidence in going out of the house in underwear So soft and a little more absorbent than the Gerber ones They aren t as trim a fit as some of the other brands but my son really likes the roomy feel 
4 0 no need to get a fancier diaper pail than this This pail does not need special plastic bags you can use leftover grocery bags etc which is a big advantage I don t know why people buy those diaper pails that individually wraps every dirty diaper a baby s poop does not smell bad 
5 0 I cannot sleep without it This pillow is the best After sleeping with it the first night I new I couldn t be without it My husband bought it for me and I am so thankful I left it at my mother s house one night and I could not sleep I keep waking up The night after getting it back I slept like a baby again If you are having trouble sleeping you have to buy this Its very soft and you can take the cover off to wash it 
5 0 Worked great with real underwear incentive I bought Elmo Underwear from Ebay with a sports theme and was done training in a couple of weeks The real underwear incentive did the trick So then I bought more underwear as a reward I got Wiggles Thomas the Tank and Nemo Underwear from Ebay 
4 0 Great crib but quality has changed I bought this same crib in May of 2005 from Buy Buy Baby and it came in six weeks pretty easy to assemble I did it while I was pregnant It had no scartches or chips I like it a lot and my daughter loves it we havent converted it to a toddler bed or the full bed shes only 2 But its very roomy It can get dented a little easily as when she banged a toy on it there were some dents but since its in white you dont notice it that much I really like it cuz the quality is superb and we re very very happy with In fact we bought another one from amazon for my son My kids are 12 months apart so we needed another crib for him since now hes 1 He likes it a lot too But even though company and everything is the same the crib did come with some damaging to it but it wasnt that bad you dont really notice it we got lucky i guess But i do plan to just paint over the parts where the white paint has come off The quality also seems different it doesnt seem as dense as the first one I bought I dont know whether the manufacturing has changed or its quality issues But overall its a nice crib I just wish it came in better condition and that it was the same wood feeling as the first one But its definately worth the buy AND it came with SUPER FAST SHIPPING with amazon and the shipping was free too But its well worth the buy My kids are happy and so im happy 
4 0 Great Buy I ordered this at Christmas with the free super saver shipping The crib arrived within a week Assembly was simple and the crib feels very sturdy and stable It s attractive but my only complaints are 1 it did arrive with about five different chipped gouged areas in the white paint this was easily remedied by touching up with white paint and 2 the bolts are exposed on the crib it would have looked better if they had provided caps Overall I m very happy with the crib AND the price can t wait to use it for my little girl who is due in May 
5 0 Love it This crib came in five days and was in perfect shape We set it up in a reasonable amount of time I can honestly say that it feels sturdier than any other cribs we were shopping for in the stores 
5 0 I love this crib This crib is beautiful and exactly what we were looking for Our first shipment came in damaged but after a short phone call a second one was on it s way Great customer service The quality of the bed is outstanding We purchased it for our first child but should also be able to use for the second when that time comes 
5 0 Great crib at a great price My wife and I just finished putting this crib together It took a total of 25 minutes start to finish The instructions were extremely easy to follow We bought this exact crib in honey oak 18 months ago for baby number one and it has worked so well we ordered the same crib in white for baby number two Our original crib is in the same great shape as when we first put it together The only adjustments we have done where to lower the mattress support heights from higher to lower Even that process only took a matter of minutes I have read crib purchase reviews where the box arrived extremely beat up When ours arrived the outside of the box was a little rough but the crib pieces inside are very well packed padded and wrapped and there was not a scratch on the white finish The super saver free shipping arrived at our door 6 days from date of purchase I have never wrote a review for an online purchase before but we are so pleased with our two cribs that I wanted to pass on a very positive message to those who may be comtemplating buying this crib P S I m a physician and this crib could not be any safer no solid side walls or backing just the well spaced rounded slates all the way around and no moving part 
5 0 Love it Great safe and nice looking bumper I would recommend it without hesitation 
5 0 excellent product My 5 month old daughter always put her face into the bumpers on her crib so I stopped putting her in the crib because I was afraid of her sufficating and without the bumbers her hands and feet could still get in between the rails on the crib and because she moves aroung so much I was afraid of her hurting herself So now I love puttingher in the crib because the bumpers are mesh and I don t have to worry They were also real simple to put on because of the velcro and when you change the sheet on the crib its alot easier to get the matress back in because the bumper is so flat Great product I highly recommend it 
5 0 Great I love it u have all that u need for helth care baby here just in one pack u dont need to buy more 
5 0 Received armoire with some dent on wood Some of the pieces were dent when I opened the box it was too late to returned it back I found out that wood was dented after I had trashed shipping box 
4 0 Very Nice The armoire is very pretty but please show pictures of the inside of the furniture pieces because I was expecting something else I still like it very much but I wanted a part to hang clothes and it doesn t have one It is very pretty and from the outside it was everything I was expecting Thank you 
4 0 QUICK SHIPMENT A FEW SCREWS MISSING BUT FAST RESPONSE AFTER READING ALL THE HORROR STORIES WE WERE LEARY TO PURCHASE BUT DECIDED TO WELL IN ADVANCE OF OUR CHILD S BIRTH WE RECIEVED THE ARMOIRE WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF PLACING THE ORDER IT WAS EASY TO PUT TOGETHER LESS THAN 1 5HRS THERE WERE SOME SCREWS MISSING FOR THE DOORS BUT I CALLED STORCRAFT THE NEXT DAY AND WAS IMMEDIATELY PUT THROUGH WITH NO BUSY SIGNALS THEY SENT OUT THE SCREWS AND I HAD THEM WITHIN 10 WORKING DAYS THEY COME FROM CANADA IT IS BEAUTIFUL WITH NOT ONE NICK OR DING IN IT WE D RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE AS PART OF THEIR CHILDS NURSERY FYI IT WAS NOT CHEAPER AT WALMART ONCE TAX AND SHIPPING WERE INCLUDED 
4 0 I like it My son is going through potty traning and he hates those toilet covers he just wont sit in them so this product was our solution for him when we are out It is small but my son 20 months old fits fine in it The problem is I can t find the liners anywhere 
5 0 baby bedding The Sweet Pea bedding set is a good buy the quality of the workmanship is excellent has a high end look for a low end price 
5 0 Don t Buy Extras The crib just the way it comes is best A thicker mattress would be bad for 2 reasons Firm is best to avoid suffocation dangers Bumber pads are also recommended against by all modern advice sites and classes SIDS deaths appear to be related to suffocation and this happens usually when the baby s mouth and nose are against padding Firm mattress like this very thin one are much safer The main thing is to always lay the infant on it s back to sleep and not on it s belly Also never use a bumber padding in any crib for any very young child Finally there is also the issue of outgassing of any kind of waterproof plastic type matress covers and foam filling What you want if you can t afford the very expensive natural options is a thin mattress like this one that won t have a lot of material to outgas thus reducing the exposure of your baby to these common somewhat toxic VOCs Best is to buy this a few weeks or longer ahead of time and then air out the mattress I m even putting ours in the clothes dryer on low heat just past the switch off point so that the drying heats it up a little and then clicks off the heat and continues exhausting air past it until the end of cycle This is my own idea of how to accelerate the outgassing so that our new baby in January won t have much VOCs to breath 
5 0 Great Crib If Your Space Is Limited We have 2 kids in a 2 bedroom apartment When our 2nd child was born we put him in our bedroom There is not much space there so this portable crib was a great find We use it as a permanent crib until our son outgrows it Pros saves space folds easy to move from room to room on wheels really easy to change the sheets compared to regular crib with heavy matress It also has very neutral color and style so it fits really well with other traditional furniture Cons the baby will outgrow it in about 1 year the matress is extremely thin about 1 inch We bought an extra matress the normal thickness for about 20 To find it do a search for portable crib matress 
5 0 Like the crib except for the mattress My wife and I like the portable crib quite a bit It is great to move from room to room and you can pull it up next to your bed similar to a co sleeper The price is also not bad at all The only annoying thing is that the mattress pad that comes with it is so flimsy as to be practically unusable We went to Baby Depot and bought a serviceable pad for about 20 Even after buying the extra mattress pad I still think the portable crib was a good buy and I do not regret our decision to buy the crib at all I would buy the crib again if I had to start all over our son sleeps quite well in it 
5 0 easy to transport and use I bought this pump when I was going to a concert and knew I would need to pump while I was out to avoid discomfort and leakage This pump fit in my purse and was easy to use I just slipped out into the bathroom and pumped It was silent and no one even knew 
5 0 I was SO skeptical bought it and LOVE it I researched many breast pumps on line before my daughter was born After she was two weeks old and my milk supply was established I decided to purchase a pump I had read many reviews about ISIS and was so skeptical and I didn t want to pay 300 for an automatic one I enjoy breastfeeding so much however I am not comfortable nursing in public not to mention pumping allows my husband to feed her too After much thought I decided to purchase the ISIS amp quot back to work amp quot It came with the pump bottles and the tote which by the way is very discreet I had no trouble assembling it at all From the first time I used ISIS I ve had great success I am able to pump several ounces in 15 minutes without any pain or discomfort as I control the suction Our daughter does not have any problems switching from bottle to breast at all nor have we ever experienced bottles nipples leaking I assemble the pump and the nipples rings when they are just out of the sterilizer and are still wet I love how easy this is to use and I don t have to find a place to plug it in at work The only thing I ve noticed is that the little gel packs don t stay cool enough for my liking so I went and purchased 2 little ice packs 90 cents and they work like a charm I would recommend this to any Mom 
5 0 Cheese it The Fuzz My Wife and I bought this item for the usual reasons We washed them and had no problems with fuzzballs or shredding They re just as soft and sturdy as they were before we washed them if not a little softer For the record we washed them on the cold cycle with other baby clothes They went through the drier for an hour at the lowest heat setting Anyway I m just writing the review to offset the bad review There was nothing wrong with the pads that we received and they do what they re supposed to do get between the warm baby and the cold changing table 
4 0 Very Cute and Big I was surprised at what a good size this rug was It matches the bedding perfect The only negative thing I can say about it is that it tends to scoot around a little bit when you walk on it I put it right in front of my son s crib and by the end of the day half of it seems to have scooted under the crib It could probably use some kind of gripping material underneath it to keep it in place 
4 0 Balcony Safety for Your Toddler Product shipped quickly and was well packaged Each loop or hole on the edge has an individual string that you have to tread Would have been better if the strings were attached to the netting Overall the product works very well and gave us the protection for our child we were looking for Our 22 month old tested it contiually by pushing hard and running into it and there were no problems 
4 0 Safe simple and will be easy to remove later We just installed these this weekend on our upstairs banisters they re great They re strong enough to keep our 11 month old baby from falling through we pushed and pulled on them after getting them all fastened I still intend to watch him carefully when he s up there but these will definitely protect him in an emergency Just be sure to follow directions tie them tightly They re not that bad looks wise either I can still see my spindles through the netting so the look of the stairway is basically unchanged Of course looks are less important than safety I think I m going to get these for our outdoor deck as well I d recommend them 
5 0 Baby Gate works well The gate works well It is a little hard to move the panels but overall works well 
5 0 prima pappa diner i had this highchair delivered to my new great grandaughter so I am reporting what they said about it Great 
5 0 It s Very Useful My baby has used this since she was 4 months old It has a sturdy wide base It has height adjusters you can recline it very secure safty belts but I do make sure my babies hands are nowhere near it when I buckle it thats the only thing I dislike about this highchair I dont find it hard to clean it comes with two trays and it has wheels and folds up definately worth the money especially now because it s on sale I paid full price 
4 0 Watch Out for Defects I love this car seat except for the fact that the one I have is defective The crotch snap does not work properly When I contacted Baby Trend they advised that they do not exchange or repair their products free even though mine was manufactured in October 2006 I contacted them in December less than a month after I bought it Otherwise this is a wonderful seat I love the triangular handle I use it with the Snap Go and have no trouble at all transferring her If she falls asleep in it it is easy to take her wherever I want without disturbing her She seems very comfortable in it as well She was born November 12 2006 The hood is such that it can block out the sun no matter from which direction it is shining And you can still see her face if you are tall enough The product is great if yours if fully functioning I m anxious for her to grow to 20 pounds so I can buy another seat As it is I try not to take her in the car any more than I have to because of the defective lock since I can t spring for another seat now I will never buy another Baby Trend for that reason 
4 0 Great seat could be evn better This is our first and only child seat and has worked quite well for us We do need to put in a specialized cushon for our baby s head There have been recent articles warning against letting your baby sleep in a child seat and sine babies head muscles aren t very strong the support is a good addition I find the triangle grip excellent but even with a small baby in the seat you will not want to cary this very far at all My wife in fact had a back injury carying our son in this seat and that was just from the car to our house Some day these seats may come with some other innovation making them more ergonomic for parents I don t know that it would have been different in another seat but be warned these things are not meant to actually carry a child by hand and women have weakened muscles after giving birth It s a terrible combination Carying the baby in this seat should be a task for husbands for several months as I found out too late Back to the seat it works quite well in the car and with the baby trend snap n go We use the snap n go quite often and it prevents you from repeatedly removing your child from the seat and snapping him back in which can be trying for you and your kid I was disappointed the unit had no SPF rating for the sun shade That feature may not have made it to child seats but sun protection is extremely important for babies and it wouldn t be difficult to use a protective fabric I called Baby Trend and they had no idea if and how well the shade actually blocked harmful UV rays Other seats may not have this feature either but we will look closely for it in the future after being sternly warned by the child safety class at the hospital Babies have super sensitive skin and it s important to avoid any direct sunlight if possible I know it sounds extreme and alarmist but it also should be very easy to do and is recommended by the American Adadamy of Pediatrics For now you would need an additional cover on top of the included cover Pros Consumer report top pick not as expensive as some Cons No SPF rating or sun UV protection listed for sun shade Heavy and non ergonimic to cary by hand not a complaint specific to this particular seat they probably all are 
4 0 Great crib for a great price We bought this crib online couldn t be more pleased The shipping was great a few minor nicks but nothing overly noticeable The directions aren t bad but they could be a lot better clearer We also bought the matching change table it looks great in the baby s room Net great value for a great product 
5 0 Crib Easiest purchase Just love the crib and the price was unbelievable including shipping cost 
4 0 Very Nice Crib Good Price I m really pleased with this crib The price was right and it arrived within a matter of days Shipping and handling costs were very low A few dings here and there and the directions were a little hard to follow Otherwise it looks great and is very sturdy Great crib for the price 
5 0 Don t know what we would have done without it We loved this product and our little girl loved it even more We used it from the time she was 4 months to almost 10 months We have a nice wide doorway that we were able to put the jumper in We never had any problems with fingers getting pinched or heads getting bumped We believe her coordination is better because she used this so often At just 14 months she could jump with both feet off the ground It is a quality product at a reasonable price Would highly recommend 
5 0 I love this car seat This is my third child and third infant car seat This was the most expensive but worth the money The padding keeps the baby s head from that scary 90 degree flop the shoulder straps have padding which prevents the red marks the others left on my kids the straps don t get twisted and it s much easier to get in and out of the car It s the same weight as the others which is to say rather heavy and awkward to carry The only thing I don t like is it does not fit on shopping carts Worth the money 
4 0 Really nice bedding but I received this set at a baby shower back in 2005 It has held up really well My only advice with a retail price of 232 00 and even an Amazon price of 152 it s still too steep I never had the quilt in the crib because it is dangerous to do so with a baby and he was constantly napping so I hardly ever made the bed Next time around I m going to find a pattern I like and just buy all of the decorative things associated with it then buy an inexpensive and plain bumper and sheet The room itself is what you and everyone else sees The bedding is almost impossible to see unless you re hovering over the crib I do especially love the lamp switchplate mobile and 5 pc wall hanging from this collection You could buy all the accessories to truly create a safari room for less than the cost of the bedding alone 
5 0 Beautiful good quality and soft I ordered the 6 piece crib set plus other Zanzibar items to go with it and was really pleased at the quality softness of the fabrics It s beautiful and looks very nice and cozy I have a bigger crib that later turns into a twin bed so what I did to make the quilt bigger was to use the fitted sheet to make an addition I also used the dust ruffle to make the bumper bigger and some pillows which look great in the sofa I have in the room 
5 0 Good quality I just purchased this crib bedding The quality is great I love the thickness and the velour Worth the money 
5 0 Fun and Safe Walker This is a great walker The tray has plenty of activities to keep the little one busy and the music steering wheel and button lights can easily be removed to make the tray even bigger My grandson just loves the walker and I do too because it gives him the freedom to move from place to place safely Amazon sells model 14570 so don t worry the walker is sturdy with locking wheels for when you prefer him to stay stationary Also a plus is that it converts into a walk behind walker which assists the child learning to walk 
5 0 This is great When I was looking for a thermometer for my baby girl I wanted something easy so her father could use it and fast because shes one not to stay still very long I found this one and fell in love with it I use for it for everyone in my family Yes I did have a problem finding the covers but that s not a reason to not to get this thermometer 
4 0 Something to consider when making your choice I am a first time expectant mother and like most excited moms to be I read pretty much all of the reviews on every item I need to register for or buy for baby However the helpful hint I have to give comes from my other half who already has a son and has used a wipe warmer He said the wipe warmers that heat from the bottom up heat ALL of the wipes are a waste of money because by the time you get to the bottom wipes they are dried out from being continuously reheated They basically lose their moisture which defeats the purpose of a wipe in the first place and you end up throwing a bunch of them out without the benefit of using them first We opted to go with this one because it seems to be smaller more convenient for travel which we will do a fair amount of and it heats just the first few wipes which is usually all you need for a diaper change Some mothers would say this is not really a necessary thing to have after all babies lived through diaper use just fine before these things were invented but because our baby will be born during the winter I thought this would have more use for us I gave this product four stars because we haven t tried it yet but just wanted to pass that helpful hint along to other mothers who are interested in practicality and saving money and hopefully not losing quality in the process 
5 0 Helps baby sleep The first night we had our daughter home she would wake up about every 45 minutes My wife and I were pulling shifts to take care of her Finally at 6am my wife says Hey lets try the secure sleeper that we bought We haven t removed it from her bassinet since The product does as it says and we swear by it She is only 2 1 2 weeks old now and sleeps about 5 6 hrs a night The velcro rolls can adjust to the babies size The previous statement about baby falling off may be because the baby is too large Given the size of the secure sleeper it s not hard to believe that it will not last once the baby is larger than the sleeper Overall a great product 
5 0 Love this Despite some negative reviews I got this seat because I have an 8 mth and 2 5 yr old and my husband is deployed so bathtime can be very challenging I also have a textured bathtub bottom so I knew a bathring would not work Well this seat is fantastic my baby loves to sit in it and tries to grab all of the bath toys so he can chew on them Also whenever I get the baby in the toddler wants to jump in too which is so much easier then conjoling an ornery 2 yr old into the tub Since using the bath seat my infant hasn t scraped his legs on it once like some other reviewers mentioned so not sure what that is about And although he has tried to climb out a couple of times he is usually content to sit there Of course even with this seat you can t let such little ones bathe unsupervised anyways so it is fine when he tries to get out I just put him back and he is happy Even when I don t bath the two together I put the little one in here just makes it so much easier then trying to hold him steady he is such a wiggler trying to crawl stand immediately and having my hands free to scrub him To clean his bottom I just pull him out clean him and then stick him back in no problem To clean the seat I ve followed the advice of other posts and again no problem I actually came back here to buy one for my sister but I see that it isn t available right now boo I ll have to find it elsewhere Highly recommend 
4 0 Very Functional Great for organizing baby s food in your diaper bag Caution not leak proof be sure to properly seal leftovers Love the slots that hold spoons 
5 0 Great Idea This item is a great idea for people on the go like me It has removable slots so that you can place a larger bowl in it plus your baby food jar 
4 0 I like it but There are a few things that I liked about my simple round about better Such as the latch system is more difficult in the Decathalon Overall though very impressive car seat safety system The fabric for the cover is wonderful and plush and stylish I always feel safe when my little ones are in a Britax Well worth what may seem like an exorbitant amount of money You cannot put a price on the safety of your child 
5 0 A Happy and Clean Baby The first time I used this shopping cart cover my daughter fell asleep need I say anymore It fits nearly every shopping cart it s easy to fold and unfold and it gives me the peace of mind knowing that all of those shopping cart germs aren t coming home with us Well worth the extra peace of mind it gives me 
5 0 Perfect for an OCD Type A Mom I highly recommend this item As soon as your little one can sit up on his own this is a MUST HAVE for all moms It fits all shopping carts except COSTCO but including TARGET as well as those icky high chairs available at restaurants It keeps baby and Mommy s hands from touching the cart handle and prevents the kiddo from wedging his legs in the wrong hole in the cart A MUST HAVE This is the gift I give at baby showers I ve had for over a year and it has survived many a washing with a touch of bleach Still looks good 
5 0 our favorite blanket we have the one with brown trim but i had to write a review here too because we just LOVE this blanket it s super soft the perfect size for swaddling and nice and light AND still warm for baby we live in hawaii so we love how this blanket keeps the drafts off our son but doesn t cause him to wake up sweaty it costs a little more than your average cotton blanket but it s COMPLETELY worth the money i d buy another in a second 
5 0 The ULTIMATE Blanket for Baby I love this blanket so much let me count the ways 1 certified organic so hard to find 2 large enough for a good tight swaddle for a good night sleep 3 darling drawing showing how to swaddle baby sewn to blanket even my husband can now swaddle like a nurse 4 soft soft and softer with every wash I just love this blanket and I feel so good wrapping my little bundle in the ULTIMATE and I know he loves it too 
4 0 Excellent and affordable My husband and I received this changing table along with the 4 drawer chest and the Monterey crib as a gift from our parents We were skeptical because we wanted a nursery that was affordable yet not too flimsy We were pleasantly surprised once the pieces were put together The pieces coordinate beautifully with the nursery and will take our soon to be born infant into childhood And the nicest part is that you don t have to spend thousands of dollars to have a nice nursery My friends and family are constantly complimenting us on how great the pieces look and how sturdy they are The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 was because two of the drawers rubbed together slightly once assembled It was very easily fixed by adjusting the drawer tracks took 5 minutes BOTTOM LINE If you are looking for a beautiful quality nursery that is affordable this is a great choice 
5 0 Wheels We were just at the baby store to choose carseats and the Britax Marathon carseat on display had a Gogo Babyz Travelmate attached to it It was so easy to maneuver that my 7 year old daughter wheeled her 20 pound baby sister around the aisle for fun Two large solid screw in knobs attach the Travelmate to a backplate that secures the seat The whole combination looks very sturdy and relatively easy to use We bought both the Marathon and Travelmate We were looking for a better alternative to the Sit n Stroll This may be it I cannot compare the two options as I have never tried the Sit n Stroll only read the so so reviews 
4 0 Works fine but pretty noisy This pump works great for occasional use and after 5 months I still have not encountered any problems with the suction that some reviewers have mentioned The instruction book explains how to clean the motor in the event of suction loss so hopefully that problem is avoidable However beware that the motor is very loud I definitely wouldn t recommend taking this one to work or anywhere else that you would need to be discreet When I use it I sit in the bathroom with the fan on so that my family doesn t have to hear it I also recommend buying the micro steam bags by Medela so you can just throw the parts in the microwave and clean them right away each time you use them 
4 0 Good pump I decided to by this pump instead of the single because it saves time to do both sides at once This pump works very well and I quickly get the milk I need I like that there are different levels of suction to fit my comfort I gave it four stars because it is a little difficult to change speeds and adjust with both hands being occupied Sometimes one side looses suction and while I am trying to fix it the other side looses suction because I had to remove my hand from holding it in place 
5 0 The Perfect Choice For Me I purchased the Medela Double Select Pump in anticipation for the arrival of my second child per the recommendation of a relative who had great success with this model we both had a terrible time with manual pumps in the past I am extremely pleased with this pump I can easily fill two bottles within a few minutes and have never had any trouble with the suction motor malfunctioning equipment etc It is extremely easy to put together and take apart as well as easy to clean You will have to buy a pack of Medela bottles before the first use as they are not included And yes the motor is a little noisy but not unbearably so It has neither disrupted my children s sleep for example nor become irritating for me It is also versatile enough to pump on both sides simultaneously or just on one side Additionally the Medela company has a very solid reputation and I understand that their customer service is very good when it comes to problems with their products I think that this pump is a wise choice for part time use not more than once or twice a day at that I ve had much success and I think that most of you will too 
4 0 Medela is a name I trust for breast pumps I breast fed my son for a year in 2003 with the Medela pump back then I trusted Medela to pick up this one for my daughter this year I pump once a day so they get used but not abused The model has changed some I think it is more powerful this time The thing I don t like but certainly can live with is the motor not being attached to the breast shield My chest is rather large so putting the bottles in the unit and holding the unit to my chest with one hand is not an option I have to hold each shield upto my chest and the motor sits in my lap I can t control the speed or turn the unit on off because I don t have a free hand I leave the speed where I need it before and take the bottle off while it s still on and put it in the bottle holder while I turn the unit off I still very much like this product as it gets the job done 
5 0 Used this pump for 8 months I borrowed this pump from a Mom who just used it the 8 weeks she was out of work I used it FREQUENTLY at least twice daily for the 5 months I pumped at work It always worked wonderfully I never had trouble with let down or supply Sometimes I filled both 8 oz bottles in a 15 minute session Unless you have problems with breastfeeding or milk supply I can t imagine this pump not working great I didn t have any problems with it the whole time I used it 
5 0 Great Stroller We took this stroller to use for our 13 month old at Disney World it was great It held the bags we needed in the park and was very easy to get on and off busses monorail etc I am very pleased with this purchase It was great to have it in the airport too The only problem we had was that the cupholder was broken off by the airline when it was gate checked but we can get a replacement 
5 0 Great to have for travel or anytime I ordered this stroller to take my 16 month old daughter to Florida on vacation It is absolutely perfect folds small has room for storage you can even carry a small diaper bag under the seat on the cross bars it really is perfect for travel actually it is perfect for anytime 
4 0 Easy stroller for travel We bought this stroller to take on vacation and it proved to be easy to check at the gate of the airline was lightweight and continues to be a functional comfortable stroller for our son The one feature that I expected to be different was how far the stroller reclined it only slightly reclines so is not useful for a little one who needs to lay down further to nap while on the go I was happy with the amount of storage but at times wished to have a storage compartment under the seat for my bag All in all we are very happy with this purchase 
4 0 Saves us from rescuing pacifiers every half hour We were concerned about using a regular crib bumper for our tall toddler but we needed something to keep his pacifiers in his crib at night This crib bumper does the job When he stands on it it collapses so it s no help boosting him over the side My one gripe which I m not sure there s a way around is that there s a gap between the front crib corners and the bumper that attaches to the front rail the one that slides up and down Because our little one is older we put stuffed animals in the corners but I m not sure how comfortable I d be using the bumper with an infant who might get her legs or arms caught 
5 0 Good bumper for the money foolproof I love this bumper It isn t thick like the padded bumpers and fits the crib nicely without bunching And the price is much more reasonable than the bumpers that go with bedding sets Mostly I can feel secure that my little one is safe even if he rolls up to the edge of the railings I know his arms and legs won t get tangled in the railings but he also can breathe Great product It is cute too and looks very nice on a white crib 
5 0 Safe guarding babies feet and mommies peace of mind My daughter ordered this to go with The Crib Shield System It s a nice addition to the System and looks very nice 
4 0 So far so good My daughter 2 1 2 yrs old likes this cot a lot I bought it for her so that she could nap on it while my M I L is over watching her since she has a hard time with stairs and lifting toddler into high crib She sleeps on it for about 1 1 2 2 hours in the afternoon which is about 1 hour shorter than if she were to nap in her crib inside her darkened room It suits this purpose well and I intend on taking it on overnight weekend trips so we don t have to haul her port a crib The only disadvantage is that she can get out of it of course but it s a cot She began daycare recently and sleeps on their cots for the same amount of time so I figured I d buy it for my M I L at home It does the trick and my baby thinks it s special I tell her that it s only for when Grandma S is over b c she wanted to start sleeping napping in it all the time Naturally I d prefer she take a longer nap so I told her it s for special days only when Grandma S is here So now she uses it to tuck in her bunny bear stuffed animal before she goes to her room at night I love it and it seems comfortable very portable and handy I would recommend it The only reason I m not rating it 5 stars is that I have yet to use it on a weekend trip but I wanted to review it now in case you were wondering whether or not to get it I think it s very much worth it but everyone s different It s relatively small and inexpensive so if your child hates it they may like it for their stuffed animal friends Also it is very sturdy supportive and opens and collapses with no trouble at all Hope that helps 
4 0 So far so good I purchased this for my 17 month old son who normally sleeps in a crib I was told that the daycare that he would be entering uses cots So in figuring this would also be good for travel I bought it My son loves it The whole thing is like a mesh beach chair I put it together in about 8 seconds The removable fitted sheet that comes with it is soft The entire thing is easy to wipe clean It looks comfy It says it is good for kids up to 75lbs and 52 inches Good to know My favorite feature is how tiny it folds up pretty light compared to other cots Not nearly as bulky too Nice royal Blue colors 
5 0 Best Carrier for Bigger Babies My son was 20 lbs at 6 mos so we had to stop using front carriers I bought the Combi as well as this one and this one is much more user friendly SO easy to get on and off by yourself and much more comfortable I ve read reviewers saying it s uncomfortable well if you have a big baby it s just going to be uncomfortable They re heavy But this is the best one it s nice to give your arms a break The neck strap is well padded and easy to switch from one side to the other for relief w o taking the baby out It s compact enough to keep with you And if you re baby just needs to be close to you or held sometimes it s a MUST HAVE We took a trip last week and it was PRICELESS One tip read the instruction manual and you will enjoy this product a ton more 
4 0 Great for Bigger Babies For all the reviews that have written that this product has been recalled that is incorrect It was the original Hip Hammock and all those that were in the stores were removed from the shelves So unless you have an older model that was bought before 2 2005 you should have nothing to worry about This product is great when your baby outgrowns the front carriers like the Baby Bjorn I have had no problems with it and it is easier than using a sling with older babies 
5 0 Evenflo Titan I bought this item based on safety and comfort reviews from consumer reports and I d have to say the reviews I read about on the Titan were dead on My 7 month old is very long for his age and he loves the freedom this seat provides as opposed to the cramped car seat we were using I also like the fact that as he grows into a toddler and is able to sit forward I can still use this seat I wish I had bought this seat from the get go 
4 0 Good Pick Out of all the department stores here I got a recommendation to choose the titan over the triumph for the easness It got noted as lighter and easier to deal with I secound the so far so good comment earlier Its comfortable than most seats I have shopped for besides the 1 Britax that I have yet to experience 
5 0 Avent Magic Cups I LOVE these cups and better yet so does my baby They are easy for her to hold and the soft tip makes it easy for her to drink She has no idea that it s not a bottle It has made the transition away from the bottle so much easier Thank you 
5 0 Great Cups I absoulutly love these cups They are the best no spill cups on the market My 1 year old loves to walk around with it and throw it around It never spills which is a great thing when I have red Kool Aid in it 
5 0 Best Cup on the market My son is now 2 and has been a bottle baby We have atleast 10 different cups and he has always refused them and screamed for his bottle Lastnight we bought this terrific cup and he has not asked for the bottle yet I will now be putting the bottles away for good this time I will be ordering a few more so we always have one on hand They are pricey but if I wouldn t have bought all the other cups I d have had plenty of money saved just by buying these in the first place 
5 0 Britax Marathon The size is bigger than i thought but i loved it My son fits in nicely 
5 0 Diehard Graco fan until I tried the britax I was a diehard graco fan When my daughter was born 2002 the Graco Snugride was the top rated infant seat I put a lot of stock into what consumer reports has to say The infant seat was great and we got it as part of the travel system I loved both the stroller and seat and was very sad when she outgrew the seat around 1 years old I tried an Eddie Bauer convertible seat next and it was horrible the straps always twisted and my daughter s head always fell forward onto her chest when she fell asleep I quickly changed the Graco Comfortsport the one with the overhead drop down bar and she loved it It had more padding her head rested on the side of the carseat instead of her chest and the straps never twisted It was easy to get in and out and not too heavy to lug around in airports When she outgrew that seat I decided to make the switch to Britax Although the Roundabout was rate 1 on CR I went with the Marathon because the only thing CR didn t like about it was the infant latch which I wouldn t need as my child was 3yrs old and it had a higher weight limit than the Roundabout I own a Honda Accord 4 door and my husband drives a 4 door Toyota Echo tiny The seat fits perfectly well in both vehicles in the forward facing position The Toyota has latch and the Honda doesn t but in both cars it doesn t move Partly due to the fact that my husband is excellent at installing and partly due to the car seats weight It is quite heavy and it can be a pain to haul around airports My husband usually just loosens the straps and wears it like a backpack through the airport My daughter loves it we have a girly print not the granite it has plenty of room for her she never is uncomfortable sleeping in it her head doesn t sit on her chest either and though she s a very bright 4 year old she s never been able to get out of the seat I love the fact that she can be in it until she s 65lbs with the five point restraint and the straps never twist Britax also does thoughtful things like adding velcro on the sides of the seat to hold the straps in place when you re putting your child in and having a padded area under the clip so your child isn t burned by the hot plastic in the summer or freezing in the winter I plan on staying with Britax from here on out 
5 0 they re great I got four of these sleepsacks two fleece and two cotton I found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes but it didn t effect the product They are wonderful If you are buying for a newborn get the 6 12 month size since it ll last a bit longer I ended up giving away the 0 6 month size when my baby was only 3 months old as it was getting a bit small 
5 0 a definite must my baby is now 5 months old and we ve been using the Halo sleep sac since she started moving around more I was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face Now I never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night This product really gives me peace of mind and I ll be sure to give this to any new parent friends 
5 0 Love it I love this bottle drying rack It doesn t take up a lot of space and looks and workds great 
5 0 Good looking next to the sink This product works well with my Dr Brown s bottles There are holes in it that make it easy to stand up the inner parts of the bottles Much better looking than a lot of bottle drying racks I use a Sassy rubber bristled bottle brush so that it won t scratch the bottles though The Sassy color totally coordinates perfectly 
5 0 Better than the rest This is a wonderful stroller I m so glad I took a chance and ordered it sight unseen I ordered the red version which is much snazzier in person than on the Amazon picture It is fairly lightweight much lighter than our Graco model but heavier than those cheap little umbrella strollers nice and sturdy But it folds up in an umbrella fashion so it won t take up too much room in your trunk and could be carried if necessary It comes with neat things like a rain cover sun shade and cold weather boot The rain and shade covers are neatly contained in an attachable pouch and the boot fits easily in the stroller s basket The canopy has a window provides lots of shade and is even partially removable to let the breeze run through on a balmy day Coolest of all it has a built in mesh pouch that doesn t take up any room but still manages to hold everything I need sunscreen hand sanitizer wallet keys cell phone and sunglasses It s stretchy mesh so if you don t have anything it just lies flat against the hood But it does have a plastic lining so it s waterproof Also it zips so your things can t fall out and aren t accessible to your two year old either The basket is large enough for a medium sized diaper bag although a small bag would fit best especially if you want to keep the boot in there The best part is that everything is snazzy Everything looks nice the materials feel great and it s well designed The parts that should be removable washable are It s a snap to put together took just a couple of minutes and everything locks into place in a smart way It s very easy to fold and unfold Also it reclines beautifully and easily including into a totally upright position I became frustrated that my Graco model s most upright position was still too reclined for our one year old The place where your child s legs hang down is neat It is adjustable so it could stick straight out hang down or even flip up for a very little one maybe to use with the boot Your kid won t get a weird stroller mark on the underside of their little knees It has the newer style which I notice most new strollers seem to have where you only have to clip two things in to buckle a baby in My Graco model purchased last year is such a complicated mess You attach two things together on one side two things together on the other side then connect each side into the center Arg My son almost always fussed by the time I d finished Also he was always sitting on one of the straps which easily became twisted My husband STILL has not figured out how to do this quickly So this is a big improvement It s also comfy I can t vouch for that myself of course But my son settles down into it and looks perfectly comfortable With the Graco model he ended up with his legs flung over one side of the tray and if he wasn t tightly belted in he slouched down a lot A few minor imperfections about the Zooper Twist The cupholder is a mesh bag attached to the handle It works well for a standard water bottle or something but one of those giant mall sized beverages might not be so great You can easily remedy this by investing in a good quality cup attachment if that is important to you This stroller is great for me I m 5 5 It would be nice if the stroller handles were adjustable This isn t a jogging stroller It does offer a nice feature where you can lock the front two wheels so they do not swivel which makes going over rough surfaces safer and easier to manage This isn t the kind of stroller that is going to hold everything but the kitchen sink if you are looking for that kind of stroller There isn t a cup and snack tray for your child No clock This is just the greatest stroller and I m so glad to dump our awful Graco stroller Hated that thing This is snazzy well designed handy lightweight convenient and offers everything we need 
4 0 A knee saver If anyone asked me what baby product I would have to have it would be this product I love it and it is very comfortable to use One negative thing though is that the suction cups do not work very well so don t let your child use it because they could slip I would purchase it again and would give it as a gift 
4 0 bath helper This product is good for your knees however the suction does not seem to stay on well and the elbow part keeps slipping other than that it is good to hold small items like the toothbrush and toothpaste 
5 0 very covenient Very convenient carseat can be placed in the combi double stroller which is the only side by side stroller that I have seen that you can attach an infant seat into and I ve searched a lot The carseat is comprable to the Peg Perego Primo Viaggo whichI also have but you can t connect that one into the Aria twin the peg perego side by side The seat itself is lightweight and easy to manage and VERY soft with the foam insert It s easy to get into the car with or without the base Only complaint would be that the straps could be a little longer because you can t have both a baby bunting bag and the foam insert otherwise the straps aren t long enough to comfortably get the baby in and out Also our daughter was extremely colicky from 5 weeks to 12 weeks and would only sleep in this carseat so it must be pretty comfortable 
5 0 Love This Set I have just got this bed set 5 days ago and love it It could be used for a girl or boy I have looked around for bedding for a portable crib and could not find anything I liked and they seemed high in price well then I found this one and it s fits perfect on a portable crib And it s alot cuter than the picture I really do like it The only thing is I wish it had a dust ruffel 
5 0 Great stairway solution We have tried 3 4 different gates at the top of our stairway over the past 3 years with our 2 young children now 4 yrs and a 10 month old This is a GREAT option for a gate Ours is solidly installed it clicks shut automatically with an audible click so after my 4 year old goes through I don t have to worry about him leaving it open it closes by itself AND I can hear the click that tells me it closed and you don t have to drill holes in your woodwork staircase to install this It is much easier to open just as sturdy as the drill in gates and looks nicer than all of the other gates we tried We love it for our house 
5 0 Excellent My son is just so excited about his Sponge Bob bed He climbs in and out every second thus showing how much he likes it I like it because it is low and no accidental falling off and hurting himself 
5 0 Great for toddler This bed was hard to put together but it was well worth the trouble It is a great buy for the price You can t go wrong if you have a little time and patience to put it together 
5 0 Almost too good to be true Granted it may not work for every single baby haha but I know a ton of women who SWEAR by this blanket It is the gift I give at every shower Don t second guess yourself about whether or not to get this brand over a less expensive one you won t regret it 
5 0 Truly truly a MIRACLE Our son has an especially strong startle reflex and has to be swaddled to sleep at all At 2 5 weeks he startled being able to get out of any swaddle we did no matter how expertly done no matter what blanket we used So at 1 hour of sleep he d start crying and we d have to go in and start all over We searched online for actual Swaddling blankets and based on reviews chose this one WHAT AN UTTER MIRACLE We are in such debt to the dad who created this Our son is now 12 weeks old and we use this for each nap and for nighttime sleep He was sleeping 6 7 hour stretches at 5 weeks and slept 11 hours at 8 weeks We would never have this success without this blanket We ve periodically tried to get him to sleep without it but his reflex is STILL so strong that he needs it It took a little getting used to the method to get him wrapped up but in no time we both were experts And the price on Amazon with free shipping is way better than what we paid directly through AMB I wholeheartedly reccommend this to all parents especially new parents 
5 0 A lifesaver My son has colic and this blanket is a lifesaver When I wrap him in it he falls asleep and stays asleep for long periods of time He can easily break out of the Swaddle Me but not the Miracle Blanket I am going ot buy this product for all of my pregnant friends 
4 0 Impressed with quality for price I thought these were very good quality considering the price I like them better than the one I bought at BRU that cost much more 
5 0 Just Perfect When we got our changing table from a friend who no longer needed it They gave us the Diaper Depot as well I love how it puts everything at an arms reach without clutting the changing table It has lasted two kids before the one it s on now so a total of three babies I guess like anything if it s taken care of properly it won t break 
4 0 Great But Love it and it is a must in our babies room but the only drawback is that our wipe warmer Lion Heart 2004 model does not fit correctly To fix this we just taped down the wipe warmer I love that everything you need can be placed in the diaper depot and so easy to grab one handed of course Note We do not use the bottom basket under the wipe warmer as a diaper storage but instead as a cloth towel holder and it works great especially if you have a boy and need alittle protection and or clean up from showers Also our diaper stacker holds more and adds decor to the nursery s them 
5 0 Nice Stool I purchased this stool with the matching seat cover for my daughter for potty training I like that the top has a non slip cover on it to keep my daughter from slipping when getting up on the toilet She really likes that she has her own special stool for going potty it has helped in encouraging her to start potty training 
4 0 Great Seat I have this seat for my 4 month old and I love it Yes it is larger than your average infant car seat but I have no problems getting it in and out of my car which is a Toyota Avalon not the smallest car on the market but certainly not the biggest With my daughter who is 5 when she moved to the convertible car seat the biggest downfall was having to wake her up to get out of the car Graco has made it so that I no longer have to do this My son is nearly 20lbs already and had I been using your average infant seat I would have to buy him a new one already Bravo to Graco for making a seat with extra weight height limits Another perk is it has the canopy so the sun isn t in his eyes which I also wouldn t get if he were in a convertible car seat My one and only complaint is that the fabric isn t breathable so my son sweats a lot in this seat but I just put a receiving blanket between him and the seat and he is fine This in itself isn t enough to make me trade this seat for another 
5 0 A great carseat My 6 month old daughter just transitioned from her infant seat carrier to the Britax Boulevard and is loving it She looks comfortable in it and I really appreciate the side impact support in case of an accident I can really see her growing into it as well It is a little large for our Camry but there is still enough room for one other person instead of 2 in the backseat 
5 0 great car seat even for small car I got this car seat for my 10 month old daughter I was concerned that it would be too large for my car I have a Honda Civic but it fit just fine Rear facing you would need to put in the center of the back seat so if you have 2 kids you would have to put the seats up further but if you are short that will likely not be an issue I had it installed at the fire station and it fit in perfectly he installed it in minutes and did NOT need any foam pieces to make it fit properly It was a perfect fit on its own Pros 1 it is the best car seat you can get 2 has side impact protection also makes a good headrest when baby falls asleep 3 the adjust knob for the harness is awesome to adjust especially over large coats 4 the seat is very well cushioned soft fabric 5 fits fine a small car even rear facing I have a Civic 6 it s heavy so its not going anywhere 7 works for up to 65 pounds so we will get a lot of use out of the seat 8 she loves it Cons 1 it is large heavy though it is staying in my car so heavy is not a problem 2 the strap to tighted the harness is a little tough to pull tight on a smaller child but you need to pull straight out and not up 3 it is expensive I highly recommend this seat we have the Onyx fabric It is large heavy and expensive but it is the best I had buyer s remorse for a few minutes but I figured it is the best seat on the market right now and 300 is a small price to pay for protecting my daughter I did a lot of research before buying and felt confident in my decision and in the seat Very pleased with this seat Also please make sure you get your seat installed by a certified technician Check with your local Children s Hospital Improperly installed car seats and improper use of car seats is the leading cause of death among children and infants Something very easy to prevent 
5 0 I love this car seat Our 8 month old daughter outgrew her infant carrier and we needed a big girl car seat immediately I knew that we were going to purchase a car seat made by Britax because they are always consistently highly rated in crash tests and by other safety measures After reading reviews and checking out the Roundabout Marathon and Boulevard seats in the store we decided on the Boulevard I love the added protection the side impact wings provide True it is just about the most expensive car seat out there but I believe it is well worth the price The only drawback was that I found none of the fabric options particuarly appealing I finally settled on Brownstone because I believe it to be the least dreadful of them all I was surprised to find that it is not as bad as I had imagined It is extremely soft almost has a chenille like feel and does not get too hot even in direct sunlight There is also the option of ordering different covers if I tire of this one This car seat is pretty big but it fits just fine in our Honda Accord in the middle of the back seat and two normal size people can easily fit on either side It was very easy to install using the LATCH system I have not had any problems or complaints My daughter seems very comfortable in her new car seat and I feel safe with her in it 
5 0 Finally Peace of Mind I bought this portable tent for my Graco Pack N Play because my toddler can climb out of it and I wanted him to be safe We use this when visiting friends and relatives and it provides me with 100 peace of mind knowing that he won t be able to escape and injure himself It is easy to attach to the portable crib and holds very securely My only negative comment is that it s a little difficult to put together I usually keep it assembled and throw it in my trunk to save time and my sanity 
5 0 Life saver I have a climber She could climb out of her crib at age 13 months She was way too young for a bed We also have the crib tent II and both items have allowed us to feel our now 22 month old daughter is safely in her crib at night not roaming her room or house while we sleep It was either these products or emptying all the furniture out of her room putting a mattress on the floor and putting a lock on her door at night to keep her safe Life saver 
4 0 WORKED FOR OUR 18 MONTH OLD ACROBAT AFTER 2 NIGHTS OF NO SLEEP BECAUSE OUR 18 MONTHS OLD SON FIGURED OUT HOW TO FLIP HIMSELF OUT OF THE PACK N PLAY WITH JUST SHEER UPPER BODY STRENGTH I WAS SO RELIEVED TO FIND THIS CRIB TENT AND IT WAS A PAIN TO PUT TOGETHER IT TOOK ABOUT 20 MINUTES BUT WELL WORTH IT BECAUSE IT WORKS HE HAS STAYED IN THE PACK N PLAY AND DIDN T SEEM TO CARE AT ALL THAT HE WAS TRAPPED I THINK KIDS DO LIKE THE PLAYFULNESS OF A TENT MY 4 YEAR OLD WAS JEALOUS THERE ARE A FEW DOWNSIDES ITS A PAIN TO SET UP AND BREAK DOWN AND IF YOUR USING THE PACK N PLAY FOR OVER NIGHTS AND TRAVEL IT ISN T AS PORTABLE AS COULD BE AND I HAVE AN OLDER PACK N PLAY ITS FROM 02 WHEN WE HAD OUR FIRST BABY SO THE ENDS ARE HIGHER THAN THE SIDES SO THE CLIPS HAVE NO WHERE TO CLIP ONTO BUT IT HASN T MATTERED THE SIDE CLIPS HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR STRONG TODDLER IN PLACE OVERALL THE PRODUCT IS EXPENSIVE AND A PAIN TO SET UP BUT PRICELESS BECAUSE IT LETS THE WHOLE FAMILY SLEEP SOUNDLY AND SAFELY 
5 0 Works Just Like it Should I am surprised to read that people don t like this mirror We have had it since our son was 1 mon and we still use it at 7 mon We have a Trailblazer and it installed easily and we can see him great even over his Britax Marathon carseat It has been great for road trips our son was entertained even on a 9 hour trip and has been a blessing for short trips to the store We don t always use the music lights but the mirror is always handy We have never had trouble with it being too soft I have given this as shower gifts and my friends have been pleased as well Def recommended 
5 0 Assembles in a snap What a great product No tools just click click click and it s ready to use The anchors keep the unit in place under the mattress The frame is metal NOT plastic I am very pleased with the quality and the look It was out of the box and on the bed in about 10 minutes 
5 0 Give me a break A great success I love all Kiddapotamus products that I bought so far because they are well done thoughtful and win awards all the time but best of all they are really very handy We went to a restaurant and for the first time we could put our sons food right on the placemat on the table so that he could feed himself Without that mat we had to hold onto the food or but a napkin underneath so one of us was always busy with our son instead of enjoying a dinner out The placemat comes with a scoop that holds most of the food that our son will drop from his mat and the floor was still clean after we left Best of all with this mat we can provide a germfree space for him to sit eat and play on our table He was really happy about it After our visit we rolled this wonderful placemat together and put it in my handbag I was really satisfied 
5 0 easy clean up I bought this w the hippo travel high chair It worked great and kept things cleaner Unfortunately it was in the case w the chair when it was stolen out of our truck 
4 0 really helpful I have used both this product and the disposable kind that have stickers to keep them on the table and I like both for different reasons The disposable ones are sort of expensive but very portable when I am flying and visiting relatives The Hippo one is great to grab and go around town when I am not concerned about the weight of my diaper bag I have had waiters thank me at many restaurants Just fold the mess right up and clean at home My son is way too young to have a plate and not toss it and I don t want him eating off of a table that is probably full of nasty germs This hippo is really durable too I have used this same mat for over 3 years I first got it for my daughter and it still looks great 
4 0 GREAT Product I got this product b c when we first put our daughter in the highchair when we went out to eat she immediately wanted to touch the table I was fine with it until I wiped the table off and was disgusted at what I saw The tables at most restaruants aren t always cleaned with clean rags Now as she s older and eating some puffs and other finger foods it s great b c I can put the food directly on her mat and the cup catches the leftovers I keep ours in a large ziploc bag in my diaper bag so when it s dirty it doesn t get everything else dirty It s such a simple concept product but so GREAT The only complaint I have is that sometimes it doesn t stick very well 
5 0 Better in living color I have been looking for the perfect diaper bag and this is it The description doesn t do the bag justice as it has many features not shown in any of the photographs To start there is a large back pocket to put all of your changing needs which is quick and easy to access The heart of the bag contains ample room with six pockets total two elastic pockets on one side and 4 layered pockets on the other There is also a front flap with a magnetic closure with one zippered pocket on the outside and a wallet organizer on the inside the perfect area for mom s stuff There is a cell phone compartment on the front of the bag and a bottle pocket on each side of the bag The construction and material are very sturdy and everything closes up nicely so there is no risk of spilliage Finally the graphite and green is very unisex where many diaper bags are not so father friendly I am so pleased with this bag and the price is unbeatable 
5 0 Perfect rug I agree with the above reviewers This rug is large and very well made Perfect in any little girl s room 
5 0 Best Diaper Rash Cream on the market I have tried just about every diaper rash cream desitin balmex mustela vaseline sprays gold bond powder generic brands etc but this is the only brand that truly works The oatmeal or whatever secret ingredient it has gets rid of the redness on my daughter s bum in usually one or two changes BEST PRODUCT 
5 0 Fast Acting Natrual Scent This stuff works wonders for my son s sensitive bum and FAST We usually see results in just one application usually by the next changing the irritaion is GONE or nearly so It also has a very natural herbal scent which further outweighs other barrier creams It may seem a little pricey on a per ounce comparison but I ve found that I don t need to use as much which makes that argument mute 
5 0 Great purchase We bought this for a trip we will be taking in May but when my daughter saw it she got in it immediately She wants to sit in it to watch tv take walks or to put her dolls in it The light weight makes it easy to take and use in more places for me This helps with my back problems since I am more likely to have a stoller with me now It is easy to open shut and lock I do wish that it had a place to hang or store a smaller baby bag though I also like that the ride is smooth for Victoria and she has the option to reclined or sit upright The large padded hand grips help to have more control and comfort with the stroller also 
5 0 Great umbrell stroller for the amount I paid Great buy My daughter loves this stroller I like the option of the back padding that you can fold during hot season so the air can go though Your child never gets hot or sweaty at their back I would recommend this stroller maneuver really well I can do it with my 1 hand fold one hand Great great stroller 
5 0 For me it was a must have Before my daughter was born I knew I was determined to breastfeed her I read several books and asked a lot of moms what their breastfeeding must haves were Several people mentioned this nursing stool I was doubtful about how helpful a little stool could actually be but I also wanted every resource possible available to help my breastfeeding relationship go smoothly so I went ahead and bought it In the weeks prior to my daughter s birth my husband assembled the stool and I would use it to prop up my aching feet after a long day at work After my baby was born I set up a little nursing station in my living room and I found the stool to be an essential item Basically it lifted my knees to just the right angle to help prop the baby in the correct position I also used a nursing pillow and between the pillow and the stool the whole experience was actually very comfortable I was able to nurse for long periods of time without feeling any pain or stress from holding the baby in the right position I am definitely holding on to this item for use with future babies and I would recommend it to any new mom who plans to nurse her baby 
5 0 This BIB does it all This bib does it all and there are no complaints whatsoever I used to go through 8 10 bibs every few days but now this is the only bib I use every day all day Easy to wash catches everything so there is little mess on or around my child and it s easy on easy off 
4 0 Is not ideal if baby has neck rash It is a very nice product soft and easy But it was an ideal for my daughter s neck She has neck rash and the plastic ring around the neck was not a good ideal for her 
5 0 A++++ The bib I ve been waiting for No fuss No muss Comfortable and easy to clean the Baby Bjorn soft bib is a gift from above 
5 0 Thermometer I really like this it takes what seems like no time to read the temperature 
4 0 Works good for us This gate has some good points and just one negative Pros good price easy to operate Mine are very easy on the batteries I replace them about every 2 months They are located on the kid s bedroom doorways about 8 apart from each other We use them as a double safety for the top of the stairs and to keep the roaming 22 month old out of his sister s room when she wants some quiet time For those of you who have multiple gates and complain about 1 control unlocking both gates you should know that if you replace the batteries at the same time and arm the first gate it sends out the signal to both gates and programs it to unlock both So simply set up one gate while the batteries are out of the other then set up the second gate seperately I have never had them malfunction following these steps Cons I also have had my toddler wedge a knee in the door I found that this was due to the gate not being tight enough It was very frustrating and a little scary but we were always able to help him out of the gate by sitting him down and pulling him straight back We nearly got rid of this gate because of a few times dealing with this But since we tightened up the pressure on the gate we have had no problems It has also stripped some of the paint from my doorway where the tension feet are right down to bare wood I will have to repaint and patch when these gates come down The also should be a little taller IMO and if the gate is not tight enough it can become dislodged and open Always check the gate when you close it to make sure it IS closed a few rare occasions I have found it not completely closed This usually happens when you manually open the gate then try to use the remote button to open it Overall 4 stars Would be 5 stars if the gate was taller and the bars a little closer to prevent pinching Good price though and it is put together well 
5 0 Best Gate on the Market We tried three other brands and types of gates on the market Two were plastic and the third was a metal gate ordered from one of the pet catalogs costing 66 The two plastic gates each broke within days of being installed and the other metal gate was stiff and hard to use and took over an hour to actually install This Evenflo Gate was put together installed and in full use within 30 minutes of arriving and the dogs haven t been able to budge it one inch Plus it looks good and blends with the taupe ricepaper on the walls Great product at a bargain price we re ordering three more 
4 0 So far so good A snap to install my only complaint is that when you press the button to open the gate it waits about 5 seconds before you can latch the gate again PROBLEM Forget about using the remote if you have more than one of these gates in the house one remote will opena ll of them pretty stupid design 
5 0 Great idea exceptional customer service We purchased this gate for use with our youngest of four daughters The pressure gates we already had were difficult for our 3 and 5 year olds to get pass and it gets difficult constantly lifting them over the gate This gate is well worth the money The remote unit is on the wall in a place where everyone can reach it except for the 13 month old of course It is so much easier for everyone With all of the use our gate gets the spot welds broke one day You really miss this gate when you have to go back to using a pressure gate again I called customer support concerned because I do longer had my receipt or even the box The spot welds breaking loose was a problem they hadn t had reported before so this apparently isn t a common problem I was told we would receive a new gate within two weeks and the old one would be inspected by engineers to determine what had occured I was very impressed I will be sure to check out Evenflo products first when purchasing any new child baby products for their customer support alone Service like that is not so common anymore Like I said great concept and service 
4 0 Good for those mirror closet I brought it when my baby starts to know how to open the closet The suction is good and my baby now unable to open up the closet I going to buy more for my other room 
5 0 The Cover I have to say this is a better made one than some of the others My mom purchased this to have in her car in case our daughter is with her How the cover is designed to fit over the base some of the straps are almost impossible to reach underneath and where it is to be attached I had to end up using needlenose pliers to pull the strap thru The arm rest raise up Not sure about the drink holder part doesn t seem very durable but we will see Other than the cover part I feel this will be a good item 
4 0 like it but it needs a remote My Husband and I loved the look and shapes of the moblie My Baby s face just lights up when he s placed in his bed for naps or night time However we find ourself running back in forth so much because the cute little songs have stopped before he falls asleep I was looking online and saw that some of these new mobiles have remotes on them It would seem that with the all the new things that come out the manufactors would have given the public the option to have a wind up mobile or a remote mobile I hope that someone from these places reads these and takes the time to put more thought into what parents would want in future purchases But like as I said before we love the look and love they way my son reacts to it So I ll look at this mobile being a weight loss bonus for all the running back and forth 
5 0 Re Dangerous from CSM I completely understand your concern Although if you read the instructions for ANY mobile when the child is old enough to sit or stand in the crib around 6 months you are supposed to take it off They are not built for anyone to play with them My son liked his mobile so much that when he was old enough to reach it we took it off and my husband attached it to the top of his hutch This way we were still able to play the song but he couldn t reach it I think this mobile is a perfect way to add to the room s theme For those who looking to buy this mobile or any other mobile Go to the store where you are buying your crib and try it out The people at Babies R Us must have thought I was nuts because I took the quilt and the mobile from the set I wanted and took them to the crib I was buying I was able to determine if the mobile would fit before I bought it and I got to see how the colors in the bedding looked with the color of the crib This eliminated a lot of hassle for me later on with taking the mobile back if it didn t fit 
5 0 LOVE THIS TOY My daughter loves this toy All the activites keep her entertained and it gives us a break too 
5 0 Fun for the Family Being a fan of the Baby Einstein line of products I put this on my registry What a great gift it turned out to be It could entertain my daughter when nothing else did She is now 16 months old and too big for it but when she started watching the Baby Einstein videos she recognized the characters that were on this center 
5 0 Creative interactive fun I purchased the Baby Einstein Discover and Play center to keep at the office for days my then 5 mnth old son Toby was with me at work He immediately loved the musical buttons and the sun and ignored everything else As he grew he discovered the other toys one by one It was exciting to watch him perfecting the different skills necessary to manipulate the activities Because I used the Baby Einstein as a secure place for meals it needed regular cleaning The seat pops right off for easy cleaning but the cloth saddle is a little hard to unsnap from the base Overall the assembly is pretty easy I put it together myself and I am NOT mechanically inclined I definitely recommend the Baby Einstein activity center I looked at several other brands and was turned off by all the obnoxious toys and activities I wanted something Toby could learn from not just be dazzled by the bells and whistles I can t say Toby learned any Spanish from the language buttons but the Baby Einstein kept my son engaged even at 11 months when his willingness to stay in one place was usually short lived 
5 0 Entertaining with or without Mama We loved this because we could play with our daughter the puppet was fun for us too but it also kept her busy long enough to cook a meal or read the paper She liked being upright and the height adjustments were great for our tall baby also it only has ONE battery operated toy so your child is given the opportunity to interact with the toys rather than watch a bunch of flashing lights and music Saving this for the next child 
5 0 Wonderful Activity Center I have 2 activity centers by different makers the other is at Grandmas house so I have something to compare this to I can honestly say this this Activity Center is worth the extra 15 20 dollars you might have to spend To begin the seat swivels easily for the baby to move from one activity to the next That might not be an important issue for older babies but my daughter was 4 months old when she started to use this and compared to the other exersaucer it really makes a differnce having a seat she can maneuver The toys attachments are of great quality and offer a variety of skills for baby to learn from and to be entertained by I can t say enough positive things about this Activity Center I highly recommend it as it is both stimulating and entertaining for baby 
5 0 my baby loves this We got one of those hang in the doorway jumpers but we don t really have an good place to hang it so we exchanged it for this My baby really has a good time in it laughing and jumping all over the place Recommende 
5 0 Top notch toy We waited until our daughter was to get her this and it s fantastic She s now and it s in storage but she was using it until she was about I like that the height is adjustable the springs are covered and the seat comes out easily to wash it It was a poop eroo for us too A few things that I learned using this though is The blue spinning toy doesn t come out and yucky stuff can collect underneath it It is incredibly hard to clean The one that I got was a pain in the tush to get the batteries in so once the batteries died we set the kangaroo part aside My daughter s feet got rubbed raw when we first got this because she loved jumping in it I recommend using a pair of Robeez or at very least a pair of socks to protect their feet 
4 0 My 5 month old loves this I bought this for my first baby now 2 1 2 He didn t like to spend much time in the Jumperoo and would only last a couple of minutes I recently pulled it out and tried my 5 month in it She was a bit fussy at first but now absolutely loves this She jumps up and down for an hour laughing and playing with the toys on the front Any toy that can keep a 5 month old amused for more than a few minutes is wonderful and so I would definitely recommend it I would have given it 5 stars but feel the gadgets on the front could be better 
5 0 Our baby Loves This Thing Our baby can spend a good portion of his day jumping in this thing Even if he isn t jumping he loves to hit the noise buttons and various toy items around the seating area Sometimes he just isn t in the mood and will cry and jump but most of the time he is delighted and will wear himself out 
5 0 Jumperoo to the Rescue I bought this for my son when he was just shy of 4 months old Initially he would just sit in the seat occassionally moving sideways probably because he lost his balance After 5 10 minutes he was ready to hit the eject button he d had enough That lasted 4 or 5 days during which we d put him in the Jumperoo 2 or 3 times per day with hopes that he d grow to enjoy it On the 5th day he began jumping up and down like a crazed kangaroo His face had a wide smile and some drool he was excited From that point forward and still going he s consistently loved his time in the J roo He regularly has jumping sessions of 30 45 minutes while watching Clifford Dragon Tales This is a great way for little T to be in a upright position while strengthening his little legs Also it s not a bad break for us parents now and again 
5 0 Our little one LOVED this Our little one LOVED this toy until he turned 8 months Now its really a challenge to try to get him into this thing or the Baby Einstein stationary entertainer see my review for that However he will still play with it standing OUTSIDE and loves touching the legs and toys and chewing on the bar Unfortunately he puts up a fight when we try to get him in it But we did have a good run for this and it was worth it He would bounce back and forth and say AHHHHHHH and just laugh really hard So glad that someone gave this to us and we didn t have to buy it But if you are making that decision I say it is totally worth it 
5 0 Love it How much fun It has a salsa beat sung by children and is an old favorite song 
5 0 Nice scents funny music in one package This set is great my 9 month old son has loved lavander scent since almost birth The bottles are big you won t need more baby bath in a year or so The CD is lot of fun my son really enjoys to bounce while listening to his favorite tracks The toy is soft and purple a real baby eyed catching We use the case to store baby medicines tylenol and stuff Buy it now you won t regret 
5 0 A lot of Products I got it as a gift for my upcoming baby I love this item It has a lot of products and they all smell soooooo good I can t wait to use it on my baby and see if she ll like them as much as I do I also like the container to hold on my baby bath items 
5 0 It s nice having a fresh baby I love this bathwash After a bath my son smells sooo fresh and it s gentle on him It s gentle on his skin and cleans him nicely My son sweats so much and I have to bathe him a lot I was really worried that bathing him so much would make his skin dried out but the bath wash and shampoo combo keeps his skin nice and soft and smelling so nice It was a good buy 
5 0 Baby Shower Gift The gift item is great and was on the mother s wish list I spent what I could afford and then ended up with a more expensive item due to the amount of shipping which increased it from about 30 to about 40 That hurt 
5 0 So glad we got this I registered for this kit and got two at first I considered taking one back but I am glad I didn t It is great to have way more of these necessities to start off with that s months of not having to remember to buy any I love the bucket thing this comes in one currently holds all our bath stuff for easy toting to the bathroom The other one is our bib holder since we have a TON of bibs It keeps them neat all in one place and closes and can be put away for guests The vapor bath is fantastic We just got over my son s first cold and it worked like a charm He loves baths to begin with and this filled the whole bathroom with that soothing vapor and within minutes I could hear the difference in his breathing When I caught the cold a few days later I have to admit I also took a vapor bath and it was better than a hot shower for clearing my congestion I don t know that the Lavendar one necessarily calms or soothes the baby but it smells nice We ve gotten shampoo in his eye at least once with no tears or fuss so it must not burn I definitely recommend getting this for new moms to be 
5 0 One of my favorites I registered for this item and couldn t be happier with it The case is perfect to keep everything organized and at hand The products work great though I haven t tried any others so nothing to compare them to I especially love the cd though I would definately reccomend this set to anybody looking for the first bathing kit for their little one 
5 0 Great gift I sent this as a baby shower gift and it was used right away The new parent s loved it and praised the great smell 
5 0 THE BEST SOUND QUALITY BETTER THAN DIGITAL THIS MONITOR HAS THE BEST SOUND QUALITY YOU CAN PUT THE RADIO ON THE MONITOR AND LISTEN ON THE RECEVER IT WILL SOUND LIKE THE RADIO IS NEXT TO YOU I HAD THE MONITOR FOR 2 YEAR WITH OUT PROBLEMS WITH RANGE OR INTERFERANCE MY MONITOR IS BEEN ON AND IN THE SAME CHANNEL ALL THAT TIME I TRY THREE OTHER MONITORS ONE OF THEM DIGITAL THE SONY SOUND QUALITY IS UNTOUCHABLE VERY SENSITIVE I CAN HEAR MY BABY MOVE AT NIGHT I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH RANGE I WORK OUT ON THE BASEMENT DURING HER NAP IT HAS THE BEST VOLUME I CAN HEAR HER OVER A LOUD TREADMILL AND MUSIC I WAS HAPPY TO RETURN THE OTHER MONITORS TO GET THIS ONE THE ONE PROBLEN I FOUND IS THE MONITOR AND THE RECEVER CAN NOT BE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE A HORRIBLE LOUD NOISE TO AVOID THIS I TURN OFF THE MONITOR BEFORE GETTING CLOSE TO THE ROOM THE BABY IS SLEEPING IN THE WATER RESISTANT FEATURE IS GREAT I CAN PUT THE RECEVER RIGHT IN THE SHOWER AND LISTEN OR WATCH THE LIGHTS IT IS NOT WATERPROOF YOU DON T WANT TO GET IT WET BUT THE HUMIDITY OR A LITTLE SPLASHING WON T HURT IT 
5 0 Totally happy I ve been very pleased with the performance of this monitor We have a two story house with wifi and cordless phones and have never had a problem with interference I ve use the monitor in every room in the house and had no problems with reception I think this is a really high quality monitor and would definitely recommend it 
4 0 Great Monitor for Baby My husband and I adore this monitor It picks up on every little noise our little one makes which is great We occasionally get some interference but all I have to do is move the monitor and it goes away The interference never occurs on the unit in my baby s room just on the parent unit so you do not have to worry about waking the little one up I love the rechargeable battery option and the ability to carry around the unit with me throughout our 2 story house I plug it in at night by my bed and it then runs all day long You can defintely trust this monitor 
5 0 Awesome tool This is one of our favorite most used baby shower gifts It was so simple to set up and we LOVE that you can carry the parents monitor arround It s also nice that you can turn it to voice activated so you only hear cries and not background noise This is a must if you don t want to stand right next to the crib to monitor sleeping baby 
5 0 Great Pre Natal Resource I love the Pre Natal and Newborn Baby Education System It is a true blessing to have a system in place that I know will enhance my baby s development even before he is born The music and Bible versus are also relaxing for me and my two year old We have really enjoyed the CDs I use to work in the field of adoption and wish that I would have had this resource at my disposal during that time period 
5 0 Excellent Purchase This sort of product wasn t available with my first child It was such a pain to get him into winter outerwear and even more a pain to take it off when we got to where we were going When I found this Bundleme product I knew it would be much easier to survive the winter months in Michigan with my second child It fits easily into my Graco infant carseat carrier I don t have to worry about dressing him up I just put a hat on him and off we go It s also easier to buckle the baby up without so much extra clothing bunching up everywhere and probably safer too When we get to where ever we are going I just unzip the sides and he s fine So far we have endured 40 degree temps rain wind and snow and he s stayed warm and snug as a bug the whole time Truly an excellent purchase 
5 0 Infant + Cold Weather + Infant Carrier = MUST HAVE My son was born in February and I actually considered taking this product back because I didn t think it would be usueful After using this product a few times I decided I was wrong I LOVE this product It fit perfectly in my infant carrier Dressing my newborn son was not a process he enjoyed let alone being put into the carrier With the Bundle Me I didn t have to struggle putting my baby in any coats or buntings then struggle with the bulkiness to get him into the carrier in order to take him out into the cold An additional bonus I found was that if I needed to take him indoors but keep him in the carrier I didn t need to worry about him overheating I just had to unzip the top blanket and pull it back It s like a little sleeping bag Unfortunately I think my son will be too big for his current carrier when winter befalls us again I think we will be moving on to a carseat instead of a carrier at that point so the Bundle Me will be less useful Even if I just use the seat portion and keep the blanket top for extra cold days it will workout great I already consider it well worth the money 
4 0 Great for winter babies This was great for the first three months We had a winter baby and this was great for the cold weather unlike a blanket it will not fall off After about three months the baby will start to outgrow as their feet will begin to hit the edge Since it zippers and the bottom and top separate this would also be good for additional cozy lining for any young baby Good buy 
4 0 Warm and cozy Our daughter was born in October so we used the bundle me all the time It was so easy to just buckle her up and go instead of bundling her up in sweaters and jackets As she got older however she would push the top flap away but I wasn t that worried because it wasn t that cold by March she was still quite warm You might want to think about this if you have an active baby 
4 0 Love it With my second baby due in Feb I knew I would need something to keep her warm I purchased this product and LOVE IT The color is beautiful it is snuggly warm and soft and my baby falls right to sleep in it As she is only 4 weeks old it can be a little big how to explain it bunches a bit at the feet so I have to push it down But it is a great product and I m sooo glad we got it 
5 0 We love our Bundle Me We live in the cold rainy Northwest part of the country This product has been essential since our little boy was born in December It has been in his carseat since the day we took him home from the hospital We never need to use blankets or bundle him up in heavy clothes when we take him out in the carseat He stays warm and protected in the Bundle Me This is definitely the best and most used product we have bought for our baby It is a must for Winter babies It is well worth the money 
5 0 No need to bundle up with the Bundle Me Wow This is the best thing I received for my baby It has saved me sooo much time I would normally have to layer my daughter before heading out the door but I just don t need to worry with this I feel sorry for all the people who bought my daughter thick sweaters and the aunt who bought her a snow suit We just never use them I can zip her into the Bundle Me and head out for a walk in the stroller She usually falls asleep because she finds it so cozy When she was smaller we used it in the infant car seat which fit into our stroller It meant she was zipped in before we opened the door and unzipped when we reached our destination She never felt the cold It is really easy to use and fits on our two different strollers and car seats 
4 0 Great playard LOVE bassinet This is a great pack n play It s easy to set up and take any place The bassinet is great very sturdy and larger than another one that I have The colors are bright and the music piece keeps our baby s attention My only problem is the piece for the top Whenever I try to use it the arms bow in and it doesn t look very sturdy I also have trouble using this piece and the mat on the ground It just doesn t seem very sturdy and I have tried everything Other than that I am glad that I bought this 
4 0 Great for the money My little girl loves this play space The colors and over head bar keep her amused for long enough that I can get dinner on or help with home work The only thing that might make it better would be if the music in the push button play mat lasted longer than 2 minutes 
5 0 great playard great value I think for your money you get a great value for this playard It comes with an interactive musical toy that no other playard comes with anything like this It also comes with overhead bars that you can hang toys from and the baby can play with The mattress seems very comfortable and I bought this playpen because the bassinet part looked more reinforced than the others It has bars that snap in place and also has plastic parts that hang over the tops The mat can also be used as a playmat on the floor with the overhead bars 
4 0 Looks great I just recently got this pack n play as a shower gift from the godmother of our little one This pack n play has a great vibe to it the colors are absolutely fantastic It s easy to set up and has the most adorable toys It is also easy to convert it into the gym The only complaint I have is that I m 32 weeks and I had a heck of a time putting everything into the bag by myself 
5 0 The only colorful play yard I just bought this at babiesRus store Easy to setup My baby loves the bright colors and music I highly recommend this to anyone 
5 0 Very Nice Playard Very colorful and easy to set up A quilted fitted playard sheet to cover the mattress makes this a great place for baby to nap Cute toys Folds and unfolds very easily Very sturdy 
5 0 Comforting and Funny Bored with all those stage in life books for your baby to be Perhaps you are as I am soon to be expecting and realize that you won t have a lot of time to read up about what your baby may may not be up to and if it is normal after your baby arrives Well then this book is for you I eagerly started the book on Friday and finished it yes all 500 pages on Saturday What a delight The author uses plenty of references from real life Moms and Dads which add wonderful insite and humor Be warned though if you are looking for the What to expect book format this is not for you This is a realistic warm and funny look at life that tackles hard to discuss topics in a safe and humorous way If you are tired of the same old at this age your child will _____ books then definately pick this up Its like talking to an old friend that you haven t met yet who has been there and knows the struggles and confusion that comes with having a baby 
4 0 Great book for new mother I purchased this book for a young friend of mine who was about to have a baby and had lots of questions about not only the baby but about what her body was going through She loves it and refers to it constantly 
5 0 A top notch guide to baby and mom s first year This book provides an exceptionally thorough look at baby s first year from both the mother and baby s perspective First time mothers often express frustration about how ill prepared they felt for the early weeks and months of motherhood This book does an excellent job of giving mothers to be a realistic idea of what life after baby will really be like for better and for worse It s a truly one of a kind and top notch reference 
4 0 Great book more for pre baby This is a great easy to read book with good info However the title is a bit misleading 2 3 of the book deal with planning for baby and dealing with the first few days It is an excellent book but it is more a book to read in your last trimester than after baby is born 
5 0 Helpful tips and advice If you are about to have a baby or babies in the case of parents of twins or other multiples this book can really help you to get off to a good start with your babies It has a lot of helpful tips and advice Also you don t have to try to guess where the information you re seeking is because the book is organized by chapters that are on that particular topic like a chapter on sleep a chapter on breastfeeding and so on The problem with some of the month by month baby books is that the information you need is sometimes in the wrong month 
5 0 Very helpful baby reference guide I have found this book to be a very helpful reference guide There is a chart that summarize first year developmental milestones a chapter that includes detailed information about the signs symptoms and treatments for the most common illnesses that babies tend to develop advice on getting breastfeeding off to the best start helpful advice on what to expect in terms of newborn behavior sleep crying feeding patterns etc The author s tone is friendly and reassuring If you enjoyed the previous book in this series The Mother of All Pregnancy Books as I did you will likely enjoy this book too 
5 0 The thumper worked for us Our daughter is turning 2 years old this week and I felt it time to finally write a review of this amazing product From the very beginning she has been an incredibly alert and interested baby She was born c section at 38 weeks with eyes and hands wide open Once they were finished cleaning her up my husband and I were thrilled to just cuddle her and talk to her while she looked at us both with wide eyes and made little coo coo sounds Right away she was great at nursing with a very good latch She rarely ever cried and when she did it was a quiet little lay lay lay sound not the wild Waa waa s Throughout infancy she was always capable of adapting to every situation quickly and without emotional outburst Where it would seem other children would be over stimulated in an environment she would thrive and seem to want more stimulation At only three months of age people thought she was older because of her alertness and interest in people and animals She hit every developmental milestone months early especially in language sign and speech music appreciation and colors shape letter number recognition Her pediatrician has been happily surprised by her and suggested that I should have five more just like her When we bought the BabyPlus we thought if it helps only 10 as well as the testimonials say it does it will be worth it We re certain it has contributed positively in helping develop this little miracle of ours We re now expecting child 2 25 weeks along and although not using the Baby Plus could be an interesting experiment same gene pool same parenting etc we re too interested in the possibilities of how much it may contribute to our next child for us to withhold it 
5 0 Exceptiona product exceptional baby ok so how many people think their baby is exceptional Well pretty much everyone i know and they are all right of course Each baby is exceptional in their own way But how many babies are rated as exceptional by pediatricians nurses and early childhood educators Well I know one MINE I faithfully used the babyplus system when I was pregnant One time when using it he started knocking back Yeap i actually felt him knock back at it in rhythm It only happened once but I told my husband that i think this is going to be one special kid I was about 7 months pregnant then Well lo and behold after he was born people professionals don t stop telling us how amazing he is He is the most aware newborn you will ever meet He is 2 months old now and has been sleeping through the night 11 hours at a time since he was 2 weeks He cries when he needs something and never cries for no reason but i do make sure to respond quickly to his needs so i don t know how much that has to do with it Yesterday he started reaching for objects Can t quite grab them yet but it doesn t stop him from trying The pediatrician and the nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he is how aware he seems and the fact that he vocalizes to music is unheard of at this age He s been holding his head up since the day he was born 3 days late and has been making eye contact since about 2 weeks So i don t really know what if anything the baby plus system had to do with it I mean it could be just an accident but all I can say is that I will definitely use this product with our future children I would pay thousands if i had to and we are not rich people because its worth every penny 
5 0 Fantastic I was lucky enough to happen onto the Baby Plus ARE YOU KIDDING ME That s what I hear from people If I want I can sleep in and I have been able to since my daughter was 2 months old I can take a nap She hardly cried and when she did it was a pure purpose cry food I saw my daughters eyes alert and amazing from the moment she was put in my arms She has exceeded where she should be at this point in her life 22months Our bonding from the minute I put on the Baby Plus till now awesome Every heartbeat brought a reaction I can t believe this is my daughter and neither can my parents Was I ever this good No My husband s family is the same How could we have such a beautiful smart and calm 22 month old LUCKY Nope Baby Plus Sure she s a 22month old at times but she s smart as a whip and I will use Baby Plus again Thank you for discovering and making this product I will love my child no matter what but I LOVE the addition this has brought to my daughter 22 months and I am soo lucky THANK YOU 
5 0 Amazing Results I began using the system when I was 18 weeks pregnant but could not keep up the schedule with a fast pace career I stopped when I was about 31 weeks I thought that my efforts went down the drain and did not try to look for any benefits from Baby Plus However when I went back to the testimonials to compare I realized that my son has accomplished many of the same feats other Baby Plus babies have I cannot believe that only 13 weeks of using this system had such a positive impact on my son s development He never had colic has been extremely happy and expressive since he was born laughs as if it s rolling from his toes since he was 4 months latched on immediately after birth and today has a vocabulary of about 50 words not including animal sounds he can make or hand gestures he s memorized for his favorites songs I highly recommend this product 
5 0 Perfect Baby Swing The baby calmly swings everyday The baby especially enjoys looking up at the characters and mirror which keeps him entertained while swinging It has an adjustable seat that has allowed the baby to swing comfortably since he was brought home from the hospital I believe this was the best investment thus far for our infant 
5 0 Wish I d have had it for all 5 kids I have five kids ages 11 and under so we have seen and had many many baby items This has to be one of my favorites of all time We just love it Baby Ian is six weeks now and sleeps in it for his naps swings in it when he s fussy and watches the mobile when I make dinner I honestly don t know how we lived without it Buy it now And buy it here it s 20 cheaper than babies r us 
5 0 Baby Papasan Chair This item is the greatest thing since disposable diapers My grandson LOVES his in fact they moved it into the bedroom and the bassenette went in the family room because he sleeps so much better in the Papasan chair It is wonderful you owe it to yourself to get this not only for the baby s sake but for yours 
5 0 Great swing amazing customer service We bought this swing just under a year ago when our baby was about two months old She LOVED this swing and was either asleep in it or just peacefully playing and looking around the room at us Now she is 14 months and has not used it for awhile so two months ago friends bought it from us for their newborn son They used it only two months when one day they turned it off and smoke started coming out of the motor compartment The batteries were intact but the swing didn t work whatsoever anymore even with new batteries I called Fisher Price and they were very concerned about the smoke I didn t have the purchase receipt anymore and wasn t sure if it was still covered by the warranty They asked for the Product Code and Run Code and where I bought it Babies R Us They are now sending me a brand new motor housing the entire top portion of the swing which you just attach the legs to They are also sending a pre paid label to put on the box so I can send them the dead motor housing How great is that I am so impressed and amazed by Fisher Price s customer service No receipt and still they are totally helping me out and basically replacing the swing Talk about gaining customer loyalty It s good to know you can pay 130 for a baby item and get your money s worth all around The swing itself is just wonderful The motor is quiet my baby loved the moving bugs and the two swinging directions offers a nice change for the baby The swing s colors are great as well soothing and neutral instead of the usual super bright primary colors on most other swings 
5 0 Best shower gift life saver This was the best shower gift we received We had this set up in our living room before we went to the hospital We used this swing from day one every day Our baby just turned seven months old and he still loves to swing in it I honestly don t know where we would be without this swing We literally use it every day 
5 0 LIFE SAVER WOW This swing has been a life saver My son LOVES his swing It s proven to be the best baby shower present ever I highly recommend this swing Your baby is happy content and falls asleep easy giving mom time to get things done Love love love it 
4 0 Good buy It is a good buy only my daughter doesn t like the swinging motion and rather enjoys looking at the mobile 
4 0 Safer than other tubs I bought this without reading the reviews The tub definately leaks a little bit I suppose because they try to make it adjustable Because it leaked I bought a different tub In the end I went back to this one because it has the bath ring I feel much better knowing the baby isn t going to slip under the water My daughter is 9 months now and she loves this tub What I did to resolve the leak issue was put a boot tray under it It fits perfectly and catches any water that gets by Great 5 fix for an otherwise terrific tub Hope this helps 
5 0 Wonderful bathing system for babies This is by far the best bathtub we ever used with our three boys Yes it does leak if you don t read the directions and set it up properly I got one of those leaky surprises too Then I went back to the setup directions and found the problem and fixed it My youngest has loved bathtime ever since I especially liked how it converts to a bath seat as I hated the one I used to use with my other kids I m only sorry my baby is about to outgrow it This has been the easiest bathtub I ve ever used especially with a slippery newborn Okay so it s not the most intuitive as far as setting up you WILL have to ready the accompanying directions but once you set it up you ll be glad you made the effort A great product 
4 0 Love It Not sure why this got bad reviews There is a slight issue with locking the tub in the expanded position if you don t snap it in right it will leak But once we figured that out we had no problems We used the product starting at about 8 weeks when our son outgrew the sink but was too tiny for the tub and we stuck this tub right on our countertop for months with no problem Now we use it in our regular tub and it saves us from having to waste a tubful of water for one tiny person to bathe Our son is now almost one and he still loves this tub great value

5 0 Great basket for nursery I received this at my shower and it is really nice It is an attractive way to store misc baby items Right now I am using it for diapering needs Great price also 
4 0 Cute and functional We recently purchased this for our son s changing table in his room and are very pleased with it It has pockets on the inside for small items such as comb nail clippers etc And the inside is plenty big for a box of wipes A cute addition to the nursery 
4 0 Love it We originally registered for this item because we have a 2 level house and thought this would help us from trudging up and down the stairs so much But since my 2 month old still lives in our room in her bassinet that part has not yet been an issue However we keep this basket in our living room fully stocked and we don t even have to get up off the couch to change a diaper Sounds lazy but if you already have kids you understand The sides of the liner have pockets which we use to hold hand sanitizer diaper rash cream a thermometer baby brush aspirator baby nail clippers lotion a couple rattles toys and some chapstick and nursing pads for me We put the diapers a changing pad and a wipe holder in the main center part I also have two wrist rattles attached to either side of the handle and my baby loves to look at them while she s getting her diaper changed I put the basket next to her head so she can see one of them The basket itself is well made and I have no fears of it falling apart any time soon In fact we plan to put it to other use once baby is out of diapers We have not yet had to wash the liner but it appears to be well made and I have no fears of it falling apart although I am going to throw it in a laundry bag and use the delicate cycle 
5 0 white willow baby organizer with sage liner I got this for a baby gift and filled it with bath items I thought it looked great and would be useful to use 
5 0 Price reduced after I purchased this item I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon This bath tub is a good purchase but as soon as I bought it the price reduced on Amazon This had been a constant problem on Amazon and I think somebody should do something about it I think I should get a refund Thanks Shobhn 
5 0 Great Baby tub Love the Net I have used this baby tub since my daughters belly button fell off The net is very easy to use and it is very easy while washing the baby I only quit using the net when my daughter started to roll Now se sits up and has plenty of room to splash I also like the elevated seat so that way she is not slipping and sliding all over the tub My daughter also loves the toys that come with it 
5 0 Awesome I got this for my baby girl and both she and I love it She doesn t slip and it is really comfortable for her She really enjoys bathtime And if you follow the way the hammock should be used for the size of your baby you will really enjoy it I wanted this prior to my baby being born but I read some of the reviews and I didn t buy it for her After the first month of her using another tub and having trouble with the product I decided to buy this Aquarium tub that I wanted in the first place Caution Please use the hammock as directed for your baby s size This tub is perfect if you do that The reviews that I read about the hammock being too small or the bump in the middle of the tub were laughable when I actually read the directions before use Please read the directions Both you and your child will appreciate that you did 
5 0 Love this chair I love this chair and so does my 5 month old I love that it reclines 3 different postions and the best feature is it slides up and down to meet my level needs Feeding him from any height is easy 
5 0 The best high chair I love this high chair and so does my daughter It has many toys for her to play with while she is waiting For her food The chair also folds compactly for storage It has a great bar in the back to hang all of her bibs and towels It has a height adjustment that is great I adjust the height to fit right under our dinner table so she can sit with us at dinner It also converts to a booster chair so she can still use it as she gets older I love the chair pad the cushion is so comfortable and it a beautiful fabric but it wipes off clean Which is great for moms since we hate a mess It is very sturdy and safe I also like the five point harness system My daughter is like hodini she can get out of the three point harness and since i have her in the five point harness she is locked in safe I highly recommend this product to new and old moms I love it 
4 0 A few problems but otherwise fine This is a nice chair except for the brakes They lock so easily that if you just barely brush by them with your foot they lock It seems that all you have to do is look at them and they lock Since we are constantly moving the chair to us or back to the wall etc this is a real problem because you have to unlock them esp if more than one of the four is locked in order to move the chair easily As baby gets heavier and heavier and becomes a toddler this is even harder The pleats at the bottom of the seat pad are probably unnecessary and definately hard to get the crumbs out of If it weren t for the brakes I would give it 5 stars The toy aquarium is nice except that they could make the large push pads which make the fish move around in the water easier for little ones to push 
5 0 Great buy We bought this highchair for our 7 month old daughter last weekend She absolutely loves it Love the piece in the middle of the seat that prevents baby from sliding down The safety straps are extremely easy to use clean up is a snap Our daughter loves the toys it comes with is thrilled to be sitting at the table with the rest of the family Would definitely recommend this highchair 
4 0 Almost perfect Our son loves the toy The buttons were hard for him to push initially But at 10 months he was able to push the buttons to make the sounds He loves it both on and off the chair Our only complaint is the wheel locks lock too easily They flip down with barely a touch which can be annoying when you want to wheel the chair around alot like we do in a small kitchen 
5 0 Great Toy My twins love these blocks They received them as a gift at about 3 months old At first they enjoyed just touching them each side of the blocks have a different texture Now that they are older 7 months these blocks are one of their favortite toys They can easily hold them shake them and throw them 
5 0 Perfect for little hands My son loves these blocks We introduced them to him around 3 months He loves the colors and is now starting to pet the different textures on the cubes These are great toys even for teething My son loves to chew on the little bumbs His favorite cube would have to be the duck He talks and squeals everytime the duck quacks These cubes will also come in handy later when he is learning his colors and letters We love Baby Einstein 
5 0 My son loves these I bought these blocks when my son was a month old he is now almost 7 months old and he loves them The blocks are designed in bright and attractive colours that easily catch your baby s eye When baby starts to pick up and play they will discover that each block has different textures and fabrics to help develop baby s touch and they also have a unique feature too Red and Blue are rattles Yellow s duck quacks and behind the sun is a tiny mirror and Green s frog vibrates when you pull his leg These blocks by Baby Einstein are a great buy at a 10 value they will keep your baby entertained and happy 
4 0 good product but quite big for small hands great attractive colors to the baby but quite too big and frustrating a 5 6 month old who s just starting to learn to grasp with one hand and just learning to navigate his opposable hands 
5 0 All you could want in a toy These blocks contain everything you could want in a toy Each has different textures images and something unique about it The yellow block has a duck on the one side that quacks when pressed On the other side is a sun whose face flips up to reveal a tiny mirror Another side has a picture of some bananas with a clear plastic over them to make for an interesting texture and yet another side contains a circle motif The red block rattles has a picture of a robin on the one side a square pattern motif on another side and a picture of strawberries on another The green block has a frog with 3D legs and the one leg is a pull toy that will cause the block to shake It also has a picture of a green apple mine does at least although this picture shows a leaf a silky fabric with leaf prints and a triangle motif The blue block is another rattle It has a picture of the BE turtle on one side some jeans made from real denim on another and a star motif on another All blocks have a side with the color s name I bought mine at Target and they have the name in english spanish and french although these pictured only show it in English The rest of the sides are filled with textured fabrics such as a soft fluffly fur or a bumpy texture like the material found on the bottom of some slippers to prevent skidding My three month old loves to look at these blocks and I rub the different sides against her skin while saying soft smooth or bumpy and she loves the feelings My friend s daughter who is five months loves to pick up and throw down the blocks It s one of her favorite games I d reccomend these blocks as a must have for any infant 
4 0 Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity blocks My som is 10 months old and loves these blocks Some make noises The yellow has a picture of a duck on it and makes a quacking sound The green one has a picture of a frog and you pull the tail and it vibrates and my son loves that There are also different textures on each block and my son really likes playing with them 
4 0 Great product I purchased this toy for my son when he was 4 months old At first he seemed a little intimidated by the toys and would cry when I put him in it Once he got used to it he really enjoyed it Now he plays with all the toys and he likes that it wobbles around His favorite toy seems to be the sun and the counting beads I did not experience the problem with the feet that others wrote about Just lucky I guess The seat is really hard to remove for washing which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 
5 0 Fun for the Family Being a fan of the Baby Einstein line of products I put this on my registry What a great gift it turned out to be It could entertain my daughter when nothing else did She is now 16 months old and too big for it but when she started watching the Baby Einstein videos she recognized the characters that were on this center 
5 0 Creative interactive fun I purchased the Baby Einstein Discover and Play center to keep at the office for days my then 5 mnth old son Toby was with me at work He immediately loved the musical buttons and the sun and ignored everything else As he grew he discovered the other toys one by one It was exciting to watch him perfecting the different skills necessary to manipulate the activities Because I used the Baby Einstein as a secure place for meals it needed regular cleaning The seat pops right off for easy cleaning but the cloth saddle is a little hard to unsnap from the base Overall the assembly is pretty easy I put it together myself and I am NOT mechanically inclined I definitely recommend the Baby Einstein activity center I looked at several other brands and was turned off by all the obnoxious toys and activities I wanted something Toby could learn from not just be dazzled by the bells and whistles I can t say Toby learned any Spanish from the language buttons but the Baby Einstein kept my son engaged even at 11 months when his willingness to stay in one place was usually short lived 
5 0 Entertaining with or without Mama We loved this because we could play with our daughter the puppet was fun for us too but it also kept her busy long enough to cook a meal or read the paper She liked being upright and the height adjustments were great for our tall baby also it only has ONE battery operated toy so your child is given the opportunity to interact with the toys rather than watch a bunch of flashing lights and music Saving this for the next child 
5 0 Wonderful Activity Center I have 2 activity centers by different makers the other is at Grandmas house so I have something to compare this to I can honestly say this this Activity Center is worth the extra 15 20 dollars you might have to spend To begin the seat swivels easily for the baby to move from one activity to the next That might not be an important issue for older babies but my daughter was 4 months old when she started to use this and compared to the other exersaucer it really makes a differnce having a seat she can maneuver The toys attachments are of great quality and offer a variety of skills for baby to learn from and to be entertained by I can t say enough positive things about this Activity Center I highly recommend it as it is both stimulating and entertaining for baby 
5 0 my baby loves this We got one of those hang in the doorway jumpers but we don t really have an good place to hang it so we exchanged it for this My baby really has a good time in it laughing and jumping all over the place Recommende 
4 0 My 5 month old loves this I bought this for my first baby now 2 1 2 He didn t like to spend much time in the Jumperoo and would only last a couple of minutes I recently pulled it out and tried my 5 month in it She was a bit fussy at first but now absolutely loves this She jumps up and down for an hour laughing and playing with the toys on the front Any toy that can keep a 5 month old amused for more than a few minutes is wonderful and so I would definitely recommend it I would have given it 5 stars but feel the gadgets on the front could be better 
5 0 Fun for Baby but Loud for Mommy I and more importantly my twin boys really like this jumper It seems safer than the doorway jumper mainly because their fingers won t get mushed I like that it has multiple height settings and that it s on a sturdy frame They love to jump in it and before they were able to crawl it was one of the few ways for them to get out some of that excess energy and get some exercise Plus it s a nice safe place for times when I d like to get something done without having to keep a constant eye on one of the babies The cons that wouldn t keep me from buying it again are it takes up more room than a doorway jumper the rattly bear is pretty loud and the music is obnoxious There is an on off switch and two volume settings for the music though 
5 0 Our baby Loves This Thing Our baby can spend a good portion of his day jumping in this thing Even if he isn t jumping he loves to hit the noise buttons and various toy items around the seating area Sometimes he just isn t in the mood and will cry and jump but most of the time he is delighted and will wear himself out 
5 0 Jumperoo to the Rescue I bought this for my son when he was just shy of 4 months old Initially he would just sit in the seat occassionally moving sideways probably because he lost his balance After 5 10 minutes he was ready to hit the eject button he d had enough That lasted 4 or 5 days during which we d put him in the Jumperoo 2 or 3 times per day with hopes that he d grow to enjoy it On the 5th day he began jumping up and down like a crazed kangaroo His face had a wide smile and some drool he was excited From that point forward and still going he s consistently loved his time in the J roo He regularly has jumping sessions of 30 45 minutes while watching Clifford Dragon Tales This is a great way for little T to be in a upright position while strengthening his little legs Also it s not a bad break for us parents now and again 
5 0 Our little one LOVED this Our little one LOVED this toy until he turned 8 months Now its really a challenge to try to get him into this thing or the Baby Einstein stationary entertainer see my review for that However he will still play with it standing OUTSIDE and loves touching the legs and toys and chewing on the bar Unfortunately he puts up a fight when we try to get him in it But we did have a good run for this and it was worth it He would bounce back and forth and say AHHHHHHH and just laugh really hard So glad that someone gave this to us and we didn t have to buy it But if you are making that decision I say it is totally worth it 
5 0 Love it How much fun It has a salsa beat sung by children and is an old favorite song 
5 0 Nice scents funny music in one package This set is great my 9 month old son has loved lavander scent since almost birth The bottles are big you won t need more baby bath in a year or so The CD is lot of fun my son really enjoys to bounce while listening to his favorite tracks The toy is soft and purple a real baby eyed catching We use the case to store baby medicines tylenol and stuff Buy it now you won t regret 
5 0 A lot of Products I got it as a gift for my upcoming baby I love this item It has a lot of products and they all smell soooooo good I can t wait to use it on my baby and see if she ll like them as much as I do I also like the container to hold on my baby bath items 
5 0 It s nice having a fresh baby I love this bathwash After a bath my son smells sooo fresh and it s gentle on him It s gentle on his skin and cleans him nicely My son sweats so much and I have to bathe him a lot I was really worried that bathing him so much would make his skin dried out but the bath wash and shampoo combo keeps his skin nice and soft and smelling so nice It was a good buy 
5 0 A Great Gift Set I received this Gerber gift set for my baby shower The products lather up really well and they smell great They are gentle and they don t make my daughter get a rash You get a lot of product for the price too My daughter really relaxes with the Lavender scent wash and lotion and we used the Menthol wash when she had a cold Now that my daughter is teething she drools a lot which causes chapped skin on her cheeks and chin The moisturizing stick works great for this We love this gift set and would recommend it 
5 0 Baby Shower Gift The gift item is great and was on the mother s wish list I spent what I could afford and then ended up with a more expensive item due to the amount of shipping which increased it from about 30 to about 40 That hurt 
5 0 One of my favorites I registered for this item and couldn t be happier with it The case is perfect to keep everything organized and at hand The products work great though I haven t tried any others so nothing to compare them to I especially love the cd though I would definately reccomend this set to anybody looking for the first bathing kit for their little one 
5 0 Great gift I sent this as a baby shower gift and it was used right away The new parent s loved it and praised the great smell 
5 0 working just fine This is the first baby monitor we ve tried and we are quite happy with it We did a good bit of research ahead of time and chose this one because of its features and the reliability I like that the receiver unit can plug into the wall I don t really like to use the voice activated mode but my husband does and says it works great When in the normal mode I can hear little birds outside my baby s window and cars passing our house it s quite sensitive I also like the lights on the receiver you can turn the volume all the way down if you re watching a movie or something 
5 0 Awesome tool This is one of our favorite most used baby shower gifts It was so simple to set up and we LOVE that you can carry the parents monitor arround It s also nice that you can turn it to voice activated so you only hear cries and not background noise This is a must if you don t want to stand right next to the crib to monitor sleeping baby 
5 0 A Must Have In terms of pre natal resources this is the best I have found The positive results are proven I can not think of a reason not to buy this product Every expectant parent wants the most and best for their unborn child This system is wonderful for interacting with your child before he or she is born You will even notice a response from your baby It s very exciting 
5 0 Great Pre Natal Resource I love the Pre Natal and Newborn Baby Education System It is a true blessing to have a system in place that I know will enhance my baby s development even before he is born The music and Bible versus are also relaxing for me and my two year old We have really enjoyed the CDs I use to work in the field of adoption and wish that I would have had this resource at my disposal during that time period 
4 0 like it but it needs a remote My Husband and I loved the look and shapes of the moblie My Baby s face just lights up when he s placed in his bed for naps or night time However we find ourself running back in forth so much because the cute little songs have stopped before he falls asleep I was looking online and saw that some of these new mobiles have remotes on them It would seem that with the all the new things that come out the manufactors would have given the public the option to have a wind up mobile or a remote mobile I hope that someone from these places reads these and takes the time to put more thought into what parents would want in future purchases But like as I said before we love the look and love they way my son reacts to it So I ll look at this mobile being a weight loss bonus for all the running back and forth 
5 0 Re Dangerous from CSM I completely understand your concern Although if you read the instructions for ANY mobile when the child is old enough to sit or stand in the crib around 6 months you are supposed to take it off They are not built for anyone to play with them My son liked his mobile so much that when he was old enough to reach it we took it off and my husband attached it to the top of his hutch This way we were still able to play the song but he couldn t reach it I think this mobile is a perfect way to add to the room s theme For those who looking to buy this mobile or any other mobile Go to the store where you are buying your crib and try it out The people at Babies R Us must have thought I was nuts because I took the quilt and the mobile from the set I wanted and took them to the crib I was buying I was able to determine if the mobile would fit before I bought it and I got to see how the colors in the bedding looked with the color of the crib This eliminated a lot of hassle for me later on with taking the mobile back if it didn t fit 
5 0 Great item great price I purchased this item not from Amazon and my child loved it The puppet provides hours of entertainment and the music is great not the usual kid drivel that usually is part of any kid item Some HBB s come with contemporary music and I will be picking up one of those soon Highly recommended 
5 0 Excellent Purchase This sort of product wasn t available with my first child It was such a pain to get him into winter outerwear and even more a pain to take it off when we got to where we were going When I found this Bundleme product I knew it would be much easier to survive the winter months in Michigan with my second child It fits easily into my Graco infant carseat carrier I don t have to worry about dressing him up I just put a hat on him and off we go It s also easier to buckle the baby up without so much extra clothing bunching up everywhere and probably safer too When we get to where ever we are going I just unzip the sides and he s fine So far we have endured 40 degree temps rain wind and snow and he s stayed warm and snug as a bug the whole time Truly an excellent purchase 
5 0 Best buy convenient durable I bought this 2 years ago when I had my first daughter I used it in her stroller on cool days and could quickly install it on the jogger when going for a run at the beach where it s usually windy and cooler during the fall It s very easy to switch from to any stroller less than 1 minute When we visited relatives in Canada at Xmas I installed the bundleMe on the infant car seat and it kept her warm during our trek from the airport to the parking spot In San Diego one fall day when she went down a slide at the park that was still wet she ended up wearing only a diaper but the BundleMe kept her warm as we walked back home Never had to worry about losing a blanket on the road or having enough blankets to keep baby warm or whether her feet were sticking out of the blankets lost a shoe sock etc I am now using the same bundle me with my second child I d recommend it to anyone who spends lots of time outdoor taking walks etc 
5 0 Infant + Cold Weather + Infant Carrier = MUST HAVE My son was born in February and I actually considered taking this product back because I didn t think it would be usueful After using this product a few times I decided I was wrong I LOVE this product It fit perfectly in my infant carrier Dressing my newborn son was not a process he enjoyed let alone being put into the carrier With the Bundle Me I didn t have to struggle putting my baby in any coats or buntings then struggle with the bulkiness to get him into the carrier in order to take him out into the cold An additional bonus I found was that if I needed to take him indoors but keep him in the carrier I didn t need to worry about him overheating I just had to unzip the top blanket and pull it back It s like a little sleeping bag Unfortunately I think my son will be too big for his current carrier when winter befalls us again I think we will be moving on to a carseat instead of a carrier at that point so the Bundle Me will be less useful Even if I just use the seat portion and keep the blanket top for extra cold days it will workout great I already consider it well worth the money 
4 0 Great for winter babies This was great for the first three months We had a winter baby and this was great for the cold weather unlike a blanket it will not fall off After about three months the baby will start to outgrow as their feet will begin to hit the edge Since it zippers and the bottom and top separate this would also be good for additional cozy lining for any young baby Good buy 
4 0 Warm and cozy Our daughter was born in October so we used the bundle me all the time It was so easy to just buckle her up and go instead of bundling her up in sweaters and jackets As she got older however she would push the top flap away but I wasn t that worried because it wasn t that cold by March she was still quite warm You might want to think about this if you have an active baby 
5 0 EXCELLENT WHAT A GREAT PRODUCT IT REALLY KEEPS THE BABY WARM EVEN IN THE COLDEST WINTER WHEN THE WIND IS WHIPPING THE GENEROUS FRONT FLAP FLIPS UP OVER THE CARRYING ARM OF THE BABY SEAT AND ALSO KEEPS THE BABY WARM NO FUSSY COATS AND HUNDREDS OF BLANKETS I HOPE TO USE IT NEXT WINTER ALSO 
4 0 Love it With my second baby due in Feb I knew I would need something to keep her warm I purchased this product and LOVE IT The color is beautiful it is snuggly warm and soft and my baby falls right to sleep in it As she is only 4 weeks old it can be a little big how to explain it bunches a bit at the feet so I have to push it down But it is a great product and I m sooo glad we got it 
4 0 Looks great I just recently got this pack n play as a shower gift from the godmother of our little one This pack n play has a great vibe to it the colors are absolutely fantastic It s easy to set up and has the most adorable toys It is also easy to convert it into the gym The only complaint I have is that I m 32 weeks and I had a heck of a time putting everything into the bag by myself 
5 0 The only colorful play yard I just bought this at babiesRus store Easy to setup My baby loves the bright colors and music I highly recommend this to anyone 
5 0 Very Nice Playard Very colorful and easy to set up A quilted fitted playard sheet to cover the mattress makes this a great place for baby to nap Cute toys Folds and unfolds very easily Very sturdy 
5 0 excellent very colorful playpen I got this as a gift on my baby shower was so happy to receive it This playpen is so wonderful very colorful sooo easy to set it up I m pretty sure our unborn child will be thrilled about it I received great reviews on this gear also so don t be dissapointed to grab one like it awesome playpen 
5 0 Wonderful Colorful Product I received this pack n play for a shower present this weekend and it is absolutely adorable set up It is very colorful and the the toys are cute It was very easy to set up I am not good at putting things together and it took me about 5 minutes total The matress comes out so you can put it on the floor with the toys overhead It is very multi functional 
5 0 Comforting and Funny Bored with all those stage in life books for your baby to be Perhaps you are as I am soon to be expecting and realize that you won t have a lot of time to read up about what your baby may may not be up to and if it is normal after your baby arrives Well then this book is for you I eagerly started the book on Friday and finished it yes all 500 pages on Saturday What a delight The author uses plenty of references from real life Moms and Dads which add wonderful insite and humor Be warned though if you are looking for the What to expect book format this is not for you This is a realistic warm and funny look at life that tackles hard to discuss topics in a safe and humorous way If you are tired of the same old at this age your child will _____ books then definately pick this up Its like talking to an old friend that you haven t met yet who has been there and knows the struggles and confusion that comes with having a baby 
4 0 Great book for new mother I purchased this book for a young friend of mine who was about to have a baby and had lots of questions about not only the baby but about what her body was going through She loves it and refers to it constantly 
5 0 A top notch guide to baby and mom s first year This book provides an exceptionally thorough look at baby s first year from both the mother and baby s perspective First time mothers often express frustration about how ill prepared they felt for the early weeks and months of motherhood This book does an excellent job of giving mothers to be a realistic idea of what life after baby will really be like for better and for worse It s a truly one of a kind and top notch reference 
4 0 Great book more for pre baby This is a great easy to read book with good info However the title is a bit misleading 2 3 of the book deal with planning for baby and dealing with the first few days It is an excellent book but it is more a book to read in your last trimester than after baby is born 
5 0 Helpful tips and advice If you are about to have a baby or babies in the case of parents of twins or other multiples this book can really help you to get off to a good start with your babies It has a lot of helpful tips and advice Also you don t have to try to guess where the information you re seeking is because the book is organized by chapters that are on that particular topic like a chapter on sleep a chapter on breastfeeding and so on The problem with some of the month by month baby books is that the information you need is sometimes in the wrong month 
5 0 Excellent info on skin rashes A recent reviewer noted that she had trouble finding information on skin rashes in this book I had to post a review responding to her review because this book has tons of information on skin and scalp conditions in the table on pages 404 412 which talks about everything from impetigo to eczema The information on teething is a bit more meager I agree that this is something that the author needs to expand upon in the next edition of this book But I still think this is an outstanding baby book It provides tons of information and is reassuring and contains just the right amount of humor to keep you reading at a time in your life when it s hard to find the time or energy to read 
5 0 Very helpful baby reference guide I have found this book to be a very helpful reference guide There is a chart that summarize first year developmental milestones a chapter that includes detailed information about the signs symptoms and treatments for the most common illnesses that babies tend to develop advice on getting breastfeeding off to the best start helpful advice on what to expect in terms of newborn behavior sleep crying feeding patterns etc The author s tone is friendly and reassuring If you enjoyed the previous book in this series The Mother of All Pregnancy Books as I did you will likely enjoy this book too 
5 0 Much improved over the earlier version I purchased the earlier version of this product two years ago I was disappointed that I wasn t able to use it for my second pregnancy most likely because it had been dropped too many times This new version comes with a cloth pouch that makes it MUCH MORE user friendly Also one set of batteries 4 AA lasted for 4 1 2 weeks The batteries in my old one would last 5 days IF I was lucky My daughter just turned two in January 06 and is extremely smart verbally advanced and a joy to be around By 16 months she knew all of her colors and could recite the ABC s By 18 months she could recognize all of the letters I believe we are well on our way to having a reading child by the age of 3 Do I credit the Baby Plus Who really knows but we decided not to chance it and are using it again for baby 2 
5 0 Fantastic I was lucky enough to happen onto the Baby Plus ARE YOU KIDDING ME That s what I hear from people If I want I can sleep in and I have been able to since my daughter was 2 months old I can take a nap She hardly cried and when she did it was a pure purpose cry food I saw my daughters eyes alert and amazing from the moment she was put in my arms She has exceeded where she should be at this point in her life 22months Our bonding from the minute I put on the Baby Plus till now awesome Every heartbeat brought a reaction I can t believe this is my daughter and neither can my parents Was I ever this good No My husband s family is the same How could we have such a beautiful smart and calm 22 month old LUCKY Nope Baby Plus Sure she s a 22month old at times but she s smart as a whip and I will use Baby Plus again Thank you for discovering and making this product I will love my child no matter what but I LOVE the addition this has brought to my daughter 22 months and I am soo lucky THANK YOU 
5 0 Amazing Results I began using the system when I was 18 weeks pregnant but could not keep up the schedule with a fast pace career I stopped when I was about 31 weeks I thought that my efforts went down the drain and did not try to look for any benefits from Baby Plus However when I went back to the testimonials to compare I realized that my son has accomplished many of the same feats other Baby Plus babies have I cannot believe that only 13 weeks of using this system had such a positive impact on my son s development He never had colic has been extremely happy and expressive since he was born laughs as if it s rolling from his toes since he was 4 months latched on immediately after birth and today has a vocabulary of about 50 words not including animal sounds he can make or hand gestures he s memorized for his favorites songs I highly recommend this product 
5 0 Great service from BabyPlus A friend of mine introduced me to the BabyPlus system I am just now beginning my third trimester and have been using the BabyPlus since week 20 I enjoy the 2 hours a day I use the system I feel like I am doing a good thing for my little boy on the way While using BabyPlus the battery cover clips snapped off I emailed customer service and they happily offered to replace the cover no questions asked BabyPlus is a company that seems more concerned with a positive experience for the baby rather than making sure I had all the required paperwork for replacement parts 
5 0 Mary Jane S RN mother of Faith and 23 weeks pregnant I am using the babyplus system for the second time and am looking forward to the same benefits as it produced with my 5 year old Faith was born alert calm and hardly cried at all as an infant She slept through the night right away with only waking to eat She is now in her last year of preschool and she enjoys to write sing and listen to music and loves arts and crafts Her teachers tell us how she is constantly helping other students in class with writing letters and words when they have had trouble Her disposition has always been happy and eager to learn She has great coordination with activities and sports I am a nurse and I tell all my patients and friends about the BabyPlus system I am pregnant with my second child and there was no question at all that I would use the BabyPlus system again Do not be afraid to try something new Just read the studies and reviews they speak for themselves You will not be sorry that you purchased this product for your unborn child 
5 0 Perfect Baby Swing The baby calmly swings everyday The baby especially enjoys looking up at the characters and mirror which keeps him entertained while swinging It has an adjustable seat that has allowed the baby to swing comfortably since he was brought home from the hospital I believe this was the best investment thus far for our infant 
5 0 Wish I d have had it for all 5 kids I have five kids ages 11 and under so we have seen and had many many baby items This has to be one of my favorites of all time We just love it Baby Ian is six weeks now and sleeps in it for his naps swings in it when he s fussy and watches the mobile when I make dinner I honestly don t know how we lived without it Buy it now And buy it here it s 20 cheaper than babies r us 
5 0 Baby Papasan Chair This item is the greatest thing since disposable diapers My grandson LOVES his in fact they moved it into the bedroom and the bassenette went in the family room because he sleeps so much better in the Papasan chair It is wonderful you owe it to yourself to get this not only for the baby s sake but for yours 
5 0 Great swing amazing customer service We bought this swing just under a year ago when our baby was about two months old She LOVED this swing and was either asleep in it or just peacefully playing and looking around the room at us Now she is 14 months and has not used it for awhile so two months ago friends bought it from us for their newborn son They used it only two months when one day they turned it off and smoke started coming out of the motor compartment The batteries were intact but the swing didn t work whatsoever anymore even with new batteries I called Fisher Price and they were very concerned about the smoke I didn t have the purchase receipt anymore and wasn t sure if it was still covered by the warranty They asked for the Product Code and Run Code and where I bought it Babies R Us They are now sending me a brand new motor housing the entire top portion of the swing which you just attach the legs to They are also sending a pre paid label to put on the box so I can send them the dead motor housing How great is that I am so impressed and amazed by Fisher Price s customer service No receipt and still they are totally helping me out and basically replacing the swing Talk about gaining customer loyalty It s good to know you can pay 130 for a baby item and get your money s worth all around The swing itself is just wonderful The motor is quiet my baby loved the moving bugs and the two swinging directions offers a nice change for the baby The swing s colors are great as well soothing and neutral instead of the usual super bright primary colors on most other swings 
5 0 Best shower gift life saver This was the best shower gift we received We had this set up in our living room before we went to the hospital We used this swing from day one every day Our baby just turned seven months old and he still loves to swing in it I honestly don t know where we would be without this swing We literally use it every day 
5 0 LIFE SAVER WOW This swing has been a life saver My son LOVES his swing It s proven to be the best baby shower present ever I highly recommend this swing Your baby is happy content and falls asleep easy giving mom time to get things done Love love love it 
4 0 Safer than other tubs I bought this without reading the reviews The tub definately leaks a little bit I suppose because they try to make it adjustable Because it leaked I bought a different tub In the end I went back to this one because it has the bath ring I feel much better knowing the baby isn t going to slip under the water My daughter is 9 months now and she loves this tub What I did to resolve the leak issue was put a boot tray under it It fits perfectly and catches any water that gets by Great 5 fix for an otherwise terrific tub Hope this helps 
5 0 Wonderful bathing system for babies This is by far the best bathtub we ever used with our three boys Yes it does leak if you don t read the directions and set it up properly I got one of those leaky surprises too Then I went back to the setup directions and found the problem and fixed it My youngest has loved bathtime ever since I especially liked how it converts to a bath seat as I hated the one I used to use with my other kids I m only sorry my baby is about to outgrow it This has been the easiest bathtub I ve ever used especially with a slippery newborn Okay so it s not the most intuitive as far as setting up you WILL have to ready the accompanying directions but once you set it up you ll be glad you made the effort A great product 
4 0 Love It Not sure why this got bad reviews There is a slight issue with locking the tub in the expanded position if you don t snap it in right it will leak But once we figured that out we had no problems We used the product starting at about 8 weeks when our son outgrew the sink but was too tiny for the tub and we stuck this tub right on our countertop for months with no problem Now we use it in our regular tub and it saves us from having to waste a tubful of water for one tiny person to bathe Our son is now almost one and he still loves this tub great value 
5 0 It s Useful Our 21 month old daughter has been using this tub since birth and we love it It does hold water and she can splash around and play with her toys The sunctions are great since they do stick pretty good to the tub Easy to clean and easy to put away when my husband or I need to use our regular tub

5 0 Perfect for the changing table I purchased this to put on the changing table I was looking for something that would fit on top of the table next to the changing mat and would hold diapers wipes lotions etc I purchased and returned two other baskets for various reasons then I found this one It fits perfectly and holds the wipes container several diapers lotion hair brush etc I love that it has separate pockets to hold small items so that they dont fall over This allows everything to be within easy reach while changing the baby The price was also reasonable I was looking at buying one from Pottery Barn for twice the amount This basket is a great buy 
5 0 Great basket for nursery I received this at my shower and it is really nice It is an attractive way to store misc baby items Right now I am using it for diapering needs Great price also 
4 0 Cute and functional We recently purchased this for our son s changing table in his room and are very pleased with it It has pockets on the inside for small items such as comb nail clippers etc And the inside is plenty big for a box of wipes A cute addition to the nursery 
4 0 Love it We originally registered for this item because we have a 2 level house and thought this would help us from trudging up and down the stairs so much But since my 2 month old still lives in our room in her bassinet that part has not yet been an issue However we keep this basket in our living room fully stocked and we don t even have to get up off the couch to change a diaper Sounds lazy but if you already have kids you understand The sides of the liner have pockets which we use to hold hand sanitizer diaper rash cream a thermometer baby brush aspirator baby nail clippers lotion a couple rattles toys and some chapstick and nursing pads for me We put the diapers a changing pad and a wipe holder in the main center part I also have two wrist rattles attached to either side of the handle and my baby loves to look at them while she s getting her diaper changed I put the basket next to her head so she can see one of them The basket itself is well made and I have no fears of it falling apart any time soon In fact we plan to put it to other use once baby is out of diapers We have not yet had to wash the liner but it appears to be well made and I have no fears of it falling apart although I am going to throw it in a laundry bag and use the delicate cycle 
5 0 white willow baby organizer with sage liner I got this for a baby gift and filled it with bath items I thought it looked great and would be useful to use 
5 0 Great Baby tub Love the Net I have used this baby tub since my daughters belly button fell off The net is very easy to use and it is very easy while washing the baby I only quit using the net when my daughter started to roll Now se sits up and has plenty of room to splash I also like the elevated seat so that way she is not slipping and sliding all over the tub My daughter also loves the toys that come with it 
5 0 Like this tub best When my third child was born we got this tub It has been the best yet for us From infant stage to now 6 months old my daughter has fit snugly As an infant the sling is perfect because you can t immerse the baby while the stump is still attached We used the tub on the counter by the bathroom sink which worked very well while she was in the hammock stage Once her stump fell off and she was able to control her head well we lowered the bottom half of the hammock into the tub and let baby s bottom rest in the nook that is created between the hump and the top part of the tub A perfect angle for baby to rest comfortably while getting a bath This is the position in which we currently use our tub Now however we bathe her in the Aquarium tub instide the bathtub so we don t have to worry about where the water lands Finally once baby is old enough to sit without support we ll remove the sling altogether and let her sit in the wide end of the tub to play during bath time No doubt our daughter will enjoy this final transition in the short weeks ahead 
5 0 Love this chair I love this chair and so does my 5 month old I love that it reclines 3 different postions and the best feature is it slides up and down to meet my level needs Feeding him from any height is easy 
4 0 Aquarium Healthy Care High Chair Great product Son enjoys being in the chair He especially likes the toys that attach to the side of the tray Only thing I don t like is it is difficult to clean in the creases of the seat cushion 
5 0 The best high chair I love this high chair and so does my daughter It has many toys for her to play with while she is waiting For her food The chair also folds compactly for storage It has a great bar in the back to hang all of her bibs and towels It has a height adjustment that is great I adjust the height to fit right under our dinner table so she can sit with us at dinner It also converts to a booster chair so she can still use it as she gets older I love the chair pad the cushion is so comfortable and it a beautiful fabric but it wipes off clean Which is great for moms since we hate a mess It is very sturdy and safe I also like the five point harness system My daughter is like hodini she can get out of the three point harness and since i have her in the five point harness she is locked in safe I highly recommend this product to new and old moms I love it 
4 0 A few problems but otherwise fine This is a nice chair except for the brakes They lock so easily that if you just barely brush by them with your foot they lock It seems that all you have to do is look at them and they lock Since we are constantly moving the chair to us or back to the wall etc this is a real problem because you have to unlock them esp if more than one of the four is locked in order to move the chair easily As baby gets heavier and heavier and becomes a toddler this is even harder The pleats at the bottom of the seat pad are probably unnecessary and definately hard to get the crumbs out of If it weren t for the brakes I would give it 5 stars The toy aquarium is nice except that they could make the large push pads which make the fish move around in the water easier for little ones to push 
5 0 Great buy We bought this highchair for our 7 month old daughter last weekend She absolutely loves it Love the piece in the middle of the seat that prevents baby from sliding down The safety straps are extremely easy to use clean up is a snap Our daughter loves the toys it comes with is thrilled to be sitting at the table with the rest of the family Would definitely recommend this highchair 
4 0 Almost perfect Our son loves the toy The buttons were hard for him to push initially But at 10 months he was able to push the buttons to make the sounds He loves it both on and off the chair Our only complaint is the wheel locks lock too easily They flip down with barely a touch which can be annoying when you want to wheel the chair around alot like we do in a small kitchen 
5 0 Great Toy My twins love these blocks They received them as a gift at about 3 months old At first they enjoyed just touching them each side of the blocks have a different texture Now that they are older 7 months these blocks are one of their favortite toys They can easily hold them shake them and throw them 
5 0 Perfect for little hands My son loves these blocks We introduced them to him around 3 months He loves the colors and is now starting to pet the different textures on the cubes These are great toys even for teething My son loves to chew on the little bumbs His favorite cube would have to be the duck He talks and squeals everytime the duck quacks These cubes will also come in handy later when he is learning his colors and letters We love Baby Einstein 
5 0 My son loves these I bought these blocks when my son was a month old he is now almost 7 months old and he loves them The blocks are designed in bright and attractive colours that easily catch your baby s eye When baby starts to pick up and play they will discover that each block has different textures and fabrics to help develop baby s touch and they also have a unique feature too Red and Blue are rattles Yellow s duck quacks and behind the sun is a tiny mirror and Green s frog vibrates when you pull his leg These blocks by Baby Einstein are a great buy at a 10 value they will keep your baby entertained and happy 
4 0 good product but quite big for small hands great attractive colors to the baby but quite too big and frustrating a 5 6 month old who s just starting to learn to grasp with one hand and just learning to navigate his opposable hands 
4 0 Fun My mother in law bought these for my daughter At first I was skeptical about how entertaining they would be but my daughter took to them right away In the beginning she would just chew on them and smile at the quacking duck noise but now she interacts more and seems to love feeling all the different textures She also loves to knock them down when I stack them up They won t entertain her for hours but she s always thrilled to see them when I break them out for the first time that day 
4 0 Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity blocks My som is 10 months old and loves these blocks Some make noises The yellow has a picture of a duck on it and makes a quacking sound The green one has a picture of a frog and you pull the tail and it vibrates and my son loves that There are also different textures on each block and my son really likes playing with them 
4 0 great bag This bag is great to keep just the necessities and it will hold all your stuff water wallet cell phone keys plus your babies The material is crunchy and noisy but does not make noise while walking only when reaching in and getting something 
5 0 Best value for money in a small kitchen toy My 20 month old loved this when I bought it for her and still plays with it daily now 5 months later I especially love the fact that it comes in a box so that all of the bits and pieces can be tidied away after play time in one central place and there s no danger that anything gets lost Definitely a must if your in the market for pretend kitchen play 
4 0 Great Cabana for about 2 days Sadly I too found the Kwik Cabana III to be a terrific item the first time I set it up inside our house of course When we actually took it to the beach and tried to open it up under real world conditions Jersey shore in early September and not particularly windy one of the four support rods snapped at the top junction We now own a 100 collection of poles and fabric but not a cabana It s too bad because it s really a great design and so lightweight Hopefully the manufacturer will design a stronger version which I d buy again 
4 0 Not so easy to pop up This tent was not as easy to pop up as the manufacturer claimed We fussed with it a while before actually figuring out how to do it No intructions came with the tent The second time we tried to open it one of the spines broke and now the tent is useless For 100 it shouldn t have broken that easily When we had it up the first and only time however it was great Our nine month old son loved it I sat in the center of the tent while he crawled laps around me chasing some little plastic balls He liked hearing the crinkling of the tent fabric as he moved across it The tent does need to be pegged in any kind of wind but this is easy to do Another reviewer said the tent was hot but we re in Hawaii where there s always at least a breeze and it was fine There is also a slit in the one wall of the tent which allows the wind to pass through I m going to try and contact the manufacturer about the lack of instructions and the relative fragility of the tent s parts If I am satisfied with their response I will order the tent again It really was great once it was set up However I will be more careful when opening it and will try and find a non windy place to do it 
5 0 Perfect blanket I got this blanket to accompany the toddler set for my daughter s 3rd birthday While the toddler bedding set isn t the highest quality in the world this blanket is ultra soft and my daughter loves it 
5 0 Great blanket This blanket is soooooo soft and warm and fuzzy My 2 yr old got it for her birthday and she loves it I love to wrap her up in it and cuddle with her Its our favorite blanket Not real big but a nice big size for a toddler If you are looking for a Dora blanket this is a very good choice I like it better than fleece Its kind of fuzzy and almost silky feeling 
5 0 LOVE it We just got this swing for our 3 1 2 month old daughter about 3 weeks ago Can I tell you she LOVES it She just lays back and watches the lights and the butterflies pass by I LOVE the fact that it plugs in I was getting it out of the box and thought OH NO I don t have batteries Then while I was putting it together I saw that it plugged in WOOOHOOOO As you can see I put it together myself it was that easy I was SOOOOO Excited when I saw it here on Amazon for 114 SHIPPED I had waited a while to get one because I REALLY wanted this one I just couldn t pay 159 for it so I JUMPED on it when I found it at this price BUT it would be worth the extra we LOVE it that much Rache 
5 0 We all love this swing I looked at this swing alot before buying and loved that it was pink and the light but hated spending that much on a swing We had the jungle swing but she wouldnt sit in it she didnt like anything so I said I was going to try this I didnt care how much it cost if she would sit in it Of course soon as i got it I put it together couldnt wait for my husband easy to do and she loves it she will just coo and laugh I love this swing and so does she I would reccomend this to anyone looking at it 
4 0 No complaints yet We ve been using this for three weeks now and don t have a single complaint yet We love the fact that it s a plug in too Our little girl is mesmerized by the mobile and the music is almost hypnotizing and surprisingly good quality We don t use the tray or restraints so we can swaddle her before putting her down and she s usually fast asleep within minutes Once she starts interacting with toys we ll use the activity tray and I m sure she ll enjoy that as well The only downside is that the swing motor does make noise but the sound is relatively minimal and can be easily tuned out I would have rated it as 5 stars but the color is not optimal we re not huge fans of pink and would have rather chosen the blue swing with stars if it weren t 40 more 
5 0 Absolutely love it This was given as a gift and the mom is ecstatic with it It has light purple butterfly strobe lights that dance on the walls and ceiling when the the lights are off The music choices are very soothing This is a favorite I have purchased a second one as a baby gift The fact that it can be plugged in makes it very convenient to use 
5 0 Awesome money saver I ordered a baby swing from Amazon that cost me 114 00 total and all the other stores carried it for 159 00 plus shipping and tax We were so impressed with how fast the item came and in perfect condition The only way you could get it from other stores was on line also so I figured I saved about a little over 60 00 Thank you Amazon for making our present to our first grand daughter a pleasant one 
5 0 EXCELLENT PRODUCT VERY HAPPY Beautiful swing My baby absolutely loves it There are so many options to choose from like the way she swings the lights on butterflies moving songs that are played I can say that she is comfortable enough to take naps in it Very strong and sturdy Swing is deep enough where baby won t fall out Once again beautiful product that I love and my baby loves Thanks Amazon 
5 0 You must add this to your baby registry I got the Safe Bather over a year ago with my first son and am due with my second son and will be getting another for him I used it in the sink when my son was an infant and then moved it into the tub as he grew He NEVER cried when I bathed him and seemed very comfortable It holds in the warm water too As he got older he sat on it and I would just lay him down to wash his lower half I never had any problems with it or any smell issues It machined washed and tumbled dried easily After each use I would ring out as much water as I could and just hang it up on the curtain rod and let it drip dry I would recommend it to anyone 
5 0 Stroller I love this stroller It came and it was exactely what I wanted Amazon got it here very quickly as promised I am very satisfied with my purchase 
4 0 Great umbrella stroller I love this stroller First of all it comes in fun non gender specific colors unlike so many baby items Second it is extremely lightweight and easy to unfold one handed even while holding a baby Third the proportions of the stroller are perfect My husband and I test drove many umbrella strollers and found that we usually kicked the wheels he is 6 feet tall while I am 5 6 but we don t with the Maclaren Also the handles are tall enough that he is not hunched over pushing the stroller There are a lot of other great features too There is a carry strap that is great for transporting the stroller The mesh seat keeps baby cool in the summer and we purchased the Volo accessory pack which has a solid padded seat liner which we use in the winter to keep baby warm I do recommend getting the accessory pack which also has a rain cover and carry bag for the stroller The basket under the seat in on the small side forget about fitting a diaper bag in there but I don t mind carrying the diaper bag because the stroller is so lightweight and manuverable My only other issue is that the sun canopy does not tilt very far forward Overall we are very satisfied with the Maclaren Volo 
5 0 Maclaren Stroller The Maclaren Umbrella Stroller is the best around It s very lightweight and easy to manuver It s worth the price and I would highly recommend this stroller for every mom with a child over 1 year old The only drawback is that the basket under the seat can only hold up to 5 lbs This stroller is easy to open and close and fits nicely in the trunk of your car 
5 0 AWESOME Goregous Stroller We had those cheapo umbrella strollers but our 2 1 2 year old was to tall for it and it wasnt wide enough she looked very squished This came in the mail today and its perfect Light weight tall handles with light padding nice break system beautiful colors materials our toddler is not squished she has plenty of room shes 35lbs 37 tall I dont feel hunched when I walk with it great place for a storage pouch wide and long canopy Its just perfect well worth the Im buying another for our new son for when hes old enough Great deal Buy one Im very happy 
5 0 Great Stroller This stroller is wonderful I initially bought it strictly for travel but love its ease of use so much that it is used daily Pros Lightweight great carrying strap easily folds takes up very little space in your trunk and the turquoise is a great unisex color Cons once it is folded you can not lean it up against something without it falling With the carrying strap this is not a big deal This is a very minor issue that does not keep me from recommending this stroller to all my friends and family 
5 0 Besat stroller for town and country This is an excellent lightweight stroller and is the one we use most often We have a more expensive larger safer stroller with more features but we have found we never use it and always use this one Collapsing the stroller to pop into the car is a breeze and there is an adequate shoulder strap for you to carry the stroller when you are doing portage over rough ground We take the stroller everywhere We ve used it on well groomed trails for hiking museums restaurants we ve even used it at the beach and we ve used it on the Paris Metro This is a great stroller for train and subway travel The wheels have a lock feature which allows them to rotate or swivel and the rear wheels have a brake mechanism which is a little awkward to release but I find that comforting rather than frustrating I want solid brakes There is a small basket in the back of the stroller for a baby bag purse and a few groceries so this again is an excellent stroller for when you are just running out for a few things or going on a small picnic If I was an apartment dweller in the city this is the stroller I d get The only bad feature this is not a stroller you can run with Don t even try The harness is excellent but takes time to adjust it correctly so that it is not too snug nor too loose This is a super lightweight stroller but is a quality product with excellent engineering and design It is not like those flimsy twenty dollar throwaways and just has the MacLaren name on it this is the real deal We have used it for two kids still works like new We should get sales rep compensation because no one really had these in Paris and all our friends saw ours and got one too 
5 0 A perfect potty training system when you buy two While my 4 yr old had been potty trained since she was about 2 1 2 she wasn t making it thru the night so we used Pull Up every night Shortly after she turned 4 she started waking up with dry pull ups We gave it a few weeks to make sure it wasn t a fluke then invested in two of these pads The tuck in feature on both sides is great I find that it does stay in place even after a nights sleep She finds it comfortable as she s never complained about it of course Princess sheets accomanied this new pad to encourage acceptance and we made a HUGE deal about her giving up Pull Ups sleeping in regular underwear The best part about this design is that if there is an accident you just whip it off and any other top sheet that might have gotten wet and tuck in a dry one No changing the fitted sheet in the middle of the night For us if the top sheet or blanket gets wet I ve got a second comforter blanket in her closet to quickly throw over her of course pajama changing can t be avoided That helps get everyone back to sleep as fast as possible I ve washed them a number of times they come out of the dryer in the same shape every time follow washing instructions The size is also generous I was worried that she might move off the pad during the night but with proper placement to where she normally sleeps most of the night we ve never had a problem It says it absorbs 6 cups while we haven t tested that I ve never found the pad dripping so all the urine was securely soaked in We haven t found a down side to these pads Even the price isn t bad I did some price comparison and maybe you ll find them a few bucks less but not by much And if I may add in a bit of my own potty training 2 cents my husband wanted her to give up pull ups much earlier but I was in no mood to change sheets or these pads every night I ve read that most toddlers bladders aren t large enough to make it thru the night anyway so I was just as happy to let it happen naturally In that way everyone was happy well I was and you know what they say about Mamma being happy everyone s happy Thus I highly recommend this pad to anyone going down the no more Pull Ups Road I am sure it would be just as useful for any older child and parents dealing with bed wetting problem 
5 0 Love it Great for vacation visits to Grandma s or just to have around in case a friend or cousin drops by Inexpensive and very functional 
5 0 Great Chair My son has been using this seat since he was able to sit unassisted The chair is very easy to assemble and disassemble It is also dishwasher safe which is helpful for those really messy situations The removable tray is great for getting the mess away from him so I can clean him up without him getting messy again He is now almost 20 months old and we still use it now as a booster He is tall for his age but it still fits him well with plenty of room to grow As for the complaints about it not fitting larger babies I don t really know My son is very slender but there is quite of bit of breathing room for him We make frequent trips to grandma s house and to friends houses and this seat is very travel friendly All in all this is a great product at a great price 
4 0 Adequately designed room for improvement The basic idea is great and the ease of assembly is nice no tools needed We have used it with all the grandchildren 6 and one nephew I think it needs some design improvements 1 the straps which are used to hold it to a chair would be better if there were a strap which went from front to back not just around the back of the seat One of the grandkids seems unable to sit still and I keep expecting him to tip over the chair because it tends to slide sideways in the front 2 the tray is designed for a slim child On one side the tray fits a finger like protusion into a hole On the other side there are 2 places to attach the tray in slots Only when the tray is in the innermost position is it aligned directly in front of the child and there isn t a great deal of tummy room If you move the tray to the outer position available on one side only the tray is cocked at an angle and it still probably wouldn t accomodate a child with a larger stomach 3 the belts to hold the child need to be longer Fortunately for us all the grandkids and nephew are slim At least so far 
5 0 Great space saver My son is 13 months old and 25 pounds One mother wrote that her 10 month old 24 pound baby could not fit in it but my son fits into it fine with room to grow and he is even considered a amp quot big baby amp quot I think that people need to take into consideration the height and weight proportion when buying the product Every child is different with different weight and height which means different shapes Instead of my huge high chair in the kitchen I now have a small booster that stays in one of the kitchen table seats and slides right under the table w the chair when my son is not in it It is a great space saver 
5 0 a must for families on the go I recently purchased this seat for my 1 year old daughter and used it last week at the beach The chair easily and securely fit on the chair The tray stayed attached unlike other models I had tried My daughter enjoyed many meals in her new seat Cleaning it was a breeze as was packing it for travel This is a great seat at a great price 
4 0 Playtime away from home This was purchased as a gift for our daughter but too big to be shipped to us overseas So it remained at my mothers house until we came to visit Ever since we put it together which was very easy she has played with it everday She likes it so much that we are placing it in our suitcases to take back overseas with us Easy to disassemble as well so we took it with us to visit the in laws in North Carolina which gave her plenty to do It also served as a feeding chair while we were visiting 
4 0 Item good for children with neuro problems like Cerebral Palsy My 9 month old baby has mild CP We bought this seat for her when she was younger but she is just now able to use it She loves it It has worked well to help her with her balance her muscle control and provides a safe environment for her to play It is limited with the number of activities Our only complaint is that we have to check the screws on the bottom of the bouncy foot rest because they often fall out But we just check it periodically and it hasn t been a problem I have a few pictures of Hope in her seat in the customer photo section for this seat 
4 0 Practical compact and fun I bought the Bounce Bounce Baby Activity Zone not only because of the price but the fact that it is not as big and round as others It is perfect for our apartment with not a lot of space My 6 month old loves it she bounces in it and chews on all the toys She loves to spin the ball around she moves the see saw animals up and down as it makes a wonderful clicky noise she gets a kick out of not loud The bar going across is pretty close to her head but she doesn t hit her head on it She chews on the zebra connected to the mirror and spins the caterpillar heads around it s really very nice while not being so busy and bulky when unneccesary like others 
5 0 Great buy for the price My daughter loves it I got it for her at 4 months Like the other users I just put a blanket around her until she balanced better She likes the sounds it makes when she bounces on it its not too bouncey though so it helped her learn how to stand and built up those leg muscles She loves turning around in the rotating seat and can get the ball going really fast She likes the mirror because she can reach it to adjust it and chew on the zebra if she wants She is fascinated with the seesaw toy that clicks as she moves it from side to side She will spend hours in this toy The piano is a little hard to reach but at 6 months she can hit it easily now 
5 0 A must for a busy mother I am very busy in the evening cleaning cooking homework laundry etc I can place my daughter in her activity zone wherever I am and she will play and watch me without fussing This toy is a life saver I would be lost without it 
5 0 Great product I did not bathe my infant in the sink I put her in this and put her in the tub with a little water This bather is soft and dries quickly I also washed it in the washing machine and it didn t shrink I would highly recommend this product for an infant 
5 0 Most comfortable natural contour dries quickly lightweight I have tried 2 different plastic bathtubs The first one was sturdy and spacious but it has a bump that was very uncomfortable around my baby s waistline The other one has a fabric sling on top of the plastic bathtub It provided good support but my baby felt wobbly Both bathtubs prove to be unsatisfactory I use this bath form in my shower cubicle on the floor with a long flexible shower head My baby does not fuss in it as she feels secured It dries very quickly Great product with a reasonable price 
5 0 SaferBather is Sensational The SaferBather is soft and easy to clean It dries easily and can be stored when not in use I love it the baby loves it and that is what sells this product 
5 0 Great for Special Needs Kids Too Although we didn t buy this through Amazon this product is terrific Our son has special needs CP and has been using this for 2 years We re actually getting ready to replace it as the first one is finally wearing out and we have another baby on the way It dries really fast and the included hook keeps it out of the way on the shower head Can t say enough how great this item has been 
5 0 All that s needed I got this as a shower gift although it wasn t on my registry I had no idea how perfect it would be 
5 0 Excelente Este producto es tanto mejor que las ba�eritas porque te da m�s flexibilidad Lo comenc� a usar cuando mi beb� ten�a unos cuatro meses y la ba�erita comenz� a ser inc�moda ya que no ten�a un buen espacio donde ubicarla El Safer Bather se coloca en la ba�era no se resbala y el beb� queda muy c�modo Mi beb� tiene ahora 10 meses y medio y le gusta sentarse para jugar mientras lo ba�o y a�n as� resulta fabuloso Adem�s se puede lavar en la lavadora y seca bastante r�pido A�n las veces que no lo he lavado enseguida no ha olido mal Creo que es un producto excelente 
5 0 safer bather I used this product with my 1st baby and loved it Now with my twins I definately had to have another It s much easier to handle the babies on the safer bather than the regular baby tubs 
5 0 Wish I had this for my first baby I used this on my bathroom counter for sponge baths the first week Now I put it in the bathtub and fill the water up to the edge The safer bather warms right up My baby never cries when he gets a bath When I am finished I simply wring the safer bather out and hang it up Couldn t be easier 
5 0 Bath time fun I love this bath tub We have been using it from the time our baby was just one week old for sponge baths He is now 2 months old and he loves bath time This product is great It is very soft and it seems comfortable I wish I had one for my baths Our baby loves bath time The pillow stays warm with the bath water Just be sure to hang it to dry after bath time to avoid a chilly pillow at the next bath It dries quickly and is easy to care for Love it 
5 0 Great item for babies with reflux This item was a must for our son who has had acid reflux from 6 weeks on Yes a baby will slide down eventually as they start to move and kick but it was perfect for putting him down at night after nursing By the time he would slide down hours had passed and he was due for another feeding Our son 4 months old 13 5 lbs and 25 inches long still uses it every night Even if he eventually moves down it doesn t matter He LOVES the memory foam and it is so comfortable for him to sleep in ALSO our pediatrician took note because he was impresed with hiw it is so good for preventing flattening in the back of the head It distributes the weight better Great for a baby who hates tummy time 
4 0 love it My son was born 13 wks premature When he finally came home from the hospital I was very concerned about his sleep position I got the Inclined to sleep as part of my baby shower and I love it and so does my preemie baby It is really soft and the velcro sides are adjustable 
5 0 Great fit Kids sleep well Lasts years We chose this mattress because of its firmness not too hard or too soft and for its vinyl cover We went with a higher priced option but not over the top expensive To be perfectly honest we didn t know what else to look for in a crib mattress I mean how do you really test one Well our twins slept well together on one until they had to be separated into two cribs where they also slept very well They are about 3 weeks shy of 3 years old and are still sleeping on the mattress in their toddler beds We found that they fit the crib very well no dangerous gaps held up to changing and normal use The mattresses both still look and feel new By the way the kids are both average sized We are getting ready to buy another for our third child I definitely recommend this mattress 
4 0 My Toddler loves it We recently bought this mattress a little over 2 weeks and it s great for the toddler bed It said that with time and movement from baby the corner edges will spread to fit the bed frame better It fits fine right now I would not buy this mattress for a baby because I think it is too soft but for my toddler who loves to sleep our soft bed and loves pillows this is perfect 
5 0 Baby Deserves the BEST I absolutely love this matress I purchased a high end crib from USA Baby and they tried to to convience me to purchase these ridiculously priced matresses I decided to get the best quality matress offered from Babies R Us This matress is much better than anything they are offering for over 150 dollars The delivery was quick and easy I LOVE AMAZON BABIESRUS and I LOVE THIS MATRESS Absolutely perfect 
5 0 I absolutely LOVE this monitor I bought this monitor to replace my Sound and Lights monitor because it was picking up the neighbor s house instead of mine The 10 channels on this monitor make sure that I don t have that problem anymore The best part about this monitor is that it actually does work outside like it s supposed to Our old sound and lights was supposed to but wouldn t even work if you just stepped out onto the porch This private connection monitor I can take all the way down to the mail box or my husband can set it up in the garage while he s doing projects and the reception is great 
5 0 great one since my baby was born i changed 3 monitors i used to hear a lot if interruptions and sometimes the neighbours phone conversations this fisherprice monitor is great u can chose any channel and no interruptions heard go for it thanks for amazon as well Xeen 
5 0 Excellent I bought this thing for my new nephew and I m satisfied his parents told me That was the best gift they received I recommend it excellent product 
5 0 Love Em Finally a product from Fisher Price that is worth the money These are the second set of Fisher Price monitors we have purchased and are loving them unlike the first set We especially love having 10 different channels to select from reception display battery display rechargable batteries low battery alarm terminal reciever disconnection alarm and most of all clear sound and NO static We struggled for months with another model of monitors from Fisher Price and ultimately ended up purchasing these upon recommendation from family We are glad to ditch the other ones and are completely happy with these 
5 0 Satisfied buyer After reading all the other reviews posted I was a little apprehensive about buying this monitor However there was such a good deal on the price that I decided to take my chances and purchase it any way To start with I was surprised at how easy it was to set it up and even more pleasantly surprised with how clear the sound is it s as if the baby is right there beside me I really had to wonder if we are all talking about the same monitor I have absolutely no complaints It was so clear I could make out the song in the vehicle driving by on the road I hear even more than I really need to ha ha I would suggest that you just make sure no other appliance in the house is running on 2 4GHz and you shouldn t have a problem Hope this helps I have no complaints 
4 0 Toddler tumbles not This is a good looking functional gate that the toddlers cannot open but most of us adults can open with one hand I had to show a couple of guests how to do it without damaging it We had trouble with the delivery only because UPS left it at the entryway of the wrong house the one next to us that was empty and up for sale Assembly was a little difficult because the instructions were all pictures with very few words If it is being installed between two walls that have no molding obstructions it s fine However in my case I have the high 6 inch baseboard and I have wainscotting with a chair rail These moldings created uneven surfaces and I could not install the gate without making wooden spacer blocks that I had to paint white to match the gate It took me five hours to get it done and I m handy although a bit of a perfectionist Anyhow it looks and works great and we ve gotten compliments about it I thought it was a bit expensive but I could not find anything else that looked good as it is installed at the top of the stairs leading into our formal dining room Despite the work to install it and the high price it was worth it to me 
5 0 Safety gate is perfect for my dogs After trying four other models of safety gate I am happy to have finally found the one that works for me I use this gate for my dogs but it would be equally effective for a baby It is sturdy easy to operate good looking and as unobtrusive as a gate can be This gate is not pressure mounted It needs to be screwed into the wall on both sides However I have learned the hard way that the pressure mounted gates do a lot of damage to walls they are more difficult to operate and they are bulky If the need for a gate is going to be relatively long term I now believe that it is easier to screw it in and worry about patching the wall when the time comes I ve also learned that gates with vertical bars are more likely to be left alone because it s more difficult for pups to get a purchase on them The ones with grids or cross pieces encourage dogs to rattle them and to jump a habit that I work hard to extinguish 
4 0 Very Pleased so Far I too am very pleased with this gate Over the past week I installed one each at the top of our two staircases I strongly recommend following the advice of one of the other reviewers to skip using the template The lower fixture on the hinge side is lowest to the ground so I installed that first then held it in place to mark the spot for the upper hinge After that was on I put the gate on the hinges held it in place and marked the opposite side Worked great and it allowed me to work around the mouldings which would have been difficult with the template The wood screws held great in the one bannister on one staircase On the other staircase I had to put the gates into drywall There was a beam on one side so I had to buy much longer screws to ensure a tight grip The other side was hollow so I bought some good metal anchors so the gate is on very tight All I did was bring the fixtures to the hardware store and found screws and anchors that would fit the holes Cost me about 10 to get enough anchors and screws for four gates Most of the poor reviews sound like there are some hardware issues I take one star away because I think the gate should come with alternate screws and maybe anchors because I think it s a bad assumption that most people are installing into wood I would very much recommend this gate but advise paying close attention to what you re installing into first and make sure you ve got the right hardware 
5 0 Great Gate TIP for keeping it OPEN We love the gate and finally found a piece of hardware to attach to wall to keep it open when you are not trying to keep babies out no more clanging open and closed McMaster Carr 13985A26 Stainless Steel Spring Action Tool Holder Type 302 They come in packs of 5 and can also be used to hang tools or brooms 
5 0 Great Gate We really like this gate We have a very wide stair case and bought the extension to go with this gate make sure you get the right extension IT IS AWESOME My husband is really good with projects so we kind of made it better by putting a different latch then the one that was sent We also put some longer screws so that it would w o a doubt stay in the wall It has been able to withstand our daughter pushing on it hitting it w her walker and our doberman trying to get down our stairs So all in all it is a wonderful gate for children animals 
5 0 Very sturdy and safe Don t skimp it s worth the price When you need to babyproof your house especially for those of us who have stairs don t look any further this is the gate to use We had this installed in our former house at the top and bottom of the stairs Very safe and secure Our sons tried to climb on it but couldn t yanked on it and it wouldn t budge In our new house we have a different type of stairs and no gate would work so we installed these same gates leading to the stairs Our hallway is wider so we just had to purchase the extensions Perfect It prevented our boys from getting up the stairs unsupervised We just had our third baby girl so my husband will be installing these same gates again soon 
5 0 Great Stair Gate I did a lot of research 2 1 2 yrs ago for a gate for the top of our stairs when we had our little girl I now have a 2 1 2 yr old and an 10 mo old they shake it and stand at it but it is secured to the wall and they can t open it We are buying a 2nd one for the bottom of our stairs in our new house 
5 0 Crib Bedding Set High Quality The quality of this set is high as all items are very well made Very pleased with purchase 
5 0 The Best Nursing Bra by Far a MUST HAVE All of Medela products nursing pads lanolin bras pumps etc are definitely the best that I ve tried and I ve tried most all mainstream brands This bra in particular is EXTREMELY comfortable on sore nipples I have sensitive skin and nipples and I found this to be the best there is Bravado was too rough for me as were some other night nursing bras I tried The material is sort of a pantyhose type of material where when you slip it on it feels as though there s nothing there but it protects and supports your sensitive breasts especially important during the first several weeks of first time nursing It s not really a bra that you d want to wear on an evening out as it s more of a sports type bra and it would not support adequately for high impact activities like aerobics etc but it s perfect for around the house or errand running or low impact activities such as yoga As a larger breasted women especially breast feeding I went from a 36DD to a 36G this bra works perfectly for me for support and comfort It s a MUST HAVE for anyone who is breastfeeding 
5 0 medela support bra I love this bra and recommend it to all my friends I had bought mine from the hospital a year ago and wear it all the time I have several maternity bras and this one by far is the most comfortable one I have 
4 0 dad of a toddler and a newborn this product is workin darn good for me ya so what a couple things fall out of place you people act like your kids toy box stays organized there are only 12 pieces in there its not that hard to sort through and put them back in their respective slots and the handle issue grab it by the bottom ur an adult you dont need a lunch pale anymore and the person crying about it not staying securely latched get creative and shove a little tape behind the clip it will stay extended and lock in place good product good price what more can you ask for 
4 0 sunshade Love the Sunshade For the most part works well except if you are running in rather windy conditions then it just flies back and does not cover the kids so well I really use my double jog stroller for jogging and am happy to have the sunshade the kids like it too The only other frustration is if you have a small child who is rather reclined in the stroller and the sun is close to setting you may not get good coverage to keep the sun out of eyes unless you pull the shade completely over the stroller then the older child isn t too happy because he she can t see out 
5 0 Great Cloth Diapers Most like Disposable We have been using these diapers with our daughter for from birth to currently 5 months old They have never leaked the runny breastfed poop Would get soaked if we didn t change her often enough but she may be a supersoaker They are very soft and stretchy never leave red marks on her leg Lots of snaps to fit all sized babies They do take a while to dry We wash ours then do a cycle in the dryer and then hang to finish drying Overall a great diaper Would recommend to anyone wanting to try cloth diapers for the first time 
4 0 Easiest cloth diaper I used them on my son for 6 months They were so wonderfully soft and easy to use once I got the hang of it They are very thick so they take awhile to dry Overall I loved them and I miss using them If only the laundry fairy would visit 
4 0 The very best newborn dipe These diapers hold in newborn poo better than anything After watching lots of friends wash their babies clothes everytime they pooped because it leaked out of a disposable I deciced to got with kissaluvs and just change a diaper instead of a whole outfit We used these for 2 months solid with proraps and bummis super whispher wrap my favorite When have given a four except at 2 months my baby started to HATE having wetness next to her skin at all and it would wake her from her naps could use a fleece liner and solve that problem and they take FOREVER to dry I ll hang them on the line all day and then still have to dry them for 20 mins Overall they are GREAT 
4 0 Great love it This little kit is two in one It has all that you need for grooming and all that you need for baby health The only thing we don t use is the clippers because we like the one that 1st years has with the magnifing glass The comb and brush are perfect and she absolutely LOVES the rattle Surprise I thought it was just kind of an extra but we take it with us everywhere The suction bulb isn t that bad like others have said The case that it comes in is really great It has a pocket for storing other things in the back which we use for nose drops tylenol etc Having it all in one place is great because we can easily grab it and go if we are going to grandma s I m sure we ll be using this into her toddler years 
5 0 Great Products all in one place This is a great set to have you have everything that you need in one handy sturdy caring case This product can go anywhere with you or sit perfect in the nursery Has been a wonderful help and will continue to be a wonderful help Best baby shower gift that we got 
5 0 Multipurpose Safety Device When we had our kids this mirror was really great for giving the rear facing child seat occupant that would be our boys a view of the driver and the driver a view of their faces Soon enough they outgrew the seating layout and the mirror got stowed in the door pocket It was great for the kids and us and we really got a lot of use out of it But wait we weren t done with it yet When I got my Jeep I happened to come across the little mirror again and decided to try it for a blind spot mirror I never liked those little circular ones that go on the side mirrors because they take up too much room and they re so small they aren t really very useful Instead I stuck this mirror up on the left corner of my windshield where the only thing it blocked is low flying aircraft And it provides a rear view that covers my blind spot perfectly and is large enough to actually see what s going on The added bonus is that because it s inside it never gets wet icy or fogged up It s been on my windshield ever since The kids are 7 and 9 now so that little mirror is almost a decade old and it still sticks to the window and has survived several bumps and never broke Not bad for a few bucks 
5 0 Great little chair I LOVE this potty My 16 month old daughter sits on it for a long time before wanting off it seams comfortable Her little feet touch the ground so she feels stable I would recommend this chair 
5 0 Buy this potty I purchased two big boy potty books that arrived a few days before this potty did We had a different potty that did not work well for boys at all Once this potty got here he has not had one accident He just turned two yesterday and he loves his potty He gets excited every time he goes and claps for himself proclaiming that he is a big boy I would highly recommend this potty Don t keep searching buy this one I threw his other potty right in the garbage 
4 0 DID THE TRICK I DECIDED TO POTTY TRAIN MY SON USING JUST A POTTY TOPPER AND A STOOL HE REALLY LOVES TO DO THINGS ALL BY HIMSELF JUST LIKE MOMMY AND DADDY SO I FIGURED THAT WOULD WORK BEST FOR HIM NO MATTER WHAT I DID HE CONTINUED TO HAVE ACCIDENT AFTER ACCIDENT WE WOULD SIT IN THE BATHROOM FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND HE WOULD ALWAYS PEE AFTER I TOOK HIM OFF THE POTTY I DECIDED THAT GETTING HIM HIS OWN POTTY SEAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO SIT ON THE POTTY FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME INFRONT OF THE TV OR IN THE LIVING ROOM WITH THE FAMILY OR IN HIS ROOM I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE JUST THE THING TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND SO I WENT ON THE INTERNET TO PICK ONE OUT I PICKED THE BABYBJORN POTTY CHAIR BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLICITY OF THE DESIGN EASY CLEAN UP AND THE DEFLECTOR MOST SEATS HAVE VERY SMALL DEFLECTORS OR NONE AT ALL SOME HAVE DEFLECTORS THAT DON T STAY PUT I ALSO LIKED THAT IS WAS DESIGNED TO STAY ON THE FLOOR AND NOT SLIP SLIDE OR GET STUCK TO THE CHILD THE DAY THIS ARRIVED MY SON HAD HAD THREE CONSECUTIVE ACCIDENTS TO SPITE THAT FACT THAT WE HAD SPEND MOST OF THE DAY IN THE BATHROOM I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GIVE UP AND PUT HIM BACK IN PULL UPS WHEN IT FINALLY ARRIVED HE WAS SCARED AT FIRST BUT I TOLD HIM THAT THIS WAS HIS VERY OWN NEW POTTY CHAIR AND THE SECOND HE SAT DOWN HE PEED IN IT I LET HIM TAKE THE POT TO THE BIG POTTY AND DUMP IT WITH ME AND THAT WAS IT HE WAS HOOKED I DIDN T EVEN NEED TO ENCOURAGE HIM ANYMORE OR HARASS HIM TO SIT DOWN HE WOULD JUST RUN RIGHT OVER AND PEE AND THEN DECLARE I DID IT MOMMY HELP ME DUMP IT HE ONLY USED THIS POTTY CHAIR FOR ONLY ONE DAY BUT IT WAS DEFINETLY WHAT HE NEEDED TO GET THE IDEA THE VERY NEXT MORNING HE SAID THAT HE WANTED TO USE THE BIG POTTY NOW AND HAS NEVER LOOKED BACK WE USE THE POTTY CHAIR NOW FOR OUTINGS IT IS GREAT EASY TO CLEAN AND EASY TO BRING ALONG IN THE CAR I WOULD HAVE GIVEN 5 STARS IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT THE DEFLECTOR IS JUST A BIT LOW IF MY SON WASN T LEANING FORWARD TO WATCH HIMSELF PEE IT WOULD BE A CLOSE CALL THERE WERE A FEW REVIEWS THAT STATED THAT THEIR CHILD S LEGS WERE BEING SQUISHED BECAUSE OF THE DEFLECTOR BEING SO WIDE MY SON WILL BE 3 IN 2 MONTHS AND HE IS A BIG BOY IN THE TOP 75 PERCENT FOR HEIGHT AND WEIGHT AND HE FIT FINE WITH LOTS OF ROOM TO SPARE THAT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT CONCERNED ME WHEN I READ THE REVIEWS 
5 0 Great potty for boys I recently purchased this potty for my 16 month old son We are not actively training but I wanted to introduce him to it The first night I got it he went pee pee and boo boo in it I screamed and clapped and sang a little song He really likes it He even brought it out of the bathroom and took it into the living room to watch The Wiggles while sitting in it I like the color and how it fits his size He can sit on it and get up all by himself Its very sturdy it doesn t wobble or tip over like some do One reviewer said the sprout was a little short but I haven t had a problem My son tends to look down at himself while he s going so everything is pointing south anyway I love that there are only 2 pieces to this chair Very easy to clean I had a safety 1st chair with the flip top lid and the detachable sprout and I absolutely hated this thing My son would pull of the sprout and walk around the house with it He was too concerned with the lid and turning around on the chair to pull the lid up and down instead of concentrating on trying to go potty With the baby bjorn there are no distractions no music no removable pieces except the bowl which allows him focus on going potty I just really like this potty chair I would highly recommend this chair 
4 0 baby Bjorn potty chair My 16 month old son enjoys sitting on his potty chair It suits the contour of the body but unfortunately for boys the tip of the front guard is a bit shy in height he needs to sit very still to prevent a waterfall from going over the guard I still like this chair its very easy to clean he seems to find it comfortable 
5 0 2 yr old loves it Purchased this potty for my 2 year old daughter She enjoyed just sitting on it It s comfortable and fits her just right She ll even sit and read while she goes Love the pull out bowl feature Great for dumping and cleaning in a jiffy My daughter even feels proud because she can help dump it Easy to use No buttons no whistles no ways for it to fall apart Thrilled we picked a terrific potty the first time We re getting a second one in a different color for her bedroom upstairs since she s starting to use it more often Highly recommended 
5 0 I love this thing This neoprene organizer is the best I didn t know how much stuff I wasn t bringing until I got it Now I am always remembering stuff in the organizer on the stroller in the car It really is handy highly recommende 
5 0 joovy stroller organizer This works well and is a thick quality product I didn t want to pay this much but after getting it so worth the money It stays on well 
5 0 Best gate out there When my son began climbing out of his crib we cringed We live in a townhouse and his room is a 14 x 30 space in our walkout basement One portion of this area is used for our storage and exercise equipment however so we were very nervous that he would pull something down on himself I realize that the manufacturers do not advertise this use but it is possible to link these gates end to end in order to cover a longer stretch The gate cleans up easily and was much less expensive even with needing to purchase two than the other configuration gate options Our son is 19 mos old and 38 tall very tall and he has not gone over the gate he leaves it alone He is able to climb over many of the plastic and metal pressure gates It did take a bit of installation time about an hour for both gates and you will need basic skills to install it One other thing my husband had to go out and buy a drill bit that was the right size for the gate install 7 32 so be prepared This was the best 200 I ve spent on toddler products thus far 
5 0 Good Product does the job Looks nice A bit difficult to install the guide for marking the placement of the screws was slightly off so we couldn t fit the feet on but that s okay because we didn t actually need them Looks nice better than the white barred gates I find it easy to open I can do it one handed once you figure out how to do it EASY TO CLEAN We have the gate up to keep kids in our out of the kitchen When eating lunch they tend to touch the gate with sticky messy hands but wipes off easily with a wet cloth People often comment how nice the gate is I love the neutral color Happy with the purchase 
5 0 Perfect for hard to fit spaces We purchased this gate to fit around the base of an odd shaped staircase for those interested it s the front stairwell of the Wellington plan by Centex Homes it s really popular down here in Centex subdivisions so I thought I d share I was concerned about finding anything that would cover this area because of odd shape but this gate did the job in spades And it was a breeze to install at least compared to some other gates I had it installed within 1 hour As is usual with these kind of things if you are installing into sheetrock be forewarned that the anchors that come with the gate hardware are pooky and you will need to buy some decent ones at the hardware store That s really my only complaint but it s seems to always be the case with any factory provided hardware these days We are very pleased with it and it was worth the money 
5 0 My search for the perfect gate is over Love this one With the mixed reviews this gate has I hesitated in buying it but I wish I hadn t My house is rather small but there is a large open area between the kitchen living room hallway and door to basement this is the highest traffic area in the house Also none of the walls or corners are straight across from each other making it impossible to use a more traditional gate I actually found it easier not to attach this gate to the wall so I can change what part of the house I want my daughter to have access to It is possible for the gate to tip over if my 2 year old daughter is playing with it so I made a rule that she is not allowed to play with the gate It took her about a day to adjust but now she has no problem with it I m not sure about the durability of the gate since I have not had it long but I think the price is well worth my daughter s safety and my peace of mind 
5 0 must have for large areas Easy to install and to essamble We have two of these gates that we use for a large play area for or twins 
5 0 Excellent Product This gate is really adaptable and attractive I use it for puppy safety and containment It works great 
5 0 Love the Gate except for one thing My husband and I bought this gate to keep our precocious and exceptionally curious toddler out of the kitchen It took her about a week to figure out how to open all the safety locks on the cabinets When the gate arrived the box was heavily damaged and the gate was broken We called customer service at Summer and they had a new gate and free return shipping label to us in three days Installation was fairly easy for my husband who is not particularly handy with tools We like the fabric mesh since our daughter can t climb it like other gates The only thing I don t like quite so much is that the latching mechanism is not terribly easy to use You have to line up the gate and then pull slightly on the handle to seat the latch properly Takes a little while to get used to All in all we would definitely recommend this gate to others who have large openings to close off 
5 0 LOVE this baby gate I ordered two of these gates to block off spaces that are about nine feet long and these do the trick These gates allow me to stop my baby from going up a staircase down a staircase or out a door using all three panels which expand up to twelve feet If you don t need all that length you can detach a panel or use it in a v shape to angle it while using all three panels I found it so easy to install just using two brackets on each wall The screws and anchors provided were all I needed to install into drywall Plus they give you a template to make it even easier to line up the screws The gate swings open in either direction and is easy to open for an adult but I don t think my baby will figure it out for years to come I am so happy that I invested in this gate rather than buying multiple gates to block all the stairs 
4 0 My daughter loves it My daughter loves her new doll house She s twelve and has always wanted one Because she is 12 I felt that I needed to buy a large doll house and this one is the perfect size It looks really pretty in her room It was really easy to assemble too I only wish that it came with doll furniture 
4 0 Love this postioner My son is now 2 weeks old and loves to be nuzzeled in between the postioners with his head up against the head piece I have already washed it and no complaints here Washed beautifully The only complaint I do have is that I wish they would have put more velcro on the postioners to keep them in place They are kind of scimpy and often the head piece comes undone 
5 0 Love this Item It gave me the piece of mind that my son is safe It also fits in the bassinet that I purchased The one thing it needs is a little wedge so my son s head is elevated but all in all this is a great piece of item to have It s nice to know that pieces can be moved around so that you can custom fit it to your child s growth spurt 
5 0 Very Useful This has proved to be one of the very useful gifts that we had especially being new parents We started using this right when we brought our daughter home from the hospital This holds the baby whether they are sleeping along with the parents in the crib and on the craddle Highly recommended 
4 0 Great toy for a highchair I bought this gift set to go with the Fisher Price sassy chair for my seven month old grandson The toys hold his attention and are easy to either affix to the tray or use on their own They make it easier to feed him and give us some time while he plays 
5 0 Best Baby Item EVER The Boppy is an absolute MUST HAVE for every new mom Even if you are not going to nurse it helps with supporting the baby during feeding giving you an extra arm For me it was a life saver for those middle of the night feeds I could rest my son on it latch him on recline a bit and many nights we would both fall back asleep I buy this item for everyone I know who is expecting a baby now 
5 0 Perfect for four legged children This is a perfect solution when you have a large space and need to confine pets or small children By adding the extension pieces you can easily expand it s size An added bonus is you don t need to mount the gate to a wall Also it s heavy enough to safely confine and light enough to move 
5 0 A Little Peice of Sanity I have 3 kids and 2 dogs and I am so happy that I purchased this gate I bought it when my 2nd child was born and it has become a consistant item in my house We moved and I was concerned about the different size of the openings There was not a problem It is easy enough for my 5 year old to open but sturdy enough to withstand my 2yr old and 1 yr old I love the gate in regards to pets because it makes having company easy I can keep my dogs in the house and yet they are away from my company With out the gate I would be constantly fighting my toddlers to keep them out of the kitchen trash litter box cabinets Everyone who comes over to visit and has children or pets ask about the gate Even though the price of the gate is kind of high it is something that keeps giving I love my gate even after almost 3 years 
5 0 GREAT PRODUCT DON T BE TURNED OFF BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS REVIEWER What the previous reviewer didn t realize is that there are 2 different packaging options for this item The first option is a pack that contains 1 key and 2 locks for people who want to try it out and the second option is to buy the pack that contains 4 locks but no key for those who already bought the starter kit and happened to like the product So make sure you really read the description of what you re getting if you re buying online This one happens do be the 4 locks with no key so you might want to try the starter kit first I actually rec it because UNFORTUNATELY the lock doesn t work with all situations because of draw designs Then on top of that Kidco also sells the key seperately with no locks for those who have the product love it and happened to misplace or lose their key OR want to purchase an additional incase they ever lose the 1st key I will admit that I think it s pretty lame for a company to try to squeeze every penny out of you especially when it probaby only costs 5 cents to make the darn key and especially when you re dealing with child safety products As far as how well the product works I LOVE IT and wish it had worked out better with all my draw situations It s especially great for those cabinet doors that stand alone and don t have another door next to it where you can just buy one of those wrap around door knob locks that require 2 knobs to be side by side I didn t have as great of luck with my kitchen draws because the draw panel is added on to the actual draw so it isn t flush with where you put the catch I put 5 stars to bring the rating up because the last reviewer only gave one and it s actually a great product I know it will outsmart my baby far beyond any cheaper options out there I installed them with the adhesive tape that comes with it but I plan on reattaching it with the screws also included because I personally feel that the screws will do a better job AND because I love my child more than my freaking cabinet doors for all those worried about messing up your precious wood cabinets I mean give me a break the holes are so small anyway and it s totally concealed only you will know it s there ALSO this locks so tight that little fingers hands can t reach inside small openings which usually occures with the other types of locks and pull stuff out And also there s an option to turn the lock off for in between kids DEFINITELY CONSIDER THIS PRODUCT 
5 0 Great for car rides My floor was becoming a sea of crunched up Goldfish crackers and smooshed raisins Car rides consisted of me with a Tupperware of snacks passing them back to my one year old because given the chance he would dump the whole thing So Snack Traps are a life saver He can still reach in grab a handful and throw if he wants to but mostly they ve helped keep things clean 
5 0 Snack Trap This is the greatest thing ever invented for little kids My son would take an entire handfull of snacks fruit if he was able These snack traps control the amount he can take out at a time I also appreciate that this vendor shipped to an APO 
5 0 LOVE THESE CUPS And glad I could buy a 3 pack If my baby doesn t lose one of these I will 
5 0 MUST HAVE for EVERY Toddler This is the best wish I d invented it No more ziploc bags being wasted no more Cheerios all over the supermarket floor This little cup lets the child reach in with fingers pull out several treats cheerios goldfish etc and munch away without spilling No more mess or crumbs all over the car store house etc I LOVE IT Bought a 3 pack twice I keep one in my diaper bag for road trips My daughter was using it at 1 yr old 
4 0 Good if your kid learns not to take off the lid As others have said the lid is easily removed even by a very young child The first time we used it our son took the lid off and spilled the snacks But after a few times he figured out that if he took the lid off the snacks would spill and stopped taking the lid off We find it very useful for our now 27 month old we started using it probably a year ago It is not perfect but we have not found a substitute 
5 0 Great for bigger babies not for newborns I ordered the piddle pad a week before the birth of my third baby I wanted to put it in his car seat to avoid the poop blow outs caused by breast milk all over his car seat With my other two kids I was always cleaning their car seats when they were first born Here is the only problem I found with the product It doesn t fit into the infant carrier when it is set for a brand new baby It was too big no matter what I did it would not work Not wanted to return a product I was sure would come in handy I moved it to my 20 month old s car seat and it worked and fit great As a matter of fact after two weeks worth of use it finally got a chance to prove itself when it saved my son s car seat from the milk shake treat my husband had given him It absorbed the drink and saved the seat Easy clean up For once I didn t have to disasemble the car seat so I could wash it Great product for bigger babies and toddlers ect But not for newborns 
5 0 No More Messes We got this item as a gift and even before opening the package I thought FINALLY We ve had a few leaks on long raod trips and the PiddlePad is fantastic Now it s just one little easily washable insert to throw in the wash instead of trying to wrestle apart the car seat to take the cover off to wash it And then you have to try and get it all back together again Ever seen a second hand car seat at a consignment store or garage sale Now you know why they re so filthy No one bothers to pull them apart to clen them We can t rave enough about the PiddlePad 
5 0 THE BEST SLING I have used many slings in the past and this sling is by far the best It is easy to use and to learn to use Our baby loves her sling and settles down immediatly after we put her in it I can clean my house walk our dog shop etc and she is nestled safely in her sling My husband also wears this sling and states It is the best baby product we bought Likewise it is lightweight and we live in a very hot climate she doesn t get too hot in this sling I used mine every day for several hours a day and as I write this our daughter is nestled in with me This is a must have item for any new mom or dad 
5 0 Best pouch ever Spend the money it s easier than back packs or slings with rings folds up into a purse can use it anywhere sturdy Don t bother with the knock offs this is the only one I ve found that works Love it 
5 0 must have I love this sling I didn t bother to learn how to use it with my first child but I am so glad I did with the second It is wonderful It was hard to learn because I didn t have anyone to teach me but the website has video instructions which are so easy to follow I learned with a doll I can nurse in it anywhere and he almost always falls asleep as soon as he s in it It helps me have hands free to play with my toddler I think this will become a staple with me and my future babies 
5 0 Reward for Patience Secure Durable and Portable Rail We have had two of these rails for about three years now and are very happy with them They have stood up to plenty of kicks and shoves from an active sleeper The rails can be contracted when we need to transport them On our twin mattress the rails take up about 2 5 inches off each side I must admit that I did not know how to use the rails properly at first and thought they were challenging to remove My husband who read the directions installed them easily and gave me a quick demo on how to adjust them Once I was patient enough to learn how to use them it was quick and easy to manuever them These rails are secure and durable ones that will last through younger siblings as well 
5 0 Best and Super Safe There is no gap for your child to potentially fall into it locks ontop and if you use it right you can easily change your sheets It is the only one to be considered even though it is more expensive 
5 0 Works great bought based on reviews posted Simple enough to set up Just like a previous review indicated you just have to read the directions I could not understand how people had problems with this rail system It took less than 5 minutes to set two of these up Make sure all the parts click in place and are locked It is super strong and locked to the mattress I would recommend this to anyone looking for bed rails 
5 0 Worked for us We like this bed railing and it serves its purpose and more This bed rail is very forgiving considering my daughter always uses it as a bar to climb onto her bed Don t understand how the other reviewer said that it stuck out so far I have to agree with the other reviewer that the railing wasn t probably installed right by the user If you installed it correctly the bed railing should even actually take some of the bed space about 2 or 3 inches 
5 0 easy to use no installation required I read the reviews before purchasing this product which helped me in making the decision I found this product easy to use there s no need for any kind of intallations and it worked great for my daughter s bed I did not find the locking system hard to do at all I would recommend this produc 
5 0 LOVE IT I love this mirror It is big and gives you good clear view of your baby Plus she he had good entertainment 
4 0 really good but could be better This is a great distraction for little ones of any age almost BUT do not lose the remote If it is misplaced falls out of vehicle because a little one heaved it over the side like my guy does with everything there is no way to turn it on without the remote Both the mirror and remote use up batteries pretty quick when you let the child play with it by turning it on and off Other than that its a wonderful sleepy time night time distraction without letting the your child play with the remote At night it lights up in different places on the frame softly while playing music which isn t so loud its going to keep them awake I would buy it again or give it as a gift 
4 0 Great distraction for easily bored baby I originally purchased this as a way to keep an eye on my daughter since she was in the back seat of our van It turned out to be a sanity saving device We live by train tracks and the music and lights help to distract her while we wait I will say though that the cold weather zapped the batteries so maybe re chargeables are in order for this toy My toddler also loves it He uses the remote to turn it on and off which in itself entertains his sister 
5 0 Highly entertaining I bought this for my car shortly after my son was born so I could keep an eye on him I love this mirror it keeps my son very happy when he is tired and often puts him to sleep which is great The music isn t to annoying and the lights are slow enough that they don t bother me while I drive It s also a great price My son is 5 months old now and we still use it all the time I would highly recommend this mirror It has several different ways to attach to the car as well so it works in almost every car 
5 0 Fantastic item highly recommend it for reflux babies I saw this item on a relative s registry and decided to buy one when I was getting ready for our second child I thought it would be a good way for our three year old to admire the new baby without having to hold him all the time It works great for that but even better for keeping our baby asleep He is a spitter and has recently been diagnosed with reflux at just three weeks A recommendation for reflux babies is to allow them to be at an incline after feedings This serves that purpose perfectly It keeps the baby warm and snuggly and helps to stop the spitting up Only word of warning make sure the baby is centered in the cushion if sleeping Our son managed to wriggle over the side a bit 
5 0 Terrific Product We love this pillow My daugter is 2 months old and she naps on it It fits inside her pack and play and she lays on it for a nice long nap It keeps her from rolling over It also fits on the couch in between me and my husband so we can enjoy together 
5 0 I love it This is perfect for a newborn Pros Soft fabric small portable soft filling supports a newborn perfectly Cons Long list of places you can t use it the manufaturer covering is rear to avoid lawsuits 
5 0 Great for Preemies This lounger works great We have a preemie and right now the Boppy is a little too big for our son We just place him in the Newborn Lounger and he is comfy as he can be It is safe place to put him versus putting him on the floor or couch In about a few months he ll start using his Boppy but until then this product has been a lifesaver What a great idea 
4 0 Great Bath Toy I bought this for my daughter when she was 8 months old and time to transition her into the big bathtub I knew it was important for her to enjoy her bath and wanted to provide entertainment for her This is a must have for every parent It has strainers a stringy sponge and a water faucet that you squeeze to have the water flow It is wonderful for her because she loves to figure out how things work 
5 0 So far so good They seem to be keeping the seats clean and in good condition but only time will tell 
5 0 Pack N Play sheets I am so glad that I am a member of Amazon com The pack n play sheets were no where to be found at any store I then decided to check on Amazon com I was so happy that I found the sheets I ordered four sheets they are just the right size too My grandbaby soon to be born will truly enjoy the pack n play when the baby comes to visit Thank you so much for having the sheets for me I also want to say that I received the sheets in one and one half days The delivery was terrific Sincerely C McCadde 
4 0 Pack n Play sheets The sheets fit the pack n play pad well and do not slip off with a squirmy 5 month old 
4 0 These really aren t that bad These were the only sheets that I could find for my Pack N Play and while they are a bit cheap looking I find that they work just fine They are pretty thin and they are not elasticized as the manufacturers claim they are on this site but they function well enough I live in the desert and my baby was born in August so the thin therefore cooler construction of these sheets was a bonus However if you live in a colder place you might want to try to come up with something a little cozier for your baby On the whole though these sheets are fine if you want something to cover the plastic mat of your Pack N Play 
5 0 awesome This is a great product if you have a wiggly child I wish I would have known about this sooner At the grocery store I used to spend more time making my son sit down than shopping and it was very frustrating After purchasing this product it has been less stressful at the store This is a must have The only challenge was connecting it to the cart but once that is accomplised it is worth every second 
5 0 Really worth getting I can count on one hand the baby products that I would rave about but this is one of them I am not overly concerned about germs and my son never really chewed much on shopping cart handles HOWEVER he is a really SQUIRMY We ve had a terrible time getting him to sit forward and stay seated in a shopping cart Which makes grocery shopping precarious He is very quick to stand up and turn around in the cart if we take our eyes off him I looked and looked for a five point harness that I could use with a shopping cart and then stumbled across the Shop n Dine at TJMaxx IT WORKS WONDERS He was so secure and comfortable We never once had to sit him back down turn him around or anything I also had a place for my own drink that was out of his reach the cup holder on front held my fast food super size drink My son never complained about the seat and I wish I had found this months earlier he is 14 months now It s perfect One thing I found was that I was able to use the shopping cart strap in addition to the 5 point harness on this product which in effect made a 7 point harness over the shoulders and between the legs with the product and around the chest with the shopping cart strap Another thing My son usually pulls shoulder straps off but these stayed in place and he never messed with them And even though he was straped in securely he was comfortable and able to play with us point to things play with toys etc He wasn t at all paralyzed or completely immobilized by the straps Both my husband and I were extremely impressed and pleased with the Shop n Dine 
5 0 This is a GREAT baby product This head and body support is great for a newborn Our baby always went sideways in her carseat with a regular head support This one has both a head and body support that are detachable w velcro And now that she s 3 months old we can use just the head support We also used it in her swing with the body support and now without Overall this is a great product and is soft fleece and easily washable I will probably purchase this item as a newborn gift for the next baby in the family as it is that great 
5 0 Like this alot We bought this for our 4 month old and she absolutely loved it The toys are removable which is fantastic becasue I can take them along as teethers if you will and then connect them right back to the bouncer so she can play with them As long as my baby is happy I am happy too This bouncer is a definite hit in our house Buy one go for it 
4 0 Love It My 8 week old loves this bouncer and i like the recline feature alot it inclubes two teething toys which is great 
4 0 Very Nice Bouncer I bought one of these bouncers at Walmart for my daughter She is a very fussy baby who cries WHENEVER she is awake I placed her in the bouncer and she was content for once I sat her in the upright position and she loved looking around and she fell asleep without crying for the first time The music is very cute I always try to shop around for a cheap bouncer This is my second bouncer I have owned Both were the cheapest one I could find 20 This 20 bouncer works just as good as an expensive one Don t burn your money on those 40 70 bouncers This one is a good buy It s blue but my daughter looks so cute in it so I would call it unisex Try one out 
5 0 Super soft Great boppy cover The color goes with practically any decor and it s super smooth and comfy 
5 0 Love it A must have for all parents of infants I disagree with the reviewer that said this was of poor quality It is a slipcover similar to a pillow case do pillow cases completely protect the pillow from drool and other things Of course not This takes the ordinary Boppy pillow and makes it a lot more comfy for mommy or daddy and baby It is so soft and we love it Just throw it in the laundry when dirty and it ll come out like new 
4 0 Good but not the best I had this with my daughter and it was very well made and did help but I still felt like I was bending over to much to feed my baby I gave it 4 stars because it could have been my fault with why it didnt work well for me This time around I am using the best friend the one that wraps around you so you can move and walk A little more practical now that I have a toddler to run after 
5 0 Beautiful slipcover This is a beautiful cover for the boppy pillow So soft and luxurious feeling I used it for several months without a spare and washed it every few days And yet it is still in like new condition Wonderful item now that I am expecting again I am buying another one just like it 
5 0 this boppy cover is perfect I just love the texture of this pink boppy cover It goes great with the Bare Naked Boppy Pillow We ve used this item countless times with our baby and I cannot imagine living without it The cover washes up really nice and it does well to protect the pillow 
4 0 Very Nice We bought this cover not too long ago and we love it Yes we can see the print through from our Boppy but we don t really care since it s nice and soft for our baby It would be nice if it was thicker and covered the print If you re looking for water proof than this isn t the way to go but if you re looking for something that s going to be soft and comfortable for baby I d suggest one of these 
4 0 Simple yet impressive There s nothing fancy or complicated about this pump It does exactly what its supposed to and nothing more Its very easy to use and clean and its quite efficient It is definitely not for full time use as your hand will start to cramp up but for moms who want to pump part time this is perfect I thought the price was fair Its also great that you can fit standard sized bottles onto the pump itself Basically there are no complaints here 
4 0 Great for travel Unlike many of the reviewers I exclusively pump that is my son only gets breast milk but I do not nurse him I have the hospital grade Medela pump which is fantastic I get plenty of milk without nursing and am even able to pump extra to store I bought this pump because I ve run into trouble a couple times when I was away from the house for longer than expected My regular pump has to be plugged in it does not run on batteries so it s hard to carry around I bought this pump because it is easy to throw into the diaper bag in case of 1 engorgement or 2 needing a bottle while I m out Although I m not a fan of handpumping and have not used other manual pumps I ve found this one easy to use Basically it works just like like the hospital grade and I get just as much milk just as quickly with this pump The design is so comfortable that I have even pumped while driving home one day when I got stuck in major rush hour traffic Being able to use it left handed or right handed is a huge plus I give it only four stars because the silicon part on the handle has a tendency to get loose and I lose suction in the middle of pumping Note for Avent bottle users You can buy for about 10 00 a set of adaptors I bought mine at Buy Buy Baby that allow you to attach the wide Avent bottles right to this or any of the other similarly styled Medela pumps 
5 0 good little pump I purchased this pump with my second child after returning my Medela electric pump I think it was a pump in style to its original owner I am staying at home with my child number 2 and only needed something for occasions This pump seems to work great It is obviously quiet and there is no hassle of the tubes electrical outlet etc I did notice however that when used more frequently while trying to teach my 7 month old to take a bottle that it made my nipples soar It could have just been me since I was not used to pumping that much Other than that it is great and I plan to use it for a weekend away next month I was concerned that my hands would get tired but it is really easy to use It is nice to be able to use discretely in the car as well 
5 0 Love it after 2 yrs with Pump in Style I had the original Pump in Style for my first two boys Got rid of at after second baby Thought we were done LOL another story Anyway I bought the Harmony in case I needed to buy a Pump in Style again and could use the same sheild and bottles I ve had it in use for 3 months Pump about 3 times a day Just had surgery yesterday and had to kick up my supply so I had 10 feedings stockpiled in addition to pump and dump for 24 hours straight afterwards I bought two when pregnant because I wasn t sure how they would hold up This little Harmony pump has held up great I have only on in use It s a breeze to clean and assemble It s great in that I m not tied to a machine and can move about the house Highly recommend this little pumper 
5 0 Great for both Full time Part time or stay at home moms This breat pump was a life saver I have used when I was working part time and even during full time and the pump has never failed on me Its easy to use doesn t hurt at all not to mention it was very fast I remember pumping 10 onces in 10 12 minutes The clean up was an absolute breeze and the best part was that I could fit in the pump in my little purse and no one would ever know My daughter was used to Playtex bottles so I used the liners on the playtex one step storage system and attached it to the medela pump This worked like a charm and didn t have to transfer milk from one bottle to another This pump is worth every penny 
5 0 Great manual pump Easy to use and clean I got this pump because I wasn t sure if I would need an electric as a stay at home mom This pump is easy to use and clean The ergonomic pump handle is pretty easy on the hands and wrist I could pump even when I had tendonitis which hurt when I moved my thumb It does not take up much room when disassembled so it ll be great for travelling I m not that thrilled about the soft comfort flange that is provided I prefer the regular plastic Medela flanges that come with their electric pumps I find that I can get as much milk out of this manual pump as I can with the Medela Pump In Style electric in about the same time and this one makes a lot less noise great for middle of the night pumping sessions to ease engorgement without waking my baby and husband up Also just a note to some people having problems getting milk out with the Medelas It may not be the pump itself but the size of the flanges Every woman s breast and nipples are different sizes Initially I was using the standard 24mm flanges suction cup things that go over your breasts It was painful to pump and my milk would not come out even though I was engorged with plenty of milk It would take me 2 hours just to get 2 oz of milk I went to see a lactation consultant who suggested I try the next size up flanges 27mm She got me one to try and it made a world of difference I could immediately pump 2oz in under 5 mins Now I pump daily with my electric to stock up and can get 4 oz from both breasts in under 10 mins estimate since I don t really time it cause it s so fast I use either my electric of my manual depending on my mood whether I need to double pump if I need my hands free then I use the electric or if I m going to pump somewhere besides my bedroom i e living room while watching tv with my husband I am now planning to pump to donate my milk to a milk bank This pump made a world of difference I think Medela makes flanges in 3 different sizes The standard 24mm that comes with all their pumps the 27mm and a 30mm 
5 0 A GREAT product I didn t realise how awful my evenflo electric pump was til I used this one Where the evenflo was painful and annoying to use this little hand held manual pump is easy to use painless because I control how hard and fast it pulls does not sound like a dying cow virtually silent has less parts and does a MUCH better job It feels very similar to my baby s suckling and as a result my milk will let down sometimes 3 times during a single pumping To sum it up It s fast easy and effecient I plan to take it with me in my diaper bag for whenever I need it I highly recommend this product to anyone needing a breast pump 
5 0 Great Potty This is a great potty No place for it to leak at we had the Royal Potty but it leaked very badly But this one is great Plus it is cute 
4 0 First Potty Chair and hopefully our last Son liked it from the beginning Although we haven t had success on it yet it is comfortable enough and roomy enough that he can sit on it for a while to get used to it 
5 0 The best from Baby Bjorn With five young children in our home we have two of these Baby Bjorn potties With constant use and abuse they still look brand new They are easy to clean I have even stuck the bowl portion in the dishwasher and easy to transport My kids LOVE the bright colors which make potty training easier Well worth the money 
5 0 The Best Potty for boys We initially bought a potty chair from a local store Each and every time my son used it I had to take it apart and clean every crack and crevice I read the reviews on this potty and am I glad We ordered it from Amazon and the day it arrived my husband called me to tell me it was the best purchase we had ever made It s simple two piece design make it a breeze to keep clean With the first potty my son would end up going everywhere because the splashguard was not high enough This potty chair is almost oblong in shape and it keeps everything where it should be It it large enough for my avearage size 2 1 2 year old boy This is worth every penny we spent on it 
5 0 Potty Chair This is the only potty chair my 2 year old Grandson will use My daughter had to cart it back and forth to day care once a week Before his visit from KS to MA I purchased this particular one I lined up the new one and 2 other ones I had prior for his sister s potty training and he only used this new one It is easy to clean also It s on Grandma s favorite s list Grandma from MASSACHUSETT 
5 0 Finally a potty that works This is the third potty I ve purchased for my son The first one was made by Parents and it tipped over the first time my son sat on it The second was First Years Elmo 3 in 1 and the cup pinched his behind in 3 places leaving cuts This one is great Although my son was hesitant to go on it at first which I attribute to his experience with the Elmo potty he fits nicely on it The other potties were too narrow from front to back and I had to adjust him several times to get him situtated so that he could use the front guard The seat lifts out as the cup which lends itself to not pinching his bottom and easy clean up It s low enough to the ground that his legs fit too The back and arm supports fit well also It s a solid construction and good buy 
5 0 A Million Thanks As a first time mom of a 13 month old boy these reviews have been so helpful Not only do I know which potty seat works best for other little guys but I also know the ones to run away from Thank you Moms 
5 0 Superyard Wonderful This was truly a needed item in my home I have twin boys and put it off for a while It is a great purchase I have two sets of stairs and this set my mind at ease I also got the extension 
5 0 Wonderful This is the best baby item I have purchased I fit in it also I can sit in the play gate and watch tv while my baby plays He can t get to the tv or anything else and has so much room he does not now he is confined It folds up in just a second and in the closet it goes Also works for puppies kittens and even baby goats 
5 0 Great for dogs My wife and I got this for our new puppies inside the house It works great both inside and out 
4 0 Life saver This gate has been a real life and time saver I bought the extension for it and set it up in about 5 minutes I set up all of my sons toys in it and let him go I don t have to chase him around the house and I can get a lot done knowing where he s at This gate is awesome 
5 0 Next best thing to the swaddle We swaddled our daughter forever it worked miracles for us and she loved it I also was so much more comfortable and at ease knowing she was bundled up nice and warm at night Then she got too old for it and I was so irritated to just leave her in the crib with no blankets or anything Then I saw these and I tried them out and I love them We bought the fleece ones and they keep her so warm She can cuddle in them if she likes and be nice and warm like she used to be in the swaddle She seems to like them The bottom line is that her tummy chest and toes are kept warm in a safe way I highly recommend these The fleece ones are quite warm so if you live in a warmer climate I would recommend the cotton ones 
5 0 AWESOME Sometimes at night it gets chilly and in just a sleeper my little girl s toes would be cold Once I started using these her tootsies were always warm She also started sleeping better through the night too We get to cuddle up with a comforter at night but blankets aren t advised for infants These are better than a blanket anyway 
5 0 Reduce SIDS and Soothes fussy babies a bed time Volvo Babies children are always curious and don t like sleeping much since it reduces their nosy and or get into trouble time Our family love Sleepsacks and we consider them Volvos because of their safety value 1 Reduces the possibility of SIDs not necessary to have a quilt or blankets in the crib with your baby when he she is in a sleepsack 2 Soothes fussy babies my nephews and nieces were always ready for Mr Sandman as soon as they are in their sleepsacks probably because of the cocoon like feeling so similar to their time in their mommy s womb They can roll around once they are older of course and still sleep through the night safely so you can get some sleep too without worrying about potential dangers in the crib Get 3 2 small and 1 either Medium or Large and you should be good to go The newborn size is better suited for preemies The choice for Medium or Large is negotiable because babies grow at different rates 
5 0 SleepSack an infant favorite We loved the sleepsack because it was our daughter s cue early on that it was time for bed and time for some serious sleeping In the middle of her last nightime feeding we would sack her up We attribute the cues of the sleepsack to a great sleeper and one who slept through the night early As she grew we used them until she was a pretty quick crawler For those who believe in the BabyWise series this is very helpful in creating a sleep pattern Warm and cozy too If only sleepsacks came in adult sizes 
5 0 Really great product Love these SleepSacks My son would constantly break out of the swaddle so we tried these when it was getting ridiculous He loved them and slept so much better Now we can t live without them I just put him in a long sleeve onesie and the sleepsack as our house is quite warm He never complains and sleeps through the night Am curious about the quilted ones Could be a perfect mix of the cotton and the fleece which can sometimes be a bit sweaty 
5 0 No More Blankets I love not having to worry about blankets in the crib when I put my son in his sleep sack Middle of the night diaper changes are easy too 
5 0 LOVE THIS ITEM A real must have Had a few of these for my new daughter and just loved them She hated being swaddled and prefered the freedom of something like this Plus I never had to worry about her tangling in blankets when in the sleepsack Also not too awful for late night diaper changes since it zips from the bottom 
5 0 Excellent choice for all parents Excellent product couldn t wait to receive it and it s been a joy to have it ever since 
5 0 Great Item Great item at a good price It works perfectly and doesn t take up too much space even though it can handle plenty of items 
5 0 Awesome Drying Rack This is great to keep the baby things seperate from adult things It organizes the different things the babies use and has a place for everything It will grow with the baby so it is not just for bottles but is great for sippy cups The only thing it lacks is a place for childrens plates but you can stand them up between the sippy cups and that works just fine I love using it and wonder how I did without it 
4 0 Works great for us I wash all of my stuff either in the dishwasher or using a sterilizer My only complaint is that it isn t bigger My son goes through at least 7 8 bottles a day and even though there are spots for 8 bottles there isn t enough room for my other pieces and parts we use Dr Brown bottles If you are a Dr Brown bottle user know that it works great for about 5 bottles I put my tubes in the basket part they stand up just fine 
5 0 I LOVE this stroller I used this stroller for the first time yesterday and I can t say enough good things about it I also have a Graco Quattro and a Macleran Volo and the BOB is definitely the most versatile stroller of the three I can steer it with one hand while handling my dog with the other hand Jogging with the stroller is a breeze as are the basic functions of the stroller I assembled it with no problem and it s very easy to fold and unfold It weighs about the same as the Graco and stores similarly to the Graco My son loved the Graco but I found it hard to handle and I couldn t run with it He hates the Volo b c he can t sit up in it Although the BOB is more similar to the Volo than the Graco as far as the seating position goes my son doesn t seem to mind it I think it supports him well It has plenty of storage and I also purchased the handle bar console The orange color is nice with a brown contrast I live in Minnesota and this thing plows through the snow without any problem I m very happy with this purchase 
5 0 Beautiful Construction My almost two year loves his new bed It was an easier transition from crib to toddler bed than I thought He loves going to bed in his new BIG BOY bed He likes looking at the face of the train bed as he touches the facial features This is one of the best purchases I have made on line thus far 
5 0 thomas the train bed great crib transition bed this bed is better than I hoped for My son at age 16 months decided to revolt against the crib and opt for mommy and daddy s bed instead We were very leery about putting him in a big boy bed at so early an age and this bed seemed to be built the toughest and safest The transition was amazingly better than I could have ever dreamed of My son LOVES this bed and not only started sleeping through the night again but naps in it as well It is totally cute and the design is such that even a tough tosser turner as my son won t fall out unless he wants to Even then it is low enough to the ground so no injury occurs I HIGHLY recommend this bed 
4 0 Cute as a Button Toddler Bed It took one 2 year old supervisor and 3 adults to get this bed put together This bed does not come with a support for the mattress However you can buy a piece of board that has material covering it at Toys R Us for 38 It s worth the money Our son loves the bed It s very sturdy The headboard where you can store books is a little bit shaky but nobody is going to be sitting up there He also loves the area where you can roll cars down Mom likes it too One area the headboard was horrible to put together because the plastic was not molded as well as it could have been The headboard had four areas where you needed to push thru and then push it down to stay intake We ended up using oil from the kitchen to get this accomplished like another reviewer had done 
5 0 2 year old son loves this We just received this today It didn t take me too long to put it together by myself hubby deployed I had to secure my son in his sister s crib and couldn t find the proper screw driver but it can be put together with a common kitchen knife in about 45 minutes The only problem I am having so far is the back keeps wanting to pop out as this is one of the snap in parts My son John was so excited when he saw this and just loved playing in it the rest of the afternoon He went to bed right away as he couldn t wait to get back in here 
5 0 First Bed for my son My husband and I battled between this bed and the nascar bed I won of course and we ended up with this one So far we are very happy with it We bought it for our 22 month old son who loves it He stays in it at nap and bedtime and plays on it during the day My biggest frustration was putting the bed together The very first step took us over two hours plus we ended up having to run back to the store and switch one of the side rails out with the display model because it wasn t fitting together right The second peice didnt fit much better and it even after we got it locked in to place the screw didn t line up After that step asswmbly went really quick It looks darling though and our son loves it which was all we were really hoping for Stephanie Salt lake City Ut 
5 0 Great Big Bed All I can say is the bed is Quality strong and the kids will enjoy it I didnt know the bed will be so big This is worth your bucks The kids actually feel like they are in a train 
4 0 he loves it great bed although it doesn t have a support for the matteress we found that if you get the right one you dont really need it my only problem was the assembly for the head board section could have been engineered a little better and the caps for the screws dont quite fit perfect 20 minutes to put together my son just loves it though if i could just get him to stay in it all night now 
5 0 The Milestone Bed My husband and I purchased the Thomas bed as a transitional bed for our little grandson who will be two on 3 25 He loves all the Thomas trains and now plays with them on the side rails of his bed We purchased Thomas toddler size bedding and all the accessories for the bed and play areas The bed uses a standard crib mattress but will need additional support as our grandson grows If a child is a bed jumper then the extra support will be needed prior to the first jump This bed is sturdy made well even for plastic When Carl goes to bed we tell him that his bed is in Tidmuth Shed and that his Mama Daddy are close by Thanks to Amazon BabiesRus for two years of timely deliveries and excellent products 
5 0 Great Car Seat We love this car seat it is super comfortable However I must say is is a bit large for our car we have a VW passat Our son loves it and falls asleep pretty quickly in it 
5 0 Our personal crash test Both of our children have been in Marathons since they outgrew their infant carriers and we have been extremely happy with both seats We have found them to be far more user friendly than other seats we have used and even though our daughter is now able to use a booster seat we continue to keep her in the Marathon Convenience aside mom ran a red light and t boned a Montero last month The Montero was totaled our tank like Range Rover sustained over 8K in damage Our son was in his Marathon and when Mom turned around to make sure he was okay he gave her a big toothy grin Not one single peep or tear from the little guy When insurance offered to replace the seats we went straight back to the Marathon 
4 0 ok if you have a medium sized sedan like a vw passat expect to move the seat in front of the installed car seat way up i like the car seat but it s extremely big for my car you need to have an suv with a lot of back seat space or maybe even a mini van otherwise it s very cute 
5 0 A+ Seat BUY IT I originally bought the Britax Boulevard for my son who is 2 and was out growing his regular convertable carseat He is 35 pounds and needed a seat that would fit him That seat was not so great I sold it and bought this one instead I bought the Zebra print The seat is big and heavy which I like since it looks and feels so safe I like that the instructions are attached to the seat so you can t lose them The seat was easy to adjust to fit my son and very very easy to install into my very small car Suzuki Esteem After installing it with seatbelt it DOES NOT MOVE AT ALL which we all know is safe Installation was so fast I love the belt lock offs The seat is very plush and soft I love the many covers available My son sits comfortably in this seat there is plenty of room to grow the crotch strap is so much better on this than the Boulevard and I am sure we are going to be able to use this seat for years to come I am so glad I found this Buy it you will not be disappointed 
5 0 LOVE IT I bought this seat when my son was 8 months old as he was too big for his Graco sung ride I have a 2005 Honda CRV In the rear facing position the seat belt was not long enough to strap it to the seat My SUV only has the LATCH system on the side seats and not the middle seat I spoke to the car safety officier for the police department and he told me to place him in the side seat behind the passenger seat as this would be the safest place in regards to incidence of accidents since I could not use the middle position The reason he told me not to use the LATCH in the middle position by using the side seats LATCH system since my SUV is not equipped with it is because the LATCH is connected to the car frame and if we were in an accident and the frame of the car bent it could tear his seat in pieces I was not aware that the LATCH was connected to the frame So the officier told me that when he is able to be forward facing I should be able to put him back in the middle seat as it shouldn t require so much length of the seatbelt I love this seat and so does my son who is now 9 1 2 months It is very soft and cushy I probably wouldn t have bought the infant car seat if I was aware this seat could accomodate even a newborn I would definately recommend this seat It was very easy to install It does not have a cup holder and that is the only thing I wish it had for when he is older 
5 0 Totally Satisfied Consumer Britax Marathon was the easy chioce for me Excellent growth up to 49 65 lbs as a 5 point harness The seat was extremely easy to install with the latch system and versa tether strap I especailly liked the head support on the side which is reassuring for side impacts The marathon is well padded and my 7 month old Jack looks so comfy in his seat that I wanted to jump in there with him There are better prices online as one amazon consumer stated in her review online about traveling tikes com They are selling the same marathon at 219 99 shipping and tax included They had a great selection of patterns to choose from which made it easy for me to make my decision Im one totally satisfied consumer 
5 0 Britax Marathon Shines Through All Others The Britax Marathon is wonderful As a concerned parent I wanted a seat that would offer a 5 point harness for as long as possible Thats where the Britax Marathon shines through all the other seats that I reviewed The Marathon allows any child to remain in this seat up to 49 in length and or 65 lbs Thats equivelent to a five your old Not so happy with the color selection that Britax offers for a boy The seat arrived shortly thereafter and was nicely boxed I did have difficulty finding the instructions that were tucked underneathe the front seat fabric which I thought was a strange place to put them However the seat was extremely easy to install and did not take up much room in my VW Jetta Wonderful Seat and price 
5 0 Worth the cash When my son was 5 months old he was almost too tall for his infant carseat so my husband and I started looking for a seat that would last him until he was old enough to ride without one Initially I wanted the Britax but I didn t know anyone who had one and I was really afraid to spend 300 including tax on a seat So we bought the Eddie Bauer I didn t hate it it was ok but it did NOT fit in our car Toyota Rav 4 So we gave that seat to my mother so she could use it on occaision when she babysits and we bit the bullet and bought the Britax OH MY GOSH We love it It installed in like 2 minutes I m not kidding I could not BELIEVE how simple it was My son who is now 6 months LOVES it he is so comfy and he can sleep in it without his head leaning way over like it did in the Eddie Bauer He never cries when he is in it it sits up straight enough that he can look around which he also loves The fabric feels so wonderful and wipes clean pretty easily I love the one hand strap adjustment and the velcro that holds the straps out of the way for boarding We re planning a plane trip in May and I can tell you we ll be taking this seat And when our next baby arrives he or she will be riding in a Britax They ROCK 
5 0 This chair is wonderful This chair is wonderful It reclines for infants which is terrific The pad of the chair is removable so it can be washed The tray can be removed so you can set the child up to the table There is also a place mat to be put on the tray that has numbers and pictures on one side and letters and pictures on the other side My son has learned some of his letters and numbers by using this during dinner and lunch time 
5 0 We love this seat we have two This is a great seat b c the baby can just sit and hang out it in while it s reclined and as the kids get bigger it transforms to fit them Our three year old uses it at the table without the tray When he found out that the new baby was going to use it he said That s my seat So we bought a second one Also it doesn t take up as much room as a high chair and we ve been know to take it to restaurants b c it s so much more comfortable than those boxy high chairs And we all know that a comfortable kid is more like to let you have a peaceful meal A great product 
4 0 Feeding Seat I m a grandma and didn t want to have a high chair sitting in my kitchen when I only use it occasionally This seat is great and a bargain I like that it can fit on any chair and can be adjusted to different angles The fabric cover is easy to wipe clean and the cushion provides sufficient padding I considered one of the seats that slide over the counter or table but decided on this one because I can have the baby facing me directly This makes for easy feeding I am very happy with the feeding seat 
5 0 I wish i hade this chair for my 1st baby It is so nice and roomless I love it Easy to clean I really love and great price too I really recommend this 
5 0 Great Buy This item is excellent for homes with limited space There s no worries about where to keep a big bulky high chair I also like the fact that it s portable Just toss it in the trunk and off to grandma s It also grants you more options on where you feed the baby You re not restricted to wherever the high chair will fit I m also a big fan of being able to get my money s worth out of an item This chair really does grow with the baby and when he she is too big to have the tray attached just push it up the table and you have an instant booster seat The quality of the chair is good and if used properly should give no trouble The only problem I initally had with the chair was with the reclining feature It was a bit stiff and difficult to move but after the first few times it no longer is an issue 
5 0 Nice for the price As the mother of twins I didn t want the expense or the clutter of two conventional high chairs In both regards these seats worked out nicely They re not the fanciest high chairs but the definitely get the job done and they re sturdy and easy to clean We love them 
5 0 The only chair we have needed We bought this chair for my 3 year old son when he was born and we are still using it So when my daughter was born 8 months ago we kept thinking that our son would be ready for a big chair Well he informed us that he was not giving up his chair so we had to buy another one for our daughter I love how easy it is to clean that it reclines and that the tray is so easy to get on and off Also we don t have a lot of room in our house so this just sits in one of our chairs and if we need to take it somewhere we can do that too 
4 0 Great Sun Shade Great for keeping the sun out of my baby s eyes and can be pulled down all the way for naps It s very flexible I use it on my safari tt stroller 
5 0 Simple yet effective I am very pleased with this sun shade When I first received it I thought I got scammed because it looks like nothing But it does the job very effectively It s super easy to attach and when not needed the shade pulls back out of the way Depending on the angle of the sun I can have it partially or fully extended I ve used ours for almost a year and it s held its shape It also packs up very compactly for traveling It s the best I ve found for maximum sun coverage It fits both my full size Evenflo travel system stroller and my lightweight Peg Aria which has a very small canopy On my recommendation my cousin got one and it works on her full size and her small Zooper also I ve read other reviews complaining it doesn t fit but I ve tried it on many strollers of friends and it works I think you just need to be creative in how you tie it to the stroller I expect this shade will work on most strollers I can see that some kids may dislike the reduced field of view when the shade is fully extended I started using it when my daughter was only 3 months old so I think she got used to it She s never had a problem with the reduced view My cousin started using it recently on her 11 mos old and her baby doesn t fuss either I now give this sun shade to every friend with young kids It s a great and inexpensive shower gift It s one of those things you can t live without once you have it 
5 0 I love the RayShade When I first had my daughter I was using clothespins and blankets to protect her from the sun This shade has velcro fasteners that can attach to any part of your stroller to create any degree of shade you want It is aslo very thin so it s breathable and it can really look like part of your stroller at least more so than blankets and clothespins I want another one so I don t have to keep switching it from stroller to stroller 
5 0 Great sun protector for jogginh stroller I love this product worth every penny I tried the other kiddapotamus cover with the screen first and it did not work This completely covers my 8 month old s face The first day I tried it was a very windy sunny day I had no problem with the shade moving or flipping up or down I would recommend this to anyone just wish I had this for my 3 year old son 
5 0 Great product works well on my jogging stroller This is a great product and I m glad I went ahead and bought it I go jogging with my daughter nearly every day so I needed something that would block the sun well I had been using a light blanket and clothespins but wouldn t you know just as I got going at a good jogging pace my daughter would remove a clothespin and the shade was no more I was stopping to fix it more than I was actually jogging With this sunshade she can t undo it although she tries I can pull it all the way down as low as I can on my particular jogger and she can still see out but is shielded from the sun I like the side pockets great for keys and small items and the velcro tabs are easy to use The only drawback and this is such a minor issue probably hardly worth mentioning is that the shade doesn t fold up all nice and compact like the instructions say I wrestled with my shade for awhile before I finally got it folded up it was a matter of doggone it this thing isn t going to get the best of me and even then it wasn t very stable My suggestion keep the little bag it comes in and semi fold it and store it in that All in all this is worth it Wish I d had one when I started jogging with my daughter last year 
5 0 Cool toy When our baby was first born it was fun to take pictures of him next to this inchworm because he was shorter than it Now at 5 months he is longer than the inchworm and loves to roll over and wrestle with it He is currently entertained by the various textures and fabrics on the inchworm and I anticipate this being a toy that grows with him as he learns to make the music play press the squeeky part and learn his colors numbers and the measurement system A very cool learning development toy 
5 0 Great sleeper My son has been wearing sleep sacks since he was 3 months old Now at 13 months old the XL size is perfect It is nice and long and keeps him warm without having to worry about the loose blankets 
4 0 love the halo i love this product lets face it blankets bumper pads pillows and all deco in babys crib is NOT safe ilove the fact i can dress my baby in something that she loves and is SAFE and cozy she loves this when i put it on her she knows it is bed time and she starts rubbing her eyes and preparing to sleep please dont use blankets in babys crib its just NOT safe buy these they are GREAT 
5 0 Great for little ones These are great for little ones Once my daughter got a little older she became attached to her blanket and had to sleep with it by that time she could roll over etc so we weren t as worried about her sleeping with it When she got older she didn t want her feet confined but when she was little these were great for cold winters 
4 0 Great for toddler At 14 months my daughter rolls all over the crib when sleeping at night I can put this on and not have to worry about her getting cold at night It also works great as a cue that it is time to go to bed The nice light weight is great for spring and fall weather so I don t have to worry about her getting too hot 
4 0 Wearable Blanket In this day and age of SIDS awareness the Halo Sleepsack is a great product for babies who hate being swaddled From day 1 our baby hated her arms being pinned and would wiggle and force her arms out from her swaddling So the sleep sack has been a great alternative warm and snuggly I only wish that it had arms for those colder nights and that they weren t as expensive as they are 
5 0 Great light weight sleep sack We have several of these in various sizes and fabrics They are all terrific We re using the fleece at night in the winter the quilt during the day in winter and we used the cotton one in the Fall I highly recommend this line of wearable blankets 
5 0 great product We have used this since we quit swaddling him as a newborn We use the cotton one year around and it is the perfect weight here in Texas We only use the fleece one when it becomes really cold He is 15 months old and he associates the sleepsack with sleepytime I never have to worry about him being cold or kicking off his blankets totally recommend 
5 0 Beautiful Bedding I was very impressed when I received my bedding The design and quality exceeded my expectations 
4 0 Great value for money It s a great product for below 100 price range Pros It has almost all necessary features which other travel system has got Low price Cons There is no suspension for front wheels 
5 0 Reliable product from Cosco Very reliable item I used for more then two years I have been very happy with simplicity and ease of use I am surprized to see this excellent product at such a low price You can t go wrong go for it 
5 0 Bundleme covers I am a Child Care Provider and one of my clients came in with a Bundleme in her child s car seat and I thought what a great idea I never saw one of those So I went online and found them and low and behold I bought 3 because I have 3 babies I am buying 3 more for the stroller I have They are the best thing since the baby activity centers Plus it makes an old 24 year old 3 seater stroller seats look new again I couldn t beat the price on the Bundleme in any store near by so that s why I got them online it was also free shipping Alice Gess in Holyoke M 
5 0 Perfect Winter Item I am bewildered by all of the reviews claiming the Toddler Bundle Me is too small for their children Maybe these people received the Infant version instead of the Toddler version I have a 13 month old daughter that is at the higher end of the growth percentiles and she s got plenty of room in this thing We received the Infant Bundle Me as a shower gift so I was eager to jump to the Toddler version It s warm fits her Jeep stroller perfectly and eliminates the need for many cumbersome layers Very satisfied 
5 0 Very cozy Keeps my little one nice and warm in the cold weather Great buy Highly recommend 
4 0 McNally s Review of Big Bundle Me It s nice and thick and keeps baby warm The only thing I would like different is that the top is held in place with elastic and it would be better if it fitted more snug to the top so it wouldn tg slide down But would recommend this product to keep your toddler warm 
5 0 Fits Well I ve been using the Big Bundle Me for my 28 month old since he was 16 months and haven t had any trouble getting him to fit in it comfortably In fact he still has plenty of room that I expect to be using until he is at least 3 years old We use it all the time when we go out and he loves being in it If your looking for an quick convenient way to keep your child warm this is it 
5 0 fits great for my 3 year old Interesting to read comments about frustrated parents who s children don t fit in the big bundle me My 3 year old is average for his weight and height and fits perfectly inside the big bundle me He was comfortable and it kept him very warm I wonder if they received the wrong size because my son fits inside great I love this product and would recommend it to all moms who want to make their lives easier and hassle free 
5 0 Great Outdoors Blanket This blanket is great Most meaningful to me is that it s waterproof so even if the ground is wet I m not It s pretty easy to spot clean with a wet wipe but you can also put it in a commercial sized washer I ve yet to do this Folds compactly and has a carry strap 
4 0 A little secret I found Parents if you are going to purchase this item you will love to know that the Nuby sippy cups w the soft silicone sippy are compatible with the avent nipples and nipple holder I wish I would of known this sooner I would of bought the nuby sippy cups sooner and not spend so much money on the bottles I give the bottles 4 stars b c they are durable but they are bulky The nuby sippy cups are slimmer and hold 8 oz My baby can t tell the difference It s the Avent nipple on a slimmer less expensive bottle cup 
5 0 Convenient I ve used this foldable seat for all 3 of my kids now two girls and a boy It s so nice to store in the diaper bag The storage bag it came in has long since ripped so I store mine in a gallon size Ziploc bag It goes EVERYWHERE I put it in our swim bag when we go to the pool too it s so nice to be able to put the kids on it and not have to balance them on the huge public toilets They re more relaxed sitting by themselves too which means a shorter wait in the bathroom I ve read the reviews of pinched bums and read them when I first bought this too just be careful is all I can say My kids never got pinched but then I put them on carefully so that it doesn t happen Just pay attention and the pros and convenience of this seat far outweigh the cons 
5 0 Love It When I bought this I got the oh great more stuff that won t ever get used will clutter up my house look from my husband which I reminded him of tonight I did buy it prematurely our almost 3 year old wasn t remotely interested in using any potty so it did sit around for a while But ever since she started using the potty first hers now ours w her seat we have taken it with us everywhere Not just for the sanitary reasons but every bit as much for the size We also use it with the pottys at her grandparents houses or my husband s office potty which we re the only ones that use The couple of times tonight included that we ve forgotten it she had to go in public it is a nightmare First there s the layers of seat covers then and even worse is trying to position her little behind on that enormous seat with the big ol opening in the front which means her legs have to be out at an angle so she doesn t end up right there Then she says it hurts from all her weight being in the two places where the seat goes across her Yes I pinched myself in the beginning when we were in a hurry I didn t have it down yet how it folded but it was well worth it in my eyes Bottom line I love it I highly recommend it I would be totally lost without it So worth three times and more what I paid for it 
5 0 So great I bought 2 I love this seat it is easy to use and fabulous for those times where you don t want to balance your child on the edge of the potty I bought one for myself and for my parents to use when they take my daughter places She adores having her own seat 
4 0 good for 17months my son is sort of a young potty trainer He is doing great and we bought this seat to take with us He has no problems with this seat my only thought after getting wet this week is that I wish it had a splash guard but I know that may be impossible for a folding potty seat I bring along with me a splash guard from another toddler seat that is no good as a potty chair but Iatleast I can use the pieces I have had no problems with this seat on any toilet I just line up the front of the seats and my son sits and goes 
5 0 Awesome for Tummy Time This was great for tummy time for us We started using it right away both for tummy time and for just lying baby against It really seemed to help our guy hold his head up and look about by 3 or 4 months he was reaching for the toys while holding his head up It was also handy for propping him in when he started sitting up and I used it at about 6 months when we starting doing solid foods to prop him up on instead of a highchair We totally got our money out of this item it is packed up and ready for the next one 
5 0 Great toy for tummy time This is a great take off on the normal boppy which is also a wonderful invention I like that it s smaller which is better for propping baby up for tummy time I also like that toys attach to the boppy I usually add a few more links on for variety but this is not necessary Tummy time is such an important part of baby s day especially because of doctors suggestions of keeping baby on his back to sleep This is a great way to keep tummy time easy and fun 
5 0 babys need tummy time My mother in law gave us this boppy and I am glad she did It is easy to run out of new things to do with a young baby So this is nice to pull out and put on the floor and let our little Tommy experience having a pillow under his chest I also put him on his belly with nothing under it so that he can experiance that as well This is interesting because of the bright colors and the toys attached So far he isnt paying attention to the toys but he is still only just learning to use his hands So I am sure in the next couple months the toys will become more usefull I like to place a brightlly colored book in front of him he enjoys having something at his level to look at He gets tired of laying on this pillow pretty fast but our guy is supper picky and gets bored fast Also it is small enough that it can be stored out of sight very easily I think this makes a great addition to any collection 
4 0 Helps Keep my little one busy This toy helps keep my little one busy during tummy time 
4 0 tummy time must have Some boppy pillows are a bit to big so this tummy time boppy is a great choice Highly recommend it 
5 0 Tummy Time This boppy makes tummy time easy and fun The pillow is the right size for babies and makes tummy time a no brainer 
5 0 Wish I had discovered this stuff with my first child I sure wish we had discovered this stuff with my fist child for his gassy belly issues because I think I would have a few less gray hairs and my husband would have a full head of hair if we had But any how here we are with our second son who is currently three weeks old and having to deal with the cranky gassy belly issues all over again Thankfully my mom bought me some Gripe Water while she was out visiting us and I can t tell you how happy I am that she did It has made a huge difference for my son We give him a bit of this stuff and he calms down within about 15 minutes This stuff really works and really helps It is a must have 
5 0 Great Product I have been using Gripe water for my son since birth He is almost three and it helps with stomach aches teething gas and even calming his temper tantrums My Parents used this product with myself and my siblings 
5 0 Plain and simple it works This product is just that simple it does everything it claims to do Our grandson is much more comfortable so that means everybody else in the house is too It s just so nice to find a product that does exactly what it s supposed to 
4 0 Peace and Quiet This product is really great The combination of ginger which helps with nausea and fennel which helps settle upset stomach make it safe for children and they enjoy the taste My son who was a year when we started giving this to him was constantly fussy whether it was teething or sour tummy or any number of other things and ibuprophen and acetominophen weren t helping Plus there was a fear of giving him too much of those This product helped calm him within 15 minutes and usually only gave it to him once a day if even that I highly recommend this product and only wish I had known about it when he was a baby as it s been told to me that it helps with colic as well 
5 0 Amazing Our 6 week old daughter has had a hard time with gas and we tried everything we knew to do different holds burping gas drops etc and nothing seemed to help One night we purchased Baby Bliss Gripe Water and even though I was skeptical that it would work it worked within a couple of minutes It s the only thing that seems to calm her down when she s extremely upset Definitely worth paying the money when it makes your little one feel better 
5 0 Works very well Our baby doesn t get gassy too much just a few times per month but when he does he straightens his legs and screams and nothing calms him Except Gripe Water of course Within about 30 minutes of taking his dose he s over it and back to normal I also feel much better about giving him this versus the other anti gas medicine which is actually a drug 
5 0 EXCELLENT I love it It definitely covers my playpen and the stroller very well There are no bugs that have been able to penetrate it The best part is that I can still see my little one and she can see me too It is very compactable when not in use VERY easy to use 
5 0 Perfect for the Little Camper We love camping so this bug net was great for keeping over the pack and play while she slept and also great for covering the stroller while out on walks in the woods It s such a low price absolutely worth it 
5 0 The Only positioner you will need I purchased two other sleep positioners that didn t work until I came across this one My daughter snuggles into this and sleeps so peacefully I love that you can adjust this according to the baby s size the sides of the positioner aren t velcro so they always stay in place Highly recommended 
5 0 Nice bookcase I ordered this bookcase by mistake but I was pleasantly surprised when I put it together Assembly was not difficult This product is made better than some I have seen This bookcase would be a great addition to a child s bedroom It is large enough to hold a collection of favorite books 
4 0 Great bookcase I ordered this bookcase for our newborn s room and its perfect It is just the right height for a lamp on top so we can read while sitting in our rocking chair The only thing I didn t like is that the backing is flimsy board but as the bookshelf is up against the wall it doesn t matter much So far all the books we ve gotten fit on the shelves also I would recommend this low horizontal bookcase to anyone 
4 0 Soft hat is kinda small Our little one s head is on the small size and she s rapidly outgrowing the hat The jacket fits fine only fastens at the top Cute and soft Don t order it if your baby has an average or large sized head 
4 0 i have one of these we bought one of these for my son and it a good gate in practical and economical and good to 
5 0 We love our Co Sleeper We love using our Co Sleeper We were not comfortable having our baby sleep across the room in a crib and I was initially worried about having the baby sleep in our bed The Co Sleeper lets our baby sleep close enough that a paranoid mom like myself can hear him breathing in the night and can reach him quickly when he wakes up I also love that it is easy to pull him into our bed for nighttime feedings 
5 0 Perfect for working nursing moms I used this co sleeper with my son up until he was 7 mos old He is now 2 and we are expecting our second any day now I can t wait to set it up It was a lifesaver when I returned to work because my son nursed every 2 hours up until 6 mos old I didn t have to get out of bed to feed him and it made him feel safe to be next to his mommy and daddy The mattress they provide is too firm so I suggest you get a portable crib mattress that will fit I haven t tried the one I got yet so I m not sure which one is ideal I personally didn t set it up so I can t relate to the concerns of others My husband sets it up and takes it down which is not often We use a second hand playpen on trips He hasn t complained about it Maybe some sighs of frustration Still well worth it 
5 0 loves it my 8 mo old loves this toy It s a big blue elephant that makes noise when you spin his tummy or his tail The shapes are big colorful and they tumble out when you press his trunk or ears She just loves it and I think it s the cutest shape sorter I ve seen It s just not very compact but it is very cute 
5 0 Excellent shape sorter We purchased this sorter for a 1 year old and her sister who is 3 Both children were immediatly interested in all this shape sorter has to offer It s brightly colored parts stackable shapes tail that twists to make the belly turn the flapping ears and the trunk that shoots out the shapes are very enjoyable to play with Highly recommended 
4 0 Used it the 1st time My twin toddlers love this potty chair so do I easy cleaning dumping sturdy for sitting standing One minus my son likes to pull the cushion portion off of the seat while he s sitting on it Annoying Behavior wise we re working on it but I think the manufacturer could have made it a bit more difficult to remove 
5 0 great toilet trainer great toilet trainer for my daughter the handles help my daughter with her balance while on the potty and when uses the adult toilet 
5 0 Great little trainer This is a very convenient training potty to use and clean The seat simply lifts off and the inside bowl lifts out to clean My daughter is only a year old and I worried that it would be a bit big for her she s also on the small side but she seems fine on it She will sit on it for a long time as long as I m there playing with her The seat is a pretty soft rubber We haven t had problems with it sliding tho she s not big enough to try to get on herself she has successfully been able to get up by herself without any problems 
5 0 Perfect I purchased this potty strickly on the customer ratings and was not disappointed It s very sturdy enough so that even my husband can use it as a seat when sitting with our daughter All parts are very easy to clean I started her training at 15 months just by keeping her potty in the bathroom and having her sit on it with her clothes on every time my husband or I went to the bathroom She soon got the idea and was sitting on it without a diaper Because it took so long for her to go we used the entire unit but it didn t take long until we started just carrying around the padded seat for her to use on the adult potty PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT WAS WORTH IT EVEN IF WE D ONLY GOTTEN THE PADDED SEAT I bought a second seat from another manufacturer to keep in our other bathroom so we wouldn t have to go up and down stairs to fetch it every time she needed to go but it isn t NEARLY as nice The Primo seat isn t just a piece of plastic with a hole in the middle It s thin and contoured to the shape of a little one s bottm It fits snugly on the adult potty It has rubber pads and plastic pegs on the underside to keep it from slipping when she sits down I also like that either a boy or girl can use it without extra parts to assemble or disassemble There s a small rise in the front for boys but it isn t so high that it gets in the way when the child sits down Very sturdy very easy to use and clean Can t say enough about this product 
4 0 Good for Young Children and Nighttime Potty Training This pad has performed as expected and the extra length on the sides makes it easier to tuck under the mattress to keep it from moving However the photo gives the impression of covering more of the bed than it truly does Take the measurements seriously don t rely on the photo I needed to play with it to see where on the bed it would be the most effective 
5 0 Grateful mom This pad is great My daughter is a bed wetter and I can sleep soundly when we travel to hotels or relatives houses because this really catches all her wetness and the bed stays dry I really should order another one to keep around 
5 0 Great Product This is very simple to use and protects my daughter s bed A great investment if you are in the early stages of potty training and your child hasn t mastered sleeping through the night or naps without having an accident I highly recommend it 
5 0 Great waterproof pad LOVE IT We bought two of these for our toddler who was going to be on his big boy bed for the first time I LOVE THEM They are so easy to change in the middle of the night when his diaper leaks and they have held up to numerous washings They hold a ton of liquid and haven t leaked once We ll be buying more for our older son who is going to try to make it through the night with no pull up Great buy 
4 0 Great idea Great product I bought the Handy s Plus Pad because while our son has been potty trained for nearly a year he sleeps so soundly that he doesn t wake up all the time to go pee at night and I ve had it with changing the bed sheets everyother night This pad is a great item it s soft on the top so my son doesnt mind sleeping on it and it really works keeping the sheets dry My son sleeps all over the place and it s plenty wide enough to give the coverage we need And it s never leaked through The only reason I didn t give it 5 stars was that it s tough to tuck the far side in when you have the bed up against the wall like we do I m not sure how they could make this better but they should work on figuring out a way I only wish I d gotten 2 
4 0 WOW It Works The reviews are right My four week old is captivated by this I can put her in her crib awake and she goes to sleep She used to cry The only problem is I wish the timer was longer or even better noise activated I have to go back in a turn it back on a few times but I believe this one has one of the longer timers If you are having a problem putting you child to bed GO GET IT If it had a longer timer I would give it 5 Stars 
4 0 very nice but could use a better timer We bought the Rainforest Peek A Boo when we were on vacation because we forgot to bring our usual soother The Rainforest Peek A Boo is great Our 5 month old is fascinated by it The soother does its job in terms of helping him to sleep However the timer feature could be improved Our son falls asleep better with the light and sound Unfortunately the longer 18 minute setting is with sound only Overall the Fisher Price Rainforest is a very good product that I would recommend 
5 0 Great Product I bought this for my baby when he was a month old He is now 4 months old and loves it I have never had to change the batteries yet He doesnt pay much attention to the lights or movement so I just have it set to play the music and sounds He is impossible to get to sleep without it Even if I am staying somewhere else with him this is a must pack With it I can feed him bathe him and lay him down push the button and leave the room I rarely have to go back in and start it again he falls asleep to it so quickly I only hope when he gets old enough to activate it himself that he doesnt stay awake just to watch it 
4 0 Really ENJOY This crib toy is great and our 4 week old son enjoys looking at the characters and listening to the soothing sounds However we have changed the batteries already twice and I really wish the music would play abit longer then what it does Other then that I love how fisher price came out with the rainforest theme 
4 0 Love it needs a few improvements though This was a gift for my daughter and she LOVES it She s mezmerized by the lights and movement and will cry when it turns off she s still too little to reset herself The characters are cute the waterfall is very calming even my husband and I stare at it and the music and noises are very nice and relaxing I do think it has a few areas of improvement 1 The straps are really hard to get on 2 The timer is way too short I am always having to reset it for my daughter 3 It would be nice if it could be positioned higher The instructions say 7 between soother and mattress is necessary which means that it has to go on the head of the crib instead of the side until my baby is old enough where I reposition the height of the mattress So unless she is positioned sideways she really doesn t get to see it well I really do like this item and it has been a lifesaver getting our little one to fall asleep in the crib she s 10 weeks old now and has been using this for a month I highly recommend it 
5 0 Love it My baby girl loves this It puts her right to sleep every time The music on it is very soothing and fun to listen to Highly recomended 
5 0 Adorable i had the ocean wonders soothers for my other three kids so now it was time for a change very peaceful and finally something different to listen too I love the music lights and the waterfall is great too My son seems to like it and he is very sensitive to anything that is too stimulatin 
5 0 Great for smaller babies My son was born 3 weeks early and was on the small side 6lbs 18oz This enveloped him very well even the nurses thought it was a great product and should be required for all new babies I love the material and its ease of use 
5 0 Great for the running stroller I was able to take my little one out in the running stroller at 7 weeks using the Snuzzler I stuck to smooth bike paths until she was about 4 months but her little head didn t budge when she was laying on this thing In fact I think she slept better in the running stroller w the Snuzzler than at home The two sides are convenient b c you can just flip it over depending on the kind of weather you re having fleece side to keep her warm and the other to keep her cool when it s already warm out By 4 months she didn t need it in the car seat or swing anymore but it still seems comfy for her in the running stroller even now at 5 months 
5 0 perfect for our newborn The snuzzler provides excellent support for our little guy As it is wintertime and cold here in Budapest we ve opted to use the Bundle me for our car seat It s too bad that the Snuzzler doesn t have some kind of cover to go with it Our Snuzzler still gets a lot of use in Fisher Price vibrating infant seat Our baby seems quite comfortable and content when sitting in the Snuzzler The 14 99 price on Amazon makes this a great deal 
5 0 Great for newborns We ve used this inside our Graco Snug Ride car seat since bringing our daughter home from the hospital It makes the car seat very cozy and helps hold her in place without slouching or dropping her head It s very soft against her skin too 
5 0 Must Have even in hot weather We live in Florida It s almost July Our newborn loves this thing She is currently happier in her carseat with the snuzzler than anywhere On one side is a cozy fleece which would be great for cool weather but not what we need The reverse is a navy fabric and it s plenty cozy It supports her head so her head is always upright even on long tripsand it gently supports her back and arms I rate this as a must have 
5 0 Great storage bags Unlike the other reviews I find these bags easy to use and convenient The twist ties allow you to pump right into the bag which saves me from having to wash bottles everytime I pump The other bags require you to pump into a bottle and then pour it into a bag which defeats the whole purpose The medela bags also allow you to get all of the air out which can destroy the great quality of your milk if left inside I store the bags upright just in case although I ve never had a leaky bag in a milk storage tray I bought from Babies R Us the First Years brand Once they are frozen I put them in ziplock bags with the date written on them for easy retrieval when I need to defrost milk When I am ready to defrost I just stand them upright in a large bowl and let cold water run for about 5 minutes and them pour into bottles My baby never got the hang of breastfeeding but I really wanted her to have breastmilk She is 2 1 2 months old now and I have been pumping milk since she was 3 days old I eventually chose to bottlefeed exclusively so I pump about 5 times a day I use an entire pack of 50 bags in less than a week I pump way more than she eats so I have a lot of stored milk Plently for when I go back to work and can t pump as often Take it from someone who really knows These bags are not difficult to use as everyone else will have you believe If they were I wouldn t use them considering how often I need to use them 
5 0 stylish and functional I m very happy with this bag It s not bulky but has a lot of space for everything I need It s very good quality 
4 0 It Keeps Children Safe I was six months pregnant with twins had a broken leg and a not quite three year old who figured out pretty quickly that he could outrun Mama When he nearly ran into a parking lot I bought this item because his safety is my number one concern When my son started getting rowdy in a crowded public location I was able to slip this harness on him very quickly and easily because of the strategically placed velcro I anticipated some snide comments from passerbys but did NOT expect my son to give me a baleful look and announce loudly I NOT a puppy Mama Needless to say my son did not like it one bit but it was comfortable and doesn t restrict the arms It s a very good product but it requires practicing with your child before it will be effective because the velcro WILL give if you and your child try to go in opposite directions 
5 0 Kid Keeper We saw someone using these and they appeared to be perfectly suited to keeping young children nearby without carrying them or strapping them into strollers Kids and parents can all be happy So we ordered 6 two for us 2 grandchildren and 1 each for all the parents and other grandparents 
5 0 Safety first The first few years of a baby s life is memorable Safety is very important Every home with kids should have these Thank 
5 0 Cloth Diapering Dream WE decided to use cloth diapers because it s SO much cheaper than disposables The Prefolded diaper service diapers are definately the way to go too I couldn t do it if I had to fuss with folding Also if you plan to cloth diaper a MUST have is 4 6 diaper wraps 10 for 2 BBrUs They are like plastic pants only with waterproof and cloth covering They also have velcro instead of pins My hubby who hates wrapping anything LOVES and OFFERS to change our newborn s diapers since he can easily handle the velcro wraps We did a diaper cleaning service for the first 2 months and I clean them on my own since IT s really not as difficult as everyone thinks it is Plus it s great on the environment I strongly recommend cloth diapers and wraps 
4 0 Good sturdy cloth diaper These are good sturdy cloth diapers whether you use them as diapers or burp cloths Absorbancy is quite good I use both these and the quot Gerber prefolded with absorbant layer quot diapers The diaper service ones are not quite as good for two reasons 1 They are difficult to pin and work much better with the velcro closure diaper covers and 2 they take longer to dry in the drier thus increasing laundering costs 
5 0 Great diapers Gerber makes a quality prefolded cloth diaper When folded in thirds they fit nicely into diaperwraps They are strong and cannot compare to any other cloth diaper I ve seen To make them last longer I only bleach them when they are soiled not just wet I have found that these diapers last through about four consecutive years of diapering 
4 0 Sturdy cloth diapers Good strong cloth diapers They stand up to the abuse of the machine very well I only have two problems with them They aren t very soft and they are hard to pin I added velcro to mine just to avoid having to fight with them and a nine month old Aside from these little problems they are good absorbant diapers that I use daily on my baby 
4 0 Good but not the best These are absorbant diapers and they hold up to the regular abuse of washing over and over again They need to be washed several times before they are soft I do need to mention that if you choose to cloth diaper your baby you might want to just use velcro covers first since the weave is very tight on this diaper I used pins at first and got frustrated because they wouldn t go through the diaper After a few washings the weave loosened a bit and I was able to pin them more easily 
5 0 Good service great product The price is amazing and the product is just what you need if you have a non stopping baby like mine Safe belts comfortable seat easy to install nice colors Don t waste your money in 3 digit price car seats This seat is the real deal 
5 0 Works Great I did as much research as I could before purchasing two of these car seats for my grandson one for my car and one for my daughter This car seat always seemed to rank pretty well and the price was affordable so I bought it My first impression of the car seat came when I lifted the box it was so light After weeks of hauling my steadily growing big for his age grandson in his infant seat it was so nice to lift something that didn t feel like a cement brick The straps were very easy to adjust for his comfort and the bottom liner is going to be great for those oops The seat is truly very easy to adjust compared to others I looked at And my grandson is very comfortable in it It was a wonderful purchase for us in every respect 
4 0 A good buy We bought the car seat for our granddaughter It is a real bargain very safe functional for a good long time and attractive The only downside was that it was a challenge to install it initially to fit our granddaughter 
5 0 Great Product Great Price This is an excellent carseat for an equally great price We bought two of these to use in our nanny s car for our 9 month old twins The seats don t have a ton of padding but still look very comfortable and are easy to install and use Very happy with this purchase 
5 0 love it We have not yet gotten this into the car as my grandson loves to sit in the seat It is very roomy and he looks like a king in the chair He is always smiling when we put him down in his seat and will sit there for a long time and even fall asleep there It is his seat on the kitchen table and keeps him involved with everyone 
4 0 Great price Great product First of all kudos to Amazon for having the carseat to my house in 2 days with the Super Saver shipping I might add Secondly I spent days DAYS looking for a new infant toddler convertible seat I have an 05 Trailblazer and was desparately looking for a narrow seat I could fit between 2 Graco TurboBooster seats It s still a tight fit but it works This was the narrowest seat I could find on the internet The baby body pad definitely is a must since there is very little padding in the seat cover It will work for a little while but during the summer I m sure the baby will not stand for that much cushion around her legs as it will make her hot I ll have to figure something else out at that point The seat looks better than I expected and is about an inch less wide than the Titan The Titan definitely doesn t work in between the two boosters I can t see any use for the pillow other than for looks I m very happy with my entire purchase 
4 0 Very nice carseat for the money I was very impressed with this seat I got it on sale and was axpecting something cheap I just needed something quickly for my ever growing twins The fabric is very nice and the padding is adequate I love the removable bottom liner It came in handy when one of my guys got carsick on vacation 
5 0 Portable comfy and functional Our oldest child is ready to use a booster seat I was tired of transferring the car seats from the Minivan to my WRX whenever I wanted to take our oldest with me in my car So we bought this booter seat to stay in the WRX s trunk until needed It works great It is comfy for my daughter light weight and very easy to use We were surprised it is much bigger in real life that it looks in the photos and on ours the colors are reversed The dark blue fabric is in the center with the light blue on the outside The cup holders are awesome and are better quality than you think 20 bux would get you We are very impressed and will be buying another one as the other three kids grow out of their car seats Also this is one of the few boosters that qualifies for free shipping 
5 0 my baby loves this this is the third one of these we have had Our daughter is 19 months old and we will be sorry when she out grows this product It keeps her warm and cozy and can t come off during the night She seems to really like it too 
5 0 Good Product I have been very pleased with all Halo SleepSack products This product was great for warmer weather We also have the fleece sacks that have been great for the colder temperatures I like the reverse zippers roomy bottom design and the durability of the fabric wash after wash The best part is the peace of mind they offer me so I don t worry about suffocation from loose blankets 
5 0 one of the best baby products out there My daughter loves her sleepsack She s been sleeping in one since she stated turning over on her stomach and could not be swaddled anymore We put her in a onesie underneath when cooler will put something warmer on underneath We ve got 2 so there s always one clean Worth the money 
5 0 perfect for warmer weather I used the fleece sleepsacks in the winter but needed something lighter for spring and summer These cotton sacks are great no need for a blanket and hence no worries about the baby smothering herlself 
5 0 get a couple in each size These are great we actually have them in a couple different sizes so my son can grow into them NOTE We got him the blue one but they make you review them separately Here s what I love 1 Our house gets chilly at night and even with a little space heater in his room I worried about him being cold with no blankets The sleep sack is snuggly and warm 2 Our son moves constantly awake or asleep Any blanket you did use even if it were safe would never stay on him The sleep sacks have never tangled or bunched up under him 3 This is silly but it just looks so darling I love to see him all ready for bed in his PJs and sleep sack Our son HATED the sleepers that were sacks at the bottom I think they felt restrictive because he would kick and kick at them and cry He has never minded the sleep sack maybe having his PJs on under it helps him feel more comfy I recommend this and recommend getting a couple in each size so that you can throw one in the wash and have another ready 
5 0 Much better than a blanket I was using a blanket for my newborn and would wake up all night to make sure she hadn t kicked off the covers or kicked it over her face Since purchasing this I don t worry about that at all She stays warm all night One recommendation buy the cotton SleepSack I had the fleece SleepSack first and it seemed to keep the baby too warm The cotton is a tight knit weave and feels warm enough even for our cold Illinois winter nights 
5 0 Must have What is not to love about this Perfect for baby Since you cant use blankets in the crib this is a perfect solution Soft comfortable and a thoughtful backwards zipper 
5 0 Great for babies who can t stay covered up when you keep your house cold My son was born July 04 and I usually keep my house very cold I noticed that when I put him in the crib swaddled up in a blanket and came in minutes later to check on him he had some how squirmed his way out of the blanket and was cold Being my first child I freaked So we went on a trip to Babies R Us because every mother and you know what I m talking about will do anything just to go back to that store and I found this item I only bought one to try out and had to go back for at least 3 more They are great They have a light one for the summer and you can buy thicker one for the winter My son wore this at bed till he was at least 8 months old and he wore a long sleeve onsie underneath to keep his arms warm You can t go wrong with this I promise you You will no longer have to worry about your baby getting out of their covers and getting cold 
5 0 Highly Recommended We love this wearable blanket so much that we bought every kind They are wonderful First I must say that they obviously do not confine the arms so if your baby still gets startled by her jerky arm movements when trying to fall asleep he she may not be ready for this yet I am slowly making the transition from the Miracle Blanket over to this My baby still needs the extra swaddling at night and when she is fussy but she likes the freedom during her naps that this provides and likes to get at her fingers too I did not find that my cotton sleep sack shrank The zipper doesn t lay exactly flat on her but I haven t found this a problem at all I do feel the sizes run a bit small My baby is wearing the small size and at 23 has just about outgrown it I d recommend getting them one size above what you think you need I don t like that there are no arm sleeves at all I really would have liked the choice of putting her in one with or without sleeves This cotton is so nice and light that I can t imagine it being any lighter without being to fragle to hold together If you want one that is heavier they come in fleece and quilted also but remember that there are no sleeves I very much like that the zipper is upside down It undoes from the bottom which means you don t have to completely unzip your baby for diaper changes and the zipper tab doesn t poke into the baby s chin BTW if you try to put your baby s arms inside the sack instead of out the holes they will probably get them out the holes themselves mine did 
5 0 Clearly the best I started out with various brands of bottles when my baby was born My baby developed colic at about 5 weeks old I wanted a bottle that prevented air bubbles as least as possible The avent bottles were okay but I tried Dr Brown s bottles You see the results immediately You will see absolutely NO air bubbles going into the nipple or even in the bottle No other bottle I ve seen compares As a result my colicky baby has less gas and stomach pain As far as the extra time to clean the gadgets oh please no big deal It s a matter of an extra minute of your day for a few bottles It s a little strange at 1st all the gadgets but in no time it s no big deal I PROMISE I will always HIGHLY recommend Dr Brown s bottles 
5 0 WONDERFUL THESE ARE THE GREATEST BOTTLES EVER I HAVE A BABY WITH COLIC I HAVE TRIED EVERY BOTTLE OUT THERE THESE ARE BY FAR THE BEST 
4 0 Best bottles for gas prevention After having tried every bottle brand we could find we ended up preferring the Dr Brown s They definitely reduced the amount of gas our baby was swallowing thus reducing the amount of spit up and burps The measurements on the bottles are spot on thus mixing formula in them is really easy The bottles are very durable as are the nipples They take a beating and still look brand new including the measurement markings I m fairly certain the bottles we have will last until our baby is eating just solid food And yeah the parts are a pain to clean But we can live with that It s not a huge huge deal I will say that the Playtex disposables were just as good in terms of gas prevention but we didn t feel good about throwing away all those plastic containers and the added cost of purchasing them As well the measurements on them were wildly inaccurate and thus totally useless 
5 0 Calling the Dr These are GREAT bottles I have these and some Medela bottles that came with my breast pump Dr Browns wins no doubt about it I guess I m not as meticulous as some other reviewers on cleaning and sterilizing I just follow the directions in the package and sterlized when I started out and then I ve hand washed ever since Now let s face it washing bottles is a pain regardless Washing a few more parts is no big deal It takes me approx 30 seconds more to do the vent parts And it s definitely worth the effort The couple of times I ve used the Medela bottles I could visibly see bubbles coming through the milk and rising to the top Later my baby had lots of gas and spit up With the Dr Browns bottles that NEVER happens I don t even use the Medelas as backup emergency bottles anymore I only use them to hold water if I m taking a trip and need to bring some clean water from home to mix formula The Dr Browns bottles are a godsend 
5 0 Had the rest Dr Brown s are the best I must agree that I tried the others from cheap to expensive before finally getting to the Dr Brown bottles I tried others that had the same claims even a few gimmicks that would work in theory VentAire I have only found success with the Dr Brown bottles These bottles will sometimes leak until you get the hang of them and keep the inner tube empty and the collar on not so tight Usually a gentle twist of the collar will empty the inner tube and then you can twist it back on but not too tight The disks help stop leaks during travel but you really just need to work on keeping them upright Yes more cleaning and thank goodness for microwave sterilizers I simply handwashed and then boiled for the first child but love my microwave steamer now The markings are fading on some of my bottles but I believe that hand washing has saved them a little I compared to Avent which were only slightly cheaper but had lots of transition to sippy cup type of advantages or breast pump straight to bottle I still love my Doc Brown s and the complaints of scratched off markings applied to the other bottles too I personally preferred the wide neck because they seem to fit my baby better but several friends like the standard We all agree that the Doc Brown s are lifesavers though I give a 3 pk of the 8 oz size at every baby shower 
5 0 Great Swing My daughter received this for a shower gift She takes it everywhere She loves it It is light and easy to fold up Her son falls asleep in it quickly What a nice gift Now with the price at 19 00 each and free shipping with 25 00 purchase I just ordered 2 for gifts 
4 0 Would recommend I bought this swing for my granddaughter It is very easy to get her in and out of She enjoys it It does make a soft clicking sound similiar to the ticking of a clock I think it was a good deal for the price 
5 0 Love Em Love Em Love Em This is the greatest product They stick to every restaurant table I have ever secured them to are lightweight easy to pack and fun for my daughter to look at Every time I pull one out of the diaper bag she says Elmo Elmo Elmo They keep the germs away from her and the clean up is so simple I wouldn t do without them they are great 
5 0 If you re out of the house a lot for you Great product if you spend a lot of time out of the house eating out shopping or just not feeding your baby home all the time Almost germ free way to feed your baby anywhere and then just have it disposed of and go 
5 0 A MUST HAVE This is one of the best products on the market They keep my 1 year old occupied at the dinner table he loves looking at the pictures of the Sesame Street Characters and I love the fact that he isn t eating directly off of a restaurant table I keep them in my diaper bag so they are always available They are super easy to attach and stay in place Finally a baby product that is useful practicle and reasonably priced 
5 0 Table toppers Love this product It s easy to use easy to take along clean up is a cinch No worries about what s on the table UNDER the topper We ve had three restaurant employess different restaurants ask about the product for their customers with little ones 
5 0 Germ free table for baby These Table Toppers are the greatest for your baby that is eating table foods You never know what those tables were cleaned with when you go to a resturant You can stick the table topper on the table and place your child s food on top for your child and you will KNOW that it is safe and germ free My 4 yr old and 3 yr old also love these place mats I am so thankful my kids can eat without me worrying about germs 
5 0 Great for teething I loved this product for fruits and other food that I didn t want my new baby to choke on I also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething It worked great for this as well as for the food I didn t like bananas in it though impossible to get clean 
5 0 The best stroller system This system is great Have only used it for 2 months now but its fantastic Fits into our CRV perfectly Its not as heavey as some of the others and very safe We used it for several airline trips so far and the car seat fits great on plane I would recommend to anyone 
4 0 Good stroller system I put this stroller system on my registry and we ve been using it since my son was born last year He is now 11 months and still fits in the infant carrier We like that the carrier can be used in multiple cars so we bought an extra base The stroller height seems great for my husband 6 2 and for me 5 8 We don t feel like we are hunched over when pushing it The stroller seems like it folds very compactly but it still doesn t fit into my VW Cabrio trunk the trunk opening is just a bit small So we use it with my husband s car and we are thinking about getting a compact stroller that will fit in my car My major complaint is with using the stroller without the infant carrier Now that my son is older and wants to see everything around him he doesn t like to recline The back is adjustable but we can t get it to be fully upright so he is always at a 20 degree angle recline He has started pulling himself forward and leaning on the tray It is OK for now but I think he ll start to get annoyed and tired when sitting forward like this Overall I would recommend this stroller system 
5 0 Very satisfied with this stroller We ve been using this stroller for our baby girl for abt 2 weeks now and this is just a perfect stroller Its got good grip and wheels are big so moves nicely Car seat goes in and comes out in a snap Folding this stroller is easy cant say it can be done with one hand but doesnt take much effort and you dont have to sweat it out while closing opening Has canopy on Car seat as well as the main stroller together both give a complete cover from rain wind 
5 0 You couldn t pick a better travel system My Husband and I are expecting our first child a little girl in July We received this as an early shower gift from my grandmother and absolutely could not have asked for a better gift It rides smoothly everything is very easy to snap together and it s not complicated to figure out There was minimal assembly which my husband did for me and he had a blast testing it out around our dining room 60 br 62 It s a great system we think everyone will love it 
4 0 Pretty good This is actually pretty good I use it for warming breastmilk formula It took a few tries to get it perfect temperature but I have never had too hot milk so my baby didn t get hurt There were a few times where the milk wasn t too warm but didn t take long My measuring cup s markings did rub off after 2 months and I contacted Munchkin and they sent me a new one for free 
4 0 Workhorse Purchased for the upstairs nursery it has saved me from stumbling downstairs to the kitchen for late night early morning feedings Fits the Avent as well as the thinner bottles I recommend using the caps that come with your bottles when you warm up junior s food repels the condensation I d give it five stars but the beeps are a feature that I wish could be turned off by the user note to Munchkin Worth every penny 
5 0 bottle food warmer I love this bottle baby food warmer it took a couple tries to figure out how much water to put in but it works like a charm I m not using baby food yet but it will probably work just as good 
5 0 Why I LOVE it 1 You can t beat the price EXCELLENT 2 Easy to use 3 Doesn t take up much space I ve even packed it in my suitcase and it travels well 4 Great for warming food bottles Suggestions 1 Only use distilled water in it works much better 2 For cleaning Once a month use a mixture of half distilled water white vinegar about 2 oz total pour it in the warmer and turn it on Doesn t smell great but works FANTASTICALLY LOVE LOVE LOVE IT P S I ve been using this product for 6+ months now 
5 0 You will be happy After doing research I picked Munchkin bottle warmer Good things about this warmer are quick enough heat good size we use Avent bottle easy care and best thing is auto shut off We has been using for 4 months day and night without any problem People compliant about water adjustment I usually use low level my son never compliant 
5 0 Great Umbrella Stroller I love this stroller I would recommend it to anyone My son has high tone and would arch really bad in regular umbrella strollers because it only buckled around his waist and the fabric was not very sturdy This one has the 5 point harness and a heavy material that keeps him from arching It is also taller than most umbrella strollers so you do not have to break your back pushing it I absolutely LOVE IT 
5 0 Great buy Very satisfied with this stroller I was shocked at just how lightweight it really is It folds up easy with only the use of your foot to release the locking mechanism below My daughter likes to sit up but I also can recline it for a quick snooze Easy to maneuver in stores and seemed fairly smooth on uneven surfaces Very happy after going through more than 3 umbrella strollers I returned in the stores due to one problem or another 
4 0 new grandmother I have used the stroller only a couple of times to try it out as my grandaughter is still too young for it I like the item very much Ii is well designed light yet sturdy I m satisfied with the quality of the product and look forward to use it a lot soon 
5 0 great buy I was on the market for a nice umbrella stroller I have shopped around and asked other moms what they like This stroller is very light and pushes SO easily So many of the expensive ones have bad reviews on that the reclining position is a plus as well 
4 0 Lightweight After going through MANY strollers this stroller definitely gets my vote It s lightweight compact and has lots of features that a bulky stroller has The handles are long so I don t have to hunch over anymore as I did with my umbrella stroller The recline feature is also good It allows my son to sleep comfortably rather than falling to the front while asleep The basket is also nice The only reason I gave it 4 star because sometimes the wheels tend to get twisted around and get stuck while being on rough sidewalks Other than that I really like this stroller 
5 0 Great Stroller This is the lightest easiest stroller It s small enough to stash in the trunk and still be able to buy groceries If my son decides he doesn t want to ride in it it s light enough to fold up and carry on my shoulder I like that there is a sun shade and I love the 5 point harness I have used the rain bonnet once in a marathon I was the only one without a wet kid The seat also is angled towards the back so the child doesn t slide right out when you release the buckes like some strollers Has zippers on both sides to recline for sleeping It does make for a slightly reclined chair but he doesn t mind Very well made and sturdy mine has been through a lot I have owned it for about 1 1 2 years with no problems 
4 0 great for newborns This swing is wonderful for my 1 month old girl She likes being in the horizontal position so the way the swing is designed is perfect for her although I do think that the swing should be adjustable so she can sit more upright in the future The size is fantastic I have a very small house so I couldn t get one of the mongo designs Plus It is very easy to move room to room The mobile is very interesting to her and is positioned in the perfect distance and position for a newborn I can see it beeing a problem though in the future when she gets bigger and more mobile because it is so close to the cradle I would deffinitly reccomend this swing for newborns but not so much for the older larger bab 
5 0 GREAT TUB I bought this tub for my 7 month old daughter who out grew her infant tub It is very nice It has just enough room for her to play with her toys but still small enough to be safe It blows up just like a pool very easily I also use this at my mother s home where she has a tubless showers and it works extremely well I suggust buying tub grips when you get it Overall excellent 
4 0 nice and compact This tub is great if you dont want to confine your child too much in a full sized bathtub but is also small enough to keep it safe for baby Since it s a blow up tub all the sides are soft so baby wont bonk her head There is a drain hole at one end for easy draining and a suction cup underneath so you can hang it up when not in use It is also good if you are going on a trip and are not sure if there will be a tub to give baby a bath in 
4 0 Easy to clean My baby really like the nipple size and they are a breeze to clean Nice wide opening and the capped nipples are great for the diaper bag We did notice leaks but once we replaced the nipples it stopped I found that the nipples should be replaced every 30 days or so Pricey Yes but ease of cleanup and mixing makes up for it 
5 0 Works for us I prefer the Avent bottles over the Playtex Ventaire brand They both worked well and have advantages over one another This is my non scientific review Head to head comparison Criteria_____________Comment 1 Bottle Material______Avent stays clearer and is more dense 2 Bottle Design_______Playtex curve shape is innovative 3 Nipple Design_______Baby likes the Avent shape better Avent nipple size is labeled more visibly The Avent recommended flow rate by age fits my baby more 4 Vent system________Both work well No difference 5 Assembly Ease______Avent has less parts but the nipple is harder to assemble Avent recommends wetting the nipple before assembly Slight advantage to Playtex 6 Cleanning Ease______Avent has less parts This is a big timesaver for me Playtex has 2 more parts to clean It s a hassle if you are cleaning a lot of them 7 Overall Quality______Avent bottle seems better constructed I m not saying Avent is better than Playtex I just prefer Avent more because it fits my baby and my needs better 
5 0 NEW Nipple Design NO More LEAKS I used these bottles with my first son and would have given them about 3 5 stars I would be the first to tell you if they were not fixed just right they would leak After trying all others once again with my daughter I decided to use these When I went to buy new nipples I noticed they looked different Oh wow what a diffrence Baby is 4 months old and no leaks The new nipples have a raised edge that guarantees the nipple is tight in the collar Then there is a lip that hugs the rim of the bottle to guard against leaks The REALLY great thing is you can tighten these bottle to your hearts content I tightened it as tight as I could and it didn t leak a bit The new nipples have the words Extra Soft on the package and if you look closely they look different around the bottom I am extremely satisfied with these bottles now and will use them untill baby is weaned 
4 0 dependable and likeable I like the avent bottles a lot the tops are extra wide to be able to put formula mix in without getting it all over the counter I don t think these bottles seem to help my son with gas he s just a baby and they are generally gassy The bottles do tend to leak if the inside of the white ring is not completely dry first Overall I ve been pretty happy with them though I ve never contempated switching I do however recommend just skipping the 4 oz bottles and buying just all 9 oz bottles My son is 3 weeks old and is already taking 6 oz so anytime we use the 4 oz bottles we have to make an additional 2 oz after he empties the bottle I wish I had just registered for another package of 9 oz instead of 4 oz 
5 0 No nipple confusion here These bottles are a good choice if you re breastfeeding but have to introduce a bottle My son has never had a problem going from the breast to this bottle and back to the breast again Also after months of frequent use I have never experienced the leaking problem with these bottles mentioned by some other reviewers I also know of other moms who have used these for more than a year and no leaks either I have even taken the tops apart and put them back together and still no leaks 
5 0 Love these bottles but don t like the wideness These are the only bottles that our daughter will use I really love them but wish they weren t so wide as it is so hard to get her to hold them herself now that she s old enough to try I do have a problem with leaking occasionally when I ve shaken the bottle to mix milk around 
5 0 Dex Bedrail This was a very easy assembly and worked well with my 2 5 yr old grandson No falling from bed during sleep He did however deliberately find his way out of the bed between the rail and the foot of the bed The bedrail stores well and will be used over the next several years We found this a safe product and are pleased with this purchase 
5 0 A great and simple solution This works great on our huge king size bed that has a really thick mattress It also works well with no bed frame You just shove the horizontal legs in between the mattress and foundation boxes or box springs and it stays in place nicely Easy to add and take away and looks clean and streamlined Gives me piece of mind at night that my 10 month old baby won t be able to roll out of bed In the morning when he wakes though he stands up and shakes it so I have to get up right away and pick him up before he throws himself over the top of it It only works while the baby is sleeping but I don t think many potential buyers would expect more out of it anyway It s great highly recommend 
5 0 Just Great My baby is now 3 weeks old and this is his favorite chair It is actually doubling as his bed right now because it is the only thing I can use to get him to sleep more than an hour at a time I guess it can be a little loud but I think that s what keeps baby sleeping Love it 
5 0 greatest item ever invented This was a lifesaver for our premature baby girl The fabric is soft and she seemed so comfortable in it when she first came home She is now three months old and would rather swing or play in her gym but for the first month she put her glider to good use So even though we didn t use it for a long time period it did a great job of soothing her and I am glad that I bought it right here from Amazon with free super saver shipping 
5 0 Wonderful product This Soothing Motions Glider is the best thing I have ever bought for my Child Day Care Business I say anyone with an infant would enjoy this It is easy to take apart and clean it is quiet it is wonderful I can t say how long you will be able to use it I have one very large 9 month old that is too big for it and I have a 2 month old and a 6 month old who love it The mobile above it is easy for them to reach the music is soothing I just works great I wish I had one when my children were young 
4 0 Like this product I think the Soothing Motions Glider is a great product My 6 week old daughter loves it and she has slept many hours in it so far It is very soothing to her However there doesn t seem to be much difference in the two speeds and the noise can get a bit annoying I can t say much for the music I wish it was a bit more soothing for her Regardless she seems to love it We have to put it on our coffee table so that our dog doesn t lick her to pieces It s a very stable product 
5 0 Lifesaver I love this glider My son is now 2 1 2 months old and it s the only place he will sleep He has reflux and Laryngomalacia and the way this glider has him slightly elevated is great for him This glider has served as a co sleeper for us our bed is low This is my third child and although I also have the Fisher Price Aquariaum Cradle swing I use the glider in my bedroom as his crib I love this product 
5 0 soothing for baby and mom dad this glider was a gift I purchases for my daughters 3rd son and she really loves the glider her other sons are 10 and 8 and this was not available when my other grandsons were small the baby sleeps well in it during the day and I found the best price for the glider on AMAZO 
4 0 Pretty and sweet Haven t had the baby yet but have played with this Is is easy to set up It does make a noise but a low mechanical noise which may be soothing to baby I m not sure if it is suppose to make that kind of noise It is not as noticable with the music going It moves steady and slow I think baby will like it I hope I rated it 4 because of the noise 
5 0 Great for baby I used this product when my son was young under 6 months and found it a welcome relief from unwrapping and re wrapping him in blankets when he needed changes in the night it was turning into something akin to an all night burrito stand I also bought one for my nephew It was ideal for him because he has a clubbed foot and regular footed sleepers would not fit 
5 0 Yellow Sleepsack I have been using these since my son was born and now he is 2 I will keep using them until he outgrows all of the sizes They are fantastic 
5 0 SleepSacks We went from a swaddle blanket to these sleep sacks My daughter loves them She still doesn t know how to use a blanket but doesn t need one with the sleep sack I can t find XL in the stores only online I don t know what to do when she outgrows the XL 
5 0 I Love Knowing My Daughter s Warm Enough These are great I love that I don t have to worry that my baby s going to kick off the covers and freeze in the early hours My note on sizes though Length is often more important than weight My daughter only weighs 22 pounds but she s 32 inches long and she s outgrown the Large so I m buying her the X Large 
5 0 Great heavy weight sleep sack We have several of these in various sizes and fabrics They are all terrific We re using the fleece at night in the winter the quilt during the day in winter and we used the cotton one in the Fall I highly recommend this line of wearable blankets 
5 0 Great product Our first son slept with us and we learned from that mistake with our second Our second son is sleeping in his crib throughout the night but I wanted him to be warm but most importantly safe When he sleeps at night with his sleepsack we feel at ease I highly recommend this product 
5 0 A MUST HAVE After losing one daughter to SIDS I now worry about everything These blankets help ease my mind I have never liked the idea of receiving blankets because a baby can easily move her hands and pull the blank over her head The blankets provide warmth without the risk of going over her head I usually put my daughter in her p j s and the in the blanket but on really warm nights I just put her in this Plus with it being a sack it allows her to move her feet around freely which isn t the case when she wears feet p j s because with all her kicking her legs either get caught up in the croch area or the p j s get twisted around Another benefit is that this is the only product to have the seal of approval from the National SIDS Alliance 
5 0 Good value We picked this up for our 4 month old and so far she seems very happy Sleeps soundly all night and the mattress is firm enough that I m not waking up every five minutes worried about SIDS Read several baby gear buying guides that said a mid range mattress from a well known manufacturer was the way to go and so far I d agree with them 
5 0 much better I originally purchased the sealy baby soft with only 80 gauge coils and it literally folded in half needless to say it was junk I took it back and bought this mattress much better and safely firm and my daughter sleeps great on it Next time I will do my homework 
4 0 No problems with the mattress We recently purchased this mattress for the 3n1 Natural Crib No problems noted with the mattress however our son who is now 6 weeks old doesn t sleep in the crib much just yet 
4 0 Pretty pleased This is a very nice mattress and seems very firm which is good for baby However the vinyl covering is in a blue and white check which can be seen through the sheets This feature is not readily visable in the product photograph unless you select the other pictures feature Also there is a small tear in the binding along the edge of the mattress Our first mattress was white and therefore there is not a pattern to be seen through the sheets A good solution will be to use a mattress pad 
5 0 Great Mattress I have been very happy with this mattress After researching Baby Bargains Consumer Reports and reading all the online reviews I decided on this one Good quality but best of all a perfect fit for the delta luv jenny lind crib Mattress is firm and has the recommended coil number Do your homework and you will find yourself coming back to this mattress 
5 0 Highly Reccommend Bought this about a month ago for my Baby Girl She is 5 months old now and doing much better sleeping with this product I also feel more comfortable knowing she is elevated slightly at night time This product does exactly what it says it does Worth every penny Mr Mom 
5 0 Very little odor We purchased the new Graco hands free diaper pail after our 4th child was born hoping that it would hold in the odor like our Diaper Genie did unfortunately we wasted 49 We used the Diaper Genie on our first 3 children after sampling others and have always come back to the Diaper Genie It is the best in keeping odors in just make sure you change it regularly and you ll love it The Diaper Genie II is better than the twist away style too I would difinitely recommend this product 
5 0 A GREAT BUY The Diaper Genie II works phenomenally I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a baby or is expecting It is easy to use sturdy and does exactly what it says it can it locks in odors and keeps your house from smelling like a used diaper 
5 0 Diaper Genie 2 We d been using a covered garbage can but every time it was opened to deposit another diaper it would take time for the terrible smell to dissipate With this device open or closed we don t smell ANYTHING We couldn t be more pleased with this product 
5 0 much like Safety 1st Neat system Excellent item and well priced Pretty much like the Safety 1st Neat diaper disposal system but with some improvements We got this b c the Safety 1st one was discontinued and we can no longer get refill rings for ours 
4 0 Works great but refills are expensive My old Diaper Champ stunk to high heaven I bought a Diaper Genie II and IT WORKS GREAT The only real downside is the liners don t hold much and they re expensive 6 each which adds up 
5 0 Totally Odorless This is by far the best diaper disposal system out there I have newborn and empty the unit about every 5 days and it is absolutely odorless The trick is to wrap your diapers tightly and kust push the diaper through one clamp single handedly A++ 
5 0 The Genie II ROCKS Experienced the original Diaper Genie with my baby niece about 2 years ago was a royal pain this bottom to load with diapers and to change out the liners And it seemed like the liner needed replacing every couple of days probably due to the twisting sausage effect I received this new Diaper Genie II as a gift for my newborn and WOW It is truly easy to load the liner and I used it from last Wednesday through this Tuesday before needing to empty it Emptying it was as easy as advertised I slipped the liner through the cutter and tied off the top of the dirties and tied the bottom of the liner where we were starting over again At first it took two hands to un snap the lid and get it open because it was new now after a week it has been adequately broken in and it truly is a one handed operation Even though baby is a newborn she s been producing some MASSIVELY stinky diapers Prior to receiving the Genie II we were using a regular trashcan The Genie II has completely contained the smell since it has been in use and my nursery is now blessedly odorless The liner situation is great Diapers do not come in contact with the actual container which is extremely sanitary LOVE IT Also it seems that you can safely stuff a LOT of diapers into each load which is great Bottom line I give my highest recommendation for this product 5 stars PLUS This will be my signature shower gift to others from now on unless I get beaten to it 
5 0 AWESOME Odor Control with 2 in Diapers I love the new and improved Diaper Genie Our original Genie was constantly in need of a new film canister and couldn t keep up with the smell of my two babies diapers 3 months and 2 years old The Genie II on the other hand has had NO ODOR since day one The film also seems to last longer since there is no wasting it by twisting a chunk of film with each diaper This produuct is much easier and effective than the original Genie and I absolutely suggest it to all of my friends FINALLY A diaper pail that actually works 
5 0 Good for those babies who like to suck on their Baby Bjorn My 4 month old loves to suck on her Baby Bjorn and this bib has really been nice I just throw the bib in the wash and my Baby Bjorn is without all the baby drool BRU where I live doesn t carry it so I was so glad to find it on Amazon I didn t even know these bibs existed until I saw another baby in chewing on her Baby Bijorn with one of these bibs on When I ordered this I thought I was getting one bib but they are in a 2 pack 
4 0 It definitely reduces the movement of the car seat base I am not sure at what point I had read that these mats are not a good thing Heard they prevent the seat belt tensioner from working properly But did a lot of research about the Grip It and also it was recommended at a local baby store that is highly regarded We installed our car seat base and had more than the allowed 1 inch of movement so the store recommended this it did eliminate the movement As far preventing seat damage that wasn t one of our goals though that is often one of the pitch lines for these items 
4 0 Not a bad swing Well the main reason I bought this swing is because it plugged into the wall instead of consuming massive amounts of batteries However my son doesn t really like to swing in it yet he just likes to sit there and not move But overall it s a good swing The only reason I gave it four stars is because when it is in motion it only seems to move at one speed regardless of what speed it s set on Great product though 
5 0 It works How much can you write about a high chair My daughter fits in the seat It looks comfortable though I haven t tried it myself yet The tray goes on and off fairly easy with one hand Looking at the hardware though doesn t give me much confidence this will last more than one child The tray insert works well and makes clean up much easier Would be nice if they included 2 inserts but I guess just having one makes sure I clean it sooner My daughter loves the toy that attaches to the tray It really helps keep her amused while we prep her food and she goes out of her way to hunt it down when she s just playing and not in the seat Assembly was fairly easy and the instructions were clear I was amazed they were able to break this down into as many parts as they did If you liked Erector Sets as a kid you ll like putting this together It took about 30 minutes and hardly any foul language 
4 0 Approved by my tough little critic This is a great product and purchasing it at Amazon was a great deal Not only was it the lowest price that I found but I got free shipping and I had it in my hand within 3 days It came in about a million pieces so it does take a little time to set up but the instructions were clear and I found it to be relatively easy to put together The vinyl seat and removable tray make clean up a snap too The real critic was my daughter who is VERY particular about her toys and she loves it She likes to turn herself around to look at the design on the seat cover and she is thoroughly entertained by the jungle toy My one word of caution beware tomatoe sauce on the vinyl it can stain it 
5 0 Love this chair We picked out this chair for our daughter We love it I can put her in it while I m working in the kitchen and she sits in it while we eat dinner She loves that toy 
5 0 my baby loves it i was very happy with this product my baby loves it and its wonderful i can fix his food while he is busy playing 
5 0 Worth the money I know this high chair is a little pricy compared to some simple ones But the pad the color and the toys that come with this high chair make me feel that I bought the right one for our baby You can use this one to feed your baby bottled milk and spoon served solid food I hope my baby will develop good eating habit because of using the high chair We will see 
5 0 Great High Chair I absolutely love this chair The toys keep my baby busy and the chair is very easy to clean up 
5 0 Very Nice My 4 1 2 month baby girl fits well in this I was a bit hesitant at first not being sure if she would fit but it all fits very nicely Make sure you have a decent screwdriver Will take about 30 mins to set it up My last chair was a Grace and that was about 8 years ago and chairs have come a long way Much nicer fit and very smooth to move around if needed The toy was just the icing on the cake Would not even think twice about recommending this This chair is considered one of the best chairs for babies Always do a review on This group bundles up all the reviews from all web sites etc 2 Thumbs WAY Up 
4 0 Great tub at throw away price I bought this tub for my baby who is now almost 11 months I used it since the day we came home from the hospital I used the mesh and it was wonderful The mesh swing seems very flimsy but I used it until my baby was almost 4 months old it held her weight quite well My baby is tall so I do not know if I will be able it to use beyond her 1st birthday I am playing it by the year All in all it is a great tub at a throw away price 
5 0 Happy baths I absolutely love and adore this tub My baby didn t like baths initially until we bought this He can sit back and slouch comfortably while I get him clean He feels absolutely secure and safe and I am able to bathe him quickly and with no fuss It is well designed and has a number of useful details There is the plug which is heat sensitive which will change color to let you know if the water is too hot for your baby a spot to hold the soap and other bathing sundries and the tub itself fits perfectly onto most standard kitchen sinks I like this last feature in particular because I or my husband don t have to crouch or lean over too much while bathing our baby Bathtime is always a pleasure with this tub 
5 0 Great for baby and toddler We love this tub We never bothered with the hammock so I can t comment on it We still use it and she is almost 2 years old We used the reclining side when she was a baby and used the toddler side after she could sit up on her on It is so handy to be able to stand up straight at the kitchen sink and bathe her Before I bought a tub I thought about getting the Primo tub because it had such great reviews However when I saw it in the store it looked gigantic I took a chance on the less expensive First Years tub and I can t imagine anything being better 
5 0 my baby love it great for first time mom we been using this tud for my baby since she is 4wks old she love the tud and the baby can be very safe in the tud her head is always above the water so there is no water going in to her ear she love the tud so much everytime when we get her out she start to cry and if we put her back in she stop great price good for first time mom 
5 0 Great tub I used this tub with my son from newborn on through to early 2 s It was very convenient to give him his bath at our sink so we stuck with it for quite a while The nice thing about this tub is it is deep enough for a newborn to recline and stay warm as well as a toddler to have splashing water I never used the hammock so I have no comment The tub held up nicely and the pads on the bottom stayed stuck down the entire time even with cleaning products 
5 0 Great Pads many uses This set of waterproof pads is very versitle I found it difficult to find bassinette and crib pads and this set has both plus other pads great value 
5 0 I got my sheets to fit I bought these sheets because of other reviews stating the thinner sheets were horrible These on the other hand are nice and soft I washed and dried these sheets because I didn t read the instructions and after reading a few comments that the sheets don t fit after drying decided to break them out to try them for myself Since our baby isn t due for another 6 weeks I didn t have these things out yet because the cat would think I set it up for him Well I only took out the mattress if you will And proceeded to try an put both sheets just to make sure on It is a tight fit but I also figured it would be since bunching around a baby s face is not something I would have wanted anyways Well the sheets do fit at least with the mattress out on my bed rather than in the travel crib itself But it probably would be easier to make it that way anyway Hope this helps 
5 0 COSY CRIB SHEET THAT LITTLE EXTRA PADDING THAT FITS TIGHTLY AND WASHES EASILY SLIGHTLY PRICY BUT WELL WORTH IT 
5 0 Love It This is a great quality sheet It is thicker than the standard pack and play sheets It adds a little more padding for our munchkin We purchased it in navy and have washed it several times The color hasn t faded and it just gets softer with every wash I highly recommend this product 
4 0 my newborn loves this i have a newborn that is extremly picky unlike my first baby and she won t sleep anywhere hardly but because this is padded she will sleep on it i have the packn play that is the bassinet also and this fits great it s alittle expensive that s why i rated it a 4 instead of a 5 becuase not everyone has the money to spend on the extras like this 
4 0 Lots of Space This is a great toy box It holds a ton of toys and is very sturdy 
5 0 Spacious toy box We received this as a gift for my son s 2nd birthday it is GREAT It is large deep and holds a lot of toys outside Durable and has a nice look too Love it 
5 0 Wonderful toy box This is a great toy box I read the reviews about the lid being a problem but all you all to do is take it off or leave it up I have 2 year old twins and I am glad the lid is not attached This lid would end up getting in the way If your child has a lot of toys this toybox has an ample amount of storage space I am very pleased 
5 0 Nice toybox I purchased this toybox 2 nights ago from toysrus It is pretty spacious and sturdy I really do not like the lid though It does not stay up very well It just kind of sits on top of the toy box in these 2 slots It doesn t actually snap into place so my five little boys constantly take it off The drawers on the bottom just slide into an open space under the toybox they are not actually attatched to anything either but they are nice to put the smaller toys in so they don t get lost in the bottom of the toybox 
4 0 Great Buy I purchased this toy box for my son s room The colors are great they match his decor perfectly It is very roomy It holds more toys than I anticipated The two storage bins underneath are a life saver I put all of his small toys in them he can access them easily The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the lid doesn t stay up that well It sometimes fall When he s using his toy box I just take the lid off to prevent accidents 
5 0 Ellaroo Mei Hip I am giving to this carrier 10 stars I was using it for 2 5 years and absolutely love it My two babies love it too Highly reccomend this carrier 
5 0 I loved it I have been using the Mei Hip since my son was 7 months old for 5 months I love Ella Roo products I also have the Mei Tai The key to comfort is to spread the strap across the shoulder so the weight is distributed It makes running errands and work around the house so much easier It positions your baby at the hip so you have more range of motion than if he was on your belly chest as with other carriers I fully recommend the mei hip Though I would wait until your baby can hold his head up well as there is no head support so it is not for new babies 
5 0 Perfect for baby transitioning to the bath tub I bought the Snug Tub Deluxe when my baby outgrew her infant tub that she had to lay down in She was slipping and sliding all over the big tub so this was the perfect solution to allow her to sit and play in a smaller more comfortable area than the full tub Easy to use dries quickly worked great for us 
5 0 Safe and fun Our 6 month old loves the tub It is convenient for us and saves water Right now he stays occupied with the build in squeaky toy while we wash him clean It fits nicely and seems to be pretty sturdy and well made 
5 0 Fantastic tub This tub is an excellent transition tub for a baby too big for those little plastic tubs but too small for the big tub It is spacious enough for our 11 month old to play and he is a big 11 month old and provides nice soft sides so that when he slips he doesn t bang his head on the hard sides of the tub We got the deluxe with the toys but I think they are more entertaining to me than to him I wish that we had skipped the traditional plastic tub and went straight to this Great buy 
5 0 We LOVE this tub Our toddler had this tub when he turned 7 months old until about a year and a half old when our cat punctured it It was so fantastic that we bought it again for our next baby This tub is the perfect size is comfortable and safe because it s inflated travels nicely and our kids love it Our 2 1 2 year old still wants to use his sister s tub a few nights a week 
4 0 Good alternative to hard plastic tubs I love that this is a soft tub No hard platic egdes The other problem I had with a traditional infant tub was that my baby outgrew it to fast I use this tub with a bath sling for my baby that cannot sit up on her own yet When she can sit on her own I will use the tub alone I have one complaint The suction cup that is used to hang the tub fell off after minimal use and I can not get it back on 
4 0 Great tub Like the other reviewer I needed something my daughter could splash around in while I took a shower By the way I m sure neither of us leave our children unattended We want our children to accompany us as we bathe so I purchased this tub as she had grown out of her other tubs It is a great tub It is large in size but we have a very large shower so it works great for us It does work great in the regular tub too My daughter can t wait to climb in The only drawback is mine got a tear in the side but we had it for a while so I m going to purchase another one You also can t find inflatable tubs very easily I highly recommend this tub 
5 0 Perfect answer EDITED for follow up Well everything I said below is true but now 10 months later the tub has developed it s 3rd leak so we have to inflate it every night with a foot pump I m giving up and ordering another one Not bad for every day use for 10 months though My original review When our large 6 month old outgrew her tub we looked around at other inflatable tubs only to realize that the diameter they gave was for the outside so once it was inflated the actual tub size was even smaller than the infant tub we were using We couldn t find the snug tub in any of the stores Babies R Us carries their own brand Baby Depot and Target only carried the Munchkin duck tub which is so small With our 70 year old cast iron tub we definitely liked the idea of the inflatable tub to protect her little head from harm She loves bath time so we wanted to make it as safe as possible Well this tub is the answer It is everything the reviewers have said convenient blow up once and store with suction hook big lots of room for toys and splashing secure fits very snugly thus the name and the bonus is obviously that you can travel with it And if you pay the couple of dollars more to get the Snug Tub Deluxe versus the Snug Tub you get the toys Not that I cared but she really does love the squeaking fish So bath with peace of mind and have fun with the little one 
5 0 Great learning tool These toys are great Easy to use They even taught my 2 year old how to not only blow but I think it indirectly taught her how to blow her nose too Will be a toy for years to come in the tub 
5 0 Great product My daughters ages 4 and 1 received these for Christmas and absolutely love them I do as well They are very easy to use Fill with different levels of water and play different notes Very cool idea for a toy We haven t tried actually playing songs since they love making their own music with them Really great bath toy 
4 0 Great toy I love the Einstein toys and this is no exception My daughter is 6 months old and likes to listen to the music look into the mirror and chew on the fins The only problem I have is that it is a little heavy for her to pick up yet But as you can see in the picture I submitted she likes playing with it on level ground just fine 
5 0 Snuggle Nest is best purchase The best purchase I mae for my newborn He is cosleeping with us and it fits perfectly in between my husband and I Also the insert fits in his moses basket and crib Great because of the incline for his upper body Sleeps and sleeps seems super cozy Worth the money 
5 0 Peaceful Nights Sleep Our first night home with our daughter we planned on her sleeping in her basinette next to the bed Just before putting her to sleep our cat jumped in the basinette and I was distraught thinking that she would do this again when the baby was asleep in it Because we have a soft mattress I couldn t bear the thought of my daughter sleeping with us so I spend a sleepless night in the recliner with her on my chest First thing the next day we went to the store and bought the snuggle nest The selling points for use were the size and the light It fit perfectly between us on our king size bed and the light allows me to breastfeed and change the baby without overstimulating her And because I had had a c section it was wonderful not getting out of bed all the time Two weeks later I was ready to put her in the bassinette again The best part was because of its size the nest fits in it perfectly My daughter never knew the difference between bed and basinette I am planning on using it to transition her to the crib as well I would recommend this product to anybody that wants to co sleep had a c section or just wants to provide a snug place for their little one to sleep without worry 
4 0 Same concept diffrent product I have the Safety first bed So I can t comment on this exact product but the idea of it is still the same After having a c s I was wiped out and in pain I didn t want to get out of bed and I had planned on having my son sleep with me I was scared of course to share a bed with an infant so we bought one of these beds I love it Mine has a nightlight at the top that comes in really handy If you want to co sleep you need this 
5 0 Great for more than just co sleeping Being a first time parent I wasn t sure exactly how to go about co sleeping Although I knew I wanted some type of device to keep my baby a bit secure I could have never imagined I d be so pleased or have so many uses for this cozy little bed The obvious use is in bed with parents It is a perfect fit our full size bed admittedly we re not the kind of people who feel the need for lots of room to spread out The sides of the bed are just high enough and sturdy enough to give you feel of being next to baby without the feel of rolling on top of baby The light on the bed is perfect for a quick peek I also put my daughter in this nest during nap time The sleep positioners keep her feeling snuggled and cozy It s also convenient if you re the type of parent who likes to have baby near at all times This little bed can be carried from one room to another without waking baby I found it wonderful for transitioning to the crib I simply placed the nest in the crib and she felt right at home Finially this is the perfect little bed to bring along for travel I would strongly suggest this item to anyone interested in co sleeping 
5 0 The Best Thing Ever MY baby had slpt in our bed since the day we brought her home from the hospital But I my husband and I were always afaid of squishing her and she tended to want to sleep glued on to me wich wasn t to comfortable let alone safe I was searching on line one day and came across this on another web site I instantly knew that this was what I wanted I shopped around and found a different brand of this type of bed and ordered it it does not have a sleep positioner but i amhappy about that since my baby hated hers and mine also has a foot rest on the botton so that the baby cant oooze out The only problem with this is we have a queen size bed and there is barley enough room in it for all of us but we make due and this would fit great in a king size bed My little girl loves this thing and sleeps better through the night in it and she can sleep close to me with being practally on top of me I would recomned this to any parent who wants to co sleep with their baby but wants a little piece of mind as for people who are against co sleeping then this is not a product for yo 
5 0 Reassuring handy luxurious Our baby wasn t sleeping too well in her bassinet when we first brought her home Being first time parents we were afraid to bring her into bed with us for fear of smushing her So we went to Babies R Us and found this purely by accident Yes the price is a little high for what we use mostly as just a sleep positioner but we love that it folds up for travel We are planning to skip the bassinet for a few upcoming trips and just take this with us We have a queen sized bed and it is a bit snug for the three of us to fit but we can do it Now she is tolerating the bassinet so we ve moved the nest to her bassinet It inclines and sometimes she wiggles down but she is still positioned on her back It comes with TWO sheets which is great It has a handy LED nightlight for quick pacifier replacement or covert diaper checks The bedding is firm but comfy I am very happy with the product and I would recommend it to others It s a pretty new product otherwise I would have put it on my registry when I was still pregnant 
5 0 We LOVE this set Although the hippopotamus is my daughters favorite there isn t a toy here she doesn t like Highly recommended We have tons of fun 
5 0 Love this wrap I tried a couple other slings that didn t work for me I didn t like the over the shoulder baby holder type one because I could never get it right I have a snuggly type one which was okay but still hard on my back This one is lengthy but worth it once you have used it and become quick at it I found if I want to work on the computer it is great he sleeps on my chest snuggled up and I can type with both hands I have not tried to nurse in it so I am not sure how well that works I have used it front and tummy facing My husband even wore it while cooking and found it handy 
5 0 Must Have First off there is not one baby carrier that does it all This wrap is absolutely amazing however I would recommend it for when you will need your hands free for an extended period of time I use it for walks traveling and around the house if my baby just wants that close contact or is fussy Once you get the hang of how to wrap this you can get them in and out in just over a min My baby takes super long naps when in this and is so comfy and so am I My other carrier that I have hurts my back after awhile and I suffer for days never with this carrier There are so many positions for this too I found a website with a European carrier that shows better pictures and one more position same idea I also found that it is easiest to put it on when first folding the wrap in half lengthwise then spreading it out when secure Though it is not as easy to nurse with the baby in this carrier it is pretty easy to take them out and put them back once you are used to the sling If I had it my way I would have this for long periods up and about and fussy babies or for those with bad backs a sling for newborns and nursing and a backpack only for short trips like laundry or carrying groceries up If I had to pick one however this above all would be it One more thing it is ok to wear this in warm weather just dress accordingly you and your baby The pocket is a plus as well Oh and I do find it easier once on to get baby in and out of than a back pack or front carrier This also is suitable right off the bat for new borns and many stages there after 
5 0 the best carrier you will ever own I bought this carrier b c i saw my midwives carrying their babies in it at the maternity center they highly recommended it well i bought it our son has been in this carrier since he was born in October we are in april and he still rides in it and he weighs almost 19lbs and babies that are in these types of carriers seem to be the happiest they spend 40 weeks with you what makes you think when they are born they want to be away from you it s also great for babies with colic it is the best wrap EVER 1 this creates no pressure points at all you DON T feel it in your shoulders or lower back as a massage therapist i highly recommend it b c it does not ruin your posture i do feel his weight in my thighs which for me is fine my legs are getting stronger 2 i breastfeed him with the shoulder strap hovering over my breast while i hold him in my arms wherever we go restaurants etc and people never notice they think he is sleeping 3 you can put the baby in different positions 4 they take the best naps in it 5 be prepared for all the attention and questions as to where you bought it and how it feels 6 it it soo easy to put on but you MUST WATCH THE VIDEO it comes with once you get the hang of it it a breeze i put it on in less than 30 seconds 7 and instead of looping the wrap through the rings to hold it in place i just tie it into a knot 8 you have TWO free hands ENJOY 
5 0 Best ever I had to buy this baby wrap through e bay because amazon would not ship outside the US My baby loves it we flew from Dublin to London both ways and you would not have know that there was a baby on the flight because she slept through the whole journey She just loves it she falls asleep everytime I put her in it She is just over 2 months old and weighs nearly 11 pounds It s so comfortable I actually went on a 1 mile walk with her the other day and did not feel the strain on my shoulders I tried the other baby carriers the regular ones and that was like hell luckily I had only borrowed it and had not bought one it dug into my shoulders and left me aching for a day The wrap is soft it keeps the baby warm in the winter and cool in the summer as it s made out of cotton and lycra Most importantly it s comfortable to wear for both Mum Dad and Baby Highly recommended I usually don t write reviews but I just had to mention something about the wrap because I m absolutely over the moon with it By the way it s really easy to put on it only took me a couple of minutes to get the hang of it 
5 0 We love it I never had much luck with traditional baby carriers The ones I tried were uncomfortable to wear and hurt my back and shoulders It also never seemed like my daughter got truely comfortable I love this wrap because it of it s versatility which is something most carriers lack and is reasonably priced The Soft stretchy fabric which is great provides even weight distribution and makes my daughter feel safe and secure After watching the dvd using the wrap is very easy and practical My daughter especially likes the front facing position it really lets her explore the world I do believe using the wrap has allowed us to bond much more in great new ways After searching and testing various products this is the best I highly recommend this product 
5 0 Calms my son immediately My son is now 3 months old and has had a rough go with acid reflux He loves to be held and especially upright He hated my Snuggli like the baby Bjorn and I needed my hands free with two older children It is so comfortable and doesn t hurt my back and shoulders the way the front carrier did I get comments on everywhere I go They all want to know where I got it and thought it was quite a fashion statement I wouldn t hesitate to buy this wrap I was intimidated before I ordered it wondering if I would be able to figure it out The instructional DVD is so easy to follow I only had to watch it twice through and haven t given it another look 
5 0 The BEST Bottles I spent alot of money trying out new bottles with various different nipples sizes These are by far the best bottles on the market I have read the feeback other people left about the bottles leaking and extra cleaning parts but the bottles perform really well I have never had a leaking issue with them and cleaning is not a big deal considering what the product delivers The bottle helps reduce the air and gasiness babies get from regular feeding bottles including the over rated Playtex drop ins The Drop ins are too costly and still get air inside them if you set the bottle down 
5 0 Best bottles Dr Brown s bottles are the best We tried everything else and wasted a lot of time and money Do not waste your time and buy Dr Brown s bottles 
5 0 Great Bottle These new wide neck Dr Browns are a great updated version of the skinny original bottles I like the nipple shape much better it is easy to transition from the breast to this bottle Very easy to clean as well 
5 0 Best Bottles in the World My daughter tried several bottles for our granddaughters who both had acid reflux These are the greatest bottles and only bottles that helped them with the gas and upset stomaches They also are great if you need to add cereal to their milk because of the acid reflux The wide bottles are great for this You should only fill the bottles up to the 8oz line and you won t have any problems with the bottles leaking I would recommend these bottles to anyone and especially parents with acid reflux babies 
5 0 The BEST Bottles I originally purchased Avent everything bottle warmer microwave steam sterilizer etc and therefore thought the bottles would be great However the Avent bottles leaked everywhere and you could hear my son sucking in tons of air when he ate causing a tremendous amount of gas etc Because I had used Avent I bought the wide neck Dr Brown bottles and they have been a life saver I threw all of my Avent bottles away The Dr Brown bottles NEVER leak and my son rarely has any gas and is so much happier I also nurse him and these nipples seem to fit my son s little mouth similarly to the breast The bottles are also easy to clean just one more easy step than other bottles 
4 0 Now I can see my baby I bought this mirror because it was on sale and I m glad I did The mirror is very large and I can see my son clearly without having to shift or strain like I did with a previous mirror The colours are also bright and attractive and get his attention as soon as I put him in the seat he seems to talk to the butterfly incessantly Although It does not play music and light up like some other mirrors he has a few car seat toys that will also distract him well enough when he looses interest in the mirror I gave it only four stars because it was a bit difficult to install in my particular car My middle seat does not have a headrest to attach it to nor does it have a latch so I had to resort to using some pins to keep it in place But all in all a great item 
5 0 Mrs Potty Mom in Winter Springs FL I saw this on fisher price sight and I fell in love with it I was able to find it Toys r us store My 3 y o daughter seems to love it too It comes with a carry on so you can take it anywhere I usually keep it in the back of my suv It s especially very convenient when there is no place to stop when she really has to go I just pull over in a parking lot open it and she sits in it and goes It helps avoid accidents in her car seat The only drawback though is that it has a built in cup It s not removable My daughter doesn t seem to mind it I don t know if fisher price makes one for little girls 
4 0 Good could be great My 3 year old daughter received this as a Christmas gift The basket canned goods and produce pieces are very nice The boxes however are very flimsy hollow cardboard and are showing wear after only three days of play so I know they won t last long At this price I don t expect wooden boxes but solid cardboard construction would be a better design for the age range to which this set is marketed My daughter likes this set very much and I think it will give her lots of enjoyment while it lasts 
5 0 extremely durable I have owned two of these warmers for about 5 years now they have been consistently plugged in and they are STILL working These gadgets make it so much easier to pull wipes out when you need them and they are also nice and warm for the baby I love the fact that you can use any type of baby wipe in them and if the wipes happen to dry out you can add ordinary water to the warmer to rehydrate them Excellent investment 
5 0 Every Parent Needs At Least One This warmer is a must have It stops most of the squirming and fighting over changes once your child gets past the newborn stage The wipes are nice and warm but not shockingly hot I would suggest adding the 1 2 cup of water to the container if you live in a dry climate I like this model because it does NOT have a built in night light eventually the light will become attractive to toddlers It also works very well with any type of wipe pop ups and singles I wish they had portable ones 
5 0 We love this wipe warmer I bought this wipe warmer for my son right after he was born because he hated diaper changes So I thought that it was the coldness of the wipes that upset him My son is now 4 months old and ever since we got it we have had no problems with quot fits quot during diaper changes Not 1 It doesn t stay quot hot quot very long after you take it out of the warmer but it is still warm I have never had a problem with it and would reccommend it to everyone especially mom s with boys 
5 0 Great product definate must for multiple births This is one of the best gifts we received for our twins Both girls cried horribly when the cold wipes touched their bottoms Which is horrible for those middle of the night changes when you want to disturb them as little as possible Grant you the wipes don t stay hot for very long but they do take the chill out As for quot drying out quot the wipes the instructions say to add about 1 4 cup of water if needed which works great We ve only had to add water once and that was to a cheap brand of wipes that weren t very wet to begin with I definately recommend this to mothers of multiples I plan to buy another to keep downstairs our nursery is on the second floor for those in between changes 
5 0 my son stays calm during changings when i had my oldest i did not have this product he often got upset when being changed which resulted in him crying it always took a while to calm him down i recieved this as a gift and was pleasently suprised my wipes never turn brown or dry out as long as i use a thick wipe such as huggies wipes my son s tooshie stays warm and it also wipes off easier the result is having your child staying calm and happy i do think it works a billion times better than holding it in your hand and who wants to hold them in your hand to warm when so often you need one right after another i think it s not a luxery but a necessity 
4 0 Pretty satisfied so far I just received this warmer as a shower gift I was hesitant to register for it in the beginning because of so many negative reviews However after trying it out I ve found that it is a pretty decent product It s true that the wipes are warm only for a couple of seconds but really how long does it take to wipe a baby off The owners manual states that the warmer is not meant to produce hot wipes I think it is great to have something to remove the chill from the wipes which should be comforting to the baby When I first used it I didn t add the water as suggested in the manual just to see how it would work The wipes did start to dry out after awhile but then I added the 1 2 cup of water and haven t noticed any more drying All of the wipes are still moist I haven t noticed any discoloration either and I am using Huggies wipes My baby hasn t arrived yet but I wanted to try this out to see for myself how well it did or did not work I think when he does get here in a couple of weeks he will be thankful that I used a decently warm wipe instead of a cold one 
5 0 Wonderful Product I recieved this warmer as a Christmas gift when my daughter was a month old I think its great I haven t had trouble with the wipes getting dry but for those who have please note the owners manual which says to add some water to keep the wipes from getting dry No the wipes don t stay warm for long but the idea of this product is to take the chill off the wipes not make them hot I don t have any complaints with this product and I have recommended it to seveal of my friends I feel it is a definite must have 
4 0 Great thing to have This is great especially for that first trip home from the hospital The head rest that comes with car seats doesn t compare This provides full body support and gives baby that secure feeling As long as you use it properly it is safe to use and allows you to properly secure seat straps 
4 0 Baby grows out of this quickly I enjoyed this for my baby But they grow out of this rather quickly 
4 0 Comfortable for infant a little too warm The Snuzzler is perfect for newborns and provides comfort and warmth to a tiny little body in the car seat or stroller Since we re in a warm climate though my baby seems to sweat on the back of his head 
4 0 Very good product for Baby Jogger Stroller This support can be used in almost anything bouncers swing and strollers I bought it to use in my Baby Jogger stroller and it works wonderfully There is actually a Snuzzler designed specifically for Baby Jogger which costs more This is the same product without the Baby Jogger brand name and costs almost 15 less I gave only 4 stars because the head support is kind of thick and pushed my baby s head forward so I removed it But she was already 3 months old when I bought it so it might work well for newborns 
5 0 a must buy for newborns When we brought our daughter home all we had was one of those tiny little head supports Well as she was only 6lbs at birth it wasn t very good support for her A freind bought this for her and we love it I don t have to worry about her sliding around in her carseat at all It kinda hugs them She is snug as a bug in there I love this and would recommend this to everyone to bring their newborn home in 
5 0 Excellent My son was a big baby checking in at over 9 pounds and 22 inches but the headrests that came with the carseat still didn t offer enough support We were fortunate to have received this product at our baby shower He looked so cozy with the fleece side cuddling him and he was very well supported Now that it s over 80 degrees we ve flipped it over to use the cooler fabric and he still loves it My son is almost 8 weeks old so we tried taking it out of our carseat and just using the headrest that came with the carseat But it still doesn t offer enough support Once he falls asleep his little head just hung over the side so we put the snuzzler back in and he s much happier It is a bit trickier to get the car seat straps safely adjusted around the support but after a few days we had the hang of it 
5 0 The Best Thing Ever The snuzzler is one of my favorite things to use for my preemie son He was a larger preemie coming home at 6 lbs but it s still a great help as he was still small It makes car rides enjoyable for him I think he feels cuddled by it just as we cuddle him It s also great to sit him in if he s having a rough night sleeping we ll sit him in his carseat and within minutes he s out like a light 
4 0 Great Toy Distraction We got this for our son when he was 5 months because going out to restrauants were getting too much IT lasted all the way up to a year and a half This model has a ferris wheel design It contains a hologram fish scene a rattle touch and feel fabric around a ball and fish toy It does come off easily and doesn t pivot like the rocking horse model but will hold baby s interest Put this together with a bunch of others to have the time to eat and actually get things done 
5 0 AWESOME My baby LOVES this toy 4 Months old and I bring it with us when we go out He falls to sleep quickly when I just set it in front of him and rotate it around he hears the rattles and it soothes him The fish has beads in it the cylinder thing has a spiral around it which facinates him along with little stars which make a neat rattle The round sphere has a mirror in it which swivels along with little ribbon pieces that stick out making a little more touch feel interest and the flat piece has a holographic fish on it that swims when you move it All in all it is his favorate toy It does a good job when suctioned to a glass top table but will come off anything else Oh well 
4 0 fun play toy My daughter enjoys playing with this toy but like every suction cupped toy or bowl I have tried with her she can get them off So she is talented what can I say Just kidding She does trully like to play with it whether it is still stuck to the table or not 
4 0 Good quality sturdy design very nice gate very sturdy good quality would be good to keep small children or animals out or in an area It didnt work for me I bought it to keep my ferrets contained but the gaps are to big under gate and at opposite hinge side it does keep the dogs contained though 
5 0 Great for small dogs I got this gate for my two Miniature Pinschers and I love it I use it as a pressure mount in a doorway I previously had one of those plastic ones with all the holes but I opted for this one not only for the look but for the safety It is virtually impossible for the dogs to climb over it It does get scratched very easily but that doesnt bother me I expected it with two small dogs scratching at it when they want out Overall I was impressed with the design and how well made it is I would recommend this to anyone with small dogs as long as you dont mind the scratches 
5 0 Gate has lasted 2 years and counting Love this gate we have 2 blocking stairs and kitchen One comment on installation you MUST use the measure tape ruler they provide to locate where the gate hinges are fastened to the wall that s why the top will pop out on an earlier review Eyeballing it is not the way to fasten it There are specific heights to install that make this gate safe Will be purchasing one for the top of the stairs as well and have no doubt it will be fine They provide good long screws so as long as you have a banister or stud you ll be fine 
5 0 I Love it It was really easy to install and I think it looks alot nicer than other gates It is very easy to open and close 
5 0 Wonderful product I actually ordered this as a pet safety gate for a new puppy This is so easy to use And no damaging the door frame with hardware Very sturdy no problems with it staying in place Also lightweight easy to handle 
5 0 Very sturdy gate I loved this gate so much I bought two I use one mounted to the wall and the other is tension mount without the hardware either way they both work great for keeping our little monster off the stairs Highly recommended 
5 0 Bumber pad would not fit on baby crib The product was fine it would not fit on the baby bed I had because it has sold head foot ends on crib When I ordered the bumber pad it did not indicate that it would not fit only slatted baby cribs 
5 0 Breathable Bumper This item has been a lifesaver We no longer have to get up in the middle of the night to put arms legs pacifiers or toys back into the crib I don t remember how we got by without one with our first 
4 0 useful the bumper is useful in that in prevents our son from getting his arms and legs through the crib slats on a regular basis while providing a breathable barrier in case he rolls over with his face against the bumper my only complaint is that it slides down fairly easily especially when baby gets his leg on top of it while laying on his side not standing or grabs it it needs to be readjusted and tightened frequently nevertheless we sleep better knowing he doesn t have his face in a thick quilted bumper and it is really beathable i put my own nose and mouth to it before installation to check 
4 0 Not the best but it works The only complaint I really have about this bumper is that no matter how tight you manage to get it it still slides down and needs to be redone every couple days 
5 0 Great This was a life saver Our little one likes to move around the crib but she couldn t figure out how to get unstuck when her arm or leg went through the crib slate We have a crib that turns into a headboard footboard and it still works great 
5 0 Great Product This is a great product It not only saves your seats from the indentations that the car seats leave but they also catch a lot of food from messy kids My sister my mom and I have all purchased these for our cars and we all love them 
4 0 Great Seat Saver I bought two of these seat savers for my Honda Odyssey to accommodate Britax Marathon carseats Yes the bases are wide but isn t that the point The non slip surface on the underside grips the leather very well and my car seats have no slip and slide when latched in and secured The front flap is great for keeping melting snow and ice and general muck from my kid s shoes off the front of the seat I wished I d bought a third for the infant car seat 
5 0 A seat savior No more nasty indentions in your seats No more out of control chocolate milk spills I purchased the StageSeat Saver for my brand new SUV mainly because my daughter eats like a caveman no offense to any living neaderthals She can now enjoy a beverage and snack without getting crumbs all over the floor and seat below her carseat The Seat Saver does a wonderful job containing ALL spills and can be removed and cleaned very easily It is made of a hard rubber material and does not move around once your child s carseat is securely fastened It also has a lower flap that sits low enough so that your toddlers muddy shoes will not scuff up the front edges of your vehicle s seats I recommend this for ALL car seats in your vehicle 
4 0 Very satisfied I was somewhat hesitant to purchase after reading the review describing how the seat would become loose or could not be secured tightly But the other reviews seemed positive so I decided to give it a try I did not have any problems I was able to secure the seat very tightly with no movement at all 
5 0 Love it We bought one of these a month after our daughter was born 2 years ago and it has worked perfectly We have a Tahoe with leather seats and before we got this her seat moved around to much no matter how tight the seat belt was Since we have started using this her carseats have been fine they stay tight with this and don t move around I am going to buy another one for our second child 
4 0 Diaper Champ It is simpler than I thought it would be No diaper sausage like with the diaper genie We use scented bags to curb the smell a little extra I would definitey recommend it to anyone 
5 0 Great Product Ive used this for 2 months now and it is great The very best feature is that you can use any type of bag A great way to use up all those plastic grocery bags It holds a lot of diapers and does a great job of containing the odor of course you must empty it every few days or they will begin to smell 
4 0 Get One it definetely helps I planned to get one for my second child n i had girl this time I thought of color pink as best To get DiaperChamp in pink color made me happy Its excellent choice I wud recommend to get one it will make life easy for u with all diaper work 
5 0 No odor and actually easy to use My husband and I bought a diaper champ instead of getting refills for our diaper genie This is very easy to use one handed uses 8 gallon bags that we have around the house and blocks the odor MUCH better than the diaper genie ever did I highly recommend this to all diaper using households 
5 0 Easy One Handed Use Uses REGULAR kitchen trash bags This thing is a dream come true It operates with one hand Drop the soiled diaper into the opening With a flick of the wrist the diaper is gone It s THAT simple Love this thing And it uses regular 13 gallon size kitchen bags No special bags to buy This is in my top 10 new baby necessities 
4 0 Great Product My 2 year old is starting the potty training process It s the perfect size The only thing that could make it better is if it wrapped around the toilet a little further That way he could stand closer to the toilet when he pees I don t think you ll find a step stool like that so this is the next best thing 
5 0 great buy I keep this step in my sons bathroom along with the Bjorn toilet seat The simple design makes it so easy to clean and use Ive learned my lesson with the cheaper step stools made of thin plastic or cheap wood and wont purchase them again I love how sturdy the design is I also use this stool to sit on next to the tub while bathing my son saves my back 
5 0 Good little stool This stool is working fine for us It is stable and safe non slip and it is nice and small so I can move it out of the way easily and light weight so my 2 year old son can easily move it into place by himself I am not sure that I couldn t have found a similiar stool for less money but I like the fact that it s just plain black and white and it doesn t look tacky in the guest bath I did try a couple of the wooden steps and they were too big and heavy and I couldn t move them out of the way Plus they were more expensive than this one The only complaint I have about this stool is I wish it was about an inch taller so that my son s feet could rest flat footed on it when he s on the toilet Otherwise it s a good little stool 
5 0 Infantino Giggle ball set Love this set of toys great for the babys to teeth on and work on cordination my grand son just loves this set so happy I found it 
5 0 A lot of fun to my baby Upppss my four months old son doesn t stop to play with these toys He loves the crab 
5 0 Great I received this mattress to use in my davinci Valerie crib and it fits perfect It s very sturdy can be wiped off easily with a cloth when accidents happen I am very confident that my baby girl will be super comfy on this mattress 
5 0 WOW My son has had this mattress for over 2 years now and its form is still great He wont sleep anywhere else other than his bed We now use it for his toddler bed and I have layed down on it a few times pretending to nap and believe it is more comfortable than my bed It is a really full mattress that offers great support for our little ones spines That is why we purchased our second one for our new daughter I know my son isnt ready to give his bed up 
5 0 This little turtle creats a MOOD My Daughter and I LOVE this I actually saw this before I was pregnant and loved it because I love Turtles I always said I would buy this I know that it s a bit pricey for what it is but I justified it by making it my daughters gift for her first Christmas she was only 1 month old I put her to bed with it turned on in blue light and play soft relaxing music She honestly goes down pretty well It casts starts across her crib and up her walls and both my mom and husband complimented on how soothing I made her night time the only thing is that the Amber light doesn t seem to work well in showing the stars but there is Blue and Green There is actually star constellations that it casts and it comes with a little book showing which ones they are 
5 0 Just Adorable As soon as I saw it I fell in love with it I bought it for my baby s room thinking it would only shine the stars on the ceiling but after receiving it not only shines on the ceiling but the walls too It is real soft and light weight and at night the stars give off just enough light to make any child feel comfortable The amber light is not that bright but the other colours are vibrant This is a great product that I would recommend to anyone 
5 0 My 2 year old loves it We were very happy with the Turtle My 2 year old loves to play with it and we like to steal it and try to find the constellations The Amber does not show up unless it is really dark but the blue and green work perfect 
5 0 The Greatest Nightlight After reading the reviews both good and bad I could not wait to get this product and when it came today I had to try it out The stars are great It is just a nightlight so if you are expecting something elaborate of the night sky think again It is hard over the shell and the rest of the body is plush but it is not a toy Just cute to look at I think all of the light settings are great Blue is the brightest and amber is the dimmest but they all look great in a dark room If you want a fancy nightlight go for it Worth all the mone 
5 0 turtle night light I purchased this for my granddaughter s 6th birthday She requested it She really enjoys having it in her room at night It makes a night sky on her ceiling I am getting one for my nephew next month for his 5th birthday 
4 0 POTTY SEAT this was for my granddaughter and her mother loves it so convenient to just fold and take with you when your little one has to use a public bathroom 
5 0 Great traveling seat This has been the most convient traveling potty seat we have used Unlike other ones it has a place toward the front for your little one s hands and prevents your child s legs from coming in contact with the filthly seat It is also very compact We have used it on all kinds of toilet seats and have never had a problem with it sliding of the seat or pinching legs like some of the other reviews state The thing to remember is that it needs to be placed all the way to the front of the toilet seat so the lip on the front of the folding seat secures it If you try to place it on like the seats used at home then yes you will have problems When used correctly this seat is great 
5 0 I love this folding potty I love the PRIMO Folding Potty It is the best It is so compact and easy to carry with me when I take my son to the stores or restaurants I haven t had any problems finding toilets that it doesn t work on My son finds it very secure especially when he can hold on to the handles I love the fact that he has handles to hold onto instead of the dirty toilet bowl It is very sturdy and easy to clean 
4 0 Great for the price I bought this item when it was on sale for only eight dollars and change although it had mostly bad reviews and low star rating I live in a approx 1900 sq foot home and from one end to the other it picked up with almost no static what so ever For the price I payed it gets the job done well 
4 0 Works Great I really like this monitor You can see if the baby is moving even before they start to cry Really good 
4 0 Very sensitive monitor This monitor was initially indispensable in caring for our twins The default channel had too much static to use but once we switched over to the B setting that stopped being a problem I can hear everything through the monitor even being able to distinguish between my two children breathing I love the option to turn off the sound and see whether the babies are noisy one of my girls HATED bedtime until she was a few months old and this allowed us to let us see whether she was still crying after 5 minutes without having to go in the room or listen to the I hate bedtime screaming After nine months of daily use the receiver stopped working but this is decent value for the price I found that the Safety First monitor I bought picked up the sounds from this one s base but with increased sensitivity It would have been nice if the nightlight could be turned on without the monitor relaying sound but the option to turn the nightlight off is fine 
5 0 Best Baby Bathtub This tub is worth every penny It is large but I keep it under the crib where it s out of the way and easily accessed The best thing about this tub is how it holds a small baby in place while you bathe him or her My baby is 4 weeks old but I m sure I ll continue to like it as he grows 
4 0 AWSOME ALL AROUND CARRIER We love this carrier We live in Seattle and need a carrier for all kinds of trips We are both happy with this purchase I am 5 2 and my husband is 6 0 and we can both use it with ease very comfortable for us and our daughter Just a FYI you really need 2 people to put it on and take it off safetly That carrier has MASSIVE STORAGE Very good all around carrier Very good price 
5 0 Son VERY pleased with the carrier This was a Christmas gift for my son and his wife They have a 20 month old daughter and were expecting a new baby this month she has since been born My son was VERY pleased and excited about this particular carrier He had seen one somewhere but he said this one was even better and was looking forward to using it for their older daughter on their next outting as a family 
5 0 Greatly enjoyed Our 9 month old daughter greatly enjoys the view from the backpack We have used it in the grocery store in the airport and on walks There is plenty of storage so that I did not need a carry on in the airport 
5 0 Our 9 month loves to ride in this We purchased this in anticipation of our trip to Yellowstone next year The pack is very comfortable when adjusted correctly I find that if you adjust it right most of the weight is placed on your hips Our 9 month old girl loves to ride in it She even fell asleep once She seems to like the rhythm of our walk and even sings as she gets bounced around We were worried that she wouldnt like it because she can be a pretty difficult baby she was born with acid reflux However we have had it for several months now and she makes no complaint when we load her up She doesnt even mind sitting in the pack when it is on the ground I have very short hair and the baby likes to try to grab it too short to really grab Interesting enough she never tries to grab my wife s hair I would suppose that you may want to invest in a hat if your baby likes to pull hair There are lots of pockets although if you are wearing the pack the pockets are very difficult to access even the ones on the hip The hip pockets seem too far back I have a 38 waist My wife has a smaller waist and doesnt seem to have the problem with the waist pockets that I do When taking off the pack the baby seemed secure and getting her on and off was no problem We dont use the hood Its not too difficult to put on Just takes a little time to figure it out I am 5 10 and the waist belt at near the lowest setting is just right for me My wife is 5 7 and she likes the waist belt setting near the middle top At first it felt awkward walking with the weight but after a couple of walks we got used to it Now we fight for who gets to wear the pack when we walk Im glad we got the pack We cant wait till we get to load her up at Yellowstone 
5 0 Perfect snug fit with velcro to ensure it stays in place Great product that fits the co sleeper mattress pad perfectly I loved the velcro on the sheet to ensure that it stayed in place on the mattress pad and to ensure that the pad stayed in place in the crib co sleeper Highly recommend 
5 0 A godsent Superb product I cannot say enough positive things about this item I absoloutely loved the fact that it helped to keep my son warm on cool nights but it was safe enough for him to use in his crib every night This item needs to be brought mainstream so that it can be available to all parents for their kids 
5 0 they re great I got four of these sleepsacks two fleece and two cotton I found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes but it didn t effect the product They are wonderful If you are buying for a newborn get the 6 12 month size since it ll last a bit longer I ended up giving away the 0 6 month size when my baby was only 3 months old as it was getting a bit small 
5 0 five stars is not enough My son has been wearing the halo sleep sack since the day he came home from the hospital Being a winter baby it was the best thing in the world to know that he would be warm and not have to worry about loose blankets He began sleeping through the night at 7 weeks old I think the sleep sack gives him a feeling of security He was never able to sleep without being in it He is now 30 months old and still won t go to sleep unless he is in his sleep sack We had to have a friend of ours who is a seamstress add additional material to the bottom because he became to tall for it That is how much he loves his sleep sack It is by far the best thing I ever bought for my son 
5 0 Fleece Sleep Sack Blue Extra Large Muy buena adquisici�n El beb� se siente c�modo y confortable 
5 0 Great for little squirmers Like any parent I was concerned about SIDS so the SleepSack seemed like the perfect alternative to blankets Little did I know I would come to LOVE the SleepSack for it s warming capabilities After a few months under their belt babies get VERY squirmy in the middle of the night so blankets are useless and dangerous So I relied heavily on the SleepSacks to keep my little guy warm even after the risk of SIDS passed They come in fleece for winter months and cotton for warmer months and they re generous in size so they are not outgrown easily I only wish I d purchased them in yellow or white in case my next baby is the opposite sex 
5 0 Awesome Highly Recommend These are so awesome I never have a concern that my son is cold or will get strangled with blankets One night I had the sleep sak in the laundry and it was a cool night so I put a blanket over him well my husband checked him in the middle of the night and found the blanket wrapped so tightly around his neck he could hardly believe that our son was still breathing Very scary So if anything make sure you have more than one sleep sak 
5 0 Wife loves it My wife who is pregnant with twins loves this It s the only thing allowing her to sleep at night It ended up being one of the best Christmas presents under the tree 
5 0 Worth every penny I love this breast pump I only wish I bought it sooner I bought a cheap breast pump at first but it broke down after only a month of use Due to daycare issues I had to leave my son with my parents for a week so I had to pump exclusively After the second day with the cheap pump my milk production cut in half to about 3 oz total from both sides every 3 hours Then I had to wait longer to even get that much I went out and bought this pump out of desperation and couldn t be happier It took me about 4 pumping sessions for my body to get into a rhythm but then it was great I started pumping more milk in less time than the cheap pump Now I use the pump 2 3 times a day at work and occasionally on the weekends A couple of tips If you have larger breasts buy the larger shields I am a D cup and the 27 mm shields are perfect for me As soon as I switched to the larger shields the minor discomfort I had pumping went away and I started getting about another ounce of milk out on each side in the same amount of time Also to use the dual function turn on the pump before you put the shields to your breast I ve been doing that and I haven t had a problem positioning them correctly with the pump on I ve never had a problem with cleaning the pieces I make sure and give the pieces a really good washing once a day but in between each pumping I wash everything quick with soap and my hand and let it dry I ve never had a problem with the pieces not drying in time before the next pumping Also when I bought my pump they included an extra set of membranes You can also buy microwave sterilization bags from Medela to clean everything in including the membranes which can t go in the dishwasher Also since the pump works with any bottle you don t have to continually wash one bottle to use with the pump I just stick nipples on the bottles I pumped in and take them to daycare then grab the next set of clean bottles out of the cabinet for the next day I must say this pump saved my milk supply I even have a freezer full of extra breastmilk Even though it is much more expensive than some of the other pumps I ve saved more than its cost in formula so it s been worth it financially not to mention the extra benefits of breastmilk that my son has continued to have I plan on keeping mine for my next child and I would definitely recommend this product to other moms 
5 0 Exceptional Pump I bought this pump from the lactation consultant at our child s pediatrician s office After I went back to work it proved to be an excellent purchase I was able to pump discreetly at work and cool my milk in the attached cooler If we took a trip I could take the pump and pump in the car using the battery attachment or even in our hotel room At one time the pump was not suctioning properly When I called Medela they were so helpful They assistemd me while I was on the phone to get it working properly It still didn t work so they offered me a new pump in exchange for my old one Andreaetta 
5 0 Well worth it This pump is well worth the cost if you plan on pumping regularly As a working mother who has been nursing for eleven months I can honestly say that this pump is the reason I m still able to breastfeed I pump twice a day while at work and this pump has never given me a problem It has multiple speeds and vacuum settings so it s very easy to make pumping comfortable I ve even used the battery pack to pump while driving twice in a pinch Everything you need is included I was even able to use other brands of bottles with the pump I can t say enough good things about this product 
5 0 RE Working Mom Loves Pump This pump works great for me as a working Mom It looks professional and I can even fit my lunch in the top I also love how quickly I can set it up in my office to pump It is a bit loud so don t try to use it on conference calls unless you hide it under you desk and close the flap And even then you ll want to check it with a friend listening on the phone for it first Our battery pack didn t work at first and we didn t check it until we were on the road so check yours The white membranes also must be kept very clean and the yellow tips they go in Even a little bit of old milk will completely kill the suction But it is worth it even with this issue Buy it from your lactation nurse at the hospital and then you have someone to give you guidance on how to use it and deal with any issues you have with parts Although you shouldn t have many 
5 0 A Great Pump and Worth It I have read the other reviews and find some differing opinions I loved this pump because it was very effective for my needs I used it everyday at work for 6 months It took 20 minutes to express the milk I had and the bags that go with the pump accurately measure the milk Also I was able to use one arm and hand to hold the cups in place while I made phone calls with the other I can t imagine another pump being more effective 
5 0 Great Crib Set Bad seller experience The crib set itself is stunning if you like something contemporary I ordered it from baby age and had the same thing happen received a pink feeding pillow They weren t very helpful or pleasant in the way they handled the transaction They did not honour the advertised price I ended up buying the ultra bedding set from a local boutique 
4 0 Loooove it 4 1 2 stars I would have given it a full 5 stars if it had fit my toilet better I had to kind of slide cram it into place but it was sturdy flexible enough to take it thank goodness And it s definetly taken some hassel out of potty training It s already there to just flip down just as easy to clean as I m cleaning the rest of the toilet I would fully reccomend this as a gift for any house that children frequent 
5 0 Potty Trained My granddaughter is 3 years old and has been potty trained for quite some time now when she used the regular training potty seat she always wanted me to accompany her but now that she has a Flip n Flush she likes to go alone I recommend this for any child who wants the independence of going to the potty alone It s a great invention 
5 0 10 STARS IF I COULD Have you ever tried to get your infant into a jacket snowsuit or thick blanket and then into the carseat straps Not so easy huh Well this fabulous product saved me from that headache although I tried just to see if it really was that difficult I love that I can put my now 9 month old into the carseat with the bundle me and zip her up Thats it the front covers her face if it is windy and she is warm and cozy inside On especially cold days or when she is dressed for cute rather than cold I put an extra blanket on her inside the bundle me and she cant throw it off I have the lite version which I used all spring and summer air conditioned car and now this one for the fall and winter Some have commented on how easy it is to move baby in the bundle me from carseat to stroller I have to disagree I would just get a second one for the stroller The velcro in the back that holds it into the carset will wake up a sleeping baby if you try to remove the whole thing with baby inside A great product 
5 0 Keeps baby warm dry without the fuss I own 2 of these one for each stroller It is so convenient for keeping my daughter toasty without having to mess with bulky sweaters and coats that will only need removing once we reach our destination Also saves me the trouble of having to wake her I can just peel back the top cover or zip it off altogether Also I ve received countless compliments on how stylish and practical it is not to mention water resistent which is great for Seattle 
4 0 warm and cozy except when the wind blows this product is wonderful I love the fact that it is all attatched and cannot fall off when baby kicks The only dislike i have is that the top sometimes blows off baby s face when it is windy wouldn t be so bad if i had an extra hand to hold it down but i also have a 2yr old i wish there were some way of it staying down on it s own 
5 0 A MUST HAVE FOR WINTER BABIES I purchased this item myself and I absolutly LOVE it The Bundle Me makes it so easy get baby ready to go instead of having to put a coat on her etc I get many compliments on it and am glad that I spent the extra money on this version the material is so soft warm and it s great quality Now instead of getting my daughter new coats to fit her and to match her wardrobe I have the Bundle Me ready to go already in the carseat I would definately recommend this item and would proudly purchase it as a gift for anyone having a baby in the wintertime 
5 0 I LOVE THIS BUNDLE ME This Urban Bundle Me is one of the best baby items I ve bought for my son It s much more convenient than struggling to keep a blanket on the car seat And if baby gets too warm just unzip the cover off I like this version much better than the Original Bundle Me which seems like it would get too warm for my baby The material of the Urban Bundle Me is warm enough for rainy Washington weather but not too warm like the fleece in the Original Bundle Me I also love the little pocket where I can store an emergency pacifier or other small items It washes great and I plan to buy the larger toddler size once my son outgrows this One minor problem is the zipper occasionally gets stuck but that s to be expected when a zipper isn t zipped in a straight line = 
5 0 nicely padded for a change Well built actually has padding in the bottom cushion unlike all the others we looked at If you want a comfortable ride for your infant as well as the feeling you got your money s worth get this one I am so impressed I purchased a second one from Amazon 
4 0 Great Bottles I originally bought these bottles b c they were recommended by almost every breastfeeding person that I asked and since I was planning on breastfeeding I decided to go w this starter kit I appreciated the variety of things the kit had to offer My baby was born prematurely and never really took to breastfeeding but I decided to pump breastmilk and feed it to her via bottle I tried several other brands but none worked as well as these did for her I always found myself buying a few more of these I have fed my child 6 8 bottles a day using Avent bottles since the day she came home from the hospital and only had 1 incident of leakage and I recognized what I had done wrong and was able to correct the problem w o further error I also use these for storage from time to time w the addition of a sealing disc It would have been nice to have a couple of sealing discs included in this pack 
5 0 Starter Set to spare the mom My friend is a recent mom and she is so busy sometimes she has no time to clean bottles Did her a favor and got her a pack but you can still go through these on one day 
5 0 They Passed our Tests My baby has developed feeding issues including a unique mixture of colic and reflux that had made feeding times a nightmare for everyone in our house We started out using the Playtex Drop ins system and that worked fine for us until we were about 1 5 months old Then suddenly there was lots of gas and screaming at feedings I switched to the Playtex Vent Aire bottles and the screaming stopped but there were issues with the nipples and that just wasn t working out for us either Baby was spending more calories than she was taking in with level 1 and drowning with level 2 Plus there were wierd extra parts to clean and keep up with It was a temporary answer to our prayers but still not what we were looking for Because we have a preemie changing her formula isn t an option because she needs the nutrients in this special formula we are giving her and she is continuing to gain weight So the real issue has become trying to make feeding more comfortable for her and us As a final resort I had spent so much on bottle systems that didn t work out that I had almost given up I gave the Avent feeding system a try It has worked wonders Baby eats in an appropriate amount of time now there are only the standard parts on any bottle to clean and manage baby tolerates the nipple and flow well we use both level 1 and 2 nipples Best of all are the special Variable Flow nipples sold separately we use those for feedings where we have to mix in rice cereal and they allow the cereal through not too fast but no clogs either I like not having to alter the flow of the regular nipples with toothpicks etc because once you do this there s no going back The Variable Flow nipples solve that problem and leave the other nipples unscathed for normal feeding needs Also our baby was addicted to the Soothie pacifiers at the hospital We have tried Nuk Mam Gerber and she wouldn t accept any of those But she is accepting the Avent pacifiers included with this newborn starter set My advice to parents looking for bottles to help with solve feeding issues buy the smallest number possible and give it 5 days If it looks good on day one and is the same kind of good by day 5 it s safe to sink more money into it But if it isn t going to work out it will be obvious by day 5 or sooner that you haven t found The Answer Avent s bottles have passed this test for us and I would highly recommend them Additionally if your baby is experiencing colic and or reflux see fussy baby dot org for tips and ideas Also I would recommend a specific brand of gripe water called Colic Ease all brands are not the same see their ingredient page to see why The fussy baby site and this gripe water teamed up with Avent bottles have really helped us out work through our feeding issues Good luck 
4 0 They worked well for us We used Avent with our first son almost 5 years ago I did run into some leaking problems that came from the white cap screwing onto the bottle I found if I tightened the bottle a bit more it eliminated the leaks completely After figuring this out we had no more problems We are expecting our second child in a few months and I have started to buy Avent again Our first son did not have a whole lot of gas problems Of course he was gassy at times so I can t say he had no gas but he didn t appear to have so much gas where it was bothering him I really liked the wide bottle with Avent It made it more comfortable for me to hold then later on when our son got to be old enough the wide bottle made it easy for him to hold Avent also has handles that attach to the bottles when your baby toddler gets old enough to hold the bottle by themselves The handles were wide and colorful and made holding easy for little hands The nipples I did feel at first were a bit hard but our son never had any problems taking it Of course this will vary amoung babies After just purchasing a 3 pack of 4 oz bottles for impending baby 2 I opened up the package after seeing the advertisement for extra soft nipple and it is indeed softer then it was 5 years ago If you are looking to save money I suggest either buying very few 4oz bottles or simply buying the 9 oz or even 11 oz bottles instead as they outgrow the 4 oz very quickly We had no problems cleaning these bottle as well and they held up very well We never had to replace them 
5 0 Great for special needs My daughter is a child with many developmental delays At a year old she can only sit up with assistance The bouncy seats are only meant to hold a child up to 25 lbs Zoe still needed a chair to sooth and keep her out of harms way I searched and found only two seats on the market This one and the Fisher price one This one was perfect Not only is it cushy and comfortable it has many features The toys on the side are convenient because my little can only reach to the side instead of straight in front or overhead Also it is easier to lift her out because they don t get in the way The variety of soothing sounds levels of volume and the vibrating features are all a wonderful addition to this rocker This rocker is intended to be a long lasting item since it holds up to 40lbs My three year old even sits in it from time to time 
4 0 This chair was a lifesaver I love this rocker It may not rock but keeps my son entertained for longer periods of time than any other item we have in the house We leave him unbuckled and he scoots down onto his back and plays with his toys He didn t like the toy bar so I purchased and attached a Tiny Love Toy Bar He loves the octopus although he can pull it off and into himself My 5 month old is near 20 lbs so I am very relieved that this rocker goes up to 40 lbs 
5 0 Great item Our son was 3 months old and already 24 inches and 16 lbs He outgrew his Fisher Price Papasan but it was his favorite This chair is much bigger he has plenty of room to grow still It s easy to assemble very solid in construction plays great music and the volume can be adjusted You can also hook up your ipod to it to play music It doesn t fold down so transporting is not that easy 
5 0 so far so good our baby is only 5 days old but so far it s a good carseat i like the colors and design it seems safe and easy to use 
5 0 I ve bought this TWICE We love the handle on this car seat I owned a Graco Snug Ride and HATED it it does not snap into a supermarket shopping cart The handle is a triangle shape and you can carry it forward backward or against your hip Love it bought one with my second child and again for my last child when the first one expired 
5 0 Great car seat for the money Great seat We read reviews somewhere complaining that their infant s head flopped forward in this seat I installed it so that it was in a more reclining position while still being within the range per the level indicator We have had no trouble although we always support his head in the car seat so it cant flop around 
5 0 One of the safest car seats on the market According to consumer reports this car seat is one of ONLY TWO car seats to pass all the crash tests I highly suggest parents and soon to be parents to check out consumer reports before buying any car seats And for the price it s worth it 
5 0 Our Son Loves This The first time our son saw this toy he loved it It made it much easier to transition him to the crib from his bassinette It would be nice if the ocean sounds would play longer like the music but John really enjoys the music 
5 0 crib essential Not your mama s crib toy Vibrant rich colors and soothing yet upbeat music not at all annoying or elevator style Wonderful addition to the nursery that will get you some extra sleep I promise 
4 0 Good and bad points to this Pros Great music high low volume choice light show on ceiling a plus my daughter loves to listen watch it every night as she falls asleep Cons Strap broke after 2 moves but if you contact Baby Einstein Co they will send you a new one free of charge wish it was just on off have to switch button for 1 song play vs all songs to play All in all I like this because it works for my daughter 
5 0 Leaks These are simply the best bottles As far as the leaks go you probably have the cap screwed down TOO tight that is what happened to us loosen it a little and voila no more leaks 
5 0 Great Venting Bottle but pain to clean I have used lots of different bottles with my two kids These bottles were by far the very best at venting to keep the air at a minimum in the babies tummy Yes they are a pain to wash but after switching to Evenflo glass bottles due to the plastic bottle scare currently in the news I have had tons of problems with Evenflo nipples I have bought three different packages and all have at least one defective nipple in the package they are not venting and the nipple collapes supposedly they are designed not to do this Evenflo is supposed to be sending me one replacement package but it still hasnt arrived I havent told them yet about two more packages of nipples that also contain defective nipples With all the pains of nipples collapsing while using glass bottles from Evenflo I think I would rather just go through the pain of washing the Dr Browns our pediatrician said she had no concerns about the plastic bottle scares I have never had a problem before with nipples collapsing in the Dr Browns or the Avent bottles I have used Stay away from Evenflo as their Quality Assurance department is not even close to Dr Browns 
5 0 GREAT I LOVE THE DR BROWN BOTTLES THE BIGGER ONES ARE CLOSER TO BREAST SO ITS EASY TO SWITCH BACK AND FORTH I LIKE THE COMFORT GRIP ALSO 
5 0 LOVE LOVE LOVE Dr Brown s My husband and I purchased Avent bottles for our newborn after doing our research for the best bottles in helping minimize gas colic etc Yikes Needless to say we were HIGHLY disappointed with Avent By the recommendation of our pediatrician we went out and bought a new set of Dr Brown s bottles kine of pricey but WORTH every penny With Avent my son was getting super gassy and colicky He would cry so hard with gas pains that he d clinch his little fists crunch his little legs to his tummy and practically go hoarse Burping mylicon and gripe water didn t even help Our days and nights were sleepless he wouldn t nap because he was crying and our nights would average about 3 4 hours of sleep Now with Dr Brown s our son is a NEW little man He STILL gets gas but not like he did with the Avent bottles All it takes is a couple of little pats on his back and he gives us a couple of good burps and he s out into LA LA land he s now able to take his naps and has been sleeping anywhere from 6 8 hours through the night now for the past 2 weeks and he s only 1 month old For some reason when he was feeding from the Avent he would suck uncontrollably I d see lots of bubbles in his bottle and in the nipple and I could hear him sucking all that air in With Dr Brown s he has WAY more controlled sucking it s much more rhythmic and no air bubbles in the nipple MANY thumbs up for Dr Brown s 
4 0 The best bottles These are the best bottles I have tried yet The thing that makes them unique is that they really prevent the air bubbles from coming in better than any other bottle we ve tried The only negative I see is that there are several pieces which makes washing a bit of a nuissance still it s worth it if you have the patience to do a wash a day 
5 0 For me and my baby this was the best Hi I have no idea if these bottles help a colic gasey baby My baby was never like that I considered these bottles because I hated that my son had to suck till he could suck no more then let go of a nipple so air could back into a regualar bottle So I started looking for a bottle that didn t have nipple collaspe First we tried Playtex They worked but were extremely hard to mix powdered formula in because the liners held exactly 8 oz also expensive liners Then I switched to Avent thought it was my dream come true bottle Until they started leaking no matter how I screwed on the ring I finally figured out the problem the skirts on the nipples warp after very little use So I ended up constantly buying new nipples and never knowing when we would get a whole bottle dumped on us So then Dr Brown came out with these wide neck bottles After some reading the directions and trial and error this is it The Bottle for Us This is how we did it you can t use the valve while mixing formula or warming or the bottle will leak So water goes in the bottle and just the ring nipple and cap get screwed on The valve goes in a zip lock bag About ten minuetes before the bottle is needed I but the formula in the bottle in and shake In about ten minuets all the bubbles are down and I incert the valve and feed No leaks I have an aunt who premixes her formuala in two days worth of bottles and puts them in the fridge once again leaving the valves out Then she gets them out swirls a little takes off the top microwaves for 30 secs incerts valve checks tempreture and feeds No leaks either The only time I have ever had a leak is when I mixed or heated formula with the valves in which the directions say not to do Like I said this is what works best for us 
5 0 Great Bottles 5 months old and no colic no spit ups These bottles are great You could shake them and in seconds the bubbles disapear While you feed your little one watch and be amazed as there are no bubbles It takes a while to clean them You just gotta do it when your little one is asleep 
5 0 Pack Play Sheets The sheets were very soft after the first wash and they also fit the mattress well The price was a good buy 
4 0 Yes they DO fit The lady below who said they dont fit her Eddie Bauer Pack n Play needs to realize Eddie Bauer is NOT a Pack N Play Eddie Bauer is by Cosco and is considered just a play yard all play yards are not considered equal The name quot Pack N Play quot is exclusive to the brand and therefore these sheets fit just fine Gave them four stars because they re not the most luxurious or long lasting sheets on the block but they serve their purpose and fit just fine 
4 0 A must for your pack n play It s easier to keep a sheet clean than try to keep cleaning the cushion of the pack n play I ll admit that the workmanship on this sheet isn t top notch but it serves its purpose If I were interested in sewing I could make one that looks just as good as this one but I don t won t sew Got a second sheet for the pack n play at Grandma s house Gotta have a sheet 
4 0 Great for use with Pack n Play I found this sheet to work very well with my pack n play pad It just slips over the bottom and it stays on very well I don t know about for other play pens but this is a great product for use with the Pack n play 
5 0 just right I have a 9 month old 22 lbs She likes sitting in this and it works just fine Has not leaked yet and being able to hang it up on the wall when not using it is very helpful No one can say it s not worth the money 
4 0 I love this tub How do I count the ways This tub is GREEEEEAT I had a little trouble at first trying to inflate it since it indicates to only use your mouth but all the effort was worth it It s very light and the suction hook latches on to the bathroom title for future use 
5 0 Snug Tub Review Although my 11 month old son was terrified of this tub at first he is used to it now and loves it He did not enjoy taking a bath before I bought the tub and now that he likes the Ducky tub he has a blast taking a bath I would recommend this product 
5 0 great tub This is a great tub for any baby able to sit up on their own It is the perfect size with room for your little one to grow It not only saves on water you would use to fill a larger tub but gives your little one a sense of security When i tried our baby in the big tub he cried and didnt like it so i tried him back in his infant tub and he was fine I realized it was a matter of security for him The large tub was just so over whelming He loves to squeek the duck and play with tossing rings Price is just right to Just be careful when you inflate tub because it inflates in sections My husband used an air compressor thinking it was all one compartment to fill with air and it blew up 
5 0 Happy Baby Girl My daughter loves this tub She moves a lot and it is nice to know she won t hurt herslef on a hard plastic tub She loves to bite the duck and play with the rings I have not had any problems with this tub at all Blowing it up is the hardest part Takes a lot of breath I recommend it to anyone It is worth the money I plan to use it with all future kids as well 
5 0 Mother and son are very happy This is a wonderful product for infants not quite ready for an adult tub but too big for a baby tub I love how it fits perfectly into the regular tub so it s easy to fill drain and will make an easier transition for when my son becomes too big for it My son loves playing with the rings and seems to be very comfortable My brother is super picky but after seeing my son s tub he bought one for his daughter 
5 0 Excellent Covers I have 3 of these yellow blue and green 3 was plenty 1 being used 1 being laundered and 1 extra just in case My son s is now 20 months old and they are still in great condition He no longer uses a changing pad but there is lots more use left in them for younger siblings They did shrink up a little after being washed and are a little tight on the changing pad Other than that they are great 
5 0 Awesome Changing Pad Cover This product is very thick and absorbent like a top of the line towel I recommend every mother to pick up a few of these a must have for changing pads 
5 0 Perfect fit after washing no fading I just finished washing two of these covers for the first time and put one on my changing pad I was happy to discover that despite the negative reviews I read it fits perfectly Due to the odd shape of the contoured pad it did take a few moments to get into the right place As for the softness it feels like terry cloth and seems perfectly soft enough And despite other reviews it is rather thick I wouldn t have minded if it was a bit thinner actually 
5 0 Very Sturdy This is the third one that we ve purchased Of all the child safety gates we ve seen this seems to be the sturdiest of the bunch We ve been using them for 2 1 2 years and are very satisfied The trick is to align the closing point so that it will latch when you swing the gate closed If its not aligned the gate will bounce back 
5 0 great product I loved the hand s free gate but had just a little too big opening The extension is very easy to install and sturdy Would recommend if you like the gate but have larger door openings 
5 0 So simple so perfect The baby gate and extensions were fantasticly easy to install and I am extremely happy with my purchase The extensions were added in mere seconds This was a perfect choice to keep my dog out of an area that he was not allowed into 
5 0 Excellent product I love this gate gate extension This is the best one I ve ever used I ve been through nieces nephews step nephews and now a great nephew and of all gates that have been used in our families this is by far the best one It s convenient and very sturdy You cannot go wrong with this product This will last a very long time 
4 0 Decent but a bit of a pain If you need the gate extension this thing is great it s super easy to install Unfortunately if you tighten the nuts too far the gate itself is a pain to open and close Overall though a great purchase 
4 0 extension great for medium spaces we have a big gap before our bedroom and we needed in fact 2 of these extensions to make our gate fit now with one it seemed it would be sturdy but with 2 extension it gets a little flimsy and the whole gate can fall off the wall if you press the foot pedal too hard or shove the gate by mistake 
5 0 Great addition for my triplets gate We bought two of these extensions for the Hands Free Gate that we use for our triplets that just turned a year old This gate including extensions are a lifesaver You can read my review on the gate as well lol The extensions are very easy to add and very sturday Adding them does not make the gate weaker by extending it out like some gates do It is just what it states an extension It keeps it just as strong as sturdy Worth the money 
4 0 Easy to use Works great Easy to use Just a bit costly but worth the money 
4 0 Better than other Still not the best We switch to this warmer from a very disappointed First year Night and Day warmer This one at least will not burn our hands when taking out the bottle The water inside will not come to boiling point It will still overheat the bottle if you leave the bottle for too long The light does not seem to be helpful It keeps the temperate at too high level However compare to the First year one you do not have to be precisely accurate at the water level which was a pain when you use the First year one at 3AM with your sleepy eyes and you will not get a mess of water around the table so I d recommend this product Also the warmer kind of make a tick noise when it is on so it becomes a reminder that the warmer is still on which is a good thing 
5 0 Worth the money It may seem expensive but this warmer is absolutely worth it I B F most of the time and only heat a couple of bottles a day but its so simple and doesnt take much time The light goes out when its warm enough and your ready to feed your baby I absolutely love it 
4 0 Have it have rarely used it My husband and I received this warmer at our baby shower and while it was great to not have to walk downstairs to warm the bottles for early morning feedings after Sofia hit 5 months we never used it again She s 9 months old now and it sits on a shelf in her nursery waiting for baby 2 I wouldn t buy it for myself but I d give it as a gift I say that because it ll get more mileage than the typical cute outfit and will cost the same 
5 0 Works perfectly I give my baby frozen breastmilk and have used this warmer to get the milk ready for her It works great I just pop in the bottle fill the warmer with water and wait 4 minutes 5 oz bottles and voila milk is warm but not hot 
5 0 Quilted Sleep Sacks We bought one of these quilted sacks along with a fleece one and a cotton one when our daughter was born in the winter It felt like we were Goldilocks the fleece kept our baby too warm the cotton kept her too cold but the quilted sack was just right As another reviewer said the fabric can be a big clingy however it is just a slight annoyance and the benefits far outweigh the irritation Besides I found that the fleece ones are extremely static y and and cotton sacks wrinkle into a little ball in the dryer 
5 0 Gift for baby I ordered the Sleep Sack from a friends gift registry She was very pleased with it let me know right away when she got it 
5 0 Great medium weight sleep sack We have several of these in various sizes and fabrics They are all terrific We re using the fleece at night in the winter the quilt during the day in winter and we used the cotton one in the Fall I highly recommend this line of wearable blankets 
5 0 Like this This is a neat little spout cover The hat on the duck lifts so you can pour the bubble bath into it so it slowly drizzles to make alot of bubbles would recommend 
5 0 GREAT FUN This ducky is so cute and really useful I got it for my daughter when she transitioned into the big tub I love that you can lift his shower cap and get LOTS of bubbles right out of the faucet My daughter who is 6 months old is fascinated by the ducky and I feel safe with her grabbing at the faucet and getting close to it now I had a little trouble getting the duck to fit over my faucet but I just soaked it in hot water for a few seconds and it went on very easily GREAT PRDUCT WELL WORTH THE MONEY 
5 0 Cute spout guard We wanted a ducky theme for our son s bathroom We got this and the Ducky Tub Rug Jr This ducky spout guard is cute and does it s job The bubble bath dispenser works too my husband and I like to use that 
5 0 Bubble Ducky The product was exactly as decsribed quality materials fits perfect and what child doen t want a rubber ducky in the tub area 
5 0 Great Product This product is perfect for preemies The smaller head rest is prefect for preemies and newborns The larger headrest can be uses for many months after the smaller head rest is removed It is SUPER soft Is is chenille and very cozy for baby s skin 
5 0 Great baby tub This Tub is Great I love that it fits right in my sink for easy baths and clean ups and then it folds small enough to put under the sink 
5 0 LOVE THIS TUB This tub is fabulous We love that it is just as simple as can be no bells and whistles just a great sturdy tub It folds up so as not to take up much room when stored has an opening in the bottom to drain water out fits great in the kitchen sink and holds baby in a great position for bathing We use it with one of those yellow bear spongy thingies and baby is supported semi reclined and very very comfy Worth every penny 
5 0 Graco Infant Car Seat Netting I love it It works well with the car seat and even their bouncers Great to have for the outdoors 
5 0 Love it This was a great addition to my Medela pump along with the car adapter When I pump at work it frees my hands to do other things It may take a few extra seconds to attach but worth it The only drawback are the hooks that attach to the bra They easily fall off when not in use I have to remember to take them off and put them somewhere safe 
5 0 Wonderful I love this product I ve been EP ing for my preemie for 6+ months now and have kept my sanity because of this product I ve tried other hands free methods like using my nursing bra flap to keep it in place doesn t work for me and the Easy Expressions Bustier which a lot of people love but I didn t because it compressed my rib cage and made my back ache Not a pleasant experience You do need a Medela nursing bra but I love their bras too 
4 0 Peace of mind It s so nice to know you have ever thing you might need even if you don t wind up using it all Although I ve used most of these products already and my little one is only 9 months old Plus the handy plastic carrying case is has plenty of extra room so I can keep ALL of her health stuff in one easy to grab place which is super nice when you re being a freaked out Mommy with her first baby sick for the first time so you can easily tell Daddy what to bring you and then just sit down and look at everything and figure out what can help her 
4 0 Small amounts but not a bad kit Beware that this product does not contain normal sized medicines They are only 1 2 oz bottles of gas drops saline drops acetomeniphen and decongestant and only 3 16 oz of teething gel You will go through any of these medications VERY quickly But that is probably why the kit costs 20 instead of J J s 40 one It is good to have this stuff for emergencies when you don t know what you will need ahead of time My baby LOVED the taste of the gas drops but we used up the bottle in a week unfortunately The Little Fevers was wonderful to bring along to her first shots but didn t last much longer than that The nasal aspirator is wonderful so much easier on her nose than the hospital one It also has a clear tip so you can see when it needs to be clean out I wish it came with an electrolytes packet too but I guess you can t have everything It was worth 20 to have almost everything you need at your fingertips but I wish I didn t have to replace the medicines so soon I would still recommend this over the J J kit since you never know what you ll need and what you won t use 
5 0 Great value The container is hokey and we tossed it but it s a great value for all the products inside The fever reducer pain relief drops just like Tylenol don t taste too good but they work It s a nice gift and gives a new parent reassurance they ll have what they need in an emergency 
5 0 The BEST for your baby I m not a big fan of giving pharmeceuticals to infants but this line is somewhat natural or as homeopathic as you can get in commercial stores I used the gas drops religously for both my kids and it really helped with what I call colic I also use the nose suction and the fingernail clippers theirs is the best from what I could find I will give this warning If you are buying for another person make sure you check the expiration date If their baby is not due for a while you better get one with a later expiration date This happened to me BRU had one with an expiration date of two months ahead so there was no way the person I bought if for could keep it I felt bad b c I didn t notice it while I was in the store and being a new parent I m sure it was a challenge for them to return it before they needed to use it Just a warning 
5 0 Teresa I bought this item for my daughter and her new baby The baby is 8 days old and we have already used several of the products in the kit They have come in very handy and I very glad I purchased this product for my daughter 
5 0 Excellent has everyting My friend bought this for me because she swore by it with her son It is excellent First of all I must say the Gas Drops are just amazing My daughter had so many problems with colic and gas and I used them all the time They work wonders The saline drops are great for the winter during cold season I have already had to repurchase a few of the items The case is great because it keeps everything in one place so I don t have to search for stuff 
5 0 Great for the breastfeeding mom I find these to be quite convenient for giving my baby breastmilk from the bottle With the Playtex One Step storage system I pump directly into the liner and stick it in the fridge and then I can pop it in a nurser when it s time to feed My husband and other caregivers are quite glad at the ease of putting it all together when they re juggling a crying baby As advice to others I wonder whether the original nurser gift set might be better because it comes with multiple different kinds of nipples whereas this set only comes with the silicone slow flow We ve lucked out in that my baby seems happy with it and switches easily from breast to bottle and vice versa however it might have been handy to be able to try different kinds to see which the babe likes best The shells in this set are more modern looking but I can t see how that matters I m pretty sure the pieces for both are interchangeable Nice that the silicone nipples in this set and all the other pieces latex nipples are less hardy are dishwasher safe and can be repeatedly boiled for sterilization if desired The short shells in this set are fine and it s easier to reach in the bottom to squish the liner with your fingers to help it collapse the drop in liners are relatively more shape holding than regular liners so they can suck in air but usually my baby has more than 4 oz at a sitting in the 8oz size shell the burper is nice it s hard to reach in when the liner is less full but it doesn t squish the liner all the way so we end up taking off the shell and using our fingers for the last 2 oz or so I have never had any problem with leaking I like the disposable bit of this system since the nipples collars and lids take up enough space and cleaning effort without having a bunch of bottles around as well Liners are pricy if you use a lot about 5 for 50 at Walgreens but since we only use a bottle a day it doesn t seem like much They also freeze easily This set came with one adapter for a breast pump I use an Ameda Purely Yours and they fit together perfectly and the One Step comes with another so I can use the double pumping without buying any other pieces Overall I m very happy with this set 
5 0 From a Breastfeeding Mom These are the BEST These bottles are the BEST I am breastfeeding but due to medical issues we had to give our baby a bottle from the beginning and she took this one with no problem She switches back and forth between bottle and nursing and is great This bottle system is SO easy to use It s easy to put a bottle together quickly and they transport well so they re perfect for using on the go too I love them 5 stars 
5 0 Best bottle system on the market After doing our pre baby research we registered for and received this set We started using it with no problems and then my daughter started having problems with gas Naturally we blamed it on the bottles Many bottles and wasted dollars later we returned to the Premium Nursers and have never looked back In fact the more I watch other moms with other bottles the happier I am Sure you spend a few extra bucks on liners But the time and energy and dishwasher costs you save are well worth it We have 4 bottle shells that we use and about 10 nipples The shells rarely get dirty and so rarely have to be washed Likewise for the rings and caps We usually run a load of nipples with the dishwasher every day and that s it Empty liners pop out with no mess and are recyclable to boot When we go out I pack 1 pre assembled bottle and an extra liner and nipple ring cap setup It weighs nothing and takes up way less space than multiple bottles On the fly I can just pop out the dirty liner throw it away pop in the new one and screw on the new top As an added bonus I think my husband may actually have invented this ingenius use for the Premium Nurser Note this can only be done with the Playtex brand liners not generics When my daughter was struggling with swallowing too much air my husband figured out that we could fill the liner with the desired amount of milk screw on the nipple and then squeeze all of the air out of the liner collapsing it down until it was vacuum tight with only milk in it Keeping a finger over the nipple hole pop on the airtight cap Voila a completely air free meal for baby This really helped cut back on her air swallowing Generic liners work fine for all other purposes Last but not least we like so many other parents felt that many brands were drowning our daughter in milk The Playtex slow flow nipples worked great for her She is still using them at 4 months 
5 0 Best thing out there Don t get the Avents I originally got the Avents and they were awful leaked nipples were terrible etc I got the Playtex Nursers and my daughter loves them She prefers the latex nipples though 
5 0 The BEST My husband and I have tried many different bottle types and brands and have decided that these are the best My 6 week old daughter adjusted well to them The original brown nipples wear out very quickly but the silicone ones are much nicer and will last longer These bottles are very easy to use and clean My husband prefers the soft bottle liners over the preformed dropins The soft ones haven t leaked on us once but the formed ones have slipped out from under the ring a couple of times spilling formula everywhere The formed ones also make it harder to screw the lid on tight enough causing leaks The soft liners might take a little bit longer to put on the bottle and deal with but in the long run it takes less time because you don t have to go change your clothes every time the preformed ones leak They are worth every penny I spent on them Even though they may cost more than standard bottles because of having to buy the liners they help prevent gas and colic THey are absolutely wonderful 
5 0 Nice rack for any bottles Buy more and stack higher if you need the capacity Takes up less counter space this way Sturdy and well designed Comes with extender feet so you can have short or tall levels when stacking Easily unstacks for ease of loading bottle parts 
5 0 Bought one for my baby nephew I was so happy with my purchase that I bought one for my baby nephew 
5 0 Best for large infants This is the BEST product for keeping your child warm when strolling around in cold weather It s like wrapping him her up in a cozy sleeping bag Our son loves it and so do we It s been wonderful for our little boy bought at 8mo however he s a very tall infant 28 at the time 30 now at 9 5mo I question whether this product will work for him as a toddler since he s already in 18mo old clothing This is why we skipped the infant size Also don t purchase this product thinking it will completely cover your child It comes up to their upper chest The child will still need to wear a coat hat mittens The flap does come higher however our son doesn t like to have it pulled up and fights it All in all this product does what we purchased it for 
5 0 Well Worth It We got this for our son when he was 1 yr old and it looks brand new a year later Our child is of average size and he s got plenty of room in it at age 2 We live in a major city so our stroller gets A LOT of use This blanket is very durable grows with your child and keeps them warm and comfy in the coldest temperatures Stays in place and is easy to install remove 
5 0 Fits Well I ve been using the Big Bundle Me for my 28 month old since he was 16 months and haven t had any trouble getting him to fit in it comfortably We use is all the time when we go out and he loves being in it It works great in the Jogger Stroller 
5 0 I love this gate This surround gate is great for my 10 month old daughter It is sturdy easy to move and it has a lot more room than your traditional playpen My husband and I both like how easy it is to open the door and sit inside the play space with our daughter at times I also look forward to using it outside this summer It will be lage enough to put around her sandbox I m sure I would recommend this sorround gate to anyone 
4 0 Good Value I bought this item for my mom She has two small dogs that she keeps inside She uses four of the panels to make a dog enclosure It keeps the dogs from jumping all over guests in the house It works great 
5 0 just what i was looking for i do not use these for warming the food i did try that once and it was just a pain i purchased the bowls because they are divided and stick to the high chair so they are great for that but i would not recommend getting it if you are just looking for a warming dish 
5 0 What a great item I love the Bundle Me lite I live in CA so it s perfect for those cold days I have a heavier one for the snow but still haven t used that yet The lite is wonderful I put it on I don t worry about blankets slipping off and getting dirty The top zips right off so when it s warm and not needed you don t have to mess with taking the whole thing off And it is super soft I wish I had this with my first two babies My third s the one that lucked out 
4 0 kinda big toy not exactly for your little little ones this is a type of toy for a baby who is ready to explore but otherwise great fun toy and it smells good too 
5 0 I love it I didn t realize the tentacles were horns when I purchased it I thought they were electric touch sensors I like the horns much more since batteries are not required and I know it will not break easily My 4 month old son cannot squeeze the tentacles to make the noises yet but I m having so much fun playing it for him He loves the different textures and colors of the fabrics I ve already purchased two more for friends this toy is a bargain at 10 It s definitely worth much more 
5 0 LOVE IT We received this today and when I showed it to my 7 month old it brought a HUGE grin to his face and a squeal of delight This is an adorable toy that is so bright and eye catching along with a delightful vanilla scent The horn noises that the tentacles make also bring a huge smile to my sons face and will be fun to experiment with the different tones and song producing sounds I am ordering 2 more for baby gifts for a friend and family member 
4 0 Adj Booster This is a great booster seat so far It s light and east to carry and my son loves it I like the fact that it folds in half and when we travel it will be easy to handle Also great price on such a great seat 
5 0 One size fits all We have twins and my son is growing a little faster then my daughter When it became time for a booster seat we made a great choice This seat is easy to adjust as he grows easy to install and wrap the seatbelt through sits firmly on contoured seats and is very easy to clean I must admit that one of the features that helped me to decide on buying this seat was the interactive video that showed how it worked I like this seat so much that I am now buying the same seat for my daughter You will be very happy with this important purchase 
5 0 The best we ve seen We comparison shopped for booster seats for a while and found this to be greatly superior to anything we ve used in the past The price is higher than other booster only seats with no lateral head support but the additional safety factor is well worth it This is the second of this model that we bought so now both active boys 4 and 7 are ensconced in them 
5 0 Excellent Booster I would highly recommend this booster for parents as their children reach the proper height and weight It s comfortable light and easy to maneuver Being able to put the straps across the child at the proper height adjustable by the way is extremely important for their safety and since you can use the straps in the car they go right over bulky winter clothing without having to readjust like our old seat I would strongly encourage people to remember to belt the seat in even when no one is using it It could become quite a projectile during an accident if not secured 
5 0 great product I bought this booster to replace our Graco Turbobooster because I drive a Jeep Cherokee Sport w a very low back bucket seat no headrests either I feel my daughter 5 yrs old has more support because the whole back raises for height adjustment not just the headrest I ve also heard that Compass will replace our booster seat if we are in an accident We are both very happy 
5 0 Just what we needed This booster seat is exactly what we needed for our three year old son It is easy to move from either side of the car the drink holder is deep enough to keep his drinks from spilling and most important my son is very safe and comfortable 
5 0 Great product I purchased this booster seat for my middle child She is very tiny so I didnt want a seat with no back This seat is very padded very comfortable and she loves the arm rests that flip up and down I had done some research before purchasing and this seat was rated well It rated well for safety and comfort It is also easy to install and light weight 
5 0 Wow Something that really works When trying to decide what we needed and didn t need for our daughter I knew we needed something to contain diapers We had no desire to trek out to the trash can at every change especially those first weeks at all hours of the day and night Basically for me it came down to Diaper Genie or the Diaper Dekor I considered the price of refills reviews and the advice of a friend who works in daycare and went with the Diaper Dekor We love it It has done a wonderful job and the refills have lasted longer than I would have ever imagined The dekor came with one fill and we ve not gone through an entire box of refills yet Our daughter is 7 months old now she s eating solids and some of those diapers are pretty nasty However a quick change and drop into the Dekor and no more smell Plus it is just as easy to toss in wipes and other related trash items instead of wasting refills or tracking it through the house The ONLY time we ve ever had a smell is when we ve had it open and the inner doors open to put in another diaper As soon as it closes no more smell Those who swear by their Diaper Genies I don t think it is an accident that the recent redesign of the DG basically resembles the DD in design and function I personally think we ll get a lot more use out of the DD down the line I highly recommend the Diaper Dekor for your nursery 
4 0 So far so good So far our new Diaper Dekor has done the job It is easy to use and the bag refills are simple It has only been a month or so sice we started using it but it has been a huge difference in the smell factor of the nursery 
5 0 Super easy to use keeps odors to a minimum We ve been using our Diaper Dekor for more than two years now In all that time the Dekor has held up wonderfully After hearing friends complain about the two handed requirements of Diaper Genies and the like we went with the Dekor because the easy one handed operation was appealing just stomp on the pedal and throw in the diaper We were also glad that the product was so well reviewed it turns out that those good ratings are very well deserved Our Dekor works so well that we keep it in the family room where we spend most of our time bonus we don t have to run upstairs every time we need to change a diaper and we certainly wouldn t do that if there were an odor problem The only time we ve noticed any odor has been during the summer when it s really hot and the contents get ah ripe faster and even then it was only when the lid was open Other than a few super hot weeks each year we empty the Dekor once a week and all is well The interior of the Dekor where the diapers are collected has gotten a touch stinky over the last couple years but you don t smell it until you open the door to empty the unit A little Lysol helps but frankly as long as the smell doesn t escape the Dekor it s a non issue to us and so far so good The refills may seem more expensive than other systems but they last FOREVER With my first son we used only four refills in two years I highly recommend the Dekor and wouldn t even consider another diaper disposal system Hope you re as happy with it as we are 
5 0 great find I used diaper genie with my last child it was horrid This diaper dekor is a wondeful must have product I would recomend it to every parent looking for a disposal system There really are no diaper smells it holds tons of diapers and is easy to use Get this my husband changes the bag for me as well as using it to dispose of diapers I mainly chose it due to the great reviews believe them this is the best system out there I hear the bigger one is great too I bought this smaller model due to limited space in my house and figured it would add nicely to my bathroom once baby is out of diapers 
5 0 Safe Convenient and Reasonably Priced We looked at many carseats before we chose this one 1st of all we wanted safe The seat got good reviews and had a safe harness system The seat was also affordable The pattern was cute and neutral good for boys or girls It did take some work to install the base but I think all seats would be similar It was a good purchase We especially enjoy the matching stroller that will hold 2 carseats This has been a blessing with twins 
4 0 I Like It After searching and searching for the perfect car seat that was still affordable we found the Graco Snugride It is easy to install after you buckle the seatbelt just make sure you pull your seatbelt all the way out until you hear your autolock kick in and then slowly release the seatbelt back in Once it is back in your seatbelt will hold the seat in place without the testher strap My daughter has been using this car seat for 6 months now and I haven t had an issue with it It s easy to take in and out of the base with or without my daughter in it I love the 5 point safety points on it it makes me feel like she is truly as safe as she can be and as she grows it is easy to adjust the straps 
5 0 Excellent Fit Very well made Having spent money on other stroller shields that would fly away with a gust of wind I was so happy that this one did not let me down It is extremely secure since it has a couple of velcro straps that are actually stitched to the shield thank you that keep the shield in place Others come with stickers that come right off but not this one It actually covers the stroller all the way Right now I am using a stroller system carriage that has a car seat in it so it is kind of bulky but this shield actually covers the stroller down to the foot rest and down the back behind the handles The roominess is excellent The cool pop up part is what makes it easier to put on too It s a bit tricky at first to close it since you have to twist it a certain way in order to do so but it is well worth the effort No more fly aways and awkward folding 
4 0 Works Well This fits all my strollers and is a plus to have if you live in a rainy area 
5 0 I am Not Easily Impressed But This is an A+++ Product I must say I am truely impressed and that is not the usual for me I popped it open and it just beamed at me so it looks good It fit on both versions of my babies strollers the full size and the light weight umbrella canopy stroller The velcro straps let you adjust tightness of the fit and secure it to the handles and legs of the stroller No more fly aways The only thing I could see making it not 100 full proof is the blue material that makes the roof but even that repelled most of the water when I sprinkled it kind of like windbreaker jacket material but doesnt the roof of your stroller get wet when it rains regardless Sure it does If you dont want to get wet at all Stay Out of The Rain With that said I must give this wonderful Product the Big Mommy Approval Stamp 
5 0 Definitely recommend this We use this storage and feeding set every day We bought other feeding bottles but having the breastmilk in these bottles for sure creates convenience with great speed We use these to store the milk in the freezer and or fridge and then whenever baby is hungry daddy or and sitter simply attaches the nipple and cap places bottle in bottle warmer and voila it s all ready in a matter of a few mins No fuss transferring milk from freezer bags into bottles Also because nipple is on the bottle when bottle placed in the warmer the nipple gets all warm and supple which our baby prefers rather than having a cold harder nipple 
4 0 Great This is really handy with the mini electric pump that I have I can pump straight into the bottles I just use the bottle occasionally so this item works great for me The nipples are a fast flow so the first time I fed my baby the milk flow was too fast I just picked up geber nuk slow flow nipples and it s perfect for my baby 
5 0 good for its intended perpose I have never had problems with these bottles leaking if stored correctly I use the discs with the nipples when traveling so that I don t need the full caps except for storage Honestly I don t use these to freeze because it would be too expensive I use the Lansinoh bags for that and these work great for the fridge and shorter term storage The strange little nipples are the first ones that help my son with a latching problem He always sucked air when he fed that is no problem with these and are really the only reason I buy this product as opposed to other less expensive bottles for storage 
5 0 Just What I Needed I purchased this set to use with my Medela double pump and have found it quite satisfactory to my needs The bottles fit the pump perfectly are durable enough to be sterilized as needed and most importantly keep my frozen milk fresh and safe in the freezer The nipple rings disc caps and solid caps have all worked well As for the orthodontic nipple my son has accepted it from the start and we ve had no reason to try another brand although the milk does come out a little bit too fast in my opinion I can t imagine having any trouble with this storage and feeding set if you are using a Medela pump 
4 0 Great product a pain to put together but solid safe This is an excellent double bedrail and once it is put together it is very easy to remove resize put on another bed etc We have another double bedrail that folds for travel but getting it to fit under the mattress is a pain The First Years rail makes that adjustment easy But be prepared it comes COMPLETELY apart and takes tools patience and time to put together Our other bedrail was much easier to put together 
5 0 Very pleased with this safety bed rail Our toddler recently moved into a big boy bed and was falling out of bed numerous times at night We originally bought a single bed rail but found we needed a double sided bed rail because we can t have his bed against the wall because he kicks the wall and wakes us up throughout the night I actually like the positioning of double rail better than the single because it clamps onto the bottom of the mattress rather than the top which leave more room on the bed It s easy to change sheets because the rails drop down The last part of assembling the sides with fabric getting the screws in the correct place was a little difficult probably easier with two people but other than that very easy to assemble We are very pleased with this purchase 
5 0 This is a wonderful product I bought this sling after reading the different reviews on this page After reading the instructions a lot of the problems others had were taken care of For one thing when you use it as a sling the letter P will turn over and face your shoulder To make sure the cord stopper does not loosen the instructions tells you to tie a knot in the remaining length of the cord My son loves to be held We were in Children s hospital for 10 days and I held him a lot to keep the monitors from going off So now he loves me to still hold him This sling allows me to hold him and do other things One important thing is to play with my 3 year old son 
5 0 life saver i got this for my second kid and i would be going crazy without it my baby is too small 6 1 2lbs for my baby bjorn 8lbs min which i used for my toddler when he was a baby i can go anywhere do anything while wearing it and my toddler can have my full attention while i m keeping my baby close it is so easy to breastfeed in no adjustments needed like the bjorn and no one can even tell my toddler at 30lbs even enjoys a ride sometimes for fun and those who complain about pain should first put the strap over the shoulder bone not the muscle and then realize that you are still carrying a baby on your body and the sling won t make the weight disapear when my toddler is in it i m still carrying 30 lbs but it s spread over my body not just my arms and hip i have not had any problems with the straps loosening and it fits me perfectly and i m 5 6 i highly recomend it just realize that it may take getting used to if you aren t used to carrying weight on your back this sling is awesome and it doesn t make me feel like a hippi 
4 0 OK Not great to lay your infant inside but ok if you leave it closed and slide it under baby for extra support You can t let go of your baby this way but it works great when your baby has already fallen asleep and you need something to support their weight If you are carrying your child on your hip you could slip it under their heiny to support their weight It s a quick fix for tired arms but it doesn t free you up completely 
5 0 Diaper Dekor Diaper Disposal System This was a gift for my neice She is a new mom and just loves it 
5 0 Great product great refills I would whole heartedly recommend this product I tried the diaper Genie and could never figure out how to change out the bag or hardly how to use the thing With the Diaper Dekor I pulled it out of the box and it was ready to go When it was time to change the liner which does last a LONG time I was shocked it was very straight forward It didn t even require reading the directions who has time for that when you have a baby after reading all of the parenting books and other safety manuals It is a bit more expensive but definitely worth the extra 10 for the hands free and bag changing ease Plus if the diapers sit in it for less than a week it really doesn t start smelling very much but go over a week and you will start to smell it 
4 0 works great for me My daughter is 3 and we are working hard on potty training I got this as a gift when i was pregnant and I love it There is an occasional smell I noticed if I let the bag fill up too much But that is simple just empty it more often I like that the refill bags last a long time I do admit that I do sometimes put poopy diapers inside another bag before I put it in the daiper pail just to make sure it won t smell In the 3 threes I have had it I have only brought 5 refill packages and in comparism to diaper genie that is nothing The refill packages were a little pricey my local Toys R Us sells for 9 95 a box but it is worth it and like I said they last My daughter knows to take her pull up off when it is bath time and she throws it in the dekor diaper pail without touching anything I wouldn t want the diaper genie where I have to change something every other day I dump mine out once a week love it 
5 0 The BEST of All of Them My sister had the Genie my best friend had Diaper Champ another friend used Neat and because of my their experience with all three we chose this for our registry I m so glad we did Yes when it is full some odor will come out when you dispose of another but compared to the others that omit odor without touching it this one is by far the best It took me 10 minutes to figure out how to remove the bag because I couldn t find directions anywhere but once I realized there was a blade to cut it then tie a knot it s been smooth sailing Love it 
5 0 Clean the Blade Strange title I know but keep reading and you ll understand it perfectly First of all the liners last a long time and are easy to use and refill I really like how there is a very handy and very child safe cutting blade for the liners mounted onto the inside of the lower changing door I noticed some reviewers stating that they had problems with the item controling odor while most other s have had no trouble at all Taking this into account I purchased my Diaper Dekor with an open mind I had no trouble for the first 5 months Then I also noticed an odor in my son s room even when the unit was empty and after I had wiped down the outter lid inner lid and flaps inside and out Then it occured to me There was condensation on the inside of the liner bag when I emptied it and then used the blade to cut it I wondered if maybe the bacteria or something from the moisture was now on the blade and then causing the smell So I pumped some alcohol based hand sanitizer onto the blade to see what would happen The smell went away I then thought That s just too easy and a bit crazy It can t be that simple So I waited until I noticed the smell again a couple of months later I used the hand sanitizer again and lo and behold the smell once again went away The gist of it is if you re going to put a wast material into something where it s going to sit for a few days before you get rid of it it is going to start to decompose The Diaper Dekor is great at controlling those icky germs and bacteria and keeping them in one safe place The problem is decomposisition creats heat and the more decomposing solid matter and the longer is sits the warmer it all becomes So if the temperature inside your waste recepticle is warmer which it will be than the surrounding room temperature condensation will form So when you cut the liner to empy the unit clean the blade No odor No problems 
4 0 satisfied This product is pretty good The sound sensitivity is very high and the volume is adjustable so you can choose a threshold you feel comfortable Only con is that the battery of child system didn t last very long each recharge like 3 to 4 hours You d better keep it plugged if you use it overnight 
5 0 awsome product The Evenflo Whisper Connect 900Mhz 2 Way Nursery Monitor is our second Whisper Conect Monitor Compared to the already good one way 900MHz model this one is even more sensitive has a lower noise level longer lasting rechargeable NiMH batteries and the 2 way mode can save you a lot of walking if your child only needs to hear your voice Strong recomendation 
5 0 Great for a toddler on a different floor I have a 3 year old upstairs and we have a downstairs master She wakes up in the morning and yells for us to come get her She doesn t get out of bed or her room It s great for us to be able to tell her we ll be there in a minute or to read a book or something so she doesn t increasingly get louder and wake up her sister We really are happy with it Suits our needs perfectly 
5 0 Super item I love using the system It is great to be upstairs and not have to really yell The monitor allows us to tell them we are coming to help them They know that we are on the way to help them or scare away the monsters at night 
4 0 Evenflo Whisper I didnt have a monitor with my son so I wasnt sure what to expect I thought there would be a lot more background snow but there isn t it is very clear We have a vaporizer running all the time in there but when my daughter cries her voice is very clear through the vaporizer sounds The only thing is that I wish the monitor was a little more portable maybe a battery backup A minor inconvenience The 2 way speaker is awesome When I shower and she starts to cry I can calm her with a little conversation and get a couple minutes to dry off 
5 0 Love It I m so happy with this item Even though my son is almost three this is our first baby monitor I did a lot of research and finally purchased this one because it could be used as a walkie talkie had rechargeable batteries and had a large range We have a big yard so the freedom is nice It works well with little feedback 
5 0 Better than the others I tried a few different monitors in my home and this works great I live in a condo building so was worried about static and interference but none so far Works great 
5 0 Very Snuggly Blanket In person this blanket is very cute and very soft and it perfectly matches all the other items in the Zanzibar line The two giraffe design you see in the picture above is embroidered on the lower right hand corner of the blanket and other than the caramel colored ultrasuede hem around the edges it is the only design The dimentions of the blanket are not listed above but it is 29 by 39 and has a slight amount of stretch pulling it across the width but doesn t have any stretch pulling it across the length This makes the blanket easy to use for swaddling an infant It s made of 100 polyester but you d never know it by the feel It looks and feels just like the softest fluffy fleece yet when you wash the blanket it doesn t shrink The care instructions are machine wash cold separately and tumble dry low Do not iron or use bleach 
5 0 Great Blanket This is the fleece blanket that matches the Zanzibar set It is really soft and is a great edition to this line I love it 
4 0 It s a good product I recommend this bathtub but not for everyday use I bought this product to take with us when travelling and staying in hotels For this it is a great bathtub It folds easily and is light I took it with us in our suitcase a little bulky but it did fit I was very happy I did not need to use the hotel bathtub for my baby 
5 0 Great We tried a couple different solutions to the head flop problem in the newborn s carseat These worked best They re easy to adjust even when they re closed the velcro is very strong which is a plus when you don t want to wake the baby up 
5 0 Fabulous These are so soft and cushy for my sweet darling s face They are great for the cold weather too I suggest getting them early on to help for head support as well but my daughter is now 5 months old and I just love them for the comfort and warmth 
5 0 great product This product is great my daughter 29 months loved it at first glance The duckies are cute and the size is perfect It is a cushie seat that is secure and comfortable She won t use any other toilet I also have the first years seat with the handles on the sides but this one is far superior The First Years one was about the same price but the foam part is flimsy and separates easily from the base and it does not stay put once my daughter even fell in to the toilet water from shifting her weight around on it This seat is a great value and it also has a nice hook that you can put on the wall for quick switches from potty to adult toilet 
5 0 The best potty I have had 4 potty s this is by far the BEST one I even bought the Baby Bjorn thinking it would be the best which was wrong This is the only potty that prevents my son from leaking without a hard deflector to hurt his thighs I will admit that he really liked his Elmo seat which had a horrible deflector among other things so I bought Elmo stickers and stuck them to the very outer edges on the sides and so now he loves this seat as well sometimes it takes a lot of time waiting for your little one to go and I ve noticed that with this seat there are no red marks anywhere on his body from this potty it is very soft with NO hard seems And the price is unbelievable 
4 0 Not an instant swaddler but useful anyway We use this on our second child and it does help him sleep much better I wish we had had it for our first child We own both the fleece and cotton versions and I prefer the fleece it does not get loose as quickly as the cotton one does Despite the name this is not a swaddler by itself for any but the most placid and plump babies Our kid can easily work his arms out usually through the slit between the arm wrap and the bottom pouch if he is fussy However we still use this daily on TOP of a swaddle done with a recieving blanket This way the swaddle does not come undone Yes you could do the same with a diaper pin but things stay together much longer and much neater with this than with a diaper pin or even with a second swaddle done with another recieving blanket I haven t found a good way to use it with a car seat in which I feel comfortable a swaddled kid has his legs together doesn t he but we do sometimes use it cocoon style in a Baby Bjorn or sling carrier and it can be quite magical at being soothing 
5 0 love it I think these are awesome A must have for Newborns I just had my 5th child and wish I had found these earlier I didn t use this for long about the first month But it made things so much easier that I think it was worth every penny One thing I really like is you can keep the top closed holding their arms in close while you change their diapers They seem to not mind their diapers changed as much this way They are also nice because they stay tightly swaddled unlike recieving blankets that loosen and move around 
5 0 Great for Little Houdini s The SwaddleMe was bought as a last resort to our little Houdini slipping out of every other swaddling She was unable to wiggle her way out of this It s a piece of cake to wrap around baby and easy to just throw in the wash We bought 2 fleece ones for winter and a lightweight one for spring and summer She started to get mad at being swaddled around 3 months old so I wouldn t recommend buying one for an older baby but our daughter was much calmer and slept better when swaddled while she was younger 
5 0 Must Have for New Moms I love this product Our baby loved to be swaddled and this product worked perfectly Because you can velcro it closed it didn t come undone during the night I have purchased one for every new mom I know 
5 0 Sleeping Through the Night at 7 weeks I attribute my son s great sleeping early on to the Swaddleme The velcro is a life saver because most babies can break out of a blanket you ve swaddled them in and then you worry that the blanket will smother them in the middle of the night The only issue we had was when he got a little older and stronger he would bust out his arm Usually he would continue sleeping but sometimes it would wake him up I d take that any day over trying to deal with a regular blanket It has an amazing calming effect and helps prevent them from waking themselves up with their arm and leg movements You also should really go with the cotton because it breathes I wouldn t recommend the fleece as that is a polyester and doesn t breathe 
4 0 Buy the gingham instead I LOVE this product It s a far better velcro swaddler than the other brands because it uses bigger patches of velcro In comparison to a blanket this is much easier to use and provides much more durable swaddles I m quite good with a blanket but by six weeks of age my son could wriggle out On the other hand at three months he s never wriggled out of the cotton flannel Swaddleme However even in cold weather the microfleece is too hot Several times I ve felt under the blanket to find my son sweaty It s even worse when we combine the swaddle with a sling On the other hand the cotton knit solid colors blankets are too stretchy my son quickly converts his knit Swaddleme into a toga leaving both arms flying free The cotton flannel gingham prints has less stretch than the other two fabrics and plenty enough cover to keep a baby warm at indoor temperatures It is trickier to find but worth the search The microfleece Swaddleme does however make a great non swaddle blanket on cold days particularly when the baby is in a front carrier The velcro is quite versatile 
4 0 Awesome gift and surprise I received this as a shower gift I m a resurfacing new mother my only child is now 11 so I m starting over again and it was soooo easy to swaddle my newborn son I remember struggling with my daughter to get her wrapped up in the receiving blanket and in a matter of minutes her wriggling out of the swaddle With my son he is cuddly in this swaddle for hours and sleeps soundly Even my husband who has two left thumbs can wrap him up snuggly without my help and supervision My only thumbs down on this product is I notice that with repeated use my son can wriggle his arm out and it does it looser with age Also I notice it has a tendency to bunch up at the neck so you have to be careful when you wrap the little one up in the swaddle However the benefits FAR outweigh those two glitches 
4 0 Great product just a bit pricey The organizer works wonderful it attaches to the stroller easily and folds away for storage We bought the organizer for a vacation so we didn t have to carry a diaper bag it fit the essentials and a few extra items 
5 0 Great tote I bought this for my babies room to store his toys The handles are helpful It can be broken down for storage as well The colors are bright and cheerful The product is very durable as well 
5 0 convenient and fun laundry bin I ve got an active fun loving baby boy As most babies are he goes through several changes of clothing frequently I use this Tote bin as his laundry bin and it works great i keep it next to his crib and just throw whatever needs washing into it clothes bedding toys whatever After it is filled it makes a good small medium load for washing It is attractive looking stands up well on its own has 2 cutout reinforced holes for easy toting and contains the messes well It also doubles as a toy mess pickup bin great to tote toys or other items in The size is not too deep to reach into for adults or babies If you fill this tote w small toys baby can play w it for quite a while taking things out putting things back in and looking at the mirror on the side Since it is a soft bin no need to worry that baby would bump little head on it I think this is a better size depth than the sea life pop up organizer I exchanged the organizer for this and love the convenience of it the organizer has no handle to tote around and is too deep to get to for people w bad backs or small children I also have the matching toy box which I also love very much they look great together in my son s nursury both are durable easy to clean and safe for baby to play with 
5 0 Great Product I used this on my recent trip from Alaska to New Zealand The pack was extremely helpful in navigating through the airport as well as boarding the plane 
5 0 So much better than the Miracle Blanket We bought this one first and it worked very well until my son outgrew it So I decided to try the Miracle Blanket since it can be used for bigger babies I hated It is very difficult to wrap it around it and he does not sleep as well So I decided to buy the next size up of the SwaddleMe blanket instead peace again I returning the other blanket at 30 a pop not worth it This is much cheaper and it works much bette 
5 0 Wonderful for sleeping even when they get older My son would easily fall asleep but had a hard time staying asleep We tried swaddling him in blankets but he would always escape no matter how tight we thought we had it wrapped The velcro on the Swaddle Me blanket helped keep him buddled tightly He would smile at me when I would get the blanket out before he went to sleep My son was born in the early summer so the flannet blanket worked for awhile but the cotton blanket was great for the hot nights My baby was almost 10 pounds when he was born and 22 inches long so I ended up buying the large size eventually The small size still got a lot of use since we used it every night My son doesn t need to be swaddled so tightly and likes to have his hands free now that he is 4 months old but I will sometimes use the small size for naps You can wrap it lower on the body to secure the baby s legs but they can have their hands free I have lots of friends having babies right now the Swaddle Me blanket is always included as part of their gift 
4 0 Baby Gates I purchased these for a part time Preschool program and although they are easy to use they are not as durable as I d like them to be However we will continue to purchase them because of the price convenience 
5 0 Excellent but be advised I use this gate to contain a puppy in a kitchen area and except for the annoying click it makes when it is slammed shut it was wonderfully easy to install and is very durable Reviews of it however indicated a number of users whose gate became inoperative the latching mechanism failed and since it is riveted in place cannot be replaced Manufacturer queried on this point tells me there are only a small number of cases where this occurred and that the problem has been dealt with in changes in the manufacture I bought two mpore gates for my daughter who is containing a very active one year old boy 
5 0 LOVE THIS I brought this for my 2nd daughter and love it it really keeps all the sun off her and when she is sleeping I just pull it down and its nice and dark in her stroller and the air is still flowing through unlike when I used to put a blanket over the stroller It fits great on my jogging stroller also which has a tiny sunshade now I can run without the sun blinding her I really recomend this item 
5 0 Beautiful product at a steal What an amazingly great stroller This is an umbrella stoller with all the bells and whistles It is light enough but yet has heft There is a detachable canopy basket underneath mesh baggy bottle holder winter boot rain cover and sun shade There is so much Where the child lays there is even a way to elevate the legs you usually don t get that with the lighter strollers If it gets too hot in the summer you can even remove some of the fabric on the seat so that it is ventilated I would say my favorite part is that on the canopy there is a zipper for parents to store what is necessary First time I have seen that Haven t really tested it yet but it seems to roll smoothly close down easily and open just as easily I love the fact that I can push up the levers on the back of the stroller with my barefoot usually it hurts through my boots Great buy you won t regret it The navy one really does look black but the canopy seems navy The accents that look hot pink in the picture are actually red Good looking 
5 0 We love this carrier and our little boy does too He cuddles right up against you and falls asleep at a month old and the carrier is so comfortable We tried on several at Babies R Us then bought this one you won t be dissappointed 
5 0 A Must Have If you have a baby you pretty much have to have one of these or at least something very similar The Bjorn is the original and I think the key to their popularity is the simplicity of the design A lot of other brands have added things e g pockets extra buckles or straps multiple carrying positions etc to try and differentiate Bjorn has kept it simple Both my partner and I use the same one easily adjusts for different size people pretty much everywhere including sweeping and mopping the floors The boy loves facing forward where he can see everything Hope this isn t edited Look around for cheaper prices They release new patterns every year and many places discount the previous years patterns 
5 0 Terrific Shower Gift I received this as a shower gift and I love it I had a front carrier with my son 8 years ago but it killed my back after 20 30 mins So I had sworn off of them but everyone swears by this thing these days When I was asked if I wanted one I wasn t so sure but wanted to try it out Now I have been using it for the past 3 mos and my baby girl loves it We both have been really pleased She goes to sleep in this thing everytime I put her in it So I guess it s comfortable to her too And I have been shopping for groceries and have gone to the mall with this on and I know I was shopping for way longer than 30 mins No back pain It s fabulous I recommend it to any parent 
4 0 great but expensive This carrier is very easy to use without additional adult help The straps are soft easy to adjust and it s simple to clean lots of slobber from my son chewing on the flap when forward facing My lower back begins to hurt after about an hour with this on but I can t imagine any front carrier is going to feel all that good after that long I am not rating this a 5 simply because it s expensive I would recommend trying on a few more inexpensive brands if price is an issue 
5 0 Used with Two Children over 2 year period I received this Baby Bjorn as a gift before my First Child was born in February of 2004 I used it with her up through about 9 months of age Then when we had our second child I pulled it out and it has been the best thing She loves to be in it and it has saved me from having to put her down when I am chasing my first child who is now a 2 year old I recommend any new mom to have one and it is such a great quality it lasts a long long time it is worth the money If we decide to have another child I will definitely be pulling it out again Mom of 2 little girls 
4 0 Lots of safe space for baby Great place for my grand daughter to play plenty of room for her to crawl she just stood up by herself for the first time because of the spaces to hold on to It s just a little hard to assemble fold up after use I am hoping it will move easier as it is used more 
5 0 Excellent I m very please with this product My son is unable to re organize the bookshelves dvd s vhs s and all other things that his not suppose to touch 
4 0 Great for containing an area I love this for keeping my plants off limits to my 10 month old son I live in a small apartment and have a lot of plants I had a hard time figuring out what to do to keep them out of reach once he started moving around more This works great I keep the gate around my plants so my son can t get to them An added bonus is it keeps my cat out of the plants as well Even once we move to a house I can see using this either inside or outside to contain different areas 
5 0 Pet Yard I bought this for my dog a POM He figured out how to climb out of it within 2 weeks I now keep chicken wire over the top of it to keep him in and it works out wonderful He loves a kennel but I felt bad about leaving him closed up all day so I like leaving him with more room to walk without having to worry about a big mess in my house It s very strudy 
4 0 Great gate This is a good choice The only thing is it s not suitable for a 2 1 2 yr old kid They can already climb out of this gate But I still like this 
4 0 Best play space This is great We have it for our 7 month old son who was crawling all over the place He loves to hang out in here and play He doesn t hurt himself and if you add a foam playmat under it it s even safer It s nice to have insetead of a playard because you can sit in there with the kid and hang out with him It gives him alot of room to play and crawl He can stand up and hold on to the sides He even stood by himself The other cool thing is that all the toys are in one spot We have two baskets of toys in there for him to play with This is portable and light It s kind of a pain to reshape which is why it got 4 stars but once you have it together it s pretty sturdy It s also indoor outdoor which is great for people with backyards decks or pools Folds up very compactly You could easily store this in a closet when not in use Overall it s a great product to have and well worth the money I highly recommend it 
5 0 The best I ve seen so far It is an excellent product childproof easy to install and works as intended The locks only open when the key is placed and as a magnet it s easy to figure out where the lock is in case you forget You can even stick the key on fridge if you use the locks in the kitchen 
5 0 Worked fine for us I don t know the reason for the bad reviews this fits the P P mattress very snugly and has held up well for 3 years now I just took them out to wash for our new baby and they re still in great shape just a tiny bit of pilling on the fabric No they re not waterproof so get a pad for underneath it 
5 0 Item is great gift wrapping is horrible I ordered three different items from Liz s wish list and made the mistake of ordering the items gift wrapped from Amazon Well the items came today and the boxes the items are in are beautiful but they re GREEN I called Amazon and they re refunding my charge for the boxes almost 14 by the way You re better off just ordering the items and wrapping them yourself which is what I probably will wind up doing Anyway hope this was helpful to all you Liz and Paul fans out there 
5 0 Graco Pack n Play My friend and I purchased this item to go with the Pack n Play Sand Dollar for our friend s baby shower I got this for my daughter when she was expecting my grandson almost 7 years ago It was used daily and when my granddaughter arrived she used it My daughter has lent these items to friends when they travel and she has used it for visitors with small children I know first hand the excellence of these product 
5 0 Love It Would buy it AGAIN I purchased this sheet two years ago for my son s Graco Pack n Play No it isn t waterproof but I have NEVER come across a SHEET that was However I recommend purchasing a BRU Especially for Baby Brand Waterproof Pad to go underneath it Just like you would for a real mattress When placed over the pad the sheet lies flat and instantly your PNP mattress is PROTECTED This is the only sheet I would recommend to use in a Graco Pack N Play because it is MADE JUST FOR THIS Port a Crib sheets are different and don t lie as flat or fit as snug therefore I don t feel they are as safe This sheet is easy to launder and does not shrink it will fit every time I liked this sheet so much that I d buy it again and I DID I am expecting TWINS so I purchased a second one for my second PNP 
4 0 Cara Woodbridge CT I would have loved this baby food holder if the baby food all came in jars Times have changed a little Most baby food comes in square containers so they don t fit in the holder 
4 0 Recommended I purchased two of these gates one for the top of the stairs and another for the bottom of the stairs It is simple for an adult to use but tricky enough that a toddler can not open it independently Unlike other swing gates this gate does not have any parts that run along the floor I have heard complaints of adults and children tripping over the threshold of some other gates so I think this is a better design Another nice feature is that this gate is made out of wood My favorite feature is the price I only paid about 35 while many similar gates sell for 100 I cannot give this product 5 stars because it is a little difficult to install properly You must be precise or the latch will not line up Once you have it in place it is a wonderful gate 
5 0 Top of Stairs sturdy I installed this at the top of the stairs Had to rig it to the wall used 4 small 2X4 pieces of wood and it is very sturdy My son likes to shake and rattle it Latch system is very easy to use and the directions are easy to follow for installation 
4 0 Works really well and so easy Works well with banisters The great thing about it is that you can remove it when you have guest over at night when the babies asleep 
5 0 WORLD S GREATEST BABY GATE This gate is great I have a very active 1 year old who has tried to kick climb and pull this gate down but failed every time This is NOT one of those cheap pressure mounted gates this gate is very sturdy and mounts to the wall you hear the lock click so you can rest assured it s closed It swing both ways and opens with one hand It also works great with our two Saint Bernards This is a great gate I highly recommend it 
5 0 GREAT GATE I purchased this for the top of a stair way I love it Installation was easy Opening and closing is so easy even my 6 year old and 11 year old have no trouble For the cost it is a very sturdy and excellent gate 
5 0 I own 9 of these gates I have a home day care and I own 9 of these gates Yes you have to mount them to the wall but the holes are small and the safetly factor makes it worth it The gates have stood the test of time most are over 7 years old and are still the same the walls have needed anchores because my dry wall has given out before the gates have I recommend these to anyone who needs a permanent safe attractive gate 
5 0 AWESOME All terrain stroller This thing is awesome We have a 7 month old and she just loves this stroller and so does mom The stoller is so lightweight and easy to maneuver that you can take it almost anywhere We live in a small city and the stroller handles uneven pavement and curbs beautifully I have also taken the stroller off road trail running and as long as I lock the front pivot wheel the stoller can easily manage rocks branches etc Having this stoller has given me so much flexibility and opportunity to get out of the house with my daughter especially recreationally Things you will love about the stoller VERY easy to push turn and maneuver Lightweight Quick release wheels all of them Great shocks Adjustable large sun visor Folds up compactly Easy to use brake front wheel pivot release Cool colors we have lime green Reflective The only thing I could recommend as an enhanced feature would be a shoulder strap for easier carrying This product is a great buy and defintely worth the money 
5 0 LOVE our BOB I can t say enough good things about this jogger It has become our everyday stroller My 18 month old has always been an in arms baby I wear him in slings even now at 24 pounds But he LOVES this ride The swivel wheel in front makes it super easy to maneuver turn and steer I often see parents with the older model BOB pre swivel and they have to make awkward turns by rolling their joggers onto the back wheels What a pain I m SO glad I got the Revolution Ours is the Mesa Orange color but I think it reminds me of Tomato Soup Reddish Orange and not too bright It reclines enough for my son to nap and has a flap so I can look in on him The only thing I would change is that the basket at the bottom is hard to access when my son is in the jogger Also if there were some sort of iPod attachment pocket that would be a HUGE plus Like the Jeep stroller has But I purchased some folding speakers and used velcro to seucure them temporarily to the canopy Now we have tunes on our walks I use my console purchased seperately to hold my cell phone keys iPod and sippy cup and water bottle Love the BOB 
5 0 What a ride This stroller was my favortie thing we recieved for our first child It was easy to open easy to attach the extra metal bar for car seat adaptor I wish all baby items were this easy The way the stroller compacts itself makes it a little easier living on the second floor So very light weight but feels strudy If you can afford it I would highly recommend this to new parents 
5 0 What a great stroller I used my BOB Revolution for the first time today and I loved it Here s what i like about it Made of high quality light materials Easily maneuverable and very smooth over any surface Sun canopy blocks out sun from any angle without obstructing the passenger s view Large viewing window on top of canopy Storage basket is large and easily accessible Seat reclines Straps are easy to adjust Front wheel is easy to lock and unlock the pivoting front wheel is a MUST on a jogger Easy to fold and transport Brake is easy to engage and disengage This stroller is worth the money 
5 0 Excellent Stroller My wife and I love our Revolution It is so easy to lock or unlock the front wheel for stability or manuverability It is light and tough and folds up fairly compactly with ease I haven t tried many other joggers but couldn t be happier with the BOB 
4 0 time consuming Latches work great but they are a little difficult to install on existing cabinets Would be easy if the cabinet was being assembled at the time of installation 
5 0 toddler swing review I recieved this item very quickly My daughter will love to swing in this 
5 0 Safe and fun swing We ve had this swing for three summers we take it down in the winter and it still works great The tray is nice to keep the older kids off this swing and theres a three point safety strap we use once the girls got old enough to try to stand or climb out The seat reclines a little for when the girls were real young Holes in the bottom of the swing means no standing water after it rains We love it 
5 0 baby loves this swing my baby is 8 months old and loves this swing I love it too It s much easier than other brands to fasten and unfasten the baby in the swing I love how the tray moves out of the way to get the baby in and out easily It came with the hooks too so all we had to do was hook it up to our existing swing set 
5 0 Great This swing is perfectly safe Setting it up was a piece of cake and our 6 month old Loves to swing in it 
5 0 Terrific Swing I first bought this swing 8 years ago when my nephew turned 1 He LOVED it it was his best birthday gift Since then it has become our standard one year old gift I ve given it to dozens of children and received rave reviews every time When a friend bought this for my son s first birthday we were thrilled He and his friends are now nearly four and still like to swing in it even though they have mastered the big boy swing My one year old will sit in it watching the big kids play in the garden and he is a mover does not like to sit still at all It is also perfect on days when the ground is too wet to crawl around which seems like everyday lately By the way I read the upside down post I was concerned and tried to turn mine upside down without a child in it and the ropes are balanced that I could not turn it even empty That family may have had defective ropes or it was installed improperly 
5 0 great swing My one year old loves this swing It is hung from hooks on our back porch and he swings for hours The great part is the tray for cheerios toys etc 
5 0 Easy to use Product This steamer works great and holds more accessories than the Avent sterilizer It is very easy to use Plus it s about twenty bucks less than the Avent More money to use on diapers 
5 0 Love it I had the boy version of this product with my baby and I loved it so much I bought this one for my sister in law Great product cheap price 
5 0 This was a great buy This is a very soft and sturdy bouncer the fabric is soft and the headrest is very nice I would recommend this to anyone having a little girl 
5 0 best bouncer able to bounce baby with one foot Fisher price FP designs many bouncers but this style is the best due to the leg design Some of the FP bouncers have very stiff legs so they do not bounce easily The legs curve bow out from the seat check out image of product Because of this leg design you can easily place your foot and bounce the baby My baby will fall asleep with me bouncing and then I turn on the vibration and leave her be I wasn t crazy about the PINK design but I know the leg design is offered with a Bunny print as well but that appears to be discontinued The key thing is to find the FP bouncer that has the legs that curve bow out from the seat base 
4 0 light and easy I bought this stroller because I really hate using them the packing unpacking storage there of and such I prefer to carry my son in a Baby Bjorn and a backpack when he gets bigger This stroller is light and folds down nicely Even fits the trunk of my G35 Coupe which barely classifies as a trunk I use it for my son s Peg Perego carseat It is not something you would take on the trail or jog with and doesn t have alot of storage but for going for walks using at the mall and such applications it does work well HT 
5 0 Definitely the best car seat stroller I have never written a review before but after 4 months of using the Flash EX stroller I have to encourage more users I have tried others car seat strollers and they are not nearly as light and easy as this one I love that it folds in thirds because you can travel with it in your car AND it fits into the overhead compartment on an airplane which means that it won t suffer the insults from baggage handling I use it with the Safe Seat which fits wonderfully without any adjustments just use the seatbelt The only downside is that the underside basket is small but I think the small portability and ease of use including the carrier strap makes it very worthwhile My favorite baby purchase so far 
5 0 Best Car Seat Carrier Available After looking at all of the options we decided on this car seat carrier It is perfect First it is the lightest and least bulky of all of the carriers It folds up into nothing and makes for a very maneuverable stroller Second it has great suspension that is more forgiving over rough surfaces Third it is by far the most sleek and stylish car seat carrier available I m not one to write reviews of products but I felt compelled to write something since we have used this carrier every day for the last 3 mos and it is one of the most useful things we own You won t be disappointed 
4 0 Great for shopping and compact cars I loved the fact that this folded in half so that it gives you more space in your trunk for groceries It is soooo narrow that it can fit in between any ailes in stores It is really easy to open and close The only reason I didn t give it five stars is because I had to lift the infant seat up every time I wanted to get to my diaper bag underneath The basket is soooo small and very hard to get to when the infant carrier is in place so I would put my cell phone keys and wallet in the three pockets on the handle and that solved the problem 
4 0 Good product wrong information listed I m writing this review to tell other potential buyers that this universal car seat carrier does not technically fit a Baby Trend Snug Ride infant car seat another great product The description listed on this web site states that it does Instead of returning it my crafty husband made a few of his own alterations to keep our baby girl safe Ultimately I was looking for a universal car seat carrier that was black and or gray instead of navy blue and this is what I found Despite feeling misled I m rating this carrier four stars because it serves its purpose very well especially for those who have an infant seat that is actually compatible My only other complaint is that the basket is difficult to access 
5 0 he loves it I love this stroller Its lightweight and durable My son also enjoys this stroller I think it is because he can see mommy I would highly recommend this stroller 
4 0 Makes Traveling With A Baby Much Easier I bought this carrier shortly before I flew with my baby for the first time We have a Peg car seat and I didn t want to schlepp my Peg stroller through the airport etc while on vacation To my surprise I find that I use my Combi Flash much more often than my Peg stroller It s very lightweight is very easy to pop open and has held up well through various trips I also like that it has a handlebar that goes all the way across because it is much easier to steer especially one handed My husband also had a tricky time removing the plastic parts that you have to pull off in order to make this work with the Peg once they were off though the stroller has been a breeze I would give one word of warning you do have to be careful with this stroller that it is 1 popped all the way open there s an audible clicking noise when this happens and 2 that the car seat carrier is strapped in The Peg carseat sort of just rests on top of the carrier which makes it a bit susceptible to tipping over on uneven surfaces 
5 0 If you eat out these are so convenient These are easy to use convenient and make clean ups a breeze As for the reviewer who complained that these don t stick to tablecloths uh you re worried about germs and cleanliness in restaurants with tablecloths I ve found that these adhere quite well to a variety of surfaces and my son enjoys the designs People frequently stop by our table to ask where we found these Table Toppers then exclaim If only they d had those when we had a baby You ve gotta love that 
5 0 Couldn t live without them I love table toppers We currently live in Asia and travel all over the world We ve used them in Japan China and in the USA Food gets spilled off plates dumped on tables and plopped in little kids mouths With table toppers we KNOW that the surface they are eating off isn t filled with germs My daughters like to rip them off the table occasionally but we found that the trick is to fasten the edge close to them over the edge of the table and wait to put them down until right before the food arrives that way they are more focused on the food than the placemat 
5 0 Soft Pad that fits securely I have tried 3 other mattress pads and none of them held up more than a couple washings from shrinking and ripping This Pad actually fits the mattress Finally Well worth the money Not waterproof but since the crib mattress is I didn t need a waterproof mattress pad A great quality worry free product that delivers as promised 
5 0 Best bottles on the market If you have a fussy baby or just bottle feed Dr Brown s are the best We have twin girls and first 3 months they were gased up and it was not fun Someone recommended Dr Brown s bottles which we were willing to try anything and they were the best thing we have ever used If you have a fussy baby then you will know what I am talking about If you are giving a gift for a baby shower this is the best gift you could give I can t say enough good things are Dr Brown s I was upset our doctor did not tell us about these bottles instead she had us giving them drops and buying the most expensive formula on the market Nothing worked until these bottles 
5 0 Great Product I use this on top of my son s dresser that is short and viola it s a changing table I ve never had any problems with it and we ve been using it for almost two years now I highly reccomend it for the way I use it without an actual changing table or with one I m sure it works too 
5 0 Great changing pad I got this changing pad for my dresser changing table I wasn t really sure if it would fit well but it s perfect I love how the sides go up pretty high I don t worry about my daughter rolling off the table It comes with a washable terry cloth cover that I don t think the description mentions I really like this changing pad 
4 0 So Cute and Keep Pacifiers Accessible This is very cute It could be a tad bigger but it s perfect for not having to find the pacifiers in the bottom of a diaper bag or purse And it looks nice on the outside of my diaper bag I can fit 2 3 pacifiers in mine 
4 0 Nice Warmer I have owned this warmer for approximately 4 months It does an great job of keeping the wipes warm and the light comes in handy at night I only had a couple incidents where the wipes dried out This was due to me leaving the top open or not latching the sides Other than that I have had no issues I don t even add water and the wipes still retain moisture 
5 0 Great wipe warmer Nice nightlight I love this wipe warmer My daughter loves the warm wipes The warmer heats the wipes to about the same temp as her bath water My wipes are staying moist I am filling the warmer half full on the advise from a friend so they don t dry out So far no problems I am getting another one for our downstairs changing area The nightlight is nice because you can see how many wipes are left 
5 0 LOVE IT I have been using this pump since my daughter was born 7 weeks ago It is very easy and comfortable to use and works very quickly I highly reccomend this pump to anyone who plans to pump on a regular basis 
5 0 Great Pump I chose this pump after researching and reading reviews It works perfectly I haven t tried double pumping yet but on a single pump I usually get 3 to 4 oz in about 10 minutes I haven t had any trouble with discomfort when using it and I love the fact that I can pump directly into the Playtex dropins 
5 0 Still a great pump after 11 months of breastfeeding I ve waited a while to add my 2 cents about this pump and I can honestly say that it is a keeper It is very comfortable and efficient I still pump 2x a day and my daughter is now 11 months Love the embrace 
5 0 good pump VERY comfortable but a little slow The Embrace is extremely comfortable My wife loved it when compared to a friend s Medela One complaint though it does pump a little slower then other pumps but the extra comfort is well worth it Playtex has awesome customer support My wife accidently tore one of her valves little white points that fit under each cup She called playtex and they immediately FED EXed her 4 replcement valves for free They only asked that we return the torn valve s for R D Be careful with the valves they are a bit fragile and if you tear one it adversely affects the suction of that cup 
5 0 Excellent Product A must have Am very happy I purchased this product Am able to stay away for hours while baby is with my Mom It is a must have for every breastfeeding Mom It s fast and very effective It s discreet too comes in a great tote bag and the little bottle bag is well insulated I strongly recommend it 
5 0 I love this pump I was able to breastfeed my son until he was eleven months old while working full time by using this pump I used it with the One Step Storage system which made it easy for my husband to warm and give him his bottles while I was at work The cups were super comfortable and after some practice I had no trouble getting letdown I could usually pump 4 6 oz per 15 20 minute session I haven t noticed that it is any noiser than my friend s Medela I haven t tried other electric pump however I did try an Avent ISIS manual pump and HATED it This one was perfect for me 
4 0 A great pump This is a great pump At first I was looking at pumps that cost around the 70 range I am so glad that I decided to spend the extra money My daughter was not too keen on breastfeeding and it just turned into a horrible experience that I d like to forget The hospital that I was in provided the Medela pump Ouch My breasts were sooo sore from using that thing it was not comfortable at all The cups for the breast is this hard plastic and when it would pump my poor nipples were getting so sore and then i had to use nipple cream to make them feel better I actually could not have anything on my breasts while i was at the hospital because they were so sore It made me so grouchy and I just let everything hang out I didn t care who came in the room When I came home and started using the Playtex pump it was such a relief The cups for the breasts have a soft rubbery feel to them and they didn t stretch or pull my nipples while pumping The 5 speed suction controls are very nice to have It does come with a storage kit but it only provides 4 storage thingy s I had to buy 2 extra storage kits so that I had enough contraptions to use for storing milk I really hope that makes sense And then there s the liners I had liners coming out of my ears I guess that s how Playtex makes their money you have to buy tons of liners and don t forget the storage kits The pump is a little loud when the suction is set higher I used it for 4 months and everything worked great I definitely recommend this pump I would have given it 5 stars but my only gripe is spending the extra money on storage kits and the countless number of liners you have to buy BUT It is a world of difference between Medela and Playtex 
5 0 Worth every cent going strong after 5 months w twins I love this pump I ve tried Medela and hospital grade pumps and this is by far the most comfortable pump ever I m the proud mom of almost 5 month old twin girls and I used hospital pump which got me bleeding on second day Problem flangies were too small for me and they didn t have anything larger Embrace is the right size for me and after getting home from the hospital on the 3rd day I have been married to my pump 24 7 We had latching problems so I was never able to fully nurse my babies but with Embrace I m still going strong after 5 months and pump 50 60oz day I have had NO problems with my pump no motor failures no tube problems nothing I ve pumpped with it like I said almost 5 months on average 5 times a day It may be a bit noisy my husband calls it a respirator But I would not switch my pump to Medela or any other for anything I m sorry some of you have had bad experience with your Embrace not everybody s body is made the same and not every manufacturing lot is the same I m sure of that This pump has been a life saver for me and my girls and I have no plans on stopping pumping I started with the 4oz bottles that came with the system and eventually graduated pumping into Dr Brown s 8oz bottles I love the fact that I can pump directly to both narrow and widemouth bottles I ve never cleaned my pump nor bottles in the dishwasher but wash them by hand I started working when my girls were 9 weeks old so I guess I can be called a WAHM I m a web developer and work from home and I didn t notice any drop in supply during the work day compared to the weekend WORTH EVERY CENT Try compare Not every Medela user is happy with their pump either There is no product out there that is going to satisfy everybody Embrace just is better 
5 0 Best decision ever I received this pump as a gift I m was very pleased with the outcome I considered a couple of others but this one impressed me for a first time mom I couldn t have choose another Breastfeeding was new for me and I knew I wanted something that was comfortable efficient as well I started out with the Medela while in the hosptial and it was horrible It pulled my nipples and made them very sore and that was on the lowest suction I m glad I received this one as a gift and after 4 months of use it s still going strong I m able to use it at work and that s a plus because everything is so handy Hope you consider this one because you won t be disappointed 
4 0 Great Mobile I really like this mobile It keeps my 13 week old infant entertained and she also falls asleep to it from time to time She gets so mesmorized by it that she will fall asleep My only problem with it was the first one they sent me did not work but Amazon does such a great job with returning it that all I had to do was email them that it do not work and they sent me one right away to replace it and all I had to do was print the label out and postage and everything was taken care of just had to drop it off at the post office I actually got the replacement within 4 days so that is pretty good They are on top of things 
5 0 great mobile My baby loved it since he s 3 month old He liked to stare at those 3 animals for minutes and smiled at them Now he s over one year he still loves it He can point to each animal and talk to them This is one thing that can make he calm down and let me change his diaper easily 
5 0 LOVE IT My daughter is 2 1 2 months old and loves this mobile She will watch it go around for 30 minutes While it is on she smiles kicks her legs coos at it No other toy or mobile has kept her attention like this has I see why this particular mobile has won so many awards 
5 0 great shade LOVE the shade fits well on my double Kolcraft does a good job protecting babies from the sun can be pulled right down for when they are napping Folds and stores well 
4 0 Worth the money I love this shade It doesn t stand up to the wind but if you pull it far enough down towards the bar of the stroller it usually stays put I have my toddler hold it on those windy days if we re having a problem with it blowing back at me The shade serves its purpose it keeps the harmful rays away from my beautiful little ones 
4 0 best bet for a good shade Good shade for the little angels Would recommend this for every mother that wants to sheild her babies and toddlers from the harsh sun rays The shade is big flexible and easy to attach to any stroller I use a macalaren The coverage is wonderful You fix it the way you want all the way to cover up to the babies feet or half way The sides are well protected too May not be so good on real windy days but still does the job when not fighting with the winds 
4 0 great protection but has room for improvement I have a graco side by side stroller Like with most strollers the canope on this stroller is almost useless Why is it so hard for the companies to figure out what we Mom s really want A functionable canope would be one thing for example On most strollers they are a joke So I bought this sunshade Positive folds up flat and easily attaches easily though you may have to fiddle a bit to find the best position side pockets are a nice extra and help to weigh the shade down some as well and you can perhaps hide some goodies in there because they are really not easy to spot it shelters from the side as well Negative Hello a slight wind and this thing bends backwards or moves sideways When the sun comes from the front while setting you can t really pull it down far enough to protect your children Living on an island we deal with wind all the time and so it is not as practical as I would like this shade to be But still would recommend it over leaving the child just exposed Perhaps if you have less wind to deal with you really will like this shade I gave it a 4 star because it does protect my children and that is what matters You deal with the negative points but I wished it would have been designed for all weather I don t see how you can attach a weight and still allow it to stand up correctly The material is too thin for that But I am open for ideas and suggestions I don t have problems folding the stroller together while shade is attached Perhaps that is just a matter of trying and see what you prefer and like All in all it is worth the money and afford because your little ones deserver and need the proctection Till the strollers are made with better canopes we will have to rely on something like this I also have the Peg Perego Aria stroller and had bought the single one for that one Same issue problems with wind but otherwise a nice protection And yes you will have to fold it back when you put baby in Perhaps that was the main concern of the designer Easy acess to the baby 
5 0 everyone with kids needs these for their homes they are so easy to install and work so much better than the ones you just stick in the plug and are easier too 
5 0 Time Saver This bottle sterilizer is a great time saver Zap it in the microwave for five minutes and bottles are done I do not recommend that you use it if you have a large amount of bottles to clean it s easier to boil them It s great for sterilizing pacifier s too 
5 0 great product and really fast shipping This jogger is great I love the quick fold feature and my daughter seems very comfy in it no complaints in fact she seems to look forward to going on runs w mo 
5 0 Great stroller easy to fold This a wonderful stroller I have a large 35lb 2yr old and he is very comfortable Great folding mechanism Folding is easy and I can do it with one hand Nice pockets for storage 
5 0 Nice This product is worth the price when I recieved it it put a smile on my face it is adorable the little turtle is just so cute 
4 0 No complaints This pop up bin will hold anything including soiled laundry far too many stuffed animals up to 2 toddlers though not recommended I m sure and the entire contents of the family coin jar It s pretty durable and versatile Ours has survived all sorts of trials put upon by my almost 3 year old and it still looks new 
5 0 Adorable I bought this at Toys R us as a place to store stuffed animals I actually keep my infant son s toys in it and my two year old likes to unzip it and get toys out for his little brother It s perfect 
5 0 This is just the cutest thing I love this product When it arrived I saw that it was as adorable as I expected it to be I plan to use it as a hamper in my baby s room I like that it zips shut and that it is light weight so I can carry the whole thing into the laundry room The sea animals on it are so cute I smile every time I look at it It is also the perfect size for my needs 
5 0 Great table This table is great for toddlers and it s so light and easy to move around store for the adults We use it inside for snack time but it is easy to move outside for a picnic Highly recommend it 
5 0 Excellent value sturdy perfect size Other tables were double to triple the price Look no further than this table as it is just perfect for toddlers and is sturdy and safe We have several of these in our church nursery as well and have four 1 2 year olds sit at each one without any trouble To have this table be portable is just a fantastic bonus 
5 0 Best Table We purchased this table when our daughter was 18 months old It is the best table out there it is very sturdy and she learned to get in and out of it very easily which was a plus over tables with separate chairs Our daughter is now 2+ yrs old and we still use it every day We use it to draw and paint take it outside to our garden and bring it back in nothing seems to damage it my husband and I even sit on it sideways I love the fact that it folds nicely for storage This table has been a hit with our daughter s little friends too when they come over several kids will sit together and eat and I ve even taken it to the park for picnics BEST BUY We expect to be using it for at least another 2 years or more Even our 5 year old nephews want to eat breakfast in it whenever they stay over 
5 0 We love it The table is the greatest thing we have purchased yet Our 24 month old daughter loves the table for eating and for arts and crafts When she colors on it we wipe it off when she needs to eat she carries her plate to the table and prefers to sit there vs the big table It was a great investment for us 
5 0 Couldn t Live Without A Bundle Me Pink This past November I purchased a Bundle Me Pink Starting in October I would put a blanket over my child in the car seat to keep her warm as we live in the Midwest climate When there was a little bit of wind it seemed hard to keep it in place I then decided to buy a Bundle Me Pink No need to put heavy clothes on or a big coat or even a snow suit This is one of the BEST purchases I have made for our child It is so easy to install in your baby s car seat too I plan to buy the light weight version and the toddler one when our child gets of age I would highly recommend this to anyone with a baby who lives in the cooler climates 
5 0 Bundleme for Ava The product is eactly what was needed and ordering it from Amazon was both easy and quick It was received in perfect condition in a very timely manner The perfect item for a new born in Vermont 
5 0 New baby Cold Weather You have to have one I bought the Bundle Me for my new granddaughter born in November and my daughter and her family live in the Minneapolis area It is easy for them to put the baby in the carrier zip up the Bundle Me and there is no way the baby gets any cold air on her The Bundle Me zips up on both sides and the top covers the baby s head or folds down for her to see It is hard to put a coat mittens hat etc on a newborn or young infant and it is just not necessary with this really cool product Unlatch the car seat and carry it in and the baby stays warm I bought the heavier version due to the climate and time of year but I bet the lighter version is equally great 
4 0 Warm and Cozy This is a great product for fall or winter babies if you live in a cold climate It does away with bulky snowsuits which are inconvenient as well as unsafe This is easy to use with any infant car seat It allows baby to stay warm when needed and unzips easily when he she does not without disturbing him her A must have for any cold weather baby 
5 0 Baby loves it after i brought my baby home from the hospital i put her in the bundle me and she Loved it you could see how secure she felt when she was in it 
5 0 Love this product I bought this for my daughter when she was born in October We used it all winter long It is very convenient and easy to put on the stroller or infant carrier It has holes to fit the staps through so the baby is strapped in and secure We didn t have to bother with jackets and snowuits just put the baby in and zip it up 
5 0 The best for keeping dry I have tried Huggies Luvs White Cloud and Seventh Generation and the Pampers Baby Dry worked best at preventing leaks for my baby boy For overnight I do recommend Huggies Overnites Size 4 now he sleeps through the night 
5 0 Just what I expected The footstool was just what I wanted It was in great condition and arrived just 2 days after I order it 
5 0 Best Steps Ever I bought two of these steps one for upstairs and one for downstairs for my daughter when she was 2 and started potty training She s 3 now and still uses them everyday to independantly wash her hands brush her teeth and reach higher shelves on her bookshelf They are in great shape and perfect working order still This is one of the best steps because it is higher than many steps out there but the 2 step design makes it easier for smaller children to use 
4 0 Very durable This step still is great for my 2 year old It s very durable made of pine I think and goes with everything in the bathroom I do like the fact that I can paint it any color I wanted later since it s just made out of wood I bought it b c it was the only step stool I found where the second step folded inside the bigger step for when she gets older The second step is so easy to pull in and out that my toddler can do it now too I gave it four stars becasue it would have been nice if it could have converted into a chair too 
5 0 Excellent product for adult needs Like the other reviewer I purchased two of these pads for use with my 23 year old disabled child My daughter wears a Depends and we supplement with disposable pads which are very thin and I am thrilled with the quality of the Soaker product They wash well cool water cool tumble dry and are well worth the money The appear to be very well made hopefully they will last a long while but at this price it won t be a hardship to replace them I highly recommend this product 
5 0 Matress Pads This item is great if you have someone who is incontinent and want to protect the mattress It is not limited to babies I am using for my 26 year old disabled son and it will absorb one soaking by an adult before it is saturated We use it as a backup to his attends and it has protected the matress We now have a grandbaby coming and will be buying more for the crib I would recommend this to anyone who needs this type of coverage easy to wash easy to use and it does the job of protecting the mattress 
5 0 Cute and Cozy This is a perfect little hat to match the Original Bundle Me Covers My daughter loved her hat and it kept her little head nice and warm Plus it s so cute 
5 0 A must to match the Bundleme This hat is gorgeous Very thick with an inner lining Its the perfect match to accompany the Bundleme 
5 0 Great Product No More Choking Hazard The door jams are great Easy to install all one piece so I do not have to worry about my daughter crawling around them She figured out how to take the white caps off the standard door stops in a few minutes 
5 0 Baby Shawel You will be getting lots of sale when my daughter open my gifts they all wanted to know where I purchase the toys meal and play mat etc Thanks again for a great job R Q 
4 0 makes life easier this mat really helps with clean ups after meals just run a spounge over to clean and its done 
5 0 Great mat for several reasons It is mulitpurpose and as you know if you are a parent that is a big plus Right now I use it to catch my son s flying food but it can later be used to protect the table top from art projects Wonderful addition to any shower gift 
4 0 Attractive for baby and helps avoid mess We used this as a play mat before our baby was eating solids He liked looking at the colorful images and it kept his drool off of the carpet We moved it under his highchair when he started eating and it helps keep baby from staining the carpet I wish it was bigger though so it would protect a larger area And I wish it was thicker Since our dining room is carpeted the wheels of the highchair push the mat into the carpet and stretch it a bit This leaves crescent shaped bumps or indentations on the mat Overall it is a good product especially for the price 
5 0 Attractive colors I bought this mat for my six month old baby And he is so excited by the colorful display on the mat You can tell by his expressions that he just loves the colors I am not sure if the he understands the characters yet but the colors dazzle him I guess it is a good stimulus for his brains Also this mat is very inexpensive has a good quality and a very decent size I highly recommend this product 
4 0 Great Product I love this item I agree the colors are loud but my babies seem to love seeing their little friends at meal time I fixed the loud colors problem and put the Sesame Street mat in their playroom and am using the softer winnie the Pooh version I love that its easy to clean teaches them colors and numbers The only thing is like the others above I wish it was bigge 
5 0 Love it Small organized cheap just enough for the top of the dresser and keeps everyhing contained Can t ask for more 
4 0 Good Purchase The depot fits nicely next to the changing pad and does hold the essentials I just wish the two side containers were a little bigger they do not fit the big bottles of lotion with much room for anything else Overall I would recommend this product especially for the price 
5 0 Perfect The dresser top Diaper Depot is a great thing to have in the nursery The Prince Lionheart wipe warmer sits perfectly on top of it I did not need the space to store diapers but use that area for Q tips lotion thermometer etc It has really organized the changing area for us I highly recommend it 
5 0 Perfect If you are operating with limited space and like for things to be organized then you will find this product very helpful I have my unit holding quite a few newborn diapers the Lionheart wipes warmer and many little accessories in each side holder All of this sits neatly on top of my baby s dresser All in order and ready for me to use when needed 
5 0 Very convenient I love this product It s great to store all your diapering needs in one place I got this as a gift and simply love it It holds a good amount of items and it matches with every nursery theme A must have for any mom 
5 0 I ve bought 6 so far I bought a blue one for my baby so I could see to change her diapers in the middle of the night without turning on bright lights I keep it on my nightstand and carry the budy to her crib It s safe to set it down in the crib next to her It comes on automatically when you pick it up from its base and shuts off again when you set it back down on the base The base is magnetic so don t keep it close to any electonics like TVs or computers I love it so much that I bought an orange one for my stepson s room The orange one glows red when the light is on Then I bought three more as gifts for various friends and family with young children And today I went ahead and bought the green one for myself They stay lit for 10 hours so it s great for all the power outages we get here in the winter I also use it to get ready for bed or to find things in my room at night while my husband is sleeping since he gets up to go to work much earlier than me It s bright enough to help me find my way around in the dark but not bright enough to wake him or the baby It s also great as a guest night light And it has a very soft glow that doesn t hurt your eyes when you need to get up in the middle of the night 
5 0 Great bed time pal Just got this for my 3yr old daughter and she loves him The blue light is soft but bright enough to get you around a dark room or hallway Perfect night time companion for kids 
4 0 mobile My only complaint is that the remote is loud so we never use it The music is great although some of the music is programmed under the wrong composer Oh well I guess the babies aren t reading the composers names anyway 
5 0 Great Mobile As a new mom I was looking for something that would hold my daughter s interest My 1 month old daughter loves this mobile We put it on her crib she slept there the entire night without a fuss The night light is just right to soothe the sound level is perfect During the day I get my work done with her totally occupied with the bright colours jungle sounds Easy to assemble great price couldn t ask for better My only problem with it are the batteries it eats them up solved that problem by using recharables All in all one fantastic mobile 
5 0 Love it I love this mobile so much that I ended up buying one for my 3 month old niece They love it too This is one of the best mobiles because of the movements and the colors as well as the fact that you still have a little night light with a music box when you detatch the mobile part Not to mention that it plays music for close to 20 minutes My 13 month old loves it and so does my 4 year old He is just mesmerized by it when he s tired and amused with it when he wakes up and turns it on after he s done sleeping I was a little reluctant about this mobile when I read some reviews about it being too quiet I wanted to set the record straight The mobile is quiet but it s for a baby and you are trying to lull them to sleep so how loud do you want it to be I think that the volume is perfect but if you prefer to make it louder or the house is loud you can switch it to a louder volume but we always keep it on the softest and it s just fine I highly recommend this mobile 
5 0 Daughter LOVES This Mobile My little girl has had this mobile in her crib since she was a couple weeks old and she has always loved it She used to just watch the animals move around and fall asleep to the soothing music Now she will turn her head to watch the base when it lights up This was a great buy for us My only complaint would be the little remote that comes with it The clicker is very loud which if you are using the remote it s because you are trying to turn the mobile on without being seen and the loud click gets my girl s attention every time We just don t use the clicker anymore but the fact remains that she loves the mobile itself She ll be bummed when we have to take it down 
4 0 Plenty loud enough Check to see if the crib or play yard you intend this for will actually work with it When mine didn t I decided to attach it secure and safe to my headboard Curious about reports that it s not loud enough I laid down and had a listen It s plenty loud enough even at a distance of 2 5 feet overhead Remember your infant hasn t spent time in front of the speakers at a Counting Crows concert When the baby 9 weeks old finally got a shot at it he was enchanted stimulated very excited So much for soothing but it s wonderful to know that while I m having to fold laundry he s watching the bright colors and listening to lovely music A great addition to the day with baby 
5 0 I chose this one because it s soothing I compared reviews on this mobile along with the TinyLove mobile called Symphony in Motion and the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders mobile I really like the fact that Symphony in Motion is award winning but the biggest drawback to that one is the fact that it can actually keep babies awake because of how active it is And I like the Ocean Wonders mobile because of the ceiling projection but the drawback there is that people said you pretty much have to have the room pitch black dark to see those images well Since we keep a night light on for our little one we decided against that one too In the end we chose the Fisher Price Rainforest mobile because it seemed to be the most soothing and we were NOT disappointed She tries hard to stay awake and watch the leaves go and colorful animals go round and round But there s something about the slow speed of the rotation along with the jungle noise and or classical music that just makes her drowsy everytime My husband and I are VERY pleased with this purchase 
5 0 My son loves this mobile This mobile sends him off to sleep every time I love that the music lasts so long with the wind up ones he would just start to settle down when it would shut off There are two volume levels usually the quieter one is enough for bedtime My only minor complaint is that the remote control for it makes a loud clicking sound when you press it enough to make him stir but not wake up 
5 0 Love it We bought this for my 3 month old son and he loves it There are many nights that he has fallen asleep by watching the peek a boo leaves open and close I think the level of volume is perfect After reading some of the other reviews I was a little hesitant to order it but remember It is not supposed to stimulate your baby It is to lul them to sleep I also like that you can remove the mobile part and leave the the base on just for the classical songs I would recommend this product like I said I love it 
5 0 Very Colorful and Plenty of Room to Play My little one is still on the way but I can already tell that this product will receive a lot of use It s larger than the other pack and plays out there and much more colorful The way I see it a pack and play is place for the baby to explore safely and the combination of the vibrant colors cute bug toys and mirror on the 4 sides and padded mat on the bottom make this an ideal location for baby to safely learn about the world It doesn t come with the bassinet and changer that smaller models do but those only work while baby is little anyway This product will be used for years 
5 0 Graco Pack N Play 36X36 square Good size Easy setup Colorful design No frills 
5 0 the perfect play pen just right keeps the little one happy safe in one place My daughter especially loves the toys built into the sides The only minus is that it is a bit heavy to move around 
4 0 Fabulous for sleeping but heavy We left our hand me down pack and play at our parents house We were going away before we could get it back from them so we quickly ordered a this one Having watched our first child barely fit in our first one which was a rectangle as she grew we were happy to see how spacious this square version was It looks like an old fashion play pen Our second child has PLENTY of room to grow and even at 8 months was taken by all the stuff on the sides That said space comes with a price it weighs about 22lbs So we did have to wrestle it through the airport and onto the plane for our trip But in the end would I buy it again Yes the space is worth it 
5 0 Pack and play EXCELENT It arrived exactly when they told me it would it is big and my baby loves it Safe and very colorful 
5 0 Large colorful and priceless If we would have known this was available earlier we wouldn t have bought the smaller play yard that we replaced this with Our son who is 21 months and is in the 90 percentile for height and weight just loves this play yard and we love the fact that he is safer and more comfortable than ever before We are very pleased with the quality the size the portability and the color scheme This is by far the best money we have spent for a child related item We highly recommend this item and we are confident that you will be pleased with it just as we are 
5 0 great play pen I got this play pen for a 1 1 2 year old wondering if he could tip it over He couldn t because it is square in design yeah He did try to pile things up to climb over but the side was just a little too high It s comfortable and colorful I love it 
5 0 graco square playpen is fantastic product i run an in home daycare i have several of the traditional pac n play playpens however they do not allow the room to play as these do great for confining a toddler but still allowing them room for freedom to move around and have toys they are confined but don t feel trapped very easy to set up and take down this is one of the best investments A+ in my book 
5 0 Envy of all We live on a small military base overseas My first stroller got all moldy in storage so we purchased this one when the new baby came My 3 year old loves the stroller he calls it his spaceship or his horse depending on the day and his mood He hasn t sat in a stroller since he learned how to walk but he will ride on this all day long My newborn loves the stroller as much as any newborn loves something It handels very well even on uneven cobblestone walkways Everyone on base comments on how cool the stroller is several friends with babies on the way are considering purchasing one of their own We love it and are sort of glad our old one got moldy so we could get the new one 
5 0 5 star stroller A+ for 2 children even 4 years apart I got this stroller last week I agree with the other reviewers to skip the joovy I only got that one because I thought the more expensive the stroller the better Was I wrong the Joovy way too heavy and hard to push no tray to carry anything not as big of a basket on the bottom The sit n stands front seat is way bigger My 4 5 year old has more room in back to sit stand I have a 4 5 year old that is by no means short neither she is 44 inches and weighs 42 lbs and a 7 month old that weighs 15 lbs I love the infant car seat holder This works our really well I didn t know they had this option when I bought it so it was a bonus for me since I thought I was going to have to take my 7 month old daughter out of her carseat to put in this stoller but I just put my infant carseat in there This stoller is compatable with almost all infant car seats we have Graco It it by no means at all hard to push my 4 5 year old loves to sit in the back of the baby definately worth the 120 I wish I would have gotten this one before the joovy I have taken this stoller to the airport and shopping so far and it has made my life easier with a 4 5 year old and an infant I am 5 7 and the handle to push is perfect for my height usually a problem I have with other strollers the handles being lower 
5 0 The best stroller of it s kind Prior to buying this stroller I had the Joovy It was heavy awkward to fold and had a very small basket underneath and no parent tray Even worse the child tray did not move This meant I had to squeeze my child in between the seat and the stroller and adjusting her body and legs was very difficult She was very uncomfortable and cried any time I put her in it I bought this stroller and we all LOVE it Here is why 1 Easy opening child tray so child goes in and out of stroller easily 2 Large undercarriage basket 3 Parent tray with 2 cup holders and a closed compartment big enough for a few keys money etc 4 Good head body room for the standing child 5 Weighs about the same as a one child stroller 6 Opens and folds with one hand Skip the Joovy go for this one you will be glad you did 
4 0 Sit and Stand but long trip in the mall is a pain This stroller would be great if your kids doesn t fall asleep while riding it The Sit n Stand stroller doesn t recline If you have kids who might fall asleep while you shop or just take a wall around the park or block it can be very uncomfortable for the child This stroller is good for quick task It is just meant for Sit and Stand as the name it is given Also to fold this stroller there is a trick to the front wheels It is not very hard to steer this stroller it fits fine in my Honda civic trunk while I still have plenty of room for a diaper bag as well as a few filled shopping bags All in all an okay stroller 
5 0 Fabulous I received these from a friend in Detroit MI when my son was only a baby He is now 16 months old and these table toppers have become indespensible McDonalds the fish camp Back Yard Burgers even the finest restaurants They stick very well and even if he pulls on them they are stuck The good thing is that they do not pull off the finish He loves the ones with Blues Clues and we go over the characters and fruits that are printed on them while we are waiting for our food Keep a couple in a snack size zippy bag and put them in the diaper bag The full bag is just too big Do yourself and your little one a favor and get a bunch of these Makes this mommy feel much better about not getting germy 
5 0 Best Monitor on the Market My wife and I have 3 children ages 3 and under so we ve got baby monitors all over the house We ve used I think in total 5 differet models from 4 different manufacturers including Fisher Price Graco Summer and Sony We ve used both audio video and audio only This Fisher Price model is by far the best we ve used Range We have approximately 1500 sqft on the floor where we sleep Our bedroom is on the opposite end of the floor as the youngest baby s room Other receives either didn t pickup at all or when they did they were full of static and background noise so much so that there was a continual hissing of static that we had to constantly endure This receiver can be set at a very low volume so that background noises are almost silent but the baby can still be easily heard Rechargable With the other monitor receivers it was a hassle to move from room to room You have to unplug the receiver and find somewhere else to plug it in One of the other models did offer a battery backup but we didn t use it for fear of going through batteries all the time This receiver has a built in rechargable battery Unplug it and take it with you When you re done plug it back in and it charges and is ready for the next use We re very pleased not only with the quality but also with the price Amazon s price was nearly 30 less than Babies R Us 
5 0 No more Static This product is better then most Now I am sure if you want to pay over 100 00 for a monitor it MAY be better but for the price and what I need it for it works GREAT I love the choice of channels and that if the baby is sleeping I do not have to hear static and hope I can hear if he is chocking If the baby moves this monitor picks it up Also the light indication is a plus Great monitor I would recommend this product 
5 0 Great Monitor I was going to keep the receiver in our office which has a lot of computer equipment We bought a 900 MHz monitor because most of our equipment runs on 2 4 GHz We were hoping there would be less interference We were surprised and very pleased with how well this monitor worked The receiver produces a faint hum but overall the reception is clear Every now and then I hear a clicking sound over the receiver but I m not sure if it s the monitor or the hot air humidifier I keep in the baby s room We are definitely pleased with this purchase 
5 0 The Best Monitor I have owned I love this monitor No static does not interfere with my cordless phones its great I keep the radio on in my twins room and I can STILL hear them if they cry Worth the purchase 
5 0 Great monitor I love the lights so nice when you don t want to hear rustling from simple baby movements Just turn down the volume and place in front of you when putting your feet up 
4 0 It does the job This is great for keeping your little one from slamming a door shut and possibly shutting himself in somewhere or pinching his fingers in the door jamb It s best for doors that are meant to stay open though and might slip off doors that are thinner It s great for the price and does the job 
5 0 Loved it This was the one toy I brought from amazon that did not have a problem My son loves it and the price was right 
5 0 Good This is a lot better quality than I thought it would be It is really thick and quite large I m buying another one right now for my other car seat to replace the protector that came with the car seat 
5 0 Great product Great product keeps the seats of your vehicle clean when the little ones are munchin on snacks A lifesaver 
5 0 Couldn t live without it A friend lent me hers and I thought what am i going to use this for since I intended to have the baby in his crib right away Well I had a c section and getting in and out of bed twenty times a night was not feasible nor comfortable Any woman who is having a c section REALLY NEEDS THIS ITEM 
5 0 Our Most Used Baby Item We use this constantly in every room of our house Let s you keep the baby in bed with you without fear of rolling over on him and makes any flat surface into a comfy baby bed 
5 0 The only way to sleep This sleeper is awsome My daughter is 4 weeks old and sleeps 7 5 hour stretches in it I can pick her up and breast feed her and put her right back down I think all the lack of moving around helps her get right back to sleep She is right there with me al night and sleeps sooo soundly Maybe it is the 4th trimester feeling that helps her to be so calm Whats great is that she sleeps the same way in it for day time naps without me there in bed with her A must have 
4 0 For the money it s a good quality sleeper The features that make it good there is a flap on the head end that tucks behind AND under your mattress to keep it in place The top portion is molded plastic with a decent height which is helpful if you re a toss turner you won t roll over onto it The lower half is mesh which one assumes is to allow air circulation but I think it s mostly that way to allow it to fold and be portable There is a foam wedge at the foot end to prevent baby from scootching out of it HOWEVER this makes the sleeper short enough to only last maybe 3 months more or less depending on the length of the baby I ve read that other buyers had a split mattress but mine was not split but was one piece After being folded it was obviously bent in the middle but I solved that by just flipping the mattress over for that use I suppose that the split mattress was designed after complaints of the mattress being bent so not a great change in my opinion I also liked the nightlight just bright enough to let us see the baby without waking her up fully It is sized so that it would best fit in a king size bed if you have 2 parents in bed but we managed with a queen After reading other reviews and thinking about my own use of this sleeper I ve come to a conclusion The length may be too short to use it for long however once baby outgrows it lengthwise it s probably time to get him out of your bed as he is too mobile to be in a sleeper of this design So perhaps good planning on The First Years part 
4 0 online mama This is a great sleeper BUT unfortunately it is too small and our 2 5 month old son has almost overgrown it He loves to sleep in it and feels everywhere at home if he can sleep in his little bed If there were an extending option we would be very very happy but the way it is we can only use it for another couple of weeks 
4 0 Good IDEA but not the best design We loved the idea of this item we didn t use it in our bed but in the crib instead of a bassinette when we were away from home or on the sofa Our son was 22 at birth so he outgrew this unfortunately by the time he was a month old It is really only suitable for small babies Also the mattress is split in two due to the folding capacity not sure how else to do this though which makes it seem somewhat less comfortable Only one half has a removable washable cover 
5 0 PREGNANT GET THIS You will never regert getting this This is one of the must have put up in attic till next time items 
5 0 Great way to get the job done My 2 yr old son was not interested in potty training until this We bought this potty chair and it instantly got his attention He went from not going potty to going potty all the time I bought one for my sister in law who had 2 boys she was trying to potty train and couldn t keep them interested and was only having a big mess and within 2 weeks this totally got her boys on track So I would absolutly reccomend this to anyone having troubles or struggling with potty training and for little boys the combo of this and peter potty is unbeatable and quick at getting the task done When we started my son on this within a week 1 2 he was in boxers and going all day and night with no troubles You will really appreciate this Good Luck 
4 0 fun potty My son thought the toys attached to the potty were really interesting and the sounds kept him entertained It helped him get over the fear of sitting on the potty We did have to move to the regular potty to actually get him to use the potty though 
5 0 Encouragement to begin Potty training This product was so realistic that my granddaughter knew how to use it right off the start She decided it was time to learn before my daughter was ready to train her Success on the first try 
5 0 Awesome potty chair for 2 1 2 year old boy This is my first review only because I disagree with all the negative reviews on this and this potty chair is so wonderful This potty is easy to clean and very easy for the little ones to use all by themselves My son will be 3 in 4 months and he is big for his age and this potty is not too little for him He loves the music and it is not distracting to him or too much fun I however did not use the splash guard as I didn t see the need so I dont know if it falls off easily or not We had tried everything to potty train him and this chair along with letting him go without pants or diapers on or making sure his training pants are easy for him to pull up and down is the only thing that has worked He gets to use it by himself and he even dumps it into the real toilet afterwards and he gets very excited about it 
5 0 Happy baby This is a wonderful product whenever it says or sings anything it brings a bright smile to my sons face Very easy to assemble and just plain great 
4 0 Great Potty Chair The potty is really neat My son loves it I have only found one problem with it If my son sits on the potty and moves it starts saying he pottied and he didn t Other than that it s great 
5 0 Great stroller I have to admit that I was shocked to read all the negative reviews on this stroller I have loved it from the day my daughter was born almost 2 years ago and am now using it with my son It s very lightweight and easy to steer I never have a problem maneuvering it through the mall or in stores even in the tightest of spaces My daughter loves that she can sit forward and see the world around her and I love that she can be buckled into a 5 point harness at the same time After 2 years of pretty constant use and being tossed into and pulled out of my car trunk and my husband s truck the stroller still looks brand new The fabric is easy to clean and very durable I can understand the remarks about the cup holder and basket being on the small side If these particular features are on your most important list I might think about buying a full sized stroller or travel system not one of the Italian brands Europeans just don t understand our fascination with gallon sized cup holders and enormous storage baskets just look at their cars and you ll understand However if you re looking for a stroller that can function well both as your everyday standard stroller and as your travel lightweight stroller go with the Aria 
4 0 Great Travel Stroller We bought this stroller to take on a recent trip to Europe and it was the perfect travel stroller I did a lot of research on strollers and I was really leaning towards getting a Maclaren but when we went and actually looked at all the different strollers this one stood out It s much lighter than the Maclaren and it has a snack tray which is incredibly useful if your child is old enough to use a sippy cup and nibble on crackers etc We bought this for our then 1 5 year old We must have gotten lucky because I ve never had any problems with the wheels like some reviewers have mentioned and I can steer this with one hand easily The seat reclines nearly all the way down and the basket underneath was useful for carrying extra baby items or small shopping bags It does take two hands to close which is little bit annoying It s also kind of bulky even when it s closed The sun visor is too small to do much good so I wound up throwing my baby sling over it at times to help block the sun for my little guy It seemed like every travel stroller we saw had this problem though It s very light weight and is easy to carry when it s closed My husband carried this up and down tube stations all over London along with a backpack and our five year old at times and he didn t have any problems We also traveled to Eastern Europe for a few weeks and this stroller got a serious workout in both the city and the countryside It held up really well and we re still using it as our second back up stroller The only bad thing is the sippy cup attachment came off during the flight back and we haven t been able to find a replacement Also the grown up cup holder is a complete joke and fell off after only a few uses Overall though I m really pleased with this stroller and would buy it again 
4 0 Good Funtime for Baby With the Tummy time mat baby enjoys a lot I gave this as gift for my friend s kid they liked it very much Esply with aquarium theme it looks nice Kids enjoy the waterpart on the mat I wud definitely recommend this item to anyone 
4 0 Great while it lasts This was a great activity for our little girl for the first few months The pillow really helped her to lift her head way up and check out the world and the toys were fun to manipulate She still plays with the crab at 8 months Unfortunately our cat REALLY liked the water filled fish pillow so he chewed a hole in it I figure that s my fault for not putting the toy away at night Our baby still enjoyed the toy without water 
4 0 Tummy fun My daughter has really enjoyed this mat In the beginning she would just sort of check out the fish she looooves fish but over time her ability to interact with it has greatly increased Now 4mnths she pushes around on the fish with great joy even making fun bubbles It is a great first tummy time toy The pillow velcros on so you can remove it if your little one wants to practice holding themselves up or just for a wash As far as the new water everyday thing goes I was good about that in the beginning believing it might turn green or fog up or something It turns out nothing horrible will happen if you don t change it very often Actually the ability to empty it is helpful if you plan on taking it with to say grandma s house Very easy to roll up and take with unlike our playmat The little sun could be easier to activate bubble noise A little hard for the little bitty ones Toys are still good for crinkling and chewing though 
5 0 Great Product This is such a cute surfboard The chains come off of the board for taking them other places as you go Also the water and sea life inside the pouch are so cute My son loves it 
4 0 Good intro to Tummy Time This was the only way we could get our newborn to do tummy time Flat on his stomach when he couldn t hardly raise his head at all just freaked him out and he d cry and cry But with the little raised pillow it would keep him from having his face smoshed into the floor and he d be more patient with trying to look around Now that he s 4 months and able to lift his own head fine he doesn t really need the extra booster pillow and he didn t start playing with the water bit until 3 months Plus the velcro on one of the toy links wouldn t hold But the little attached toys are very nice we made a belt for his infant carrier and put them there where he plays with them all the time But I think it s very nice for a baby as they learn head control so that it lifts them a bit off the ground so they don t panic as much 
4 0 Good value For 35 or so this is a good value The rails are sturdy enough to keep a kid from rolling out of bed even if it s not set up exactly right Length adjusts easily It s hard to keep the straps fastened correctly underneath the mattress though especially if it s a heavy mattress They supposedly fold down to the sides too but I still haven t been able to get that mechanism to work 
5 0 I LOVE THIS GATE I purchased two gates and couldn t be happier with them I have two Italian Greyhounds one is a 13 week old puppy and it was always scary going out the front door and returning through it wondering if they would bolt out Now I have a gate in the entry way so I can go through the gate close it behind me and go in and out of the front door without worrying they will get loose The other gate is used for the kitchen I can just put the dogs in there when I am busy doing something and can t keep an eye on them These gates arrived within two days of my order Shipping was free through Amazon I could not have found a better deal anywhere They were super easy to put together and install I had both of them unpackaged and installed within 15 minutes No tools necessary And they are very sturdy and look good too It took me a few times to figure out how to easily open the swing door but once you get it it is really easy This is definitely one of the best purchases I have ever made through Amazon 
5 0 Really Nice Gate That Fits Doorways Perfectly I finally got smart with the 3rd child and bought these gates 3 of them instead of those kind that you push down to lock into place and they fall over these gates are so secure and really tall my cats have a hard time jumping over them My friend has this gate also and has an 80 pound dog and he hasn t been able to budge it We have a really big doorway from our hall to living room and we were able to use 2 of the bigger 10 extenders and it fit perfectly Each gate comes with a 5 and a 10 extender I would highly recommend these gates 
5 0 Very pleased with the gate I highly recommend this gate and have actually have purchased 3 of them 2 online and 1 in the store Very versatile with the different width sections which can be added Really like the extra height as they are being used for a puppy who can really jump Also like the ability to swing gate in either direction 
5 0 Easy to set up Easy to use By far the best baby gate I have ever used Needed to keep baby on one side and dogs on the other yet still be able to walk through This gate was simple to set up and is tall enough to keep the dogs Boxers from jumping over Then the swinging door lets you go from room to room with a simple push of a tab Highly recommended and I plan to buy another one once the grandbaby starts moving 
5 0 This is a great gate at a great price I needed a gate for an odd sized doorway and looked at all of them at least twice This gate was a great bargain with the extensions included which is expensive to buy separately with the other gates I have found it to be very sturdy with no movement or realignment when it closes I didn t want to use hardware to install it and have never had a problem with the bar on the bottom I installed it with my 9 month old tugging and climbing on me with no problems It has a good appearance and is easy to operate visitors figure it out after 1 or 2 tries I have received many good comments by visitors and I am very glad I picked this one 
5 0 Excellent product I bought it initially to keep my dogs out of the living room and what I love about it is that it is extra tall therefore my dogs cannot jump over it Now that I am pregnant I know I will love it even more 
4 0 Does what we need it to do We have one at the bottom of our stairs and one between the kitchen and basement stairs Easy to install and easy to operate I dont see our daughter being able to figure it out any time soon unlike some of the others we looked at The only flaw is the squeak They can be a bit loud when you open and close them but they are sterdy and convienent 
5 0 LOVED this sling for both babies I m surprised to see so many negative reviews We wore this sling with both babies and even when they were toddlers and wanted to be carried try THAT with a snuggli I always kept one hand on the newborn I wanted to anyway but Daddy didn t As they grew the sling accommodated different positions with a tug of the strap front facing side hip on my back so I could work in the kitchen Fit easily over any layers BEST FEATURE we could transfer a sleeping baby or toddler from one caregiver to another or lay sleeping child down for nap without jiggling the wee one out of a carrier or wrestling with readjusting multiple carrier straps to fit different sized people Our babysitters and friends wore this sling too 
4 0 Pretty good alternative to holding baby all the time I got this sling when my first son was 1 5 months old and I was trying to shop in Target He was screaming in his car seat so I put it on right in the store I liked it because I could nurse him in it while wearing a nursing top much easier than in the Bjorn and nobody can see what you are doing The padded lip on the sling is actually really great it helps prop the baby s head up and also keeps them from slipping out which almost happened with a sling my cousin lent me I am now using it with my second son and sometimes I can slip the sling off me when he is sleeping and tuck it around him and he stays asleep although you have to make sure you place it in such a way that the ring doesn t get in the way or the baby doesn t get tangled in the tail I don t do this all the time but it is a nice way to get him to sleep when he s really having a hard time and because the sling smells like mommy he feels comfy I ve taken the sling everywhere and my older son still likes to be in it even though he s a tad over the weight limit I didn t give it 5 stars because as really tiny infants my sons did not like this Now though we use it a lot around the house when we don t want to fiddle with the Bjorn a great way to deal with separation anxiety If you are really clever there is a way to wear it so you can have an older child on your back My older son likes that a lot 
4 0 We have put it to the test and love it My husband and I take turns carrying our youngest in his carrier my husband loves it hands down compared to the coventional harness carrier He feels more in touch with his son and very close to him He can position him which ever way is most comfortable for the task at hand wheather it be sleeping sitting walking or just cuddling 
5 0 It s the smartest way to go I bought the NoJo sling before my daughter was born in feb 2002 and was looking forward to using it for breastfeeding and getting around without the hassel of a stroller or carseat It was the best friend that I needed being a new mother Life was so much easier with it and still is My daughter is two and I use this sling still and she s grown so much more since then Thanks NoJo for making life for me and my husband so easy and fun The malls and grocery stores will never be the same Plus the mopping of our home is made easier because she just holds on and watches safe and out of the way from her sling which is also like her blankie Thank you Jennifer and Celeste from Miami Florida 
5 0 Sassy Singalong These books are great They re plastic so you can wipe them off and flexible so your child can t hurt themselves when the inadvertently wack themselves in the head with it The buttons are easy to push and they love pressing the buttons on each page My kid even grabs my hand and helps me press the button And of course it s fun to sing along 
5 0 perfect I bought all of this seperately for my son but this would have been a great gift to recieve I especially love the foam shampoo and cleansing fluid Mustela products smell SO good 
5 0 My Grandson loves My grandson loves this walker He is not yet able to walk but he sits in the seat and loves the music and lights 
5 0 Would definately recommend this walker My baby just turned four months when I ordered this walker in February Although the pediatrician recommended no walkers at this age I used my judgement and decided since our home was one level and I am home all day I could watch my baby safely while he was in the walker When the walker arrived I read the instructions and assembled the walker in 20 minutes I place him in the walker and used some baby blankets to help prop his trunk muscles so he could sit upright He didn t cry and this was all new to him I pushed pulled him until he told me he was tired He s now five months and can propel himself backwards and side to side in small steps He hasn t moved forward too much but of course that will change In short this walker is safe durable and resonable priced The colors and rocket shape is a bit funky retro I did remove two items off the control panel the two arched movable toys because it was too much The nice thing as well as the control panel comes off completely to reveal a tray The seat also easily detaches and just throw it in the washer dryer Rest of the walker can be cleaned by wiping with soap and water There are three height level adjustments to the walker And the walker collapes for storage To summerize I would definately recommend this walker for it s durablility practicality and to increase motor skills perception for the baby 
5 0 Baby loves it I have a Safety 1st walker that is similar Winnie the Pooh and my girl loves it In fact she doesn t want to be in her Hop N Pop as much because she scoots around in her walker I got my walker from Kmart and you can change the batteries in the Hunny Pot I wasn t going to get her a walker at all and just use her Hop n Pop but she seems to really like being in it 
4 0 Very good walker colorful My 7 month old son started to walk in this walker in 2 week Height is adjustable only in 2 positions You might want to consider if your baby is small my 7 month old height is 95 and he reaches the floor on his tip toes first 
5 0 Fun Stuff What a great walker and it s so inexpensive My baby girl just loves to be in it It s built her upper body strength up and she can sit on her own now I m sure she ll be an early walker now also I like that the top can be easily taken off and cleaned or we can put other toys in it s place to change up the scenery I m so glad I got it 
5 0 EXCELENT CHOICE I bought this safe padded sheet for my four month baby it s perfecto to safe the sheet and breathe Good quality and nice price 
5 0 A Must Have You said it New Mommy from Maryland I can t understand the below comments This product is a must have do yourself a huge favor and buy two of them trust me you will only thank yourself at 2am Worth every penny After washing mine they smelled like downey and felt soft My crib mattress fits so snug and tight that I can t lift it out of the crib to put a new crib sheet on the mattress I have had mine for 3 years now and they have held up very well 
5 0 Great for gifts too We received one of these as a gift when our first child was born We then bought a second one to wash and one to use as someone else said and when our second child was born one year after the first we got a third pad We also used them under the sheets of the full size bed when the kids graduated to that though they tend to shift and you have to position them in the key area but it protected the mattress and was more comfortable than the full size waterproof mattress pads This is now the very practical gift that I give to any new parents or parents to be It saved me tons of time and effort and I just like to pass on the favor to others Very practical not very cutsie but extremely useful and generally well appreciated by anyone who uses it 
5 0 great soft easy to attach absorbs well don t have to lift mattress to change can still see cute sheet from side of crib 
5 0 Lots of bath time fun I brought this item for my son as a gift for his second birthday and he absolutely loves it The crayons dont stain your tub or walls and its very easy to clean Wonderful item for bath time fun 
4 0 Great fun but storage compartments are hard to open My son who just turned two heartily enjoys this toy The only major complaint I have about it is that while it has compartments on both sides of the canvas for storing the crayons those compartments are not easy for me to open much less a 2 year old The compartments have an indentation where one is presumably supposed to squeeze and open the chamber but it doesn t work so well for us This has actually become a little maddening and frustrates my little one A small quibble but it would be great if this toy were slightly modified to make the compartments a little easier to get in to 
5 0 Greatest Christmas Gift She Got This Year I only wish the crayons were thicker so they wouldn t break so quickly I purchased this for my 20 month old and she absolutely loves this She comes to the shower when I m in it saying color and tries to get in just to color with it on the wall I will put her in the shower and let her color while I shower then get out and let her continue to color while I m getting dried off then bathe her She actually hates getting out of the bathtub now I d recommend this to anyone with children who love to draw or color The crayon marks are easily removed off of any tile or ceramic tub though I don t know how well it would work with those plastic laminate ones and with the side compartments to hold the crayons in with the holes so the crayons can dry there s no crayons lying all over the bathtub The most used Christmas gift yet and even loved by my 9 year old son 
4 0 Great idea Needs a fix I got this for my 2 year old and it ll keep her busy for a good while She loves coloring LOVES IT The only problem I have with this is that she won t keep the crayons in their little holders and the crayons break easy Which is what crayons are wont to do in little hands I think Crayola would have been better served making these a bit thicker for tiny yet strong hands The same way they have those super big crayons for pre school Another thing you may consider just getting the bath crayons The board is cute but Lydia prefers a bigger canvas and only used the board for a few moments before moving onto the great big tub and tile Don t fool yourself they re going to color on the tile Wipes away easy enough though If you go to Babies R Us you will find Baby Einstein crayons for 3 99 A nice replacement with the same sleeves included Colors include Red Green Yellow Blue Black and Orange ETA The easiest way I ve found to clean the tub after a couple of sessions of crayon play it to spray the surfaces with Scrubbing Bubbles let it sit for a few moments and wipe away There is a bit more elbow work required otherwise 
5 0 worth the price My 6 yr old son loves this one He can draw and use his imagination unlike the floating dolphin musical rings It suction cups to the shower wall has compartments for the crayons Well worth the money 
5 0 From fighting at bath time to asking to take a bath 3 yr old was fighting each night to take bath now asks to take bath Great toy Adult needed to open the crayon compartments and I have a hard time nothing to grasp on but she learned to hold them open to keep from closing Crayon is suprisingly dark and yet easy to rub off She cleans the surface herself with a wash cloth 
4 0 bouncer This bouncer model is the best available currently on the market even though there are few flaws and room for improvement as other Amazonians pointed out But it does work and keeps our baby entertained while leaving parents some much needed time for other important things around the house Sounds and lights are easily activated by baby s movement but volume can not be adjusted Vibration mode could keep baby amuzed for about 1 2 hour first month but later our baby got used to it and does not care for it as before We also like to use this bouncer without play bar as simple comfy chair This way baby could listen see parents or watch together Baby First TV I higly recommend this product to new parents or as baby shower gift 
4 0 Better than its predecessor still needs work though This seat is for our 3 month old daughter who weighs 15 pounds First I ll point out the pros of this bouncer seat The music is wonderful The waterfall is captivating The colors are mesmerizing She can sit in the seat for 25 minutes easily The seat takes 4 D size batteries Unlike other bouncer seats we have used there is only one compartment for 4 D sized batteries Unlike its predecessor the Ocean Wonder Aquarium the Rainforest bouncer keeps our child AWAKE If we wanted our child to sleep we d put her in bed not the bouncer So Fisher Price definitely got it right this time A++ The cons is that the seat was used twice before it started to make this loud clicking noise from the bar Being an engineer I took it apart and noticed that the gears are designed to click or skip a gear if a child were to grab the frog or the monkey while it is moving This prevents the gears from being stripped or the motor overheating However the tension on this gear skipping behavior is too sensitive such that after 3 hours of use the clicking occurs from just the friction of the frogs moving up and down on the bar I called customer support about the clicking and they promptly sent a replacement bar After 2 weeks of using the new bar it started clicking Argh The good thing is that the new bar does it randomly We re willing to live with the flaw and the annoying clicking from time to time for the Pros listed above The other con is questionable There is much debate about the height of the toys on the bar Being an infant bouncer it is designed such that the child can grab the toys and even pull the rings off the monkey Our daughter loves it We do have the Fisher Price Kick and Play which is designed for slightly older children in that it provides more clearance between the child and the toys hence Kick and Play The bouncer comes with a one year warranty So for a year I can get replacement bars as the clicking becomes annoying After replacing enough of them will their engineers will fix the problem I hope so 19 March 2007 The clicking has returned with the replacement bar and won t go away I called Fisher Price for a replacement bar While they really wanted to send a voucher for 48 I pressed to have another toy bar sent as a replacement At that point customer service informed me that there is a backlog of replacements on this bar till 30 April 2007 Customer service continues to be very friendly and easy to deal with We re willing to wait for the new bar 
4 0 Had some issues My son thoroughly enjoys playing in the bouncer However approximately three weeks after receiving the bouncer the toy bar began making a horrible clicking noise I telephoned Fisher Price and their customer service was great They immediately sent me out a complimentary replacement toy bar no questions asked Overall I am quite happy with the bouncer and Fisher Price 
5 0 best ever I bought this for my 2 month old for christmas My baby loves it My baby will sit in it for hours 
5 0 Best bottle out there My son had no colic or gas while using these bottles It is well worth the extra time spent cleaning the bottle parts when you never have to stay up all night because your baby has digestive discomfort I used these with both formula and breast milk and they worked wonderfully Dr Brown s have many nipples to adjust the flow for your child so these bottles really grow with your baby 
5 0 great bottles to have for your new baby I have heard and read numerous articles on how good this product is out there on baby bottles SO I went out and bought 2 sets They are wonderful to have I would recommend them to any new parents out there to use for their newborn 
5 0 Dr Brown It worked for us This bottle solved these problems for us Gas Spit Up Milk leaking out of baby s mouth low birth weight she just wouldn t eat much My baby started out life as a breastfeeder and at 2 weeks was diagnosed with a milk allergy She was not gaining weight She was switched to soy I didn t want to try these bottles I tried Gerber Evenflo Playtex Avent My mom read that they helped with colic and so she brought me one I used that one bottle for two days until I could get to the store Since then I have retried all of those other bottles She started eating less and losing more of it out the side of her mouth and spiting up again This is her favorite So it is worth it to me 
5 0 Very little colic for the new baby My son and daughter in law report that of all the baby bottles that they ve tried Dr Brown s Natural Flow bottles are the easiest to use and my grandson has a much easier time with any possible after effects of bottle feeding times 
5 0 Fabulous This is the second set of Doctor Browns that I have bought online No other bottle will do now for my little one It was suggested to me by my doctor and friend to try these bottles since my baby had alot of gas The only negative I had heard is that it takes a little longer to take the bottle apart but it isn t a negative for me at all it takes a second and boy is it worth it I can t recommend them highly enough 
5 0 Great pacifiers I think these pacifiers are great they work either way so at night you don t have to feel around for a notch to make sure they re going in the right direction They don t leave marks around my baby s mouth like another pacifier did I believe the company is European maybe that s why they re not as widespread in the U S but they re made well The attachment is so useful especially when you re out and about with the baby Just imagine the horror when the pacifier drops out of the baby s mouth onto the germ filled floor and there s no bathroom in sight to wash the pacifier 
5 0 lo2 yr old still loves it just ordered 2nd one for our newborn Our toddler boy still enjoys this for naptime and asks for certain sound combinations With our little daughter due soon we decided rather than taking it away from our son we will buy as second one for our daughter s room It was very effective for our son his entire life so far 
4 0 works great nice clear sounding device Hopefully it will help with sleep for the baby 
5 0 Great Machine for Great Money I love this white noise machine I read somewhere that people did not like it because it was not loud I think it is plently loud enough I was just going for a little noise for the baby to listen to as she can not sleep in silence not wanting to hurt her hearing and drown out everything else in the house Lots of variety on the settings and has a plugin so that batteries are not always needed 5 Stars 
5 0 Sound Sleep I ordered this for my grandson and he loved it It makes just enough white noise that he is able to sleep He lives in town and the country can be really quiet sometimes It is a great machine and we are enjoying it 
4 0 He can sleep all night now This product is really great It is an inexpensive white noise maker to help baby sleep I like that I can plug it in and it runs all night Now when my son wakes at night he can settle himself back to sleep and it also helps him nap longer during the day The only negative is that it does not remember your standard settings every time you turn it on Each time you turn it on the volume is on low and the sound is the ocean Also if you have a power outage the battery backup will kick in however not before the sound resets to low volume ocean sounds I will say that I think I sleep better hearing the rain over the monitor 
4 0 I love this portable crib This product shipped fast and was in good condition except for a small dent in the side rail which I did not notice until I put the crib together and threw away the box otherwise it was in good condition It s nice and easy to move from room to room and small enough to fit in tight spaces 
5 0 cribs These are sturdy cribs that hold up well I own a daycare and these are used a lot daily They still look new I have had some for 3 years 
4 0 Looks better in person than online I ve not bought one of these yet but after seeing it in person we re definitely getting one in a couple months for our new baby It s very small great for our 1bdr NYC apartment People that have reviewed this previously don t mention the incredible amount of space this would save in a small living area Since we don t have an extra room for our child this will be perfect Seems much more sturdy than any of the wood portable cribs As for the particle board under the mattress you could very easily reinforce it with another board or metal braces You can remove the wheels if at a later time it worries you that your toddler would be standing in the bed It has 2 adjustable heights Seems really good to me 
5 0 Great Idea I think for space challenged households this is the way to go The chair fits perfectly on our dining chair so our little girl can sit with us while we eat The height adjustments work so that the tray will slide over the top of dining table so you don t have to keep the chair pushed away from the table An all around great product 
4 0 love it This chair is good for places that are small I started using it when my daughter was sitting with support and it was really good for her it saves space provides support and is comfortable I fully recommend this chair to anyone and it is very affordable as well 
5 0 Great for little ones I LOVE IT MY SON CAN SIT AT THE TABLE WITH US AND TAKE A NAP HE IS ONLY 2 MONTHS OLD IT LOOKS GREAT AND WILL BE WITH OUR FAMILY FOR YEARS TO COME EASY TO SET UP AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT IT WILL TRASITION INTO A TODDLER SEAT 
5 0 J5933 is the 2006 model The model Amazon sells is J5933 but there is a new 2007 model L1907 Amazon doesn t sell the new model apparently and I don t know what the differences between them are I checked the Fisher Price website and it doesn t say but they list both models I ordered mine from Amazon on March 9 2007 The chair was exactly what we were looking for Our dining area is fairly small so using our existing dining chair does save space The booster chair feels secure as it secures both behind and under the dining chair with buckle straps It also has non skid rubber feet on the bottom of all four corners The 3 point to 5 point harness is helpful for keeping the baby in place We were using one of those cheapy plastic block booster chairs and our 7 month old kept slouching underneath the tray The countoured seat in the Space Saver High Chair helps to prevent that The adjustable height was useful for raising the tray to just above our table level so we could slide the whole chair underneath when not in use I m not sure when we d recline the seat but I guess it s a nice option to have The chair reminds me of a car seat and as such keeps our baby in place while feeding The one handed release of the tray and the highly adjustable settings are convenient options I don t think I could ask for anything more out of a booster chair Perhaps a built in iPod adapter with speakers built into the tray or something Just kidding 
5 0 Highly recommend I highly recommend this product Comfortable for baby Easy to clean No big highchair sitting around your kitchen all the time Can slide chair to table with highchair in the seat Good safety harness keeps child securely in place No slouching or sliding down Converts to booster when child is older Definately think it s worth the money 
5 0 brrrfect for fall and winter love it started using it as soon as my daughter was born she hated heavy clothing sweaters and like and this worked like a charm 
5 0 Great Product We bought this because our son was quickly outgrowing his car seat and big snow suits and coats made it that much tighter so by using this we didn t have to put them on him Fit very good on our graco car set kept baby warm and it s a lot easier to just zip this down when you get somewhere rather than take coats on off I will be stashing this away to use if I have another baby wish I bought it sooner 
5 0 This was for my grandson I bought this for my new grandson and my daughter has told me how great it is She doesn t have to bundle him up constantly just put him in this and he is ready to go Plus it keeps him nice and warm and we live in a cold climate 
5 0 One of best items for baby We absolutely love the Bundleme It is so much easier to just tuck her into it than try to wrestle her into a snowsuit or wrap her up in multiple blankets She is happier and calmer and so are we It just makes taking her out so much easier faster and less stressful on all of us And it has definitely kept her warm this winter In fact we have to be careful in the car to make sure we unzip it and pull it down because she gets too hot during trips that last longer than a few minutes I have recommended this to my sister in law who is pregnant and am considering buying a Bundleme Lite for this spring and possibly next fall if my daughter still fits into it because I have been so pleased with how the original has worked out for us 
4 0 Comfortable and attractive This is the most comfortable carrier I have tried and the easiest to put on The shoulder cupping theory works well in practice at least with my son who is 7 5 kilos right now The carrier itself is well made and the clasps are nice to have instead of having to tie it on I would say that mobility is a tad limited because if you have to reach for anything high up the shoulder strap slips up around my neck but otherwise I was able to do stuff around the house while wearing my son and we were both comfortable 
4 0 good if you can get it together I love this rail It s the perfe ct size and easy to put up and down Yes it is very difficult to get together because the fabric is so taut that you have little room to manuever It was very easy to attach to the bed and adjust once it was up I m looking to buy another one for our shore house 
5 0 Love it in spite of its flaws I agree with the other posters this pillow s stuffing has not held up like I d expect from a Boppy It s almost as if someone besides Boppy made it and put the Boppy label on it but the design is exactly what I ve come to expect from Boppy innovative and unbeliveably useful I have been using this pillow since I was 6 months pregnant and my baby is now almost 17 months old I just can t give it up My husband and I fight over it so much he loves it too calls it the comma pillow I m considering getting him his own for Christmas The shape provides so much back and bip support even when you re not pregnant I honestly don t think I would have gotten any sleep during my pregnancy if it hadn t been for this pillow and the little tail small end of the pillow can provide amazing support for your lower back when you re nursing on your side which means I was able to get sleep during those first few months of sleepless nights also My pillow came with a washable case so I toss that in the washer The pillow did start to separate after a few months but I ve tried to keep it fluffed regularly and I think that s helped it stay in one piece instead of separating fully into two sections All in all I highly recommend this pillow but as one other poster noted it s a matter of personal taste and body shape as to whether it will become your favorite or be deemed a poor investment I ve definitely gotten my money s worth and will likely buy another one when this one wear out even if I don t have another baby 
5 0 Makes sleeping comfortable I got this pillow when I was about 5 months pregnant because I was needing something between my legs for my hips I am now 39 weeks pregnant and I can t imagine sleeping without it It makes rolling over easy and it stays between your legs so there is no need to adjust when you roll over The part that goes under the belly provides just the right amount of support and isn t too big and bulky I will even be taking this with me to the hospital for while laboring I love the boppy prego pillow 
5 0 Love it I have used this pillow since the beginning of my pregnancy and it is wonderful No problems with the stuffing becoming lumpy or mis shapen Great for releaving hip pain and as a stomach sleeper it allows you to sleep on your side with similar comfort to stomach sleeping by leaning into the pillow I highly recommend it 
4 0 Great idea Horrible price After my 20 month old figured out how to escape I felt this option was best as I knew if we put him in a toddler bed the entire family would be up all night hearing him scream at the gate Pros really works even for hard core escape artists made well makes me feel much better knowing that he is safe Cons Can t hang any crib toys can t use The Ultimate Crib Sheet which is one of the best baby products ever your child will HATE it at first the mesh is kinda rough so my little mad one has red face burns from rubbing on it Biggest downside TOO EXPENSIVE I feel since this company as far as I know is the only one making this they feel they can charge this much just b c desperate parents have no other option Overall love the product HATE the price 
4 0 Great protection well i ordered this item overnight because my 19 month old began climbing out of the crib again he had done this months earlier when the crib was not on the lowest setting so that time the problem was easily solved this time not so easily i was so afraid he would crack his head open on our hard mexican tile floors many of the other moms wrote how their kids seemed to love it wsh i could say that i love it because i know it is protecting my child from a potentially very harmful fall but he REALLY was freaked out by it the first few nights i think it would be nice if it were to go higher up have a higher arch thus not making it feel so confining so much like being caged in so he didn t like it at all but it has been five or six nights now and he is used to it and simply checks it out then rolls over and goes to sleep but it did cost us some tears i m not talking hours here five minutes max on the worst night anyways all in all i think it is a great product for all parents who want to protect their little monkeys from potential injuries 
5 0 Best ever Our toddler was always very active since he was born so when he got his foot stuck in the side rails we upgraded to this one from the Crib Tent I I couldn t imagine not having this I have peace of mind and don t have to worry about my son climbing out OR getting himself stuck again Fantastic invention 
4 0 Excellent Product I don t find too many things anymore that exceed my expectations This product is one of them My son is strong and active He would constantly climb out of the crib and would land on the floor head first On one of those occasions he had to go to the hospital because he hurt himself bad I did not know what to do until I went online and found this product It saved us all I put it together myself and it was pretty simple and best of all it works I thought that my son would have been able to break it because he is strong but that is not the case He likes it It keeps him in and he even thinks it is a tent to play in It is Cozy No more scares The zipper does make alot of noise and I have had to sew a few spots because the seam is so tight it tends to rip in a few spots I purchased it in December and I am still talking about it GREAT PRODUCT 
5 0 Extremely helpful product with some workable issues We have used these tents with both of our sons since they learned how to climb or fall as the case may be out of their cribs on their own at 18 months of age Now we know they are safe and secure and totally happy camping in their cribs We do have traditionally designed cribs so attachment issues have not been a problem and we are able to lower the moveable side of their cribs with little difficulty We have had to do a little needlework on one of the tents as the mesh separated from the edging material attached to the crib But it was a one time repair and is holding up well We did have to anchor the zipper to one of the velcro straps after each boy learned how to open the zippers on their own We initially used a ribbon loop under the tent pole end and later utilized a carabiner clip and the velcro strap for more easy access We always bring the tents with us on vacation if we will be using standard cribs Love this product and the safety it provides to the boys 
5 0 The best for on the go moms I love this item because it s perfect for the diaper bag or in the car It has been handy to me when my baby wasen t feel well I was able to take her temp then give her medicine without having to open five differnt bags 
5 0 AMAZING POTTY AS GREAT AS IT LOOKS me love mine potty mi mommy liks it also and got me too of dem even dough mine fwends wowe undies me didn t kare me liked diapers but wen mommy getted me dis comfy potty i never gonna go in mi diapers ever again i luv it cuz i can do it bi miself like mi mommy and daddy weneva i need to go i just go an sit down it is so cozy dat me dozent mind sitting on it for while sinc it is ony too peices when im dunn i can just spill it in da toilet and wipe itwith potty wipes and its all cleen for next time Mom s Commentary This potty is really fantastic I bought two of them one for upstairs and one for downstairs I especially like the white one because it gives a clean look All the other pottys I ve tried either had lots of grooves and peices that were hard to clean and deal with or were only one piece which we would have a whole operation clean up after each use As my child mentioned she can spill it in the toilet and then clean it with CLOROX WIPES she calles them potty wipes The rubber strip on the bottom makes it stay where its put I also bought the matching stool so that she can wash her hands and that stool proves to be great as well I think that this potty deserves five stars 
5 0 Outstanding for Potty Training This chair works extremely well and is worth every penny It is extremely easy to clean and comfortable for a toddler to use I would strongly recommend this potty chair to every parent 
5 0 Great potty I recently purchased this potty for my 16 month old son We are not actively training but I wanted to introduce him to it The first night I got it he went pee pee and boo boo in it I screamed and clapped and sang a little song He really likes it He even brought it out of the bathroom and took it into the living room to watch The Wiggles while sitting in it I like the color and how it fits his size He s 27lbs and 32 inches tall He can sit on it and get up all by himself Its very sturdy it doesn t wobble or tip over like some do My son has even held onto one of the sides while sitting on it and leaned over to pick up one of his books and the potty didn t tip at all One reviewer said the splashguard was a little short but I haven t had a problem My son tends to look down at himself while he s going so everything is pointing south anyway I love that there are only 2 pieces to this chair Very easy to clean I had a safety 1st chair with the flip top lid and the detachable splashguard and I absolutely hated this thing My son would pull off the splashguard and walk around the house with it He was too concerned with the lid and turning around on the chair to pull the lid up and down instead of concentrating on trying to go potty With the baby bjorn there are no distractions no music no removable pieces except the bowl which allows him to focus on going potty I just really like this potty chair I would highly recommend this chair 
5 0 Wonderful What a great potty seat The molded plastic makes clean up a breeze so you don t have a residual odor developing My son loves it It is also small enough it doesn t take up much room in the bathroom And the color blends in nice 
5 0 Thank you My 4 month old son absolutely loves this We got it for him when he was 2 months old and this has been a lifesaver for us since then He plays in it for over an hour at a time which gives me time to do other stuff around the house 
5 0 Happy Baby When I ordered the gym my baby was 2 months old she is now 3 months old and it is the best thing since sliced bread Every morning she plays under it for one full hour There is so much for her to do and the accessories are interchangable so you can add toys lower toys raise toys It is easy to pack up and take so we take it when we visit relatives 
5 0 She LOVES it I recently purchased this item from a local babies r us and my 2 month old LOVES it She just lies there and stares at the light and music box She to look at herself in the mirror I love this gym it enertains her while I try to get stuff in the house done So happy I bought it It is kinda pricey though but in my opinion well worth it 
5 0 The best thing I own My 7 month old has used this daily since he was 8 weeks He loves it even more now As he grows he finds new ways to play with the gym He loves the music and lights especially He will play on his own for 20 minutes at least This is a lifesaver for me I can use it to occupy him while I get ready in the morning or any time I need to distract him or just put him on the floor to play and know he ll stay in one place I would highly recommend this to anyone I think it s the one piece of baby gear I absolutely would not give up 
5 0 The Piece De Resistance I Love it I Love it I Love it My son is three and a half months old and quickly becomes bored and needs a new stimulus This playmat is just the trick I m in heaven When he tires of staring at the wide array of toys that are attached to the playard and playing with them he rolls over and pushes on the aqua part of the mat his favorite part then he rolls back over and stares at the lights and dancing fish on the detachable music box and happily laughs and kicks the cloth poles that hold the soft child safe and friendly toys above his head he loves being able to control the movements of the toys above his head so much and the cloth covered poles do not scare me as muc as the typical plastic ones lastly he looks at himself in the mirror as he drifts off to sleep He loves this mat and has finally given me some free time The tummy time has doubled voluntarily since we recieved it in the mail Defenitely worth the higher price Also the biggest playmat of this type that I ve found on the market will defenitely last me until far after we hit that crawling stage and then the detachable toys will still be usable As will the mat for naptime Thank you 
5 0 Great Product Great Price I use the mirror on my front windshield so I can keep my rearview mirror on the road and it hasn t fallen a time I have a larger mirror that attaches to the back seat where I can see my baby and she can see herself The seat protector is saving my leather and I ve had no issues at all with the sunshades This is a great value for 9 99 as a seat protector alone costs about 13 00 If this stuff was all purchased separately you d pay about 30 I m very pleased with this purchase 
5 0 Best baby gift ever This was the softest smoothest gift I thank you for getting this for me on time 
5 0 Great for those who still need it Love it My daughter would not sleep with out it 
5 0 Great I bought this for my newborn granddaughter sight unseen It s soft warm and works perfectly with the velcro closures She also has some receiving blankets but hasn t used them at all for swaddling because this item works so well and is so convenient 
5 0 Velcro not sticking issues I don t have one of these but I am buying 4 of them for baby shower gifts In reading the reviews there was mention of the velcro not sticking after a while If you take a needle and pick the lint off the one side of the velcro that is the scratchier side it should work again This will work for any velcro closer 
5 0 All hail the Baby Burrito Our 10 week old daughter had not slept for three days We had called the doctor and searched on the internet for suggestions to get her to sleep and keep us from going insane I read a suggestion that colicky babies liked to be swaddled and remembered that we had a Swaddleme in the closet It was so easy to put her in and she has slept well for the past three nights I am so thankful for this product 
5 0 It s fantastic I bought one of these while pregnant w our five day old daughter and I never had anything like it w our first two daughters Let me just say this one simple product renders ANY OTHER blanket obsolete It s soft pretty cozy easy to use I was always lousy at swaddling w regular receiving blankets impossible to get out of and she loves it I m going out tomorrow to buy five more LOL 
5 0 Caboose Stand On Stroller This was an awesome purchase Especially if you have a newborn and a toddler It really helps the toddler feel included and helps make the transition a lot easier This stroller helped motivate me to get out and shop knowing that I would not have to chase my toddler through the mall 
4 0 Love my stroller I purchased this stroller a few weeks ago I have a 22 month old a 4 year old they love it My 4 year old loves the fact that if she gets tired she can sit or stand in the back We are going to NY in a couple of weeks and this is why I purchased this stroller because you have to walk everywhere now I am sure that they will be OK The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is because it s a little heavier than I expected Other than that i s great I higly recommend it I plan to have another child so I know I will keep this for a while 
4 0 Very Pleased I am very pleased with my purchase I have a 3 year old and daycare a 1 year old and 3 year old so wanted something that I could walk with the baby in and let the older ones rest when needed This works great It isn t hard on the wrists like I found most double strollers to be Can be easily steered The only things missing are the cup holder which you can buy and I think that rubber wheels would have better suited the stroller especially for outside strolls But other than that I am very pleased 
5 0 Mommy of Two Love it no complaints I have a 2 1 2 year old son and six month old daughter We graciously accepted my sister s hand me down Evenflo Take me Two double stroller before the arrival of my daughter Not only was that ridiculously hard to move it weighs 47lbs but my son weighing 35 lbs would throw a 2 year year old fit and end up kicking the back seat of his sister s chair and send her flying forward My children are both super tall and heavy After loading them into my suv loading the stroller was like a joke After some extensive research my Joovy arrived two days ago and have used it on a crazy expedition to Walmart one week before Christmas mind you My 2 year old is extremely picky and he hopped right in and rode the whole time He felt he was a big boy and my daughter rested happily in the universal car seat attachement bar She is also big enough to just sit up so that is what I will try next Both kids were comfy content and safe It glides with ease is a BREEZE to open and close lift up two small levers with your fingers and it collapses The construction is obviously very sturdy and high quality And it only weighs 24 lbs yeah LOVE IT so glad I bought it it will be a life saver Thank you Joovy 
5 0 Wonderful Product I got this for my daughter who is very big for her age and grew out of her infant tub at 6 months She can sit up well but I worried about her falling slipping and hitting her head This product is easy to use and works very well The instructions tell you to make sure your tub is CLEAN and DRY and you MUST follow these instructions if you want the suction cups to hold BONUS It covers up the lever that you flip up and down to stop up the tub too 
5 0 Great product My son is very active in the tub and this product has made it totally safe for him in the tub We added a rubber frog cover on the faucet and together he can play all he wants and we feel confident he won t fall and get hurt 
5 0 great value I have not used this product yet but the price was right the quality of the product looks good and I am looking forward to seeing the result of its use 
5 0 About as good as you can expect I like this product so much that I am taking PRECIOUS daddy sleep time to write this review at 3 00 am on what appears to be the tail end oh God please of a week long growth spurt every 1 1 2 to 2 hour Porky Pig feeding frenzy for my firstborn three week old Granted this took a few overheated bottles and a little practice to get it right At first we were pretty p o d that we couldn t get this thing to heat consistently my wife is a doc and I m a lawyer so you d think between the two of us we could heat up four ounces of milk but nooooo apparently you need a PhD in nuclear physics to accomplish this After about ten tries I started to get the feel for it and now I don t even measure the water I just dump a bunch in and start counting Going by time produces much more consistent results than relying on the water measuring which if done with exact precision would probably work perfectly For me holding el porko in one arm and manipulating the faucet and water measuring flask is a bit rough so again for me just counting off ten alligators and pulling the bottle works great I d recommed that the company devise a flask that utilizes a sliding mechanism and slot so that you get an exact amount of water each time with excess water spilling off As a sidenote we use chilled expressed milk in Avent bottles and I find that 1 leaving the lid on the bottles makes it easier to remove the four ounce bottles from the steaming warmer 2 squeezing the nub the bulge right below the nipple tip of the Avent bottle releases pressure built up by heating 3 swirling the bottle gently after pulling it from the warmer is a good thing and 4 a once a week cleaning seems to be about all the maintenance this thing needs I griped to my mother about the sometimes inconsistent heat to which she laughed and told me go boil some water pour it in a cup drop your bottle in wait 10 minutes for the bottle to warm up clean up the mess you made then complain to me how hard you have it Point well taken Thinking about it you d need some sort of temperature probe or something to monitor the milk temp itself to really get exact results every time Maybe they ll have some doodad like that by the time I have grandkids This warmer Avent bottles and the hard to find Gerber Anti Gas Relief Simethicone drops have made my life much much easier oh yah and lots of Excederine and coffee too The kid is fed burped and oh yah baby sleeping so I am off to night night Life is goooood 
4 0 Good For Tall Bottles I had to have 2 of these for the kitchen and bedroom but it overheats 4 oz bottles so you have to pay attention and clean it often because the burned milk will cause the warmer to stink It lasts for a long time so its worth the investment 
5 0 First years quick serve bottle warmer As a grandmother I find this easy and quick to warm bottles or baby food jars Heats in very little time and easy to adjust temperature by adding or removing water Wish I had this when my kids were little 
4 0 Very Good Warmer I really like this warmer Its small and it works fast There is a little water holder that attaches to the side of the unit to keep the water ready for when you need it Just add the water put in the bottle and wait 2 3 minutes The only problem I have with the warmer is that I use water for the bottle that is room tempature so if I leave the bottle in the entire warming time it gets too hot for my baby to drink So I just take it out after 1 minute check it on my wrist and it is usually ready If you are taking a cold bottle from the refridgerator and warming it you can leave it for the full warming time of 2 3 minutes I highly recommend this warmer 
5 0 Great for the money This is my second First Years Warmer with my second child The first one got TONS of use and lasted the whole first year of heating up bottles for my son Now with another child I decided I can splurge on a new one since the bottom was starting to burn out a bit I highly recommend it The bottles warm in about a minute and is very easy It s all easy to do while holding a baby in one hand too The only negative I see if I ve yet to master how much water to throw in It works by putting in a small amount of water right into the unit and then it heats up essentially steaming the bottle so it s an even warming process The problem is most likely me because I never pay attention to how much water I m putting in to note for the future if it was right or not But worst case I do a little more a second time or give a minute to cool down Usually it s perfect With all the choices out there I highly recommend this one 
4 0 MUST HAVE This is a great product I have bought 3 additional ones for baby showers after I used the first one myself It is quick and easy Although you have to guess how much water to put in the warmer but you will get used to it pretty quickly I can t live without it and recommend it to everyone 
4 0 Super Comfortable I tried several types of nursing pads and found these to be by far the most comfortable I never have a problem with leakage or fuzzies left behind by the pads I actually had to throw away the box of johnson and johnson pads i had bought because they were so itchy and fuzzy and i found the thinner types of pads to be too flimsy for me While the avent pads are bulky because i am not back into my normal slim fitting clothes yet i haven t had a problem with the pads showing through 
5 0 There is Nothing Wrong with Pads I literally had every pad out there imaginable I had the Gerer pads the Medela pads Curity pads and the hospital pads None of them add up to the Advent ones I even had the Especially for Baby pads those are actually just as good as the Advent pads What makes them two pads slightly different is the Advent pads come with the nipple indent I have both pads if your money concious the m buy the especially for babies brand The advent pads hold so much fluid it s not even funny I leak so much all the time and it doesnt seep through my clothes All of the other pads were to thin for me and the tape that the others have is useless because it doesnt really stick to the bra 
5 0 Lovin my Revolution I just got my 2007 Revolution and I absolutely love it My 19 month old gave it his seal of approval when he refused to get out of it the first time he went for a ride If he even sees it he wants in it The main differences between the 2007 and the 2006 are 1 Increased seat recline of up to 70 degrees earlier versions only recline to 45 degrees 2 Increased back support on the seat back 3 Additional padding added to the seat Quite frankly these improvements weren t a huge selling point for me If my son was an infant the increased seat recline might matter but at his age he doesn t want to recline at all The sun canopy is the biggest I ve ever seen on a stroller In the past I ve had to put a blanket over the canopy to try and shield the sun from my son s eyes but this canopy solves that problem It is huge As for maneuverability the Revolution far surpasses any other stroller I ve tried It is a smooth steady ride I typically use the swivel feature but the stroller is still great with the front wheel in the locked position The storage basket is fairly large for a jogger and is sufficient for the typical walk or jog I did take this stroller to the mall today and while it was incredibly easy to maneuver through the mall the storage basket was not large enough for shopping and storing packages along the way It is very easy to fold and is fairly compact when it is folded but it does not have a latching feature which makes picking it up a bit awkward It s not a huge deal to me though since I usually leave it open and ready to go in our garage thank God for 3 car garages I really like the 5 point harness and my son doesn t mind being buckled into the seat He seems very comfortable and snuggles right in as soon as I put him in The cup holders inside the seat are nice but he has a hard time getting his cups into them which tends to frustrate him An older child may not have an issue with this though The shock absorbers are really nice and work very well We can off road in it and still have a nice smooth ride If I hit an uneven area of pavement or branches roots on the trail it is barely noticeable Overall I am very happy with this stroller And more importantly it got my son s seal of approval 
5 0 disposable wrap around place mats These place mats are the greatest you have children that want to feed their selves but also you can t give them a plate of their own without them dropping them and making a mess the mats work great because tables are not always as clean as you would like and you can just gather up all of your mess at the end of the meal and throw it away 
5 0 GREAT accessory on my Combi Savvy EX stroller I picked this up at my local BRUs store I ve had the snack cup only going on 6 yrs now on an umbrella stroller and got this set for my 3rd child s new Combi Savvy EX stroller The stroller came with a soft pack accessory holder that angled with the handles of the stroller but I needed more drink holders for my 2 older children and us adults It has WORKED PERFECTLY for us and I didn t have any problems installing the clamps more details on that later The very dark navy set as pictured blends well with my black silver stroller This is what the set comes with and what it s for 1 2 clips clamps with large small crews used large screws to fit around the oval tubing of my stroller and an allen wrench I think more clips would ve been nice so people could use more of the attachments so I m going to try to find long screws to replace the small screws I used on the clip on my old umbrella stroller 2 3 different sized C shaped bottle holders pop bottle in at the neck Use small size for normal water bottles medium for Gerber styled baby bottles wide mouthed water bottles i e Propel Gatorade and large for Avent style baby bottles 3 A big cup holder it was already assembled so we haven t had problems with the arms popping out as other reviewers have stated It can be attached to the clips on 2 sides one where the cup can swivel why I don t know or the other where it s stationary 4 Double cupped snack cup with connected lids that swivel open 5 A mesh bag that is small 7 x 9 5 inches but people I think this bag is to hold all the attachment parts 6 2 large S hooks and 2 small S hooks They do look flimsy but they work Keep in mind you aren t supposed to load up your stroller with heavy items anyway so it won t tip over so don t expect to hang your loaded cooler on it We used both large hooks one with a bag that held my Bjorn baby carrier and the other with a bag of snacks small pint sized water bottles in it I do have the multi colored S hooks from another manufacturer they are very sturdy and do swivel but they will not fit on the tubes of this stroller NOTE I have not seen large enough hooks for the aluminum oval tubes of these newer strollers So these will be very useful b c the basket underneath our stroller does hold a good amount but not enough for a productive day at the mall Other reviewers have rated this item low for what I think are unwarranted reasons or high expectations of an after market stroller accessory This item will not work on EVERY stroller out there Yes the big cup holder will stick out a bit but at the zoo or mall we haven t had anything fall out Put some forethought into placement of the clamps and you won t be frustrated putting them on RE Installation I recommend closing your stroller first and look it over for possible locations of the clamps Then when first installing the clamps test the closing of your stroller before totally tightening the screws On our Combi it goes right above the clamps that you pull that closes the stroller and right under the included accessory pack Later when our baby starts eating snacks I can see a possible place for it right next to the seat frame but then the front rail of the stroller does have 2 cup holders on it so I think we ll really end up keeping the 2 clips up top for us The location it s at now is angled and yes your attachments will end up holding your drinks straight The attachment pieces have an octagonal shape so when you pop the piece in it can be straight Taking the piece off is easy you only need to hold the clamp with one hand and pull the piece off with another DON T FORGET to take these attachments off before closing the stroller and throwing it in the trunk of your car b c the items may pop off and get lost or they may break This set has REALLY WORKED WELL for us and the price is good We were set with drinks for the whole family for a full day at theme parks and the zoo Good luck 
4 0 A bretty good product This is a very good product my wife and I have been trying to find somthine like this for months and we were very happy with this purches We love how it is very fexable you an interchange the parts as you wish The only thing that would make it any better is a lock so the kids can t take the attachments of 
5 0 Like it a lot and works with Peg Perego P3 stroller I m a mechanical engineer and after reading the other reviews I thought I d have to pull out my tools to make this thing work on our Peg Perego P3 stroller In fact it went on quite easily The key is to locate the clamps just below P3 logo on the brace that goes down toward the rear wheels This allows the stroller to be folded up without removing the clamp even if you have the large accessories like the snack tray or cup holder attached I did have to slightly angle the cup holder out when the seat was reclined all the way back because we snap in the car seat currently with our infant I could not attach the clamps anywhere else on the stroller though due to the large oval tubing and necessity of folding it up I m impressed with the quality of the unit though Do be sure to use the long bolts since the oval shaped tubing makes it a little difficult to connect the two halves of the clamp It would be even better if ClicknGo included bolts that were 1 4 longer so you wouldn t have to strain to pull the halves together 
4 0 Great product but doesn t fit Peg Perego Aria Twin I purchased this for my Aria Twin stroller but I ended up using it on my triple jogging stroller It works like a dream but it just didn t fit the oblong tubing on the Aria Bummer 
5 0 works great I bought this for my Chicco London stroller and it works like a charm Had to play around with the perfect location for the connectors for Mommy s cupholder or water bottle holder and for baby s snack holder but once I had it attached we both couldn t be happier I wish that they sold the snack holder separately I keep forgetting to take it off and after 2 years it is showing signs of stress at the clip Won t be long before it snaps but it really gets bounced around in the back of the minivan so I think it has held up great Anything to keep my tot happy 
5 0 Product works great for us Bought this set in black for our Maclaren Ryder stroller and have had great success You do need to test the positions before you tighten the clamps to make sure they won t interfere with closing of the stroller We placed one clamp on the side so our daughter could access either her sippy cup or the snack tray depending which we had attached at the time and the other clamp on one of the stroller handles so we could attach the cup holder or water bottle holder for our use We spent a few days at Disney World and had no problems with the attachments falling off or knocking into things You do need to remember to remove and store the attachments before folding the stroller so they don t get knocked off and lost We haven t used the S hooks yet they do feel and look a little flimsy but they d probably be okay for light bags 
4 0 Worth The Money This was a product that every mother should have it was definitely hard to part with when my daughter got older It cleans not only avent but dr Brown bottles too when placed correctly It s definitely worth the money and its very efficient 
5 0 Loved it My son is now 18 months old I used this product from the time he was born until he was 10 months old and started using sippy cups I don t know what I would have done without it My husband was deployed and boiling bottles takes tons of time My dishwasher has the sanitizing cycle but when I used it the bottles and nipples would still have a film on them The sterilizer kept them looking new I also felt better knowing that they had been through the sterilizing process in the microwave If you want to use your dishwasher I would still recommend using this it does not take much time at all I used it on medula pump parts and gerber bottles even the tall 9 oz bottles would fit if you put them in right I would highly recommend this to anyone having a baby it was one of the few products that I actually used on a regular basis 
5 0 Great Product I have been a HUGE fan of this product since 1998 I love it so much that I have given several to my friends as shower gifts Nine years later I am now using my second sterilizer with my third child It s a God send 
5 0 Where would I be without it This sterilizer is wonderful As a first time mother I m still figuring out things But I realized this is one of those things I truly did need It is so easy to use and does save a lot of time I am not a germ freak but I like to know that the bottles I am traveling with are clean and sterile My baby is almost 6 months old and I have used it with Dr Brown s bottles Medela breast pump parts and any other baby parts that would fit into it 
5 0 Wonderfull Item It s so simple makes your life so much easier The lit will close if you turn it until you find the right position Also remember not to sterilize more than 4 bottles at the time It just works perfectly My baby is 8 months now and I ve been using it since she was born GREAT 
5 0 soft and beautiful This cover is very soft it is perfect for an infant s sensitive skin We used our boppy quite a bit and still do to some extent Even our older children loved how soft the cover felt 
4 0 Great product I have twins so I use my Boppys a lot I have this slipcover in blue and pink The fabric is really soft the texture prevents my babies from slipping off or out of the Boppy The cover is easy to remove and put on and washes up great The only real improvement I would like to see is to have a waterproof lining or something to protect the Boppy even more since it is a little difficult to wash Overall very satisfied 
5 0 10 months and going strong We ve been using this for 10 months on our alphabet print Boppy and it s still in great condition with just a few stains yes the alphabets show through but it doesn t bother me and certainly my son doesn t care He loves the soft texture and so do I 
5 0 Love it This is a great cover because it is a pretty color as well as being soft and fuzzy It washes very well 
5 0 Must have for a Boppy My child was a puker So this cover came in super handy It made it easy to clean the boppy It has a zipper and is easy on easy off I couldn t live without my boppy pillow so this cover was a must have 
5 0 I own 2 of these I have one on Cyneys Stroller and one on her car seat She looks very comfortable and that makes me happy 
5 0 Great Love this product my daughters head did not flop aroung at all It kept her snug in her car seat 
4 0 False Security My son was premature and was on an Apnea Heart monitor for the first six months We recently had a string of good downloads so his cardiologist decided to take him off the monitor I didn t sleep for a week just lying there watching him breath still worried until I saw this product and ordered it right away I ve had it for about a month now and have slept much better and I know he does too since I m not putting my hand on his back every five minutes The problem I have with the product The other night my son was crying and I picked him up forgetting to turn the monitor off and it kept sensing movement ticking It never alarmed My husband and I must have watched and waited for 10 minutes NO ALARM Now I m wondering if it would alarm at all I hope it s something I m doing wrong and can figure it out Too many good reviews not to be a good device That s why I gave it 4 stars I just wish I knew why it didn t alarm 
5 0 This helps me sleep I worried constantly and woke up dozens of times each night to check on my son Since I purchased this I sleep much better It is a great product I did not purchase the thing to put it on I just placed my on a large children s book 
5 0 Great monitor I have a child that preferred to sleep on her belly due to reflux and I was so worried about SIDS I bought this monitor and was able to rest a little easier when I put her to bed in her crib on her belly I only had one false alarm and that is when she wedged herself into a corner and I guess the sensor did not pick up her movement Better safe than sorry Great purchase highly recommended 
4 0 AngelCare Hi we live in the Middle East purchased this product from Amazon for our new baby Overall this product is fantastic The motion sensor is just amazing lets my wife sleep so much better at night There are minor issues with static on the parent unit the reception however is very good over long distance from even outside the house but there is a little hissing noise disturbance EXCELLENT Product indeed Suggest all new parents should get this gadget Cheers 
5 0 If I could give this 6 stars I would This is a wonderful product I am a first time mom neurotic I know But there is such a difference in my peace of mind with this monitor I highly recommend it We have had three false alarms and only because our daughter is a very active sleeper and jammed herself into the corner of the crib and out of range Even then it is worth it I d rather know if she has her face buried in the crib bumper so I can slide her out to the middle It s great I can t say that enough I m so glad I am having kids now when there are products like these available 
5 0 My Kitty loves this chair I bought this chair for my cat and she loves sitting on it It is a purrfect size for her She is a big fan of Hello Kitty 
4 0 Love at first sight My daughter loved this chair once we opened the box The seat s back has a nice and soft fur like material The seat is about 15 inches wide so it will fit her til she gets married unless she is overweight The only down side is the stability It seems like the chair can fall back if it rocks a little harder It s good that the rocking part is screw on so I may consider taking them out Other than that the seat serves it s purpose 
5 0 Wondeful chair I am very pleased with this purchase I was a little concerned about the size as I was ordering it for a 6 year old but it is plenty big enough for her the seat is very wide and could easily hold an even larger child If you have a Hello Kitty fan this is a great chair 
4 0 Good Item for outdoors I love this item I have not had any trouble with it so far My infant set fits right in If the baby is sleeping and we have to go to a game I can place the car seat right in the Cabana 
4 0 Great product We got this instead of the Diaper Genie because we wanted something simple and easy to use no turning cranks and something that would still be usable after the baby s out of diapers We love the Diaper Dekor We bought 2 refill packs before my son was born He s 13 months now and I m just now shopping for more Another reviewer mentioned problems installing refills We did have trouble the first time but once we d each done it once it was a breeze Highly recommend this product though right now it looks like Amazon is no longer stocking the refills That means I have to go to an actual Babies R Us store which I hate So if they no longer stock that could be a serious strike against this product But they do still stock the Diaper Dekor + so I d get that instead 
4 0 good purchase I purchased this to use as a hamper in our baby girls room The bright colors and flower work great in her nursery As a hamper it is okay The top only unzips about halfway and so you need to use two hands to drop in the laundry Also have to remember that it is collapsable and will fall over if anything is dropped on top of it 
5 0 I just LOVE this product Initially I was going to get a toy box for my 10 month old daughter Then I decided she needed the extra space in her room to crawl around and I didn t want to worry about another piece of furniture she would bang in to I saw this product in the store and bought it Not only is it cheaper than a toy box its a space saver its portable and its light so you can carry it and its contents from room to room you can put alot of things into it The baby loves the colorful design and I love the fact she won t get hurt if she bumps into it Also it zips up on top so you can seal it I recommend it 
5 0 Best All Around I purchased this stroller with the infant carrier two weeks away from my scheduled c section I was worried that it would be too big and bulky but by that point I was too exhausted to care It turned out to be a wonderful buy One of the best features are the rubber tires they re noiseless and easy to push on any terrain When I used the infant carrier it snapped in place super easy I took this stroller to the beach at least 3 dozen times last year and it has weathered sun sand and a wet toddler napping in it The fabric dries easily The cupholders and removeable snack tray are great It folds easily The storage basket is huge It s also lightweight for it s comfortable size and extra features 
5 0 Excellent if you don t mind large size I ve owned this stroller for more than two years and have used it almost every day typically strolling two miles per day often with lots of groceries in the storage basket My toddler also takes her naps in the Graco won t nap anywhere else One little piece just broke and it s not a safety issue but I m taking the opportunity to shop for a smaller stroller Reading reviews of other strollers including pricey ones made me appreciate the Graco even more I do wish it was a little more narrow to maneuver through tight store aisles and to take up less room in my house but I have no other complaints Here s a list of pros and cons Pros Rides very very well Durable up and down curbs Large storage area accommodates up to three bags of groceries Toddler is comfortable and naps in stroller Reclines easily and folds pretty easily Two cup holders in back and one in front tray which clicks off on one side to remove child more easily Window in back to view child through shade Adjustable handle is good for tall people I m 5 10 and push it comfortably Works with Graco car seat for newborns Cons Quite wide Sometimes hard to fit through aisles of small neighborhood stores and takes up a lot of space in home and car trunk Doesn t accommodate newborns without car seat Shade doesn t fully shield child until he she is quite tall Until about one year of age I draped a light blanket over the shade when necessary 
5 0 Had to review this only because of what I found here I was actually pretty impressed by this potty and just happened across Amazon to see what the price was here I had to buy it at a B M and wanted to double check to see if I overpaid This was for Child 2 Child 1 had a potty but was potty trained in the span of a week and never even sat on it she used training seats instead Child 2 well not so good After a few weeks of unsuccessful attempts at the training seat I decided to get him a potty Had I read the reviews here first I never would have bought this one Luckily the B M was my first stop and I ended up with two of these potties one for home one for grandma Pros Works as advertised Easy assembly and cleanup Decent battery life Inexpensive Cons The musical fanfare that follows a successful drop isn t foolproof and will sometimes fail to activate Deflection cup in the front is a little awkwardly placed causing some collision do I have to elaborate on that one Summary It s under twenty bucks assembles in minutes and doesn t eat batteries OK sometimes the music won t work it s not exactly a high precision laser sensing toilet if such an animal exists It ll still work 90 of the time I had bought the expensive potty for Child 1 and trust me although it cost more than double the price of this unit there were no appreciable differences between the two It s easy to clean inexpensive and works as advertised I wish more kids items managed to meet these simple requirements 
5 0 Super potty works every time My 2 year old refuses to go on anything else Ours works fine I need to find another one for upstairs She runs to it and I ve tried several other potties that I had to return Highly recommend but each child has their own opinion This one is great for us 
4 0 Sturdy cute and worked well for my daughter I used this with my daughter The only time it leaked was when it wasn t snapped in right We never used the music was thinking it wouldn t be beneficial and she d want to put toys in it to make the music go It was a lot easier to clean that our other potty chair There s a little trick if you can call it that to unsnap it before pulling it out instead of just pulling it all the way at once Lightweight but sturdy It has a back which feels more like a real potty And she had no problems sitting on it Obviously we never used the pee guard which is easily removable 
4 0 Was a dud with the first born but the second one loves it A friend with a daughter recommended this highly so we bought it three years ago for our son It was a waste of money He never used it and went straight to the big john Three years later my daughter is delighted with her hand me down I don t know what to tell you Is it great or not For a small price it s worth trying 
5 0 great the royal potty Everything came in on time It was in brand new condition Thank you very much for your business 
5 0 Baby loves it and it doesn t annoy her parents I bought this play gym for our daughter when she was about 5 months old She loves it plays in it happily for long periods of time and the little musical lion toy is actually musical not at all annoying and plays several different catchy tunes The toys can be moved around and swapped out with different separate toys and more links can be added to move things closer to her We are very happy with this purchase and so is she 
5 0 Great Infant Fun I bought Bright Stars Play Gym for my family childcare business The baby loves to play with this gym I love it because the parts are removable can be placed in different spots accomodating the baby s movements It is also very easy to clean 
5 0 Best Design in Potty Seats for Boys We are still in the midst of potty training but this by far has the best design I have a little boy who is tall for his age and the potty chairs frustrate him and he is scared of the splash guards This topper with the contoured design for a splash guard is the best I ve seen yet 
5 0 Very best potty seat for boys My son is 3 and a half and we started potty training two months before he turned 3 We had purchased the cheaper seats at Target and Walmart but he would still have 2 accidents Our toilet is very elongated and all the other seats didn t fit well and were very wobbly We just recently bought the Baby Bjorn toilet trainer and now he is excited about going 2 It is very secure because of the adjusting dial and he can get on the potty all by himself No more accidents after a week with this seat The high front prevents 1 spillage and the contor shape holds him well I wish that I had known about this seat 8 months ago I very highly reccomend this seat 
4 0 Best Child s Toilet seat Trainer Since I consider this expensive I gave it 4 stars I wish there was a 4 1 2 star rating it is better than 4 stars Besides the expense I m quite happy with this product There is nothing else on the market like it so we went ahead purchased it This is an adjustable child s toilet seat that fits onto a regular toilet Because toilets come in different sizes etc there is a dial near the handle which you turn to make the trainer seat fit snug on the toilet I have found it is easy to place on the toilet plus it is so easy to remove Some other brands of child s toilet seats are very difficult to remove The BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer also has an oval shape opening child s head won t fit through it A child might try to wear it as a hat but it will not go down over their head around the neck Neither our son or daughter have had any problems using this seat trainer It is easy for them to place on the toilet and remove Our children do look so much more comfortable sitting on this Toilet Trainer seat instead of sitting falling into the toilet when using a regular adult size toilet seat Before purchasing this I also checked out the Toilet Trainer at the BabyBjorn website I was impressed with the information there I recommend people consider purchasing the Toilet Trainer 
4 0 Love it My Son Is a big guy 80 in everything I Love that this hold him up high so he can see and it allows me to be hands free IT has a bilt in diper bag so I don t have to cary alot of stuff It is great for use where a stroller isn t allowed or it is hard to use Only draw back It takes 2 people to put it on But I Still Love i 
5 0 Love It My 11 month old son and my husband and I love this backpack I originally just started out using the baby bjorn and loved that until he hit about 5 months and started gaining weight then it killed my shoulders This backpack is great comfortable a lot of the weight is on your hips Highly recommended 
5 0 Shopping carrier but looking forward to hiking I use my cross country carrier for shopping I have twin boys so one sits in the cart and the other in the carrier The boys weigh 20 lbs and I find it easy to carry them around in the cc carrier The shoulder pads are very comfortable and its easy to take off and on with a baby in it The boys love it and I do too 
4 0 4 5 Stars Awesome carrier I had the pleasure of test driving this carrier in the store with my son before we purchased and literally walked out with it The kickstand is a great innovation that makes loading and securing kiddo very painless The straps secure snugli and are very comfi There is plenty of storage room for take along essentials The child seat is adjustable so this model will grow with your little one Best of all my son LOVED the ride We walked all over the store as he laughed and cooed with glee We plan to use this carrier in the rain forests of Costa Rica so it will get a true test of capability Highly recommended 
5 0 As good as it gets I have to say I LOVE THIS BACKPACK I am a mother of 3 and have used this for at least a year now and have NO complaints Very comfortable durable safe and i LOVE the compartments I use this product EVERYDAY to walk my eldest to school NO wear or tear YET Living in NYC I am not always up to a drive i like to take the subway into manhattan with the kids and walk around central park and there s no better way to do unless you you are sporting one of these My son loves to go in it and tries to climb in himself before we head out This is as good as it gets and for the price well ya can t beat it Moms 
4 0 Nice Safe My 6 month old son enjoys this saucer a lot I just wish it had more height adjustments even the highest setting at 6 months and 27 inches tall seems not high enough my son can put his whole foot on the ground and the instructions say babies should only be able to reach the bottom with their toes Overall though great product 
5 0 FREE TIME FOR MOMMY This toy has given me the ability to set my child down long enough to get some things done around the house He has a great time playing in it and gets excited as he masters each new skill I recommend it to anyone who has a baby that needs constant stimulation 
5 0 Really is triple the fun This exersaucer has many great aspects There are many toys for entertainment and if your child gets bored with the toys that came with the system switch a roo s can be bought to mix things up Our daughter has had this since she was 3 months old and at 5 months loves it even more She loves the frog on the string because she can easily mouth it There is learning and music on two of the three electronic toys and volume control on all We use the arch solely for floor play at home and away from home because they are difficult to reach when attached to the exersaucer at an earlier age Not sure how the toddler station will entertain yet but as an infant this toy is great The cost can be expensive but when you add up the variations it is well worth the cost The system does collapse but is still bulky and heavy to move around The system can be a little time consuming to assemble but aren t our little ones worth it At the same time we bought a stationary bouncer because our daughter loved to bounce when we held her However we found that she stays entertained with this exersaucer for longer and seems to enjoy it better as of now I highly recommend this product for a child to learn to entertain themselves which builds imagination and better attention spans and gives mom dad a moment to clean a bottle or two and is a great tool to interact with your child as you sit on the floor eye contact and communication reinforces learning with the toys 
5 0 Triple Fun Evenflo Exersaucer I gave this exersaucer 5 stars because it keeps my baby interested so that I can do housework We took our 3 month old daughter to the store and tried out each one to see her reaction At 5 months now she is able to pull on everything on her own without any assistance from me We think it is great for building strength in her legs My froggie doesn t croak like the other user mentioned but everything else is the same I am very pleased with our purchase which is good considering it was the most expensive one 
5 0 Best toy ever My son he is in the picture above received this as a Christmas gift from his aunt picked out by me because it just has everything you need on a toy like this The music and the sounds are not annoying to parents at least not to me and my five month old Jacob loves it He is content in there for at least an hour which gives me sometime to get some things done He laughs when the frog croaks and when the bee buzzes and he actually hums when the music plays It has learning mode on the raised toy bar or music mode which is great for younger babies like mine I highly reccommend this item Even though my son is to big for the playmat part I still use the mat to put on the floor when he is playing 
5 0 Very Fun My daughter absolutely LOVED playing in this She would jump in it until she was completely worn out She would laugh and squeal the entire time she was in it I would just sit and laugh at how excited she was when she was jumping around like a monkey in it She couldn t get enough of jumping in the Johnny Jump up and was upset when she finally outgrew it We finally had to invest in a large trampoline and net 
5 0 Jumping for Joy My daughter is 6 months old and has been standing since she was 4 months old The evenflo classic Johnny Jump up is her favorite thing to play in It has strenghtened her legs which has really helped her learning to crawl The jump up allows her to be more independent and she can use it in any doorway with crown molding This allows her to hang out and watch mommy in every room The jump up is easy to assemble and is very strong as well as safe It is made of washable material and easy to put up take down or pack for traveling I have one at home and one at grandma s house It is also very affordable I would give it 
4 0 A wonderful way to keep the child entertained and growing The jonny jumper is a great way to have the my child grow and it also allows me more time to do other things 
5 0 Johnny Jump Up I am completly satisfied with the Evenflo Johnny Jump Up I bought this to keep at my house when my granddaughter is visiting here She has one at her house and loved it so much I had to buy one She gets very excited while jumping and I believe it is good exercise and she has fun while in it I had one for my kids when they were babies The Johnny Jump Up can be adjusted according to height so as to allow free jumping It is easy to put up and take down and can be put in any doorway so she can be easily seen and she sees us I am confident that this is a safe product and would recommend it to anyone 
4 0 Overall pretty good The clamp that hangs from the door frame is very secure and the strap is adjustable for the baby s height It s rather hard to get the baby into it however It s also rather large and bulky and my baby gets his hands stuck in the leg holes I wish it didn t have the metal frame and fit more snugly around his body so he felt more free to jump around This problem will probably not be such an issue when he gets bigger though Overall it s a good product 
5 0 Jane s Jump Up Bug Our seven month old daughter does not like being on her tummy so she does not like to crawl or attempt to crawl She loves kicking and we got the Johnny Jump Up Bug to help her use her legs more without having to be laying down on her tummy She loves it She now loves sitting up and kicking her legs and making herself move around Since Johnny Jump Up Bug does not have a tray it is easy to get her in and out and she has not come close to pinching her fingers like the reviews for jumpers that have trays usually state We are very pleased with the quality for it s low price and will use it for our future kids 
5 0 Completely Put My Sister At Ease I got this for my sister and her new born boy Like any new mother she was afraid to leave the baby alone for even a minute For her to be able to leave the room and go to the bathroom or get something to drink or get the mail and still keep watch on the baby that is such a mental relief For her and her husband The picture is very good quality She has had no problems with interference from other devices on the same frequency in the area 
4 0 Great product but picture a bit blurry We have the black and white large monitor also and the picture quality from the black and white camera is much clearer than the color camera Color samera picture looks like there is some oil on the lens or something not necessarily grainy just smudged looking I have returned it for a new one to see if the color one I had was defective I didn t see why the picture quality would differ We ll see Also you never get much color so don t buy it for that We didn t care about the color as much as the size portability of the monitor Also you can easily plug it into the TV if you want the picture on the TV instead of the monitor Very cool idea But overall we love these monitors The black and white one is crystal clear excellent sound and good reception too You do have to move the monitor around sometimes if something else interferes with it but this has been a very minor problem in our house Also if you walk in the monitor and camera path it sometimes gets static Again rarely a problem And ours sits right near our phones computers etc We have two monitors and can switch the A and B channels to see each of the kids rooms which is so convenient Definitely a can t live without it item for our family Although the regular black and white one is good enough if you don t care about portability counter space Also we have had a great experience with Summer Infant customer service After having the black and white monitor for a long time we noticed a low pitched hum and they sent us a replacement very quickly no problem 
5 0 Peace of Mind My 9 month old daughter has never been much of a sleeper She wakes very easily and is very active the moment she wakes up With the bedrooms on the second floor I am now able to watch her from our first floor using this monitor and know she is safe This monitor has also been wonderful when traveling to see relatives I am now able to relax and enjoy our visits with the ability to watch our little darling sleep soundly The image is clear if the camera is within 4 or 5 feet and even when we have placed the camera 10 feet or more away it is grainy but we can still see her tiny little body enough to know she is safe The wireless video with night vision definitely met and surpassed my expectations The other plus to this unit is that you can buy an additional camera and switch between the two cameras using the two channels available on the handheld monitor I definitely plan on doing this when we have our second child The only annoyance I have experienced with this monitor compared to my regular sony audio monitor is that I get more interference with this one Overall I would recommend this monitor to anyone who is looking for a video monitor I was nervous spending this much money without first seeing the quality of the picture but I am pleased to say it has been worth every penny Our friends and family are always so amazed by this when we show it to them My husband and I just love being able to see our precious girl at any time and know she is safe 
5 0 Still loving it after two years I bought this monitor over two years ago and still love it Especially now that my son is out of the crib I make sure he is not being mischievous at night without him knowing I also enjoy plugging this into the television and recording the times when he is being mishievous or just plain cute 
5 0 So reliable we bought two We have found this monitor to be very reliable Just plugged it in and it works I can t believe how well it works in low light no light situations We have a vacation home and bought a second one so we don t have to bring it back and forth No complaints 
4 0 Works Well Works well for us with good reception throughout 2 story 3200 sq ft house A bit of static for a few seconds once in a while probably depending on position of receiver It does have a background hiss which is not hard to sleep with Have 802 11 Pre N router and 5 8 Ghz cordless phones also which do not seem to interfere 
5 0 I actually really like this wipe warmer I had actually registered for this warmer then I had read the reviews so I decided to take it off of the registry because they were not so good I still recieved this as a gift anyway and thought that I would return it My husband had taken it out of the box already and had set it up so I decided we would try it I actually like this warmer alot I have had no problem with my wipes being cooked I make sure there is enough water in the resevoir which by the way doesn t have to be filled that often and the wipes are nice and warm for baby I also lik the little light on the front of the warmer 
5 0 Bummis are the best We ve tried just about every diaper cover out there as well as every AIO and we keep coming back to the Bummis super whisper Our daughter is thin and tall and the velcro means we re able to get the diaper tightened to fit perfectly Well worth the money 
4 0 new to cloth diapering This is the first cover I ve tried and it s great I don t plan on trying others It leaked the first time I used it because I hadn t adjusted it properly but since I check the fit no leaks I use cloth while at home to cut down on costs I don t recommend them for overnight but if you want something affordable for during the day this is a winner 
5 0 Great Baby Warmer I looked at all the reviews before choosing this warmer and I am very pleased with it 
5 0 Excellent warmer I really love this wipes warmer My baby used to cry when we changed his diaper at night but now that we use the warm wipes he hardly notices it and he does not fully wake up I will definetly recommend it to other friends The only drawback is that I could not buy it in Mexico so I had to ask a friend for it 
5 0 Thought I couldn t live without it until we moved and this was packed for four months We didn t think our daughter would be able to stand a cold wipe so we rushed out and purchased this right after she was born It was used religiously up to the point of moving For the last four months she has had nothing but room temperature wipes and hasn t complained at all Yes it s wonderful to wipe her little bottom with a warm wipe but this isn t a MUCH NEEDED product 
5 0 Great Wipe Warmer This warmer is fantastic The light is really useful especially in the middle of the night for changes I didn t know about adding the 1 2 cup of water and have only had a problem with drying out when I didn t use wipes that had a slit at the top 
5 0 I love this warmer I especially love this warmer for the middle of the night changes Cold wipes are shocking to the baby s skin and cause a lot of upset These warm wipes are soothing and not shocking Follow the instructions and add 1 2 cup of water over the wipes each time you fill the warmer This keeps the wipes from drying out The nightlight does not show much light but does the job 
5 0 I m glad I have this warmer I can t believe there is so much controversy about bottle warmers and wipe warmers If you choose to get one this wipe warmer is great The heating element is on top which makes it safer than other models This also ensures that the next wipe the one on top will be the warmest that makes sense I haven t used the night light yet but I may in the future Besides this model doesn t cost any more than the one without a night light When we are out obviously my baby gets treated with cold wipes but at home we always change her in her nursery with warm ones I am glad to have this luxury for my baby I am pleased that I can avoid cold wipes especially in the middle of the night or after a particuarly bad BM It s nice to be able to provide a little extra comfort I use pampers sensitive pop up wipes and sometimes two pop out instead of one but it s really no problem how many times do you use just one wipe anyway I ve had no issue with dry wipes because I read the directions I just add water whenever I add wipes it s a no brainer If I m going to be out not using wipes at home all day I unplug the warmer according to the directions I keep my warmer by the changing pad and I always have very warm moist wipes to tend to my baby just like a gentle wash cloth 
4 0 MammaZee We returned the Lionheart warmer and got this instead This one works MUCH better It actually keeps the wipes warm and is easy to use The light can be handy although we dont use it much Its also easy to see if you are running low on the wipes rather than get suprised when you pull out the last one If you need a wipe warmer this is the one to buy 
4 0 Looking to buy another I got one of these for my grandson at Christmas and my daughter asked me to locate another for the second car he loves it so She angled the mirror so he can see himself and the fish jiggle around even if he can t kick it yet She said he never stops talking to it the whole time he is in the car Sounds like a gotta have it 
4 0 Great for younger baby I received this play gym as a shower gift prior to my childs birth I also received a larger more elaborate play gym at the same time Because this gym is smaller and more portable I started placing my munchkin in it at 3 weeks to stimulate and entertain her The bold black and white designs and primary colors are perfect for a newborn to attempt to focus on and there aren t a ton of hanging toys to overstimulate or startle her It folds up easily for carrying around the house or packing in the car for a trip to Grammie s You can even throw in a few extra toys when folded it s like a large purse or carrying bag and know that they won t fall out on the way Now that baby is close to 2 months old and more playful the hanging toys are just the right height for her to bat at and she loves to gaze at herself and coo into the mirror Overall I m pleased with the gym and would reccomend it I only gave it 4 stars because at times the overhead bar will tilt this way or that and you have to straighten it a bit to keep it upright 
4 0 A few minor flaws but a good swing overall We picked this swing over others because it s bright and colorful and because of the sound and speed options We don t find the motor to be noisy at all in fact the white noise is rather calming for the baby It has taken my son a month or two to get used to it I think he just noticed the moblie a week ago he s 2 months I think as he gets older and can play with the front tray he ll like it much more Good points Familiar songs to other Baby Einstein products Speed settings really are different Seat reclines quite a bit very comfortable front tray has many options such as speech sound and songs as well as rotation parent friendly and easy to assemble not graco green rather cheerful looking removable tray toy is great for tummy time or carseat toy cheery stimulating moblie noise is adjustable good restraint baby is secure Flaws the mobile is too high up for newborns My son didn t notice it until recently each time i tried to point it out he just looked at me instead the plastic tray sticks so tightly that it takes a real hard pull to open it It always gives the baby a jolt songs on the front tray are too short I keep having to go up and press it to keep him interested the nature sounds sound more like static than anything else great idea just needs to be clearer If you don t mind the minor flaws its a great swing for a good price compared to others 
4 0 It helped We purchased this in desparation because our son has a lot of colic outbursts and we hoped previous reports were correct Although it doesn t always work to calm him it helps 2 out of 5 times which is better than before and he even falls asleep in it occasionally something he only previously did in our arms So we have had it for 2 months and as long as i put on some of the white noise in his non fussy modes he generally will go to sleep for about 1 2 hour There are 2 things i would change 1 the straps are a pain to work and with a newborn they aren t really necessary since he doesn t yet move much i always put a blanket on the fully reclined seat to soften the feel of the straps on his back i don t use them yet 2 The white pastic bar is a pain to use it takes a lot to snap it down and unhook it when he is crying so i just took it off which took some work after installing it now i can grab him easily when he wakes up fussy all in all i am very please with it he loves looking at the hanging animals over his head and the sounds work magic 
5 0 Love this swing We discovered that my son liked the swing when he would fall asleep at the gym nursery in thier swings I chose this one because we already had the Baby Einstein Pack N Play and for the timer feature which works perfectly by the way My 9 week old son goes right to sleep Simply Wonderful 
5 0 thumbs WAY up I bought this based on the great review given by the previous poster about her colicky baby Thankfully she was NOT wrong I have a 5 week old who has been fussy and high need from the moment he was born During the day he would only takes nap on me in a carrier and at night he would only fall asleep in bed with me and my husband My arms and body were getting tired from carrying him all day He would never sit in his bouncy seat for more then 5 minutes so I was hesitant to purchase another piece of baby equipment thinking it would not help As I type this he is taking his TWO HOUR nap all by himself I put on the nature sound which is white noise set the swing on the highest level and WOW I was able to take a shower today for the FIRST time since he s born without someone holding him I never wanted a swing but now I am a FIRM believer in the power of motion for an infant 
5 0 Colicy baby approved I am a first time mom with a 6 week old colicy baby who is usually up and fussy from around 10pm to 2am My sister gave us an old Graco swing saying it would be an absolute lifesaver My daughter ended up hating it I hated it too because it didn t recline enough to support her neck plus it wasn t very sturdy So I took her to Babies R Us where you can try the different swings out Luckily she was very fussy at the time even in my arms She kinda liked the Nature s Touch swing but it was 40 more and took 4 d batteries for 100 hours of continuous use Then I saw almost all of them took 4 d batteries for 100 hours Then I put her in the Baby Einstein swing and I am not kidding she got quiet and happy She loved the sound effects and the flashing lights on the tray It also had a harness seat belt and reclined enough so she could fall asleep without her head bobbling around I also noticed that It took only 3 d batteries for 200 hours of continuous use There was another family shopping for baby swings at the time and when they saw how happy she got in the swing they decided to buy it too That night she honestly slept from around 10pm to 2am I actually got nervous because she was sleeping so long and woke her up Oh I also love how sturdy it is and that it easily folds down to store away or move around It is the best swing Babies R Us has Or at least my baby thinks so 
5 0 bang for you buck im glad i opted for this item rather than the expensive ones it works well for all bottles sizes for those who want to get the job done yet not spend too much money this is it 
5 0 Great gift Great product especially when you need a sterilized bottle in a hurry 
5 0 Baby Gift This was a gift and not for myself I understand the receiver really likes it Thanks 
5 0 Great sterilizer for the price I bought this sterilizer not knowing what to expect and I was suprised It works very well and is quick and easy With a young newborn that is very important It holds 4 bottles and the accessories It only takes 4 mintues in the microwave 2 minutes to cool and it s done Couldn t be easier I would not waste on more expensive sterilizers when this will do the job 
5 0 Great product don t wait to buy it I bought this for my not yet 4 month old daughter and it arrived yesterday I put it together with ease except being short one battery that I stole from a clock in the house She has been holding her head up since birth and doesn t like laying down anymore She loved sitting in this and looking at the toys She s just now realizing her hands are hers to use so the toys on this are perfect Her toes barely touch the floor and so she can t quite jump in it But at her rate of growth she will be jumping in a few days Another reviewer mentioned placing a pillow under the baby s feet and I think I ll try that tonight With that said I still wish I bought this sooner If you are thinking about buying it don t wait until your baby is older Buy it sooner and get your monies worth Even if the baby can t reach the floor there is great value in the toys So far so good Although she is deeply interested in this new toy and trying to figure out what to do in it I just LOVE it I can see many hours of her enjoyment mine watching her and valuable hands free time for me 
5 0 Our baby asked us why we waited so long We were originally going to get our 8 month old a jumper that you hang from the door After reading some reviews about injuries and mishaps from jumping into the door frames we firmly decided against that and researched floor models We were between this Jumperoo and another one that has 4 support poles as the base The square Jumperoo didn t have nearly as many toys for her to discover and it seemed to take up much more space We decided on this Jumperoo because it took up less room and had more toys for only slightly more money The investment was worth it for just the first 10 minutes of fun When we first put her in she wasn t quite sure what to make of it and just looked around at the toys grabbing for them After she realized in the first 2 minutes that she could jump she did with great joy Her face was all smiles and watching her kick her feet out while jumping had us all rolling on the floor hysterically The toys she likes best are the ones that spin and she reaches for the parrot and frog that hang The tiger that comes up when you push on the button seems pretty useless as does the color wheel The whole thing took us about 10 minutes to put together and another few minutes to wash the toys Remember not the submerge the electronic one and to put 3 AA batteries in it The box does not include the batteries and you ll need a screwdriver to remove the battery cover Also the large spinning ball has a rainbow sticker along the sides that if you don t dry right away well they ll start to wrinkle The Jumperoo does fold up for easier carrying stowing but it s not a smooth transition I don t see us doing it that often however As I mentioned the entertainment that the adults got was well worth the cost initially And now our baby girl has a great time bouncing on it while strengthening her legs She doesn t seem to like jumping without an audience but maybe she will when she gets a little older Don t wait to get this you won t regret it 
5 0 Worth every penny I bought this after reading other Amazon reviews I LOVE this Jumperoo I put my daughter in this when she was almost four months old she has great neck control Although she couldn t reach the floor pillow worked great underneath her she immediately started to play with the toys and turn around in the seat Few days later she was a jumping fool She smiles and laughs in this thing Watch out for really messy diapers poop jumps right up the back and front 
5 0 Fun Jumperoo When I first bought this for my son he was around 4 5 months old I was disappointed at first because he did not like it He would sceam when I put him in it I thought wasted money Every week I started to put him in it more and he finally figured out around 6 months how to jump in it Now it s his favorite activity He jumps himself silly and loves to play with all the toys He spends most of the time trying to get the parrot on top Highly recommend Just give them time to adjust and be big enough to use it 
5 0 Such a great jumperoo Our 8 month old daughter LOVES this jumperoo she literally bounces until she s exhausted She even tries jumping when she s NOT in the jumperoo anymore Another A+ product from Fisher Price 
5 0 Oh my God RELIEF I have large breasts DD normally without the added bonus of the milk My son latched on great at first but then got a cold and could not latch properly He got lazy with my milk supply being very good and refused to open his mouth wide enough Needless to say breastfeeding became torture I was almost to the point of considering formula when I came across these Within just a few hours of wearing them the pain decreased The shells helped shape my nipples a little better and made it easier for my son to latch with little effort After a full day of use the pain has become almost non existant I wish I had bought these for my daughter because I might have been able to breastfeed her longer than just 9 months These shells have made breastfeeding the wondeful bonding experience it was meant to be My son is still a little lazy with the latch but he is getting better and opening his mouth wider now At first I was discouraged by the thought of needing to sanitize them every night but I bought a microwave bottle sanitizer which makes sanitizing them a breeze I am a very satisfied customer 
5 0 Beautiful colorful cheery crib mobile I really like all the product from Haba especially this mobile They are made in Germany of high quality materials and have a sweetness and charm that a lot of US products lack I love the colors too The only thing about this mobile that was a little unexpected was that it doesn t come with an arm to hang from the edge of the crib Instead we hung it from the ceiling on some elastic Worked great 
5 0 Always need extra We actually had to buy a couple extra bases for each of our cars and the sitters too 
5 0 A must have This is pretty much a must have for infant seats I don t know why they don t just sell them together Bases are great because you secure the base once with the seatbelt then just pop the car seat carrier in and out with a simple little latch It also makes switching between other cars that have the same base a breeze Definitely get this 
5 0 Great for Grandparents We bought this base so that our daughter and son in law would not have to bring their base on the plane when traveling to visit us with our little grandson Works perfectly with their Graco Snug rider infant seat 
5 0 So handy especially for grandparents who like to borrow baby When my parents bought the base off our registry they didn t understand why we d need two bases for one car seat Can t you just move yours between cars It s not like you ll be riding in our car that often After we strapped the second base into their car they hardly ever removed it and they relished the opportunities to pick up the baby on the spur of the moment They were disappointed when the baby outgrew his Snugride seat and hoped I could find a similar base system for the next size of car seat After watching me move his convertible seat back and forth a few times they ve decided to install a second larger seat in their car to avoid the hassle The Snugrider was a far more cost space effective solution than 2 car seats and since the base only has to be installed once people less familiar with the car seat can still safely move the baby in and out of the car repeatedly with greatly lessened risk of error 
5 0 It s Great I loved my Diaper Genie I used it for 2 years without a problem My teenage daughter even figured it out It kept the smell contained pretty well We would empty it about every 5 days and never had a problem Well worth the investment 
4 0 Tried FOUR diaper pails Genie ranks 2 I have to disagree about the Genie being the best It s close but I like the NEAT better I ve owned several of these things the Dekor Champ Genie and NEAT why so many All had issues read on Frankly the Dekor and the Champ both smelled and smell control is the reason I want one of these so those two now serve as garbage pails in other areas of our home The Genie is good at controlling odor but the top is a pain to use and the top on my Genie broke after about 2 months so another one bites the dust As for controlling odor Genie and NEAT are both the best they both seal off the bad stuff with different sealing off mechanisms that the other models just don t have And features other reviewers have commented that they like about the Genie are also in the NEAT system put a dirty diaper into a clean bag every time plunge the top to contain the smell and section off the mess change the bag every few days to a week Our 16 month old is in daycare M F so we only change our two NEATs once a week And never a smell Ever easy to replace the liners Takes 30 seconds No smell when changing it either Plus the handle plunger on the NEAT is easier to use one handed than the Genie Just push and pull No grappling to get the top off or the bag to grab the diaper and start twisting with a dirty diaper in one hand and a squirmy baby at the other less plastic is wasted because it pushes straight down The Genie rotates plastic on plastic which sends more down the chute As you can see I ve dumped a ton of money into this wisdom But now I finally have a stink free environment in my son s room and so far nothing on the NEAT has broken I m only afraid that because it s an underdog they re going to discontinue it and then the refills will be hard to find If that happens I would try another Genie and hope the lid holds out I rank the Genie 2 out of all of these models 
5 0 Why keep diapers so long Any diaper system will stink if you don t empty it This one works great If you are worried about the smell you re probably not cleaning it out in a timely manner Who wants to keep dirty diapers in their baby s room for two days 
5 0 One of the best baby products For us this is a LIFE SAVER It has been really helpfull I even bought another one for my mother s house Im agree with a lot of nice stuff from other reviews and Im not going to repeat them but I have to say something about how many times it gets full It s not true that it gets full everyday or It would get full if you put the diapers open What you have to do is Fold the diaper together with the wipes that you use and you would see the difference I use to change it every 2 days now It gets full every 4 days The refills are not expensive at all and you could always get free refills at Babies R Us buying 2 or 3 together I use one refill every 3 weeks or so I haven t try any other one in the market but for me this is perfect so I could say that is the BEST OPTION 
5 0 A Little Frog to Light the Way This night light is adorable I just purchased this to add to my Froggy Tales collection It lights the way to your little one s nursery I love this line and am so glad they came out with more accessories It has a simple on off switch and seems durable The only improvement I would make would be a sensor to turn off automatically during daylight hours There is also a new wall light switch plate as part of the collection in stores not yet on line 
5 0 What I Wanted This is what I wanted for our leather seats The carseat fits well and is very stable The only thing that would make it better is if the back of the protector that fits behind the carseat were a little bit higher 
4 0 Great except for top of seat It doesn t exactly cover the top of the seat in our vehicle so we have to use a towel over the top of the seat to protect it from dents Otherwise it s great for our new car which has leather seats 
4 0 Saving the seat in a new car We recently purchased our first new car ever We wanted to make sure that our car seat does not put indentations into our new car s interior so we purchased this seat saver It has been easy to use and so far it is saving our car s seat Our daughter is in a rear facing car seat and my my only complaint is that the bottom of the seat saver is much larger than the base of our car seat However I think that as our daughter grows so will her car seat and this will eventually become a nice feature to have 
4 0 saved leather seats we have been using this seat saver for 16 months now and it has not ruined our leather seats Every month I take out the convertible car seat and clean seat and re install to do safety check and the seats are just fine If your car seat is properly installed there is no way this seat saver will move around My only suggestion to manufacture would be to make it a bit more narrow it takes up more space on the actual vehicle seat than needed The two stage version is the only way to go 
5 0 Really protects your seat With three kids under the age of four these seatsavers have literally saved our leather seats in our new mini van I would highly recommend using these under all car seats 
5 0 Great seat protector catches spilled liquid well Works very well and saves leather seats from impressions from the base of the carseat and the lip along the bottom piece catches most spilled snacks and drinks 
4 0 it gets the job done we bought this because my our car seat was making marks all over the seats in my car it get the job done the only thing i wish was that it was a liitle taller or that it went up over the headres 
5 0 Great for leather seats I purchased this seat saver to protect the leather seats in our new car from the car seat indents it seems to be working great 
5 0 Better than expected When deciding which Froggy Tales items I would need I wondered how useful this hamper would be I thought it might be flimsy and not very practical Being a new mom and never having ordered nursery stuff before I didn t know that these hampers come with a separate lining that easily lifts out of its themed shell I was happy I bought it Not a must have but definitely a 5 star functional accessory 
5 0 GREAT PRODUCT I am a nurse so I am familiar with the sound of the human heartbeat My husband and our two children ages 10 and 6 are FASINATED at the sound of our new addition s heartbeat If I laugh the baby s heartbeat will speed up and they think it is so COOL We also hear other things like movement The two headsets are a godsent WE are really enjoying this product I can also use it to spy on the kids when their door is closed 
5 0 One of the many great Lamaze stuffed animals for babies There seems to be quite a few choices for Lamaze animal toys for babies hippos giraffes turtles etc I chose Larry the Lion and he is a big hit with my 3 1 2 month old daughter As she s grown she s discovered new aspects of Larry which keep her fascinated His bright colors are quite captivating and his squeaky tummy usually makes her giggle She also quite enjoys playing with his crinkly mane and now that she s teething I think she really appreciates chewing on the 2 rings and the purple star that are attached to his paws Larry is already our stand by fail safe toy when all other toys fail to pique her interest A thumbs up from first time parents 
5 0 Great seat We call our seat the cushy tushie seat This is a great over the big toilet seat We ve had it for 2 years it has not cracked or shown any signs of wear It is easy to clean too It is fairly portable to Gramma s house 
4 0 VERY GOOD SEAT BUT NOT FOR OVERSIZED TOILET My daughter who is 20 months old LOVES this seat I bought the royal toddler potty but decided to buy this one as well b c its good to travel with she refuses to sit on the royal potty she rather use this one on the toilet seat The only problem is we have an oversized toilet so its not a snug fit but it does the job 
5 0 PERFECT Potty Seat I have bought many potty seats tried them out and this has been the one I have stuck with I even tried those folding travel seats but all they do is slip and slide and scare my daughter into thinking that she is going to fall in I even bought a second to take in the diaper bag I HIGHLY suggest this as a potty training buy 
4 0 Been using it since my daughter was 6 months old This seat has worked brilliantly over the past few months It seems very comfortable for my daughter who has used it since she was 6 months old She is now 13 months old and just over 20 lbs and has no problems with it I have an elongated toilet and it doesn t fit perfectly and my daughter is sometimes tempted to put her hands through the gap especially to drop things in BUT this hasn t really bothered me much We even travel with it as it is so ligh 
5 0 awsome we bought this for our daughter and it has been such a help with potty training she can put it on the toliet herself and get up herslef I am not worried about her falling into the toliet as I would be if she tried to get onto the toliet without this seat and it is very comfy 
5 0 Great toy for babies I have bought Freddie when my daughter was born She has started to seem interested in it at about 3 months old and really played with it after 4 months old It s a pretty big toy for the hands of a baby that s why i think they enjoy it better when they have control over their hands and are able to grab properly Highly recommended 
5 0 The Only One You Need Buy TWO Keep a Spair Simple and Elegant in Design I ve never met a BabyBjorn product that I didn t love Easy to use Easy to Clean the kids gain confidence on the Real Potty and you re not wiping poop out of a bucket It s worth the extra costs it s worth the shipping costs if you can t find it near you 
5 0 Probably the best you can get Very nice comfortable seat The adjustment feature is great 
5 0 Love the Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer I love this toilet training seat I like that it s a hard molded plastic and not a soft seat It looks so much nicer in the bathroom and cleans better too My 3 year old daughter finds it comfortable to sit on The adjustment knob helps keep the seat in place I also like the high splash guard in front girls can have little fountains too and this is the only seat we ve used that keeps everything contained in the toilet It was well worth the extra money 
5 0 Great Potty Seat I love this seat because it works on different types of toilets It does not move around like some of them do This is the third seat I tried but just have not been as happy with the other brands This one is great and worth paying a little more for 
4 0 A little big for my little girl I like the style and ease of this potty seat but for my daughter the hole is much too big She squirms on it and will not use it unless I am holding onto her she starts to slip and fall in I am having to end up buying a much smaller seat Hopefully she will grow into this one She is 2 1 2 and a little on the small side 
4 0 Works well Works well and no bells or whistles to distract the child from what they are doing Easily portable to every bathroom in the house Make sure you buy a step stool 
5 0 Potty Seat Works Great Great seat It is adaptable to all toilets There is an adjustable knob that cranks underneath to tighten it to the seat but you have to reach into the toilet to do it I found that if you just get it close before you place it on the toilet it stays secure You can either place it on top of the seat or lift the seat It s easy on and off and your child can even do it him herself It worked so well I purchased three 
5 0 Great stability for BIG boy on oval toilet Regular training seats you place on top of an adult size toilet just were not stable enough for my son Add the fact that one of our toilets is oval and it was a BAD fit Also add that he s a very big boy and regular seats would allow him to pee right over the little pee catcher don t know the official term for that part He d say Mommy I fall and didn t want to try This seat works great because you can adjust it to make it fit with more stability 
5 0 very usefull thing this gate actually changed our life our 18 month old was crazy about kitchen and we had to spent a lot of time being next to him so he would not hurt himself there Nothing could keep him away from kitchen After we bought this gate we can let him run around the house without being afraid that he would go there This gate is very easy to install to operate and it cost cheaper than others I would recomend this to all with small kids 
5 0 Evenflo Simple steps We bought this for the door to our 2yr old daughters room once she transitioned to her toddler bed It is nice and sturdy seems to be very well made we love the taupe color It is not wobbly at all It took my husband 10 15 minutes out of the box to working I love that we do not have to take it on and off to get through each time The swing gate is easy for us adults to use but too difficult for my daughter to figure it out I love it so much I am going back to purchase another one to use on the spare bedroom door Yes i did brush my toe against the bar once now I know to step over it not too difficult Well worth the 34 
4 0 Bang for the Buck Overall this is a good gate I use it for a puppy so it s a much more different experience for me than using it as a baby gate The intstalation was easy At first I thought the gate was broken becuase the latch didn t meet and the upper end stuck out farther than the lower ends THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY I just want to make that clear When you fasten it to the wall the pressure pushes the top together so that it can latch Use of the product was a litlle hard The latch requires you to push in two buttons pinch them between your index and thumb pull it to the side left or right depending on a few things WHILE holding the buttons And pushing it forward or towards you It sounds hard And at first is But you ll get the hang of it Using 2 hands if you can makes it easier Quality of the product is great It has withstood a lot But keep in mind I have a 5 pund puppy not a 10+ pound child One other thing I MUST note is that there is a bar along the bottom that touches the floor It is VERY easy to trip over And when you do it hurts Don t let this factor alone deter you from buying this gate It s a good and relativly inexpensive product and one of the only decent pressure mount gates out there that I could find 
5 0 Life saver We swaddle our daughter every time she goes down to take a nap When winter came around we wanted something warmer to swaddle her in because we don t use blankets with her and we came across these They are super easy to use and the microfleece makes them warm enough for our New England winters 
5 0 the BEST for traveling with baby Although those hospital blankets are the absolute best for swaddling these little suckers are the best if you re away from home and trying to wrap up a screaming infant on a couch at your mother in laws on the grass at a picnic etc A nice tight wrap but cool enough for summer although they are a little on the small size so you should just get a small and a medium By the time they fit into large swaddling isn t really needed 
5 0 Helps get newborns to sleep We loved this product because we didn t have to remember the whole burrito wrap system The only down side is that the fabric does stretch and our little houdini figured out a way out But that was nothing that a few diaper pins wouldn t solve 
5 0 5 Stars I never write reviews but often read them however this product is well worth the time which is highly coveted these days with my 3 week old This swaddle is very easy to use and actually stays put I wish they had this when my four year old was an infant I love it 
5 0 THE BEST baby shower gift i didnt get if i could give this product 10 stars i would my son loves to be snuggled up in his swaddle me he sleeps better and doesnt startle as easily he has a hard time staying awake when he is in it so if your baby doesnt stay awake for feedings you may want to wait until after he is full to swaddle him i wish i had purchased at least 2 i plan to buy another one as well as 2 large sized ones so far i have tried the small microfleece my son was born 7 lbs and is still using the small one and its rather large on him 3 weeks later not sure how much he weighs now but 0 3 month sized clothes are still too big for him in the future any woman i ever buy a baby gift for is getting 1 or 2 of these from me you cannot have a baby without one make sure you get 2 or 3 because you will be miserable when your only swaddle me in the wash or if you leave it somewhere like i just did 
4 0 A lifesaver My infant daughter loves to be held which is hard to do with her two year old brother wanting equal time This sling has helped so much And it s the same one that Dr Bailey on Grey s Anatomy uses except she wears hers upside down don t know if that is intentional or not hmmm 
5 0 I love it I was looking for a sling but didn t think that I could use the kind with the rings I wanted something sturdy and when I was shopping online I saw this one I love this My daughter gets nice and snug inside and most people do not even know I am carrying her Definately worth the purchase 
4 0 Great toy bin This toy bin is such a great investment I d give it 5 stars if it was just a tad bigger It is not only functional as a toy box but light and portable has carry handles collapses for storage and travel and is an interactive toy in itself with its mirrored flower and bright colorful textured surface My baby loves this and so do I I have it in both designs fish and flower 
4 0 Very Good Product I am very happy with this product easy to use and help me have some peace of mind when my kid is playing around 
5 0 Couldn t live without it This simple product gave us the piece of mind to know that she was safe My railing and bannisters were installed 6 apart and if my daughter lost her footing which we all know NEVER happens as a kid is learning to walk HA could have easily slipped between them entirely and ended up on the lower level Pretty easy to install I did it without my husband s help and doesn t damage the railings 
4 0 Seat Protectors for Cars Great deal for the price pack of 2 seat protector It just do what it claims to protect the back of the front seat from little kid s shoes marks Even if the description says deluxe it is not quite the plastic edge sewed lining can easily tore apart if pulled too hard 
5 0 Comfortable and Eco Friendly This is a great carrier After lugging my 25 lb boy around in the Playtex Hip Hammock this carrier feels like heaven The Hip Hammock dug into my neck and was scratchy gross synthetic material This is soft and cozy and distributes my guy s luscious girth so much more evenly Yay 
4 0 Stylish and comfortable I really like this carrier It s beautiful and comfy unfortunately my son eight months does not like it He squirms and complains I suppose you have to take temperment into consideration with a product like this 
5 0 LOVE IT My son is 6 months old and was becoming way to heavy for me to carry in the Bjorn anymore My low back and shoulders we really starting aching So I decided to see if their was something else out there and I found it I was torn between the Playtex hip hammock and the Ellaroo The playtex carrier had so much good feedback that I thought I would love too I decided to get them both and give them a try I took the hip hammock back immediately The material was scratchy and uncomfortable It felt so synthetic and looked cheap and ugly on I wanted something I could wear out and still look stylish When the Ellaroo arrived I was so happy The fabric is soft and beautiful it has a really natural feel to it Now the real test will my son love it too He did The second day he actually feel asleep in it I am able to carry him around for a long time with out feeling crippled afterwards It is great for shopping as well It folds up small and goes on in an instant My son wont deal with sitting in his infant carrier while I grocery shop so I would always end up pushing the cart holding him with that seat in the way and minding my 3 year old at the same time I know you moms can relate Now he is content riding on my hip and things are a lot smoother for everyone I highly recommend it Just checking back in my son is one year old now and I am still using the carrier on a daily basis We both are comfy and happy Now that he is walking it is great to keep him up when I don t want him crusing and touching everything like at the doctors office If I was just holding him he would just squirm away and get down The carrier has also gone through several washings and is holding up just fine My husband jokes that one day my son will be wearing me in it haha 
5 0 Great stroller Got this stroller pretty quickly from the seller back in December Very nice and quite solid Our daughter loves it It s clearly an example of you get what you pay for My only complaint I wish the basket underneath could be a little deeper But overall an excellent stroller 
5 0 LOVE IT I bought a 2006 BOB Revolution I live in a very small town with dirt gravel and brick roads It is so smooth my baby doesn t even notice and neither do I I love this thing so much It folds up easier than my Chicco 
5 0 good item This chair was sturdy and well made It is ideal for grandchildren s visits as it can be easily set up and also stored in a small space 
5 0 Great booster seat This has been a great booster seat We bought one 5 years ago and used it for both kids It folds up nice and is durable and easy to clean We used to take it camping with us and strap it to the picnic tables Best booster seat we ever tried 
5 0 great buy We originally purchased this chair 7 years ago same design different colors then After two more babies we thought to get a new portable chair for travel the new ones come with so much more or so I thought I bought one with a removable tray thinking that would be nice and no way As soon as our daughter figured out that she could fling the tray off it was a waste of space and made a bigger mess Now she can throw all the food at once I miss our simple back to basics chair like this one Also be careful most of the other chairs are not as height adjustable as this model This is a great economical and reliable choice 
5 0 This is a great chair My daughter has been using this chair since she was 11 months old she is 16 months now and she loves it She sits at the table with us and really enjoys the seat which places her at our level Also it s really easy to clean and fold up nicely Love this chair 
5 0 Mini Orchestra a hit My one year old granddaughter loves these jingly instruments We play music and dance and shake the instruments During Christmas Jingle Bells was one of our favorite songs These will be used for years to come 
5 0 Great toys We really like these toys and we like to take them with us when we travel My daughter also has the Drum Music Set by Parents Magazine which she actually likes better But these are great to use and encourage musical skills with your children They are easy to listen to and are very durable 
5 0 Best Small Toy Purchase I bought this set for my baby when she was 6 month s old and they quickly became her favorite She has a box full of small toys rattles but she always ends up grabbing for one of these I like how flat they are which makes it easy to tuck one into a small diaper bag so she can have musical entertainment when we re on the go My baby is approaching 1 year and still is intrigued by them I anticipate years of fun with this toy A great purchase 
5 0 Way Cool My little musicians give these instuments a good workout and they are still in great shape They really enjoy them and love having their own instruments to play I highly recommend them for a child who enjoys music 
4 0 GOOD BUY I really like this stroller It is super light easy to manuver folds up nicely my girls love it and the really love being next to each other With my stadium stroller someone was either kicking the back or pulling hair and fighting who is in back or front the only thing I would say about it it does just about make it through the door ways it makes it but a tight squeeze The canopy I can t figure out for the life of me but that is minor cup holder is decent and at least it holds something No storage bin but I hang everything from the handles it s a good buy for the money and my kids love it and that is all that matters 
4 0 Great double stroller As a mother with twins this stoller is a great option as the kids get out of the infant stage It folds up smaller than most double strollers and is light weight and fairly easy to control Drawbacks no real storage for diaper bag or purse and the seat belts are difficult to adjust quickly 
5 0 Best double stroller we own We have three children ages 2 mos to 3 years and we use this stroller with all three The seats fold down flat enough that with use of the seat belt and a head support our infant does just fine in it Our 2 year and 3 year old love it because they can sit side by side and talk share snacks etc The only problem we have had with it is that in 18 mos worth of serious wear and tear i e a dozen plane trips two vacations and weekly use at the zoo the clip that holds it together when folded has gotten warped and so sometimes pops off The cure We wrap a luggage strap around it when flying the rest of the time it is no big deal We actually have a double jogging stroller which cost 3x as much that while we loved it for about 2 mos we haven t used since our second child was 3 mos old It is big and bulky and it much more difficult to maneuver The Jeep double umbrella stroller has been great 
5 0 It was the perfect gift I bought this for a friend who is expecting a second daughter wanting the new baby to have something special too Their first is about 20 months and I know she has sleeping issues so anything to buy them extra sleep with 2 I thought would be appreciated Well here is the email we got from her husband yesterday Baby 1 has gotten really attached to the sleep sheep you got for the baby to be She has taken over ownership of it My wife called me to tell me that Baby 1 was freaking out trying to find the sleep sheep when she found it she hugged it and fell asleep If this works I will forever be indebted to you both So I m adding it to our registry expecting 1 of our own in September 
4 0 Sleep Sheep The Sheep is very large but it does what it says plays nature sounds I only wish it had a time selection or remote 
4 0 Love this Sheep I bought this Sleep Sheep for my son who was 20 months at the time He was transitioning into a big boy bed He loved the bed but wanted me to stay with him until he fell asleep I bought this sheep in hopes of another source of comfort for him to replace me It worked He loves it The only downside is there is only 2 sound settings he likes The heartbeart and whale sounds are a little creepy I would ve liked to have a few more options like birds or a babbling brook But we do love the rain and the ocean settings that are available I say we because I find it very soothing too 
5 0 Babies love it The name says it all it is soothing for them It plays for a long time after you turn it on It s nice that you have many options to play besides the heartbeat sound My son is 8 months old and we still use it 
5 0 baby loves it great product Totally worth the money not only is it cute but works wonderfully Our baby loves the ocean surf sound works like a charm always soothes and puts her to sleep within minutes Bonus also works on the hubby 
5 0 Crib bedding Great set not too babyish for my elegant guest room Great for my grandson he loved the sheep applique etc and appropriate for my granddaughter too 
4 0 Cute and useful I have the Skip Hop Dash in black canvas and absolutely love it So this was just a little added bonus to get for the bag It holds 2 size 2 Gerber Nuk pacifiers and with its snap strap can be attached to just about anything We attach it to our stroller so we can have clean pacifiers on hand at all times 
4 0 My son likes them but they annoy me Well I can t give them too bad of a review since this is the only pacifier my son will take However I can t give it all five stars either For one this pacifier is really bulky compared to other pacifiers It almost looks like the nipple you would put on a bottle it s that bulky Second there is an attatcher that attatches to the pacifier and clips to the baby s cloths so the pacifier doesn t fall on the floor and that is even more bulkier than the pacifier So using the two of them your baby is almost consumed with this pacifier I guess my biggest beef with this pacifier is more cosmitically It s an ugly pacifier Besides it being ugly it s a pretty good pacifier I like that my son didn t have a problem with nipple confusion due to using this From the moment he was born he just had a high need to suck and I just couldn t spare my breast for the whole entire day so we had to give him a pacifier He never had a problem using this pacifier then nursing on me 
4 0 Only pacifier my baby will take Like the reviewer below my baby also was sucking on her hands her clothes and did not like the Avent pacifiers I had bought for her My friend told me to try a Soothie and it worked wonders immediately Baby does not spit it out It apparently is suitable for babies who breastfeed I would have to agree that the con is the lack of a handle There are 2 little holes in the pacifier that you could use to tie a makeshift pacifier clip string otherwise you should get several in case it falls out and gets lost Side note it is very cute to watch your baby sucking on this you can see his her mouth working through the pacifie 
4 0 Only Pacifier My Twins Will Take My twin daughter really needed a pacifier as she was chewing her clothing and this was the only one she would take and she loves it The only con is that it has no handle 
4 0 Thank goodness My newborn son would not take a pacifier for the first three weeks of his life We tried many different brands Advent Mam etc but unlike his older sister who took to the Advent brand on her second day of her life he did not like it at all The shape of the pacifier seems more natural to the breastfeed baby I would strongly recommend this pacifier to all mothers that are breastfeeding We are so thankful that we found this pacifier especially at 2 in the morning 
4 0 Great little electric pump take it from a mom of six Ever since our first child was born I have had trouble breastfeeding I produce a copious amount of milk and find it is extremely difficult to teach my tiny newborns to latch on properly Therefore I have relied heavily on this little electric Medela pump for all six of our newborns I have read several reviewers say that the pump is sufficient only for occasional pumping sessions but that has not been my experience I actually stopped breastfeeding two of our newborns entirely until they were each about six weeks old and could latch on properly without damaging me I used this pump to express milk seven to eight times a day for those six weeks and never had a problem The motor kept on going strong until the last baby Now all that said I will say that I am planning on purchasing a double pump for our seventh due in ten weeks I anticipate the same struggles with breastfeeding him that I have had with all the others and I would like to be able to pump both sides at once Pumping then feeding baby from a bottle can consume my entire day and pumping quickly will be a welcome help 
5 0 A must have I nurse my baby exclusively and am a stay at home mom but this is really handy for when we go out and can t schedule around his feeding times I didn t have any problems with let down It does make noise but it s not noisy I only pump at home so it doesn t bother me I only used this after my baby was 6 weeks and had no problems whatsoever 
4 0 Works Good Everyone tries to tell you that any breastpump that is any less than a hospital grade will not work if you are going back to work full time But I found that this one worked just fine I could pump for 15 minutes twice a day and it worked great I ended up not breastfeeding for as long as I had thought and I am very glad I didn t spend 200 300 on a breastpump This one still works great and I plan to use it for my next child Not everyone needs a hospital grade pump don t let people convince you of that I gave it a 4 because it was a little loud but not too bad 
4 0 Used exclusively for two months When I got this pump it was because I was a single mother and my mom wanted to give me a night off once in a while I chose this one because I orginally intended to only use it occasionally and I didn t have much money Then I developed a Candida yeast infection in my nipples that simply would not go away Nursing was too painful but pumping was bearable so in an effort to continue providing the milk nature helped me make I used this pump Sure the suction wasn t industrial strength and I had to do one breast at a time However the pump did the job in almost the same amount of time my son finished his bottles and I was even able to pump a little extra for longer term storage I was able to use this pump with steady efficiency for two months straight and my son never once had any formula If you are planning on returning to work I do not recommend you purchase this particular pump Go ahead and get yourself the time saving double pump However if you really are going to use this just occasionally I would recommend this product 
5 0 worth every penny HIGHLY recommended I love this pump I ve been using it since my daughter was born nine months ago At first I used every other day but when I returned to work I had to use it twice a day It works pretty good I don t have any complaints about this wonderful pump I m now using it once a day and still working I hope this review helps moms out there who are unsure of what kind of pump to buy 
5 0 Very Handy I lived in Nicaragua Central America and the hand pumps here cost US 75 00 This one is a dual electric pump and was a relief for our new born baby 
4 0 Its a good product The only reason I gave it a four is because I had one of the same model but a single and it worked bette 
5 0 best ever I have had many stroller over the span of the last 7 years and 3 children and this is the best one yet So easy to push and isn t so wide that you can t fit through the doorway but wide enough so the kids don t fight My oldest even jumps on the front wheel cover I know he shouldn t but what are you going to do and I can comfortably push all three love it love it love it Get this stroller if you are looking for one 
5 0 Love it I ve been searching for a stroller that met all my needs and this is it I have twins that are 10 months old and I have used 4 different strollers since they were born None of them did everything I needed until now I needed something for every day that could fit in my van and I could also take on the beach This stroller fits in the small space about 19 deep in the back of my van without having to remove the wheeles It opens and closes so quickly and easily You just unfold it and it locks into place Closing is just as easy with one hand The seats recline separately the front wheele swivle is wonderful I can easily push this stroller with one hand I have been able to get through all doors but I will say that there have been a couple places that was a tight squeeze There is a good basket under the stroller but there is a bar above it so you can t put anything too big I love that it has seat cushions that you can remove and wash It has a foot brake but no hand break so I m not sure if this would be a good stroller for serious joggers It s great to find something that will make my life a little easier 
5 0 The Best Double Stroller Ever I love this easy to push light weight double stroller I have no trouble putting it into my car and the best feature is the front wheel It swivels and locks So when I run I can lock the front wheel and when we just take a nice walk I unlock the wheel for easy mobility My two boys love sitting in it and there is enough run so they do not complain Well worth the money I paid for it 
5 0 Smooth Ride My husband and I recently purchased this stroller and I can t believe how smooth the ride is We shopped around before we choose this one as our favorite This stroller is so easy to maneuver around since it has the swivel front wheel that s one of my favorite feature about it Another feature I absolutely love is that the seats recline seperately and how easy it is to recline them We have 2 kids ages 1 amp amp 2 and they don t have to turn around to look at eachother anymore I have to say that anyone who has two little ones this stroller is much easier to push than any other double stroller out there 
5 0 Great Booster Seat This is the best booster seat we ve ever purchased It sits firmly on any chair it s very comfortable for my 3 year old and there are no clumsy straps to deal with It s also very easy to take along wherever you go We would recommend this product to anyone with toddlers who eat at the big table 
5 0 Awesome booster seat My kids love the cooshie booster Its stays secure without straps and is nice and soft for their little fannies The booster is easy to clean and is stainless I highly recommend the Cooshie Booster We ve had one for over 4 years now and bought our second when our second daughter was ready approximately 2 years ago Both are still in perfect condition 
5 0 Cooshie Booster best booster out there let me start by saying I have twins that are 2 5 I have never written a review before and I wanted to do so for this item I was reluctant to purchase a Cooshie due to the cost and purchased the hard plastic ones from Wal mart instead The hard plastic ones were leaving small bruises on my girls backs right along their spine from leaning back into the hard seat They also will rub the finish off of the seats of your hard wood chairs without putting something under them Also the hard plastic ones are hard to clean and difficult to remove from the seats to clean under them because crumbs will get under it and in it and around it The cooshie is light enough that my girls can carry it around them selves and they love to sit in them to watch TV I love the ease of being able to move the seats without unstrapping them in case we need the extra adult space Mine came with carry bags so we can take them with us to a restaurant and not have to use the germ infested seats there Cooshie seats are well worth the money I plan to use ours for several years to come They are also a breeze to clean 
5 0 Convenient and comfortable Our playgroup has lunch together every week One of the moms bought this booster and brought it for her daughter Within two weeks the entire group had bought the cooshie booster seat They come in black green and blue so far as I know The clean easily and are very convenient to carry to restaraunts in the carry case it comes in I am a tough critic of baby products and this one ranks 1 Grayson GA 
5 0 Great Booster We love it and most important our 2 yr old loves sitting in it Soft and comfy A must have 
5 0 Awesome Booster My 4 year old son just didn t fit at our new kitchen table and chairs We tried phone books but they moved and ended up on the floor half the time We pulled out his old hard plastic booster seat but he was just too big for it I purchased the Cooshie Booster and it is perfect He fits in it with lots of room and he s a big kid its not at all as small as the standard plastic booster seats and the super soft material really is great Awesome product that I highly recommend for bigger kids since it does not secure onto the chair or have a seat belt I won t use it for my 20 month old daughter 
5 0 My five year old loves it I have a smaller five year old that wanted to sit in a big boy chair not the stool we had been using After he destroyed one of our phone books and scratched our wood chairs with a hard plastic seat I found the Cooshie I highly recommend it It is easy to cart with you and he loves having a seat that can move around We are looking forward to using it next week at a movie theater No more coats Consider this seat if your child is smaller but no longer a toddler In addition he loved the color and the softness What a bonus 
5 0 The Best Booster I have two one for each of my boys This booster is great because it doesn t need to be straped or attached to the chair and is very portable It never moves from the chair either and is so comfortable for the kids We absolutely love them 
5 0 Pretty In Pink This is the prettiest car seat and the best fit for my baby She loves it 
4 0 Good carseat but careful with small babies I received this carseat as a gift and loved the colors I researched it online to find out that it is very safe in comparisson with others However baby seems to big in it Even with the newborn headrest my baby s head can dance in it she was 7 8lb Overall good carseat but if you have a small baby you will need additional head suppor 
5 0 love it I love the carseat my baby is small and she is so cozy in it This is my third child and I wish I had this carseat with the first I can not tell you how many compliments I get on it when I go out too It is so pretty 
4 0 Perfect seat Easy to use lightweight Clicks easily into the car bases and Graco stroller frames I LOVE the pink The strap system is secure and very easy to figure out even for me I suggest having a certified baby car seat installer put the seat in for you My husband an engineer and I thought we installed the bases correctly and they still need some slight changes 
4 0 Be Careful with the handle Overall I love this carseat but I found out today that I have been driving around with the handle in the wrong position I have kept the handle in what the instructions refer to as the A position which is also the setting that you carry the seat in After speaking to a police officer recently trained and certified in car seat installation safety he said the handle absolutely needs to be as far back as possible and provided a very strong arguement why The manual that came with the seat is very ambiguous and does not specifically say this at all I called Graco and suggested that this statement be added to the book for safety concerns and she argued that the seat was tested with the handle being up and it was fine The officer I spoke to was adament that an infant could be in GRAVE danger if the handle is up in a crash I think I am going to believe the police officer vs the manufacturer 
5 0 Best stroller on the market Shopping mom s dream This is great at keeping my 1 yr old occupied during my big shopping days I have tried other strollers Go with the Limited It has noises on the toys that keep him busy Not to mention the inquiries I get from other parents It is not hard for me to get it in my Yukon Howver I have to put it in the front seat in my husband s Maxima as it does not fold real flat 
4 0 Great stroller for walks I purchased this stroller for walking around the neighborhood so the weight size fold was not an issue The tires and suspension give a smooth ride and it is easy to steer Negatives seat padding could be thicker recline mechanism is a cheap toggle and I laughed when I read others complaints about getting their finger caught in the harness but it happened to my husband and myself For the price it is a great value and and I would definitely recommend it 
5 0 Love It Very easy to put together and it rides wonderful on our neighborhood trails My daughter fits snugg in the seat unlike other strollers we tried Folds up easily however its a little awkard to pick up and load in the car 
4 0 Excellent Alternative We originally wanted a stroller car seat combo but we received this as a shower gift We love it Our infant Graco Snug Ride carseat actually fits into the stroller facing whomever is pushing My husband loves the iPod connection it works well as best I can tell The tires are easy to inflate I was able to figure out the air pump to inflate the tires with out any instructions I also find that it has a lot of storage capacity for shopping It is not super easy to steer with one hand as I sometimes have to do when my baby wants out The stroller is heavy to lift in and out of the trunk and it does not fit in all cars It can be awkward to lift and stowe watch your fingers and it takes up a lot of space It does collapse using one hand but its not as if you could do it while holding your baby or anything else so it might as well be two handed Also I find that it is not the best a steering in small isles in stores it tends to get hung up However it will ride over most terrain quietly and with little disturbance to your little one It has two cup holders in near the handle but I find that they are usually too small I read once that they were designed to fit a Starbucks cup My Avent bottles do not fit well nor do bottles of water Overall I would recommend this stroller its well priced durable and functional 
4 0 Smooth and quiet I finally picked up the jogging stroller now that my boy is 17 months old It was easy to put together and is very quiet Since its brand new there hasn t been time for it to get squeeky My only complaint was that it seemed to lean to the right until I walked with it for about a mile Then it corrected itself and I think it is nice The other thing was the left back tire rubbed one time on the break that sits up above when unlocked But that could have been some uneven ground I have the Sport model that doesn t come with the MP3 thing I think I ll just listen to the birds and ambient sounds instead 
5 0 CON CARRO DESDE BEBE ESTE BEBE YA TIENE SU PRIMER CARRO SU NUEVO JEEP LIBERTY STROLLER ES PERFECTO 
5 0 Worth the money and hassle for peace of mind This tent was a much needed item after my son 18m climbed out of his crib but then was not emotionally ready for his daybed yet Since I needed it ASAP I could not wait for shipping so I called local stores It wasn t at a few baby stores which surprised me but I found it at Babies r US I wanted the original one without side enclosures but could not find it I guess there s a good reason they changed the design and I trust it was from wise consumers input Anyway setting up the tent part was a snap but affixing it to our crib was the challenge We have a convertbable 4 in 1 crib that has a headboard higher than the drop rail side This means the front and back vertical poles aren t even which causes a problem when trying to secure the super strong velcro fasteners It would leave it crooked and possibly able to slide since the corners would not be resting stable as the must be We found a way to level it since I was not gonna give up My hubby mounted an old broomstck behind the backboard even with the front and we got it level well rested and snug on the crib perimeter My complaint of taking time and effort is based on good safety so I say it for preparation not to disway your purchasing The velcro hoops are so tough to pry open and then fasten it worked me out Also when inserting the mattress we found it much easier if two people do it so they can get it flat and then drop it into the net rather than trying to sinch down the sides The enclosure is soo snug that it will make it hard to adjust if you drop one side down first All that to say my son loves it and was so eager to get back into his crib lastnight I was a at peace knowing he wont fall trying to climb out again 
4 0 Zipper wakes up son This is a wonderful product we got it to keep the cats out of the crib However the zipper wakes up our son almost everytime we try to open or close it So we usually just shut his bedroom door now Maybe our next child won t be so sensitive to the sound Update now that he s a little older he isn t waking up to it as long as we very quietly zip it 
5 0 Great product My son was one of those climbers so i had to buy this when he was 18 months He was able to climb out but had a couple falls that made me nervous We have had it for awhile now and i absolutely love it I am also happy to have it for the next child so that i don t have to worry about my son throwing things into the crib I recommend it to all parents It is easy to assemble I have one at my mom s house and home At first my son was a little uneasy about it but i zipped it up while he was sleeping each night until he just got used to it Now he asks me to do it 
5 0 Great Product Very impressed This product has been a lifesaver My newly 2 year old had learned to jump out of his crib and is just not ready for a bed yet I bought this and within 25 minutes it was completely put together and put on the crib I did it myself and found it simple to do I haven t had a problem since The only downfall I have is that the zipper will wake him if I go in there and want to cover him with a blanket I found changing the sheets easy the mattress fit right thru the opening and I switched the sheets no problem This product is excellent 
5 0 Worked for us We were very pleased with this item As others have mentioned changing the sheets requires removing the entire tent but I didn t mind doing this Our son thought it was neat just like camping inside He did not even attempt to jump out of his crib after this was put on It fit just fine on our sleigh crib 
5 0 Love this Chair My husband and I over analyze everything and this highchair is the best that we ve seen We started our son on solids at 4 months which was before he could sit up by himself and has worked flawlessly ever since The tray easily slides on an off even one handed The cover is easy to wipe down the tray stores itself on the back of the chair the harness straps are secure and when it folds it really is a space saver The leg separator was annoying at first but we found that it is detachable the foot rest is as well 
5 0 LOVE IT We ve had this chair for about 6 months now and love it Our older son had a Graco one but when we stored it we lost the straps so we had to find a new chair for the baby I was looking for an inexpensive chair but when I saw this one with all the features I loved it immediately and decided to splurg So glad that I did The chair is very easy to clean and folds up small enough to fit between my frig and wall While the trays are too big for the dishwasher they clean up really easily with a wet wipe so that doesn t bother me 
5 0 A+ This is THE perfect chair We love it My son is 6 months and he seems really confortable in it I m sure he ll be fine for the next few years It s very convenient with all its different positions I can feed him in the living room or at the kitchen table He can be vertical to eat solids a little less to drink his bottle and laying back if he falls asleep It s very easy to clean as well and easy to fold It s just PERFECT Nothing wrong about it 
5 0 Wonderful crib set but accessories only so so I recently purchased this 6 piece set along with the lamp hamper mobile for our nursery The colors are vibrant pastel pinstriped shades of blue sage green and tangerine with touches of bright yellow I like that brand new from the package the material is touchable and isn t stiff as a board While this is generally listed as gender neutral I think buyers should know there is a lot of blue in this set While that doesn t matter to us I know some parents prefer more yellows greens oranges etc for true gender neutrality The embroidered details Humpty Dumpty Cow Jumping Over the Moon etc on the quilt bumper pad diaper stacker and hamper are just beautiful they stand out but are do not take away from the prettiness of the fabric The accessories are cute but I think if I had paid full price for the hamper lamp that I would be less pleased The material of the hamper is great but the wooden structure is very flimsy I foresee this getting put inside the closet once baby is crawling or it will easily be pulled over The lamp has a story book with Hey Diddle Diddle cow spoon dish on it very cute but up close you notice it was not painted well From a slight distance you don t notice it but it does bug me a little considering the price The mobile is cute but I do not care for the fact that the baby will only see the bottoms of the stars moon and cow Not nearly as exciting as the ones that position the animals shapes down towards the baby Would not be my first choice for mobiles I prefer the geometric symphony one but since I got this as a package deal I will likely use it Overall the material is nice quality touchably soft the colors embroidery are beautiful the colors do lean a bit more towards a traditional boy room versus a neutral room with light blue as the main color for the bumper pad the dust ruffle the hamper and the valance hamper lamp mobile not as high quality products as the crib set I would recommend this crib set to friends family sans hamper lamp mobile The nursery rhyme theme is classic well put together here by Lambs Ivy I rated this 5 stars simply for the crib set For the price and the amount of items included it is a great deal If I were rating the accessories I would not give them more than a 3 for just being average 
5 0 Princess booster car seat My granddaughters were delighted with the new Princess car seats I feel good knowing they will remain in them and safe The service was excellent they were received by them the next day I had a very positive experience Thank 
5 0 I still love it I seriously love this bowl and spoon The bowl fits nicely in your hand so it s easy to feed a squirming baby The spoon has a very soft tip so you don t have to worry about hurting their gums My daughter is a year old and mostly feeds herself but we are still using the bowl for snacks or I ll put yogurt in one side and fruit in the other The lid always stays on and the bowl still looks new even though we ve used them a lot I would highly recommend this product 
4 0 Pretty Good The baskets are good sized to hold most infant feeding items including spoons bottles breast pump accessories and more My only complaint is that the valve container is a little misleading The openings are still too big for breast pump valves but nowhere in the information on the product does it clarify that it is actually designed for the larger sippy cup valves 
5 0 Great Basket I have the basket for my son s bottle parts and nipples and it works wonderfully It holds the parts to 10 bottles and allows the dishwasher to get them all clean I ve never had any issues with this basket 
5 0 Best Dishwasher Basket I ve Found I have two of these dishwasher baskets but I do not have the valve basket They can be purchased separately at some stores I originally bought another type of dishwasher basket that had the bottle nipple compartment on top but it much more difficult to use Everytime you opened it to add another nipple the ones already in there would fall out These dishwasher baskets are designed allot better They have the nipple compartment on the bottom for better cleaning and have slots that the bottle nipples fit into The best aspect however is that the nipples do not fall out when the compartment is opened 
5 0 Keeps the germs away My son used this until he refused to sit in the basket anymore I just washed it every so often and kept it in my car for next time Maks them more comfy and keeps them warmer in winter 
5 0 What a relief We have used this seat for our son since he was about 10 months old in shopping carts and at restaurants It is easy to install and fold up it has pockets in the sides so he can keep his toys with him and keeps his hands clear from all the germs from carts and high chairs Plus he looks so much more comfortable in this seat cover A must for new Moms concerned about germs and keeping baby healthy 
5 0 Absolutely the Best This gives 100 coverage even covers all of the big costco cart There are loops for holding toys and a little side pocket for extras My son loves to ride in the cart and chew on things with this I don t have to worry that he s going to chew on the cart It s also extremely easy to put on and take off I usually do it one handed while holding my son A must have 
5 0 better than all the rest This is an amazing product I had seen other shopping cart covers in the stores but they all have little ties and velcro sides and look quite complicated Who has time for all of that With the Floppy seat you just stretch it over the cart slide the seat belt through buckle and go It covers all of the surfaces of the cart unlike some others It s so nice and comfy lots of cushion and I can attach a toy to the loops and put my baby s sun hat in the pocket Wonderful wonderful wonderful I know it is more expensive than some of the covers that are in the stores but it is well worth the extra cost This is one of the best baby products we have purchased 
5 0 Best Fitted Diaper I have used both Kissaluvs size 1 2 with my son from age 6 months 2 years He has never leaked I never had a problem with drying them perhaps because I live in a dry climate My husband loves them too so they are all we used Buy them new at about 10 each I used 2 dozen at a time My son is such a wiggle worm that I recently bought a few fuzzi bunz pocket diapers I like them better for his age 2 3 years because I don t have to wrestle a diaper AND a cover on him However they are pricey at 15 each I m having a baby this month and bought a dozen size 0 I will need at least another dozen but they grow out of them so quickly I have heard they are THE best infant diaper High resale value as well 
5 0 wonderful These are great if you re looking into buying cloth diapers very soft and cushy 
4 0 Germ Free protection As a first time mom I am very nervous about my son getting germs He likes to lick everything I got this product and it fit nicely on every cart I ecountered except the Costco cart The cart was too big I was still able to cover to seat and the handle preventing AJ from tasting the cart I also like the fact the it is easily washable and has its own safety strap The minor problem I can t seem to fold it up without carefully thinking about it Otherwise it stays in my trunk and out of the way unitl I need it 
4 0 love it I ve never written a review before and to be honest I didnt read the reviews on this item before I bought it But I also hurt myself at work and the back pain was getting worse especially going into my third trimester This back support made a big difference for me it does work and I would recomend it I only gave it 4 stars cause it does roll down a little on the sides of the back Other than that its great and does its job 
5 0 Worked Great I read the other reviews and thought I should order the lg xl Well I guess I really didn t need that size Med would have worked also It gave me great support and eased the low back pain I think it works excellent 
5 0 JENNIFER My Mom bought this for me thinking it would help my back discomfort Well as I rolled my eyes at the idea I found relief I was able to be up and about with no lower back discomfort It is very discreet and I am not constantly walking around holding my back or belly the belly sling as we call it is great and I would definitly recomend this product 
5 0 Survival must for the 3rd trimester A friend of mine bought this item for me and at first I thought that wasted her money I noticed that she bought it for me in L XL and of course I thought this will never ever fit me after all my pre pregnancy size was a 4 Well I was sooo wrong Into my 3rd trimester I developed discomfort in my lower abdomen and back I decided to try this belt and it was a awesome I ve been able to continue working out walking etc because of this belt I love it My only suggestion is to buy the bigger size 
5 0 Fits the bill perfectly Superb solution to the where will my kid sleep while we re staying at ____ problem Comes in a cool back pack for easy travel Inflates quickly with included pump Deflates quickly to save room in a cramped hotel or spare room Rechargeable pump holds a charge for a long time Comfy The only negatives I can think of are minor The pump nozzle is a tad tough to fit into the inflation valve The bed is a little large for tight spaces It does lose some pressure over a couple days Definitely recommended though 
5 0 Very Pleased Bought this for my 2 year old grandaughter She s tiny and was afraid of the bigger bed so this was perfect for her She loves the bed and sleeps very well in it 
5 0 Daughter loves it Right from the moment it arrive my daughter loves it She sleeps perfectly and has a dora stuffed to sleep with her at nightnight time 
5 0 Great Bed Bed is great Took a while to put together but have had absolutely no problems with it My wife who weights about 125 lbs has laid on this bed and it has not even come close to falling apart It states max weight should be 50 lbs but it appears to handle more than double My daughter loves it and I recommend it if you dont mind the time it takes to put together Sure it was a bit tricky but I believe the way the poles are made is for it to have more support Loved the fact I could use the mattress from her crib 
5 0 Great bed finally came the first time we ordered this bed half the parts was missing i called the wonderful customer service people and they sent a replacement bed after a long wait it finally came it was a little hard to put together but with good amp quot know how amp quot this bed can be put together within 30 45 min it is very sturdy i had my husband test it out he jiggled and jubbled it and it stayed together perfectly my daughter loves it 
5 0 Outstanding for the price This bed had easy to follow instructions which clearly state it is made for children under 50 pounds It has stayed firmly together as we have read and followed the guidelines for proper assembly and use My daughter is 2 and a half and weighs 32 pounds and we have had no problems with this bed She loves it and so do about half her stuffed animals I recommend buying this with the toy storage system she loves which makes it easy for her to pick up her room 
4 0 Cute Bed hard to put together Super cute bed but my husband and I had a hard time putting it together My daughter liked it for about 3 months and is now in a twin bed It s great for her baby dolls 
5 0 Great This potty seat fits on the toilet and does not slip around the child is secure and comfortable rather than doing a balancing act This goes a long way for a child trying his best to learn Also its easy to clean 
5 0 Great product Very sturdy chair and perfect size for our 16 month old The quality is good especially for the price I would recommend this product 
5 0 Potty pal Those looking for an inexpensive alternative to 45 wooden stools should consider this My two year old can carry without risk of pinching fingers as well 
4 0 The good the bad and the ugly Our baby s been getting fussy We started with gas drops and that nipped the problem in the bud Then a couple of weeks ago feeding time turned into a battle zone Screaming back arching twisting and writhing spitting formula while passing gas burps sending formula up along with air We were desperate So I ran out and bought these bottles The Good The moment we switched the screaming stopped HOORAY We still get a little screaming if we didn t get the bottle assembled properly and we have leaks and it seems slightly harder to get burps out of baby probably because there s less air going in so it takes longer to build up a good solid burp The Bad These bottles in the 3 pack only come with the stage 2 nipples The flow on those was too fast baby was drowning I bought a bunch of stage 1 nipples and WHOA we went from 125 mL per 30 minutes to 45 mL in an hour I tried letting baby build up her sucking strength on these stage 1 nipples for about 3 days then finally out of desperation came here to read reviews and see what others had to say I bought the narrow Dr Brown s Level 1 nipples Baby s sucking had evolved by the time I got those home and unfortunately she sucks so hard after having used these crummy Playtex stage 1 nipples that she drowns some more when we use the alternative nipples This solution would have worked well had I got these nipples the DAY that we noticed how slow the stage 1 Playtex nipples were Needless to say I thoroughly read through the instructions since the screaming had stopped and I was able to process information again It recommends that you bring the nipple tip where the hole is closer to where baby s lips come together meaning don t allow more than 1 2 the nipple in baby s mouth while she s sucking This has worked perfectly and we are now back to 100 mL in 30 minutes PTL The Ugly In addition to needing a stage 1 5 nipple desparately Come ON Playtex Puuuuhleeeez the parts are a bit awkward Not like Dr Brown s but you have the nipple the ring the bottle the disk and the vent cap Lots of pieces to clean and keep up with but easy to handle if they keep your kid from screaming at you for hours on end Also you are not supposed to use a bottle warmer on this Guess what I tried it anyway Sometimes a bit of formula will leak thereby requiring cleanout of the bottle warmer But it isn t too bad and we have been using the bottle warmer anyway seems to be working out just fine for us Take my advice ASSEMBLE THE BOTTLES WHILE BABY s SLEEPING YOU CAN T SLAP THESE THINGS TOGETHER DURING A SCREAMY BABY EMERGENCY OR YOU WILL HAVE A MESS ON YOUR HANDS and everywhere else Bottom line is that our baby is eating again So I would recommend I just take away one star for the bad ugly portions of my review Edit These bottles WERE a TEMPORARY answer to our prayers However we have switched to Avent bottles and they have worked great for us for two weeks now My advice to parents looking for bottles to solve feeding issues buy the smallest number possible and give it 5 days If it looks good on day one and is the same kind of good by day 5 it s safe to sink more money into it But if it isn t going to work out it will be obvious by day 5 or sooner that you haven t found The Answer 
4 0 Good bottle overall When I registered for my baby shower I inadvertently registered for the regular Ventaire bottles as well as the Natural Shape bottles which is what I was wanting so my review will discuss both types NATURAL SHAPE VENTAIRE For starters the Natural Shape bottles are good for babies who are breastfeeding because the milk doesn t flow out when the bottle is tipped over The baby really has to suck to get it out and it has to open its mouth wider due to the size of the nipple Feeding my son with a stage 1 nipple took a REALLY long time Approximately 40 45 minutes However I tried a Stage 2 nipple when he was about four months old and the milk flowed out pretty easily So quickly in fact that he got really mad and refused to eat because he was getting choked I switched back to Stage 1 nipples and also began relying heavily on the regular Ventaire bottles He is now 5 months old and we have switched to Stage 2 nipples in the Natural Shape bottles and he is doing well He tends to finish a 6 7 oz bottle in about 10 minutes These bottles are a lot wider than regular bottles and he has a harder time trying to grasp and hold these bottles REGULAR VENTAIRE Now for the regular Ventaire bottles I found these bottles to be the better of the two for us Although I had initially breastfed and chose the Natural Shape bottles for that reason I had to quit breastfeeding at four weeks So the issue of having a nipple that wouldn t confuse the baby was no longer a concern for us The regular Ventaire bottles had no flow issues even with Stage 1 nipples He finished his bottle faster with this type of bottle and seemed to have no problems with the speed of the flow We switched to Stage 2 nipples a couple of weeks ago and the transition was smooth I didn t notice him getting choked and he doesn t have to gulp as quickly as he does with the Stage 2 nipples on the Natural Shape bottles These bottles are also slimmer which makes it easier for him to try and grasp and hold the bottle Now for the operation of both types of bottles They have a plastic disc that fits into the bottom ring of the bottle then the bottle screws on and finally the nipple in its ring screw on top of that On the regular Ventaire bottles the disc fits snugly into the bottom On the Natural Shape bottles it has to fit into a little notch and it is easy to think it s in right only to find out that its not ie when the milk starts leaking out We heat our bottles in a pan of water on the stove and the bottom rings have a tendency to hold water So if you use this method you need to tap the bottle sideways on the pan to shake out the water in the ring and I usually hold a dish towel up to the edge of the ring as well and tip the bottle so that all the hot water comes out If you don t when you tip the bottle to feed your baby the hot water will run down onto your hand or the baby s hand if s he can hold the bottle This isn t really a reason not to buy the bottles just something to be aware of Finally some people have wondered if babies swallow less air with this type of bottle I have two older children that I used standard bottles with and I have seen no difference between those and these Playtex bottles My son still burps just as much as the next baby Occasionally during feeding you can hear some air leaking out but overall I really don t think it makes any difference 
5 0 Great Bottles My son was very fussy when he was new and had lots of gas I had about seven or so of these bottles from an inlaw I decided to use them and no gas and no more fussy baby I continued to use them up until this month I have no time for bottles with so many parts My son is crawling and pulling up so I am busy all the time The bottles are great I never in the seven months had a leak problem the wasn t strickly human error mostly by my husband It is a good idea to put them back to gether when clean they do consume time if you are in a hurry You can buy replacement parts in my area the nipple and bottom seals Great bottle Great buy 
4 0 Pretty Good My baby is mostly breastfed but Dad gives baby a bottle at night so I can get a few hours of uninterupted sleep Baby loves this bottle and it really does keep air bubbles out of the milk The only downfall is all the parts and putting them together If I had it to do over I would have tried the Playtex premium bottles with the drop ins 
5 0 Walk through Gate This is a good quality gate which was not too difficult to install We use it for 2 cats and so we don t have to lock unlock the gate to pass through it since the cats can t push the gate open I liked the pressure gauge that was included with the unit Very sturdy very solid It was well worth the cost 
5 0 Great Service My Pacifier holder came in a timely fashion and was just what I wanted and looked just the same as the picture on line Thank you for your great service Becki 
4 0 I like the pattern I really like the pattern on this changing pad It matchs up my diaper bag this is the only reason I bought it I wish my diaper bag comes with this changing pad so that I don t have to spend extra money to buy it Really I don t care about the pocket 
5 0 A rockin red potty With five young children in our home we have two of these Baby Bjorn potties With constant use and abuse they still look brand new They are easy to clean I have even stuck the bowl portion in the dishwasher and easy to transport My kids LOVE the bright colors which make potty training easier Well worth the money 
4 0 Great Quality but get the Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer instead We have the Baby Bjorn Step Stool Potty Chair Little Potty and now the Toilet Trainer Hind sight is 20 20 The Toilet Trainer and Step Stool is all you need Our initial thought was to have the Potty Chair for home and the Little Potty for trips The reality is our daughter would sit on her potty then want to sit on the toilet like Mommy and Daddy We balanced her on the toilet before we decided to get the toilet trainer No more balancing acts on the toilet She can use her step stool to get on the toilet when she wants The Toilet Trainer travels well fits all types of toilets easy to install remove and clean The Potty Chair and Little Potty are fantastic quality but you might as well go with the Toilet Trainer from the start 
4 0 Works Great for Little Boys When I began my research for a potty chair for my son I had no idea how many things there were to consider I really didn t want anything that made noise or had lights but we ultimately decided on this chair because of the one piece splash guard since I learned that it wasn t uncommon for little boys to hurt their tender bits on other chairs It is well made and sturdy it didn t tip when my son got on or off I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and didn t slip around He had no problem getting himself on and off of it and he liked the responsibility of dumping the contents into the big potty I liked that it was easy for him to do that and easy for me to clean the bowl afterward 
5 0 The BEST for boys We were given this potty in blue by a neighbor and my son has had some great early success on it It s comfy and the fact that the splash guard is a unibody construction with the removable pot is a godsend in terms of how easy it is for my son to get on and off the chair Within days of his first success he was able to use this potty with no help and carry the pot in to me in the next room to show off his latest success However we didn t find out how truly great it was until we tried to buy a second potty for upstairs use We ve purchased two others One had a splash guard so low and poorly designed that my son s privates landed squarely on top of it every time he sat down Another had a high splash guard but it was soft and movable and flopped down underneath my son every time he sat down He s become very upset each time we try a new terrible potty and I feel awful for putting him through it No more We re buying a 2nd Baby Bjorn right now and I d highly recommend that anyone about to embark on the potty training journey with a boy do the same Simply the most well designed potty chair out there 
5 0 POTTY TRAINED WITHIN DAYS We bought 2 of these potty chairs They were so easy to clean and stayed brand new looking that I sold both of them for 75 of their original list price when we were done with them How cool is that They maintained their value Note When potty training don t forget to buy the character underwear We bought Elmo Underwear with the baseball cap sport theme from ebay and it worked great Trained within days 
5 0 great potty I was originally looking at buying a potty chair that had all the bells and whistles flush noises music lights the works Then I thought wait a minute the regular potty doesn t have those things She wants one like mommies I got this for her after being asked repeatedly to read the potty book for girls She was immediately sitting on it without any prompting Once I finally took her pants off she went right away We are still working on going always on the potty but she loves the potty itself It is very basic and sturdy My daughter had no problem sitting with the little guard on the front I like that it has a separate bowl and my daughter is so proud when she can take it out and flush it down the big potty 
5 0 I love it I love the design of this chair It s all one piece except the bowl and it s very stable I like that there is a back for support The removable bowl is convenient to empty and clean I bought this for my third child but I wish I had had it with my other two 
4 0 Good diaper cover These are great diaper covers They seemed huge at first until I got the hang of them They clean easily and dry fast no special washing required I think the elastic feels rough but my little one doesn t seem to mind and there are no marks on her legs from them These are great diapers for all kinds of cloth prefolded and fitted diapers 
5 0 Great cloth diapering item This is one of the best covers on the market and great for the price You can use these with flat or prefolds without using pins or fasteners or it works with a fitted diaper 
5 0 5 Stars for Durability I got these and the imse vimse covers for my daughter At first I thought I d like the IV more because it seemed as though the fit better around the leg but I changed my mind quickly Not only do these fit just fine but they are MUCH MORE DURABLE After a few washings the IV began to loose shape and the velcro began to warp and I cold water wash and line dry The BUmmis look just the same as when I got them except for some stains These covers will last me through the next few babies I m sure of it My only complaint is that once your baby begins to push the weight limit it takes a little practice to get the velcro tabs to stick right When my daughter weighed 14lbs if I didn t fastened the tabs in just the right spot they would come undone but it didn t take long to figure out and correct After comparing these covers with others my IV and the Bummis original the a friend of mine used these covers COME OUT ON TOP PS I did wash the covers in cold water at first to make them last longer but it s best to wash covers in hot water to disinfect I started washing the Bummis in hot water with my diapers and they re still holding up fine In response to the other review these diapers DO have fold back tabs for the laundry I bought these exact covers from this exact page and mine have them 
4 0 Good for the Summer Months Like most reviewers I too like this bather It is much softer than the plastic tubs and folds for fairly easy storage at least it is smaller to store than the plastic ones However my son s little jaw chatters because he gets chilly because he is so far out of the water I DO fill my tub up high with water but the angle of the chair doesn t allow for him to have enough of his body safely submerged I think it would be great for warmer weather but January and February in the Midwest are cold I also wish that the manufacturer would make the washer and bold on the underside a plastic piece It has rusted on my model too 
5 0 Great gift I purchased this as a baby registry gift for an out of state friend They keep raving on how great it is 
4 0 Much better than the tubs We started with the tub to seat bath complete universal bath system by first years but it was way too small for our baby and he slid around in it so much that we switched to bathing him in the sink while we supported him When he outgrew the sink we needed an alternative so we bought this bather It s a lot like his bouncy seat which he loves and is very comfortable in This is much easier than supporting all of his weight with one arm and bathing him with the other while he squirms around I didn t give it 5 stars because I think it s lacking 2 things that would make it perfect One is a strap like in the bouncy to keep him from sliding down though he doesn t slide too bad not like in the tub the other is that it needs suction cups on the bottom to hold it in place in the tub better 
5 0 Just what I wanted I was given a hand me down changing pad that I used for my 1st 2nd child but it was really looking bad when baby 3 came so I broke down and bought this I love it My covers fit on snug but easily and the strap has been so nice to hold baby on for a few seconds while I grab something instead of making one of my other children stand beside the baby to keep her from rolling My child also loves to play with the strap and it keeps her occupied during changes 
5 0 Excellent Product I have been using this changing pad for two years and it works great The only problem is it can rip I am buying a new one for my next child but this time I will buy a changing pad cover to go over it 
5 0 Pillow is a must for every toddler I purchased this pillow for my son as I was tired of seeing him slumped over in his car seat while he slept With the RestUpRight pillow he is secure and alligned in his carseat and sleeps with a straight spine The pillow is adjustable and the fabic is really soft Also its VERY easy to use It is well made and it comes with straps so that the pillow goes over the seatbelt and it does not slip down while he sleeps 
5 0 Best travel pillow EVER I ve been stumped in trying to find something for the car for my son to use that wouldn t bother my other two kids we have a Lincoln Town Car so it s tight in the backseat and this pillow has been our pillow SALVATION Works perfectly my son s head doesn t loll around and it s narrow design keeps him in his own personal space AWESOME I m ordering the adult version RIGHT NOW 
5 0 Just a note about bumpers for you who don t know Ok just so you guys know as a student of child development and safety your child WILL NOT suffocate due to a use of bumper pads The only reason this has happened is because the parents have not securely positioned their sleeping child and the child rolls over buries his or her face in the bumper and suffocates You should however remove the bumpers once your child is able to pull him or her self to a standing position in the crib since the bumper can be used as a step to climb up and fall out I hope this puts some of your minds at ease 
4 0 Great looking good quality bumper I recieved this bumper as a shower gift and I really like the colors and the quality The only thing is that it doesn t come with instructions on how to attach it to your crib and its not as self explanitory as one might think it would be The picture on the packaging shows the pattern facing inwards towards the baby and no bumper on the sliding side rail so I guess you have to double it back on the sides but the ties end up weird that way We ll see how it works out but otherwise its a good quailty bumper 
5 0 Great set I received the safari bedding as a shower gift I have the comforter the bumper pad the dust ruffle two fitted sheets and the rug I also received the nightlight and valances as shower gifts I was able to find the safari border at a Target Greatland in my area It really adds to the room I was also able to find the wall hangings but I m not sure if I will use them or not Everything is well made and we hope to use it for baby number one as well as other children that we might have in the future 
5 0 Nice quality bumper pad For safety reasons I was reluctant to purchase a bumper After looking at this one in person and seeing that it had ties on top and bottom I decided to purchase it My daughter did fine without it but I like the color it brought to the crib I wanted her to be able to see the cute animal design so I have the pattern facing in toward her Her crib has a drop down side so I have the bumper pad running across the back and ends of the crib I took the excess pad and wrapped it back around the outside of each crib end and tied it None of the solid blue shows I am very pleased with the quality of this bumper pad and highly recommend it 
5 0 Love this bumper I love this bumper The embroidered animals are plush and very cute Colorful too Just about any color in the set you can use to paint decorate the rest of your nursery with I just wish the inside of this bumper also had the patchwork animal design on it Instead it is just plain blue like the trim on the outside So when you walk into the room and look into the crib what you will see is basically a blue bumper Other than that its a nice bumper the set is great 
5 0 Wall Paper Border Relatively easy to hang We used additional glue for pre pasted paper because we read elsewhere that it was necessary Overall a relatively good product 
4 0 A little tricky to hang I bought this border to accessorize my Froggy Tales collection It matches beautifully with the set It is a little tricky to hang I found that just adding water to the prepasted back was not quite enough to make it stick well I added wallpaper paste to it to assure it s adherance I also liked that it is a double roll and covers 30 feet rather than the standard 15 of most wallpaper borders It makes my Froggy Tales Set complete 
5 0 great lightweight stroller This is as light as an umbrella stroller but performs like a big bulky one I will be able to use it as my grandson grows I would recommend this to my friends 
5 0 Great item and it was beautiful Awesome item that is the right size and works great 
5 0 I Love It My daughter just turned 1 year old She s on the tiny side so I was concerned as to what type of carseat I was going to purchase I read many reviews on Britax and it seemed like the company to go with I loved the print of this and my daughter looks so cute in it Not to mention that she finds it much easier to fall asleep in this seat than in her infant carrier My husband said it was fairly easy to install and I know getting her in and out as well as adjusting the straps is a breeze It was a perfect buy and I would recommendend to anyone 
4 0 Great Car Seat few minor flaws We purchased this car seat for our daughter when she turned one and was 20 lbs We loved our Peg Perego infant seat but she was clearly outgrowing it and uncomfortable So far she loves this seat and I love the safety profile and color She enjoys riding in this seat as it has plenty of room and fits her size well The only 2 flaws that I find I personally dislike is 1 that you do not hear a distict click when you buckle the 5 point harness For me this is juat a reassurance that it locked 2 I dislike the rubber strap covers and may consider cutting them off They make the straps harder to maneuver I do like the velcro attachments on the side that allow you to pull the straps apart when you put the baby in This is a real time and effort saver Overall we really love the seat We also purchased the Graco Comfort Sport car seat for our secondary car and it is a good seat overall but not as nice as the Britax Plus the Britax goes to 65 lbs and the Graco only 40 Britax is definitely worth the money and the better seat for the primary car 
4 0 love the pattern and the fell of the seat My thoughts about this product I hope they will help you to decide I had already purchased a Britax car seat that was a neutral color thinking I d be happy with that Wrong So I return the neutral color and went for the Floral pattern which I love looking at and so does my husband The price was more than I thought the next level should cost but well worth it I spent a good amount of time at the store looking feeling the other car seats This model is very durable good feel of the material and it s going to last My only disappointment is the velcro tabs which is a great idea to hold the straps to the side to allow you to place your child in the seat The velcro tabs are located about an inch too high 
5 0 Well worth the money I love this car seat but more importantly my 7 month old baby girl seems to love it too We switched her to this seat when she was 6 months old and car rides have been a whole lot better She has plenty of room and it reclines better than her infant car seat Graco snugride and it is well padded We call it the princess throne My husband was shocked at first at how much this thing costs but now he understands why This was so easy to install and very safe I love the latch system the thing barely moves You can t put a price on safety Plus this will grow with her until maybe she s about 5 Also you cannot go wrong with this beautiful fabric I love it not another pink but very girlie and sweet I LOVE IT WELL WORTH THE 
5 0 This Car Seat Rocks What a great seat Excellent growth for the long term I especially like the sides of the seat that offer great side impact protection Also a five point harness that accomodates a child up to 65lbs and 49 in length The 5 point harness was super easy to use and adjust Seat installation was a breeze with the latch system included I bought my seat online at travelingtikes com who s prices were far lower than any other advertised price by more than fifty dollars shipping included right on I purchsed the tan seat portland that best matched our car interior Im so happy that Britax is rated so well and that their seat is such a household name which made my purchase that much easier to research My little guy is styling 
5 0 Just Bought 2nd One My wife and I each have seat in our car for carrying our 18 month old toddler She has a Britax Marathon convertible car seat I have a Cosco Eddie Bauer Deluxe 3 in 1 car seat Neither of us has had any problems using the Britax seat with thick harness straps that don t twist The lap buckle system on the Britax harness is easy to use and can be undone with one hand The seat cover was also easy to remove when my daughter spilled juice all over her seat In contrast within 2 weeks using the Cosco seat and wrestling my toddler into the harness the thin harness straps on my Cosco seat were a twisted mess that just kept getting worst The overlapping buckle system is a pain to line up and use I ve finally decided to give up on the Cosco seat I got tired of trying to straighten the harness straps and to fasten the complicated buckle I just ordered another Britax Marathon 
5 0 just love this chair I just love this high chair so does my 7 month old It puts him right up to the table with the rest of the family It s easy to attach to the table and easy to dettach it and store And its easy to fold up and take it with you 
4 0 I love this product and everyone asks where I got it The Easy Diner is so nice to take with you anywhere It sometimes can be a little hard to fold up or I would have given it 5 stars I just hope it lasts for a while 
4 0 strong steady My son is one years old and he s about 27lbs This Chair is very strong and steady once clap on the table One shortcome is it has to be installed on a very strong or heavy table otherwise the table will not stay put with the weight of my son So I m not able to use it at all restaurants though 
5 0 easy to clean This item works wonderful and is very easy to clean The cover slips off and can be thrown in the washer I prefer this type of high chair over the larger free standing ones Very convenient and can be taken anywhere 
5 0 WHAT A WAY TO GO If you have a baby you ve gotta have a Regalo Portable High Chair It is the most convenient item I ve seen since strollers It is very high quality in design and materials The directions are a breeze It washes easily travels easily looks nice and is just the perfect item if you are granny and live in a small apartment but want the grandbaby to eat with you often The parents love it too because they take it to restaurants to avoid using the contaminated restaurant chairs It is perfect for so many reasons Get one today You ll be glad you did 
5 0 My favorite baby item I recommend this product to all new moms without hesitation This product is awesome My baby slept for much longer using the Swaddleme I m only sad that my baby has outgrown the size large at only 15 pounds at 4 months but he seems to have lost the startle reflex which is the reason he badly needed the Swaddleme in the first place This is one of those items that is a must have and I will be buying for all baby showers I tried another brand of a similar blanket and wasn t nearly as impressed the velcro did not stay attached The microfleece is warm and washes well 
5 0 Great purchase This was a good buy for me The baby wrapper is ideal for newborns 
5 0 VERY HANDY Had a few swaddle blankets my son HATED being swaddled so this blanket worked out well for us he would fall asleep at the breast and then I could lay him down ON this blanket and wrap him up in it while he was asleep no battles and he was snug in his blanket which helped him sleep longer and better but the other blankets required wrapping and flipping under him etc which woke him or if I swaddled him while awake he would cry and fuss so this was my swaddling savior I have since bought more for my baby due sooN 
5 0 Life saver We swaddled our daughter every time she goes down to take a nap When winter came around we wanted something warmer to swaddle her in because we don t use blankets with her and we came across these They are super easy to use and the microfleece makes them warm enough for our New England winters 
4 0 Buy the gingham instead I LOVE this product It s a far better velcro swaddler than the other brands because it uses bigger patches of velcro In comparison to a blanket this is much easier to use and provides much more durable swaddles I m quite good with a blanket but by six weeks of age my son could wriggle out On the other hand at three months he s never wriggled out of the cotton flannel Swaddleme However even in cold weather the microfleece is too hot Several times I ve felt under the blanket to find my son sweaty It s even worse when we combine the swaddle with a sling On the other hand the cotton knit solid colors blankets are too stretchy my son quickly converts his knit Swaddleme into a toga leaving both arms flying free The cotton flannel gingham prints has less stretch than the other two fabrics and plenty enough cover to keep a baby warm at indoor temperatures It is trickier to find but worth the search The microfleece Swaddleme does however make a great non swaddle blanket on cold days particularly when the baby is in a front carrier The velcro is quite versatile 
5 0 A must have for every new baby Shortly after I found out I was pregnant with our 2nd child I bought a SwaddleMe on a whim I knew the benefits of swaddling a newborn from having done so with our 1st child and the SwaddleMe caught my attention with its design and overall ease of properly swaddling a baby At that time I didn t know exactly how handy this little blanket wrap would be Our baby is now 2� weeks old and this product has become one of the most important baby items we own Our daughter was fussy and just couldn t seem to settle down until I pulled out the SwaddleMe and wrapped her up in it The instant change in her personality was unreal She s now a happy and content baby and the fussy crying has all but stopped The only time she doesn t wear her SwaddleMe is during diaper and clothing changes and in her carseat any other time of the day she s snuggly wrapped up Swaddling a baby with a regular blanket can be a bit tricky but this specially shaped wrap makes it super easy The velcro tabs ensure that the baby can t accidentally loosen the wrap and unswaddle him or herself I highly recommend this wonderful blanket wrap to anyone who is expecting or has a newborn baby 
5 0 Worth Its Weight In Gold When my daughter was born I didn t know about swaddling and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep then put her in her crib and she d flail her arms wake up and cry and I had to start all over What a nightmare Then I figured out that since her arms wake her it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn t move them as much so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets It worked It became much easier to get her to sleep But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again When she was a little over a month old somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it It worked great It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it and it stayed put My daughter started sleeping so much better I wish I found those blankets sooner it would ve saved me from so many sleepless nights 2 years later my son was born and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket Out of curiosity I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket and his arms wake him right away exactly the same as my daughter I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep 
5 0 Very useful baby item Very well constucted It was a gift and the new parents loved it 
5 0 A perfect solution for travel My husband and I bought this because our baby was born right before we would be moving back to the US We are very happy with it as it makes traveling with a baby a breeze We never have to worry if the hotel we re in provides cribs or if they are safe for that matter We have had it for almost three months now using it exclusivly and the only thing wrong is a small tear in the fabric I had no trouble setting this up however I did try it out before the baby came so I wasn t exhausted at the time I don t think it would have gone the same if I was I can t imagine what we would have done without this thing 
4 0 Saved me from some sleepless nights I purchased the mini co sleeper for my first child She slept in it at our bedside until she was 6 months old I really feel that her being beside me helped us all sleep better If she woke up and was fussing I could just reach over and pat her find her pacifier etc without having to get out of bed and walk to the nursery every time Often I could comfort her before she really got good and awake upset and I could get her back to sleep faster At 6months she was getting too large for it so I transitioned her to her own crib in the nursery with no problem The only drawback is that it is not very easy to fold up for travel I had to get my husband to do it for me every time BUT I have yet to find a portable crib that is very easy to fold up we have a Pack and Play too When you do get it folded up and put into its carrying case it doesn t take up that much room Can be used as a co sleeper by the parent s bed or as a free standing bassinet Overall I have been pleased and will use it again with my next baby 
4 0 Great except for the sheet If you want to have your baby near you at night the co sleeper is great It makes getting in and out of bed a bit of a challenge but it is nice to be able to look over and see my infant daughter sleeping or to comfort her back to sleep with a little rocking with my hand if she is not ready to get up VERY easy to set up and sturdy My only complaint is the sheet it shrinks a lot in the wash gets tangled up because of the velcro and is not easy to change quickly Also replacement sheets are expensive 15 Instead I recommend using a bassinet sheet they are exactly the right size are softer and are around 5 
4 0 Great for having baby in master bedroom without taking up too much room I really like the size of this co sleeper It s perfect for having baby in our master bedroom without taking up a ton of room like a full sized crib would do Seems very stable and durable and should work until baby is about 6 months old and ready to move to her own room Only complaint would be the leg extensions which I needed because my bed is higher than average They seem a little shaky and I worry about breaking them off when I have to move the sleeper 
4 0 BundleMe Does The Trick mostly So when my son got to the toddler stage I was worried about how to keep him warm in his stroller We live in the city so travel by stroller is a way of life He loves to be outside but really dislikes being covered up you can see the source of needing this product Overall we have found this product to be very good it is machine washable it is warm for my son 16 months at the time of purchase there is room for him to grow into it a bit this winter it fits our Maclaren Quest stroller nicely and it is attractive The only downsides we have noted are that we wish it had one zipper up the middle instead of having a zipper up each side The reason for this is that we think it would be tougher for our son to get his hands out of the bag this way he is nothing short of Houdini like however in his ability to get himself out of outwear and protective items like this bag so it may not matter at all The other thing is that is does not attach to the stroller as securely as we would like it has a tendency to slide down the front and eventually usually on a rainy day the bottom of the bag drags on the ground a bit However going back to the fact that it is washable this is not a huge complaint either This may also be a function of the stroller with which you are trying to use this I would recommend this product to anyone with a squirmy toddler who loves being outside as much as my son does 
5 0 Good Quality Just received the bag The material seems very strong A reviewer on another site mentioned that the only thing missing is a cushioned shoulder strap so what I plan to do is use the removable velcro cushions that came with my daughter s infant carseat and put them on the straps so that my shoulders won t hurt Haven t used it yet but plan to take it on a plane real soon I m just happy that the booster seat is so awesome and that it folds Update didn t need the cushions because it s pretty light anyway carseat fits well it protects the seat well when you check it at the airport 
5 0 Sweet When I first saw this set I was in love The colors are really girly fun and prettty I have the the entire set from this collection and I just adore it Great for when you little bundle of joy gets older too since it is not to babyish 
4 0 Great product with only 1 complaint My only complaint about this potty topper concerns the stick in place double sided tape The peel off backing is difficult to remove from the tape with out tearing the potty topper It takes a bit of time to get off and if you have a toddler dancing around the bathroom stall doing the pee pee dance you don t have the luxury of a lot of time Also when the deed is done and it s time to remove the potty seat cover you again need to be very careful or the tape will tear off the cover and remain on the toilet seat Then you have to pick it off with your fingernail YUCK I think a post it note kind of stick in place would be much better than the double sided tape The seat cover doesn t need to stick to the seat forever just long enough for my toddler to tinkle Other than that this is great After my toddler finished I used it too and found it to be very comfy It was cushiony and provided a warm layer over a cold toilet seat I didn t have to worry about anything leaking through as it seems to be water proof It was large enough to cover the enitre seat even those large public toilet seats I will continue to use these as they do provide the layer of protection I am looking for but I will need to be extra careful with the tape until something better comes on the market 
5 0 My First Sports Bag Really cute very portable plush sports bag w various balls and the best part is it s NOT Electronic Each ball makes some sort of jingle or crinkle or boing sound but they re great for baby to just handle or chew 
4 0 Lots of fun on the go Love the boing sound in Tigger and rattle in Eeeyore Fits good and holds a sippy cup too or some snacks Great value 
5 0 Good for what it is We bought this just for travel purposes For a couple years we ve traveled extensively with our big bulky stroller and while that was great for holding carry ons it was a pain to move around So this one is fine for what we use it for quick trips to the park moving our two year old around the airport and to toss in the back of the car just in case we need it at the mall It is a rough ride and kind of squashes him on the sides he s now 31 pounds but like I said it is not our main stroller I m 5 5 and I find the handles to be at an awkward height but my 5 11 husband thinks it is fine We live in CA so being able to fold up the back for a little air circulation is handy but not used so often I would definitely recommend this if you need to save money or have need for a good quality cheap stroller 
5 0 Wrangler Jeep Umbrella Stroller We purchased this stroller to take to WDW We were pleased with this stroller We were able to easily collapse to get on and off buses it is very easy to manuever Despite it s light weight I was able to put three to four jackets one bag on the back of it without it turning over even without my three yr old in the stroller It did tip over once or twice it just took a lot more than I expected it would to tip I didn t have problems with the handles being too short I m 5 7 but my husband did 6 3 But overall the only way it could have been better would to be to have one little cup holder I ve had three different umbrella strollers and this is by far the BEST one I ve owned It s ability to maneuver through crowds and turn quickly is simply excellent For the price I would not could not have purchased a better umbrella stroller 
5 0 Love it We are both tall hubby is 6 2 and I am 5 10 and this is not a back breaker like most strollers Great ite 
5 0 2nd Guidecraft book display purchased I already bought the Noah s Ark design for this type of display we keep it in the living room I reviewed that display in more detail We purchased this one for our son s bedroom I wish the canvas came in more colors than just red but the natural wood is beautiful It was very easy to put together only took a couple of minutes It s sturdy but light weight It holds all sizes of books and can hold anywhere from 12 to 36 books depending on their size and shape The 1st Guidecraft book display help us teach our son to respect his books He took such good care of them like putting them back in the display instead of throwing them on the floor that we have been able to introduce paperbooks to our 18 month old and he doesn t try to tear them apart I think this type of book display is more practical for children s books than a traditional bookshelf due to shapes and sizes 
5 0 Not your ordinary child safety harness Very cute way to cleverly protect your child and keep them close We have a two year old and going to an amusement park with his other sibilings having to have him hold your hand yeah right not all the time He likes to be independent and loves dogs and backpacks so he feels like the older kids This helps and doesn t look like you have your kid on a leash 
5 0 the ONLY breastfeeding must have I got these when I developed cracked and bleeding nipples with my 2nd child They are the ONLY thing that helped No amount of lanolin would relieve that initial latch pain Once I started using these the pain went away It was a miracle I had to use just a couple pairs They may seem expensive but you don t have to use a new pair at each feeding like you do with other brands With my 3rd child I used these from the start and never got sore And now with my 4th I will be sure to have them on hand 
5 0 GET THESE TO HELP YOUR NIPPLES IF YOU RE IN SO MUCH PAIN THAT YOU RE CRYING or just uncomfortable A few days after I got home from the hospital I was thinking of stopping to breasfeed because my nipples were so sore and in such pain even though baby was latched on just fine These pads worked miracles Put them in the refrigerator and the apply them to your nipples right after feeding You will feel GREAT These truly saved me Now baby is 6 months old and still breasfeeding I m sooooo glad I did not stop thanks to these pads and chamomile tea applications They might be a bit pricey but VERY worth it 
5 0 Yes it IS hard to open for babies It does take a lot to get this lock open but it s literally the only thing that worked in my house for more than 24 hours Everything else was too easy to pull off 
5 0 Great bibs I ve been using these bibs for my 8 9 month old son and they work great They fit the baby well provide good coverage and are waterpfoof I like them a lot and wanted to get a second set but they are so easy to clean and dry that we just use the same set over and over 
5 0 Fits Bugaboo perfectly What else can I say Fits my Bugaboo perfectly and never fails me 
5 0 Great roof rack cup holder I don t have any stroller age kids but to avoid further loss of coffee mugs off the top of my car I started looking for a cup holder I could attach to my Yakima roof rack The Lionheart model I used for a year or more required extensive modification and it wouldn t hold insulated cups unless the handle was open at the bottom but it once carried a coffee mug safely from Bellevue to Seattle After it broke I found the Valco which attached easily and might even fit a square Thule cross bar It seems a lot tuffer and some closed handle mugs will fit Best thing is I ll be the talk of the parking lot at the ski areas 
5 0 Soft snug and pretty Looks great with the set Better than the green sheet Get 2 of these instead or try the carters tykes safari print sheets Colors are cheery and fabric is soft jersey material 
5 0 GREAT MANUAL PUMP I GOT THIS PUMP AT THE HOSPITAL AND IT WORK GREAT FOR ME I CAN PUMP MORE MILK WITH THIS ONE THAN WITH MY ELECTRIC PUMP I USED THIS ONE INSTEAD THAN MY ELECTRIC PUMP WHEN WATCHING TV IS A MANUAL PUMP SO YOU WILL GET A WORK OUT USING IT IF YOU CAN AFFORD THE ELECTRIC MEDELA PUMP THATS GREAT BUT IF YOU DON T NEED TO PUMP OFTEN THIS WORKS GREAT IS VERY EASY TO TAKE WITH YOU AND HELP IN TIMES YOU ARE ENGORGE AND THE BABY CAN T LATCH TO DRINK 
5 0 excellent sunshade I have really used this sunshade this summer If fits really well with both the single stroller and the jog stroller that I own It comes on and off easily and doesn t interfer with anything It provided both sun protection and wind protection when pulled all the way down so I ended up using it on cooler days also The SPF is also a bonus as you don t realize how much sun can be directed at the little one even with a regular shade 
5 0 Kim in TX This item is GREAT I have a 5 month old and a 3 year old I was looking for something to help protect the baby from the sun so we could still be out doing all the fun summer things with our 3 year old and this works great I have used it with my single regular stroller my umbrella stroller it has a small canopy to attach to and on the front portion of my sit n stand stroller It has worked great with all three strollers in all weather conditions and it wraps up into a small carrying case Think I am getting a double to attach to the rented theme park strollers for the rest of the summer 
5 0 Great for the occasional pumper I love this item for a baby that is only going to take an occasional bottle so mommy and daddy can have a date etc I use mine a little differently I put the liner I use the cheaper soft bags directly into the bottle Then I screw on the collar and pump adaptor I pump directly into the bottle then screw off the adaptor and screw on a lid nipple ring with a plug in it Then when the baby sitter goes to feed the baby she does not have to take off the collar and risk loosing the bag of milk She just screws off the top lid and screws on a nipple using a contrasting color nipple ring with the plug for a lid may help distinguish which part should be unscrewed This also solves that problem of having the milk raised above the readings on the bottle Only thing I don t understand is why they don t give you more of the plugs that go in the lids You wouldn t need the lids if they would just give you the plugs you could put them in the rings that go with your bottles I know this is confusing you kind of need to be looking at the pieces to understand what I m talking about For occasional bottling 1 newborn gift set and 1 breastmilk storage kit is more than enough for what I need My babies definately take to the nurser nipple easier so that is how I ended up with this system Everything washes in the dishwasher so clean up is easy 
5 0 Convenient Pumping and Storage I wish more people knew about this storage system It is so convenient pump straight into the liners twist on the caps and store in the fridge or freezer Once the milk has frozen pop off the caps pop out the liners and store them in freezer bags When needed just pop a liner back into a nurser and it s ready to go The bottles heat quickly and easily in hot water It s so easy to clean the pieces just soak in hot soapy water for a minute and rinse I bought 4 or 5 storage systems I can bring 4 caps to work send 4 bottles to daycare and have several bottles stored in the fridge or freezer My son almost 5 months old has had no problems bottle feeding with the Playtex nursers and the NaturaLatch slow flow nipples Highly recommend 
5 0 A registry must for breastfeeding moms I absolutely love this storage system After showing it to one of my girlfriends she replaced everything she used for baby 1 with Playtex and used the Playtex system for baby 2 It is a very clean and simple system and minimizes the risk of contamination since you do not have to transfer milk from one storage device to another It worked perfectly with my Medela Pump in Style you use the same bag for pumping storing and feeding I have a deep freeze chest freezer and used this for storage I followed the manufacturer s suggestion to double bag for freezing I never had any problems If you want to see how much your baby is eating with clean hands simply lift the bag out of the ring and drop it directly into the bottle shell the ring is heavy duty enough that it lifts out easily Remember when you are breastfeeding baby directly from the breast you don t see how much baby is getting Dr Sears says A baby who is getting a sufficient volume of milk will usually have at least 6 8 wet cloth diapers 4 6 disposable diapers per day after the initial three days of start up time Enough wet diapers tell you that your baby is safe from dehydration Everyone has different preferences but I honestly can t see how anyone could be dissapointed with this storage kit I only purchased two kits because most of the time I fed directly from the breast and eventually dd wouldn t take a bottle but for moms who plan to return to work I would recommend more kits I really only used my kits in the beginning when I was pumping a lot because I had so much milk 
5 0 Perfect for storage Works perfectily withthe embrace double breast pump We were in need of storing milk and getting alot of it stored when my wife went back to work Now I can just go to the fridge and take out a bottle and warm it up and ready to go Also helps out alot when we started taking our son to the babysitters 
5 0 Completely Pleased I bought this product thinking that it would work well with the other playtex bottles nipples etc that I already have It seems to be working out great I can pump using my Medela pump right into the storage receptacles and then put them right into the fridge If I m on the run one afternoon I grab one and go It s so easy and even the cleaning is easy Only a couple things to wash and you re done That means a lot to me when you re constantly cleaning other things around the house I m one very happy customer 
5 0 Great booster seat I really like this booster seat The cushioning is soft and comfortable for my son I also like the head rest Some reviews I read talked about how the head rest acted like blinders for their children My son doesn t mind them at all and they keep his head stable when he sleeps which I love 
5 0 Crash tested We purchased Britax Bodyguards for our children when they first came out because they were the first booster to provide side impact protection for their heads just like the more current Parkway model I had the same complaints as others at first about the seats impeding the kids views but they quickly grew accustomed to the seats and I loved that their heads were well supported when they fell asleep on long trips Last week my daughter and I were in a car accident where we were blindsided from the right Thanks to those wings around her head she doesn t seem to have suffered any injuries from what was a serious collision I bought new Parkways for each of the kids the day after the accident as I wouldn t want my kids to ride in any other booster seat 
4 0 not quite perfect This seat is a wonderful transition from our daughter s Roundabout The reasons why I could not give it 5 stars are the following poorly designed cup holders an early tear in the fabric no secure anchoring Cup holders we ve already spilled juice that s been left in the cup holders They are completely useless and should have been better designed Fabric though the material looks resilient a tear has developed near the lower left corner where her leg sits I am assuming that this is because the chair is mounted behind the driver s seat and therefore it gets a lot of traffic as our daughter boards and disembarks the car nonetheless we expected something a little more durable Anchors the seat wobbles around and doesn t really hold our daughter in place She is often reaching over to pick something up and the seat nearly topples over I am not sure why this wasn t considered in the design It makes it easy to remove and install but I d rather have something a little more stable 
5 0 More Than Pleased I bought this for my 4 year old daugher i liked the safety review for this seat my daughter loves everything about it I don t have one bad thing to say about this seat i ve had it for about 3 months and it looks like it did when i pulled it from the box she has spilled everything you could think of on it and you can t tell it even still smells new the cushion is just as good as the first day she used it i will buy another for my 18 month old daughter when she is big enough 
4 0 I liked it The seat worked great We bought the seat because we could not stand the way my 3 yearolds head would hang when she went to sleep in the car This seat offers support for sleeping children However the same neck support prevents them from looking side to side with ease kind of like blinders 
5 0 Best Booster I tried a few boosters before settling on the Britax Parkway First we tried the Jupiter booster My daughter is a tiny girl 5yrs old 36 lbs 43 inches tall She was way too tiny for the Jupiter The shoulder belt kept sliding off her shoulder and her head wasn t supported when she slept in the car Another thing i didn t like about the Jupiter was that the padding under her bottom felt too thin and she complained her bottom hurt after long car rides Then we tried the Graco It is a good seat But no head support unless you lay the seat back a ways I didn t like the plastic seat belt guides because it hurt my daughter s cheek sleeping on it Next we tried the Parkway Britax This booster is by far the best booster on the market in my opinion I am a huge Britax fan All my kids have been britax babies My 3 year old and 4 month old currently sit in the Marathon britax This booster has enough padding to keep the kids comfortable the head rests keep their heads from flopping My daughter likes the way the fabric feels she is very sensitive Even though the Graco booster seat looks like the Parkway and the Graco is 50 less than the Parkway I still didn t like the fact that the red seat belt guides on the Graco looked like they would hurt to rest my head on Britax thought of everything with this seat I HIGHLY recommend this seat Fork over the extra cash and splurge on your child s safety You ll be glad you did 
4 0 Great Highchair My wife and I are very happy with this highchair The adjustable height works well as well as the reclining positions for the back of the seat It folds up to be relatively thin for storage and the wheels are a nice touch Unfortunately the entire tray assembly while great in its ability to chose how close or far it is from the baby requires two hands to remove or adjust Thankfully the 5 point harness will keep even the squirmiest of babies safely in place while you use those two hands to take care of the tray It would have been nice to have a few more themed toys or gadgets The tiger teething ring is nice attaches to the tray so it won t fall on the floor but most other Fisher Price high chairs in this price range come with a LOT MORE for the baby to do And that s our only hangup Otherwise this is a good value 
5 0 Perfect Crib I purchased this crib because of its price and the colour I was nervous about buying without seeing a model one first My husband put it together in a couple of hours with no major drama My daughter has used it since she was 6 weeks old she is now 14 months I love it it is sturdy and beautiful the drawer underneath has valuable storage we are in NYC it was easy for me to lower as my daughter grew I think it is practical that it can be converted into a bed 
5 0 Good quality and price I was a little worried when ordering this crib because several people said they had problems with shipping and they said they never received the product I didnt have any problems with the shipping I received the crib withing the number of day s stated when I ordered 7 14 days We had no trouble putting the crib together I would suggest having two people put it together just because it is easier if one person can hold parts of the crib while the other person screws it together It looks very nice I have no complaints 
4 0 economical and worth it I shopped for months to find a 3 in 1 that was of good quality but wasnt to pricey We just moved our 7 month old son from our bed to this crib He transitioned nicely It arrived 1 day later than projected It was fairly easy to put it together I did it by myself my hubby is mechanically challenged I did break a plastic piece as I assembled it The company sent a replacement free of charge I received the replacement in 4 days The only thing I could complain about is the latching system it works fine but I feel they could do a better design 
5 0 I ll never buy another brand My son was born premature I breastfed for as long as I could but after he was diagnosed with severe acid reflux I needed to find a bottle He needed cereal in every bottle to thicken it along with medications for pain and to help move it along his digestive track First I tried the playtex bottles with disposable liners The amount of gas and spit up was still quite a lot and I still had a unhappy baby Then my doctor told me about Dr Brown s bottles They are a bit more expensive then others but WORTH EVERY DIME The clean up is fine too if you just throw all the pieces together in a nipple basket in the dishwasher I will never use another bottle with my future children ever again I am so happy I found these My son was like a different baby from the FIRST time he used these bottles The gas was GONE the spit up was decreased by well over half the previous amount I tell every mother and soon to be mother I run into about Dr Brown s bottles I ll never buy another brand 
5 0 Best bottles EVER My baby boy hates to eat At 7 months old he was only taking at the most 4 oz of milk per feeding We tried all kinds of nipples and bottles I picked up these bottles and right when i got home he ate 8 oz in one feeding Since then he still doesn t like to eat but at least we get some milk in his little belly 
5 0 Best bottle in the world When my baby was 2wks old she developed excessive gas and was very cranky she would not allow me to put her down at all I bought a 2oz Dr Brown bottle and fed her that night She has not suffered with excessive gas since and is a much happier baby I truly recommend Dr Brown bottles 
5 0 Get the 8oz bottles only I initially tried the Avent wide neck bottles for my newborn and didn t like them Those bottles leaked the nipples gave my son suction blisters on his lips he needed extensive burping I didn t find the graduations on the bottles to correlate with any other measures at home and my son seemed to have a hard time getting a hang of how to suck against the negative pressure that builds up in the Avent bottles Dr Browns bottles solved all these issues I am extremely happy with them You need to get used to washing the small parts but once you have a routine going it s well worth the effort It takes me under 20 minutes to wash six bottles I prefer not to use the dishwasher The small brush which comes in the starter kit and the multi pack varieties is essential for cleaning and lasts for about 6 8 weeks of regular use I recommend going straight for the 8oz bottles and buy the 9 pack which is available at other websites When warming these bottles if you find the fluid going up into the vent just loosen the collar the column of liquid goes back down and tighten again If breastmilk is stored in these bottles in the fridge the fat content does tend to stick to the plastic of the vent You will receive Level 1 nipples with the starter kit multi packs however you may want to graduate to Level 2 at 3 months of age Level 2 at 6 months of age and the Y cut nipples for any thick liquids e g milk with cereal The caps snap on loudly which is the only con I can think of Use the travel disc to avoid leakage when transporting milk My friend s babies with refulx did well on these bottles My son doesn t have reflux but I can t imagine using any other bottle for him Highly recommend them and would definitely buy agai 
5 0 Best bottle on the market for premies My son was born nine weeks early and had trouble when the NICU started bottle feeding him The hospital bottles either fed too fast or required too much sucking for him Once we got him home we bought every bottle we could find to try Dr Brown s was the third one we tried and it worked fantastic for him The nipples fed him slow but did not require too much effort for him Once we started him on this bottle he started eating exactly as he should and has not had a problem since We also had to use Nutramigen formula which also helped with gas and reflux but for us it was the nipple and the ease of use for him The downside for us was that they don t fit well in our dishwasher so we hand wash all of them When we go out we put dry formula in each bottle and carry bottled water with us When we need to mix a bottle we take out the inside pieces put the cap on and screw the neck and nipple back on shake it well and replace the inside and we have no problem with shaking just take out the inside piece 
5 0 Great Bottles My son was born seven weeks early and was bottle fed in the NICU When he came home we had a few frustrating days trying to find a bottle he liked These bottles are great They are the only ones I could find that offered a preemie nipple The other bottles drowned him but these were just right 
4 0 Worth trying Our baby had some problems with gas when she was very small even though she was nursing When she took a bottle we started using these and we did notice a difference I can imagine that they re not quite as convenient when mixing formula since it says all over the instructions not to shake liquid in the bottles 
5 0 Best bottles every once you learn the tricks I love these bottles and have been using them for my twin girls since week 2 of their lives week 1 was spent fighting with the wide necked version of this bottle Once we figured out how to prevent all leaks these bottles are amazing and speed up feeding time since baby can drink continuously HELPFUL HINT for all Dr Brown bottles When pulling nipple thru the collar everytime run your finger around the base of the nipple inside the plastic collar to make sure it is fully seated before screwing nipple and collar on to the bottle Eliminates leaks completely And do NOT over tighten collar onto bottle Again will prevent leaks We learned all of these tricks the hard way Mother of twin girls from Texa 
5 0 A life saver Children have been seriously injured or killed by televisions falling on them This product is a great idea as long as it s secured to a stand or shelf that can t move This one s definitely worth the to keep your child ren safe 
5 0 Be careful with fans My monitor is excellent as the others reviewed but be careful with ceiling fans When my fan is on the sensor is detecting movement when it shouldn t baby is not in crib If you have the fan on the movement detection is inaccurate Be sure to test this under all circumstances when you have something in the room on that vibrates moves etc 
5 0 Totally worth it I absolutely love this monitor If I were to recommend only one baby item it would be this In 2 5 months the monitor has gone off twice I have no idea if they were false alarms or not because by the time I sprinted to her crib she had already been startled out of her deep sleep by the beeping of the monitor which I like Even though she was a healthy full term baby with a 9 on both her Apgars in a non smoker household and the risk for SIDS is low for her I have a great peace of mind knowing her breathing is monitored at all times 
5 0 Perfect Sleep all through the night Both my babies slept through after three weeks and I found myself sitting next to them half the night checking their breathing So I got the angelcare and only checked for one night found that it worked it is easily tested by taking the baby out the alarm goes off after 10 secs and had peaceful nights ever after Happy to recommend it to everybody 
5 0 Peace of mind We received this monitor off our registry For a long time we never used the sensor pad We felt we didnt need it A few weeks ago our daughter started rolling onto her stomach in the middle of the night unbeknownst to us We would turn her only to find her moments later or even hours later on her stomach We finally let her sleep on her tummy becuase it was obvious that was where she wanted to be So the pressure pad is so sensitive that it picks up a 3 month old s breathing we have only had a few false alarms but that was becuase she was way over in the corner of the crib Hope that helps 
5 0 worth the money We splurged a little to get this monitor but we are very happy we did so I sleep much better at night knowing that my baby s breathing is being monitored The instructions indicate the sensor pad should be placed under the mattress directly under your baby with no bedding or padding in between However I ve found the sensor will work even through a mattress bedding and a one inch thick sleep positioner It s SUPER SENSITIVE which is GREAT One thing to keep in mind You should not have a ceiling fan on at night or have a strong draft in the room such as an AC vent blowing directly onto your baby s crib The unit will pick up air movement in the room I highly recommend this product I would not be resting at night as peacefully as I am without it 
5 0 peace of mind This monitor gives us such peace of mind when our son is sleeping So many of our friends have the video monitors but even though you can see your baby how can you tell they are breathing As far as false alarms we only had one and it was because he wiggled off of the pad We would recommend this monitor to anyone with children 
5 0 No baby should be without this My youngest could NOT sleep without this sleepsack We bought the very biggest ones available XL so she wouldn t outgrow them and she used them most of her first year A fantastic shower gift too 
5 0 Wish I Had Invented This How many times a night do you go into your baby s room to make sure the covers are still on them Yeah well you can stop doing that now Just buy this The sack zips in the opposite direction so as not to catch on baby s skin I must have washed this thing a trillion times and it held up wonderfully Just put your baby in his her pajamas and zip them up in the Halo Sleep Sack It doesn t look like much but it certainly keeps them warm I must have pointed and laughed at my daughter for a good five minutes when I put her in this for the first time It looks pretty comical on but in a cute way She also had plenty of room to move her legs and feet around kind of like a mini sleeping bag that stays put I highly recommend this and it makes an excellent baby shower gift 
5 0 A must have for infants This has been a great help for our infant daughter She s been in sleepsacks since practically birth She stays warm and snug and can t kick it off We only use it at night so when it goes on she knows it s bed time It s part of the routine now Highly recommended 
5 0 We love these for our Triplets These are great Our triplet girls have been wearing these sleepsacks for bedtime and naps since we brought them home from the hospital They were so easy for sleepy parents to use during midnight diaper changes We have gone through the newborn and small size and are about to buy the next size up because they work so well We also don t have the constant worry about SIDS issues like we would with blankets We highly recommend these for any new parent 
5 0 all sizes are available All sizes of the SleepSack are available at BabiesRus com You should also try the new SleepSack swaddle if you want to swaddle your baby easily It turns into a regular SleepSack when swaddling is no longer needed wanted 
5 0 Fabulous even at midnight The Halo sleepsacks are great The best part is that it zips from the bottom I thought this was weird at first until I needed to change her You just unzip to her stomach change the diaper and the zip back down we had a few of the cheaper sacks and they zip from the top which always wakes our little girl up It s totally worth spending a little extra money for these 
4 0 Does the job It really works baby s fingers and toes used to be cold It s a little nerdy and it smelled when we got it But it keeps her little toes warm and it s such a relief to know that baby is safe 
5 0 GOOD FOR BABIES AND OLDER TO MAKE SURE THEY KEEP COVERED WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE TO TRY OUT B C OUR BABY WOULD KICK THE COVERS OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND WE LOVE FOR THE HOUSE TO BE COLD I WAS WORRIED B C WHEN I WENT TO CHECK ON THE BABY HE WAS ALWAYS FREEZING COLD SO I WENT TO BABIES R US AND FOUND THIS YOU CAN T BEAT IT EVERYONE NEEDS AT LEAST 2 OR 3 OF THESE LITTLE OUTFITS WE EVEN BOUGHT IT BIG SO HE WOULDN T OUTGROW IT SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET AT LEAST ONE 
5 0 Helps baby sleep all night I bought this sleepsack for my 4 month old daughter and she totally loves it She sleeps all night now where as before she d wake up at like 5 am She gets cold easily so I still put a light blanket over her even though she s in the sleepsack plus it gives her that added security and me some peace of mind knowing she s not buried under a pile of blankets But I got mine at Marshalls for 13 00 sure beats paying almost 20 00 
4 0 Best I ve seen Looks good seems comfortable They re light and don t take up much space I bought two My kids love them over the big toddler seats they were in before 
5 0 Nice Booster This is a wonderful backless booster seat Much more plush than most you find for sale Light weight comfy and nice fun color My daughter loves it 
5 0 Excellent Product Avent nipples have been wonderful for my baby I did not experience nipple confusion when I started my son on bottles and I am still breastfeeding I am very happy with there products and would recommend them to everyone 
5 0 like the breast This is an excellent nipple that mimics the breast when brest feeding is not feasible 
5 0 Awsome jumper I love this jumper I first used it at Grandma s house and I was amazed at how long it entertained my then 4month old for So when I got home a week later I ordered a different one from toys r us It had all of the gizmos and gadgets and I just knew she would love it But she couldn t even jump in it because of the placement of the leg holes in the seat So I returned it and bought the Graco jumper like Grandma The bumper around the seat is a must have Along with the tray where we put toys and soon snacks She was soo happy to jump again she wouldn t let my take her out for 45 minutes 
5 0 Still using it at 15 months We bought this for our son last year for Christmas when he was 3 1 2 months old He liked it but we had to stuff blankets in to help him sit up We bought this over an exersaucer because we did not have room to store anything large He has really liked it He is now 15 months old and walking but still likes to jump in it I put him there when I am cleaning and he has a great time 
4 0 Baby girl loves this jumper Well she does She jumps like a rabbit I put a mirror in front of her so she can see herself She get a huge kick out of this They should get this item back in stock 
5 0 The best solution for breastfeeding in public I love thi sling for many reasons but the top three are the following 1 my baby calms down right away when she s carried in it 2 she doesn t get scared of strangers when we visit new people or go to a party she s in the middle of the stranger anxiety phase 3 Most of all it helps nursing really discretely in public without ovrheating my baby Before Itried to use all kinds of blankets and scarves but my baby was getting so swaty and hot instead the fabric of maya wraps is very breathable and my baby remains at a comfortable temperature even in Texas 
5 0 PERFECT daddy bag Both my husband and I love the sling bag He enjoys not having to carry our big pink bag too girly for him Fits EVERYTHING we need So many compartments and very comfortable Keeps hands free and not having to keep a big bag on your shoulder I love it so easy for those short quick busy trips ALL MY FRIENDS LOVED IT One friend wanted one for her twins that much room Another friend said it would be perfect for her upcoming plane trip A third friend said it would be a perfect Father s Day gift 
5 0 Stylish and Functional I ve had the Essentials bag for about a week now and I absolutely love it I had a small size Eddie Bauer diaper bag and it would constantly slip off my shoulder when I was carrying the infant carrier which made things more difficult Not only is this bag stylish its functional as well My baby is almost 6 weeks old and I can still carry all the major necessities that fit in my other diaper bag If you get the black gray model Dad can use it also This is what I currently carry in the bag Bottle Holder 1 4 oz Dr Brown bottle can definitely fit larger bottles in the future Large Top Compartment 3 diapers baby wipes case and small bottles of hand sanitizer and baby powder disposable changing pad Middle Compartment 2 4 oz Dr Browns bottles and a formula dispenser Bottom Compartment Extra Sleeper and Shirt my wallet and keys Small Velcro Compartment on Strap loose coins Cell Phone Compartment my cell phone of course Small Zipper Compartment Chapstick and Lipstick there is also a nifty pen holder next to this compartmen 
5 0 This is the Bag to get This is the bag I have been looking for Great for my 9 month old I have had the pretty Petuina Pickle Bottom bag the baby Bjorn diaper bag and the baby sherpa bag and I have to say none of them functioned for me For other moms I am sure those bags worked great for them but this tiny compact bag is the greatest I wish I had this bag when my son was first born Although it looks small it holds everything And it gives you a chance to have your hands free without even feeling like you are wearing a bag I am in love with this bag It is so nice to go out and not feel like I am moving in With my other bags they were so big and bulky and with this one it is like I don t even have it Again it is a must have for all moms If you get the Black and Gray it is great for the dad s as well 
5 0 The Essentials Bag I ordered the essentials bag after struggling with a bulky regular diaper bag and my newborn The essentials bag fits a blanket for laying the baby on to change a new outfit at least two diapers a wipes case three 6 oz bottles a formula dispenser my wallet keys pacifer burp cloth and cell phone Everything has it ones compartment which makes finding everything easy no digging around in the middle of a big bag and due to the design it feels much lighter than a larger bag I have not had issues with the seams coming apart either I also recommend the Bundle Me by JJ Cole it makes winter travel with babies so much easier than a snow suit 
4 0 So far so good Every since I found out I was pregnant I ve been dreading the purchase of a diaper bag According to my friends I carry a ridiculously small purse for a mom I have a 12 y o already it s really just a cell phone holder with one pocket with slots for cards and another zippered pocket for cash I knew those days were over once my new baby arrives after all her big sis was 3 before I stepped out of the house without a huge diaper bag But at the same time if my memory serves me well a bulky bag made hauling around baby and her other gear etc on a daily basis even harder So I was thrilled when I saw this bag It came in the mail today from another merchant and like another poster I ve been trying it out It fit a decent amount of the gear I expect to carry in it a few diapers change of baby clothing etc And so far it feels very comfortable Even when worn in tandem with the PreMaxx New Edition baby carrier I also bought I will post again once the baby arrives to give an update on this product 
5 0 great bag Love this bag and so does my girlfriend who wanted to steal mine at first It fits most of the essentials to go out for the day to the mall or to run errands It even fits my wideneck bottles and wallet There is not enough room for change of clothes changing pad or toys but that s what the bottom of the stroller is for It is very comfortable to wear even over a jacket and does not hurt your back to carry it And it s never in the way of maneuvering your way through the aisles 
5 0 Great bag for quick trips For the size and shape this bag holds more than you would think I also love that your hands are free when you wear it and that your cell phone is easily accessible We bought it for our first plane trip with our 3 month old and have used it back home more than our other bags My only complaint is that there isn t a pocket big enough to hold a fold up changing pad but I can fit in the disposable ones 
5 0 Very Handy This Bag will hold about five diapers It is also male friendly as it does not look like a traditional diaper bag This one is good for short trips 
5 0 Very Well Made Mommy and baby enjoy this purchase very much It is very well made good materials and the stitching and sewing will make the blaket very durable for a lon long time The colors are bright and cheerful 
5 0 Cuter than on the internet I got this comforter for my babyshower When i registered for it i thought it was kinda cute but when it came I really fell in love wtih it The colors the feel just darling 60 br 62 I recommend this set for everyone who is looking for a neutral set with wonderful colors 60 br 62 
5 0 GREAT COLORS I ordered the Safari comforter dust ruffle sheets yellow and green rugs fleece blankets with animals in the corners and bumper pads for my boys room and it is all so cute It is restful and fun at the same time I love that you can order only the parts the you need Only one of my boys needed bumper pads but both needed everything else I had a hard time finding a place where I could get a comforter and dust ruffle without the bumper pads I prefer the yellow sheets over the lime green We have lots of guests and everyone comments on how cute the boys room is but even better is that the boys love it 
5 0 Also nice for nursery wall hanging Overall I ve been very impressed so far with this nursery collection Specifically I like the quality of the quilting work done which to be honest I wasn t expecting after just viewing the web picture Since we live in a warm climate I decided to use the comforter as a wall hanging above the crib It looks very lovely brightens up the room and shows off all the embroidery on the comforter Anyway whether you use this quilt as a blanket or art I think you get your money s worth 
5 0 So bright and cheerful I have bought the crib dust ruffle and mobile so far and plan to buy several other pieces This set is so cute Our nursery is a Noah s Ark theme and this set is perfect The quality is great I have seen similar sets elsewhere for a LOT more money If you are thinking about purchasing this I say Go for it I am known for being picky about getting the best for my money and I am not at all dissappointed with these pieces 
5 0 Highly recommend I decorated my entire nursery with this theme and am so pleased I could not have found a better set than this one I highly recommend this set to everyone 
5 0 VERY VERY happpy I am extremely happy with this product I am disappointed that the line is disappearing off the internet fast though when I first ordered this there was a diaper keeper which I planned on getting if I liked the pattern but it isn t available now I highly recommend this blanket and the entire collection 
5 0 Safari bedding I ordered this pattern for a friend of mine who is having a baby shower the end of september I had no problem receiving my merchandise and I love the quality and the colors of this item I bought her the comforter the bed ruffle and the bumper and target was right on target delivering it to my home This is the first time I have ordered oline from target and I am very happy with the shipping of my 3 items that came all at the same time within 3 days and the quality of this item Thank you target Sincerely ROBIN C 
5 0 What a Find I love this set I looked high and low for neutral bright nursery bedding and decor and was prepared to spend a lot more money on a set when I stumbled across this in the store The actual store didn t stock very much of this but I was able to complete the set on line and I received it all within 2 days or placing my order I have the quilt mobile hamper bedskirt bumper light plate wall hangings valance crib sheet and lamp shade The quality seems to be excellent and it s so cute I can t wait to put the entire nursery together with these great decorations 
5 0 Great Carrier We bought this carrier after owning an older one that has started to look quite ugly I must say this company thought of everything There is a place for my cell phone right on the shoulder straps and the padding for the parent in the shoulder and back area is superb I never thought I would use a canopy on this type of product but I have and it is a great feature to keep your little one dry Great job Chicc 
5 0 Very Practical I m a first time mom so before my daughter was born I buy a bassinet but babies grows so fast and start roll over that in 1 month it no longer fit I buy this and I think that is great Low Price practical you can leave anywhere and very comfortable I LOVE IT 
5 0 Great Bibs Excellent Bibs They cover a large area the velcro lasts forever unlike others we ve used the pouch at the bottom is great and saves many a spill 
5 0 The Best The best bibs Pricey yes but worth it Cute patterns too 
5 0 Great bibs We love these bibs They wash up easily and fold up really small for easy packing They re soft light and totally water proof 
5 0 fantastic for keeping in the trunk of the car This potty is perfect for keeping in the trunk of the car for emergencies on the go The lid closes so it fits into the trunk with no problem and you can throw a package of wipes into it to have handy Put a 2 5 gallon Hefty zip close bag over the removable pot so the child can urinate right into the bag then you can zip up the bag and toss it Easy and clean There is also room to fold up 5 or 6 more bags and store them under the cover I never go ANYWHERE without this potty for my son The pee guard does fall off easily but you don t really need it and I threw it away once my son could aim downward into the bowl 
5 0 Very Happy With This Potty I used this potty for my daughter and had no problems She loved going on it As with all potty training everyone has different experiences and always will For us this potty was just fine No bells and whistles which was great because my daughter had the Royal Potty and instead of concentrating on the concept she was too busy playing with the sounds This is a basic potty and it worked perfect for us We also placed it right next to a basket of books Good Luck 
5 0 The next best thing When my daughter was born I planned to strictly breasfeed her for the first month at least However complications from jaudice forced us to introduce the bottle on her 5th day of life The Avent system with the Newborn Nipple allowed us to provide her with both expressed breastmilk and formula supplements with ease Since then I ve tried other bottles amp nipples Nothing compares to the gentle flow of the Avent Nipple which feeds her at just the right pace to avoid gas and spitting up later We now use nothing but 
4 0 great at 6 months not for newborn When my baby was a newborn I felt I didn t have enough control to safely carry her in this sling It just seemed uncomfortable for her head it s not like the picture of the very THIN woman with newborn they must have proped the baby s head up to take that picture I felt like she was getting lost in the folds HOWEVER now she s 6 months and I can wear her on my hip The New Native sling is awesome it s simple the material is very nice and soft I can take it on and off easily and most important she is totally comfy secure and entertained watching my every move 
5 0 Great Seat very comfy I bought a cheap carseat I got it home and could feel the plastic where the baby s butt would be It was horribly uncomfortable I went shopping around and come across the Comfort Sport It s so comfortable and has tons of padding The cover is a snap to get off and on to clean The seat is plenty big for my child The straps are easy to use It s used in the middle of my Ford Explorer and my boys have plenty of room with it between them I think this is a good seat for the price The cheap carseats are just not worth it I want my child to be comfortable and safe It was easy to install I highly recommend it 
5 0 Great Value Super Comfy When buying a convertable car seat for our daughter we were looking for one that was not only safe and easy to install but also would be extra comfortable Both mine and my husbands families live a day s drive away and we wanted a car seat that would be extra soft and comfortable This one has turned out to be wonderful Very easy to install has the 5 point harness which is the safest way to strap a baby in and the padding is thick and cozy Very simple to turn it from rear facing to forward facing I ve noticed that I cannot loosen the straps unless I completely take it out of the car and I m going to have to get the manual to figure it out but I m sure I ll get it Side note I also took this as a checked item on a flight and the car seat made it without a scratch 
5 0 perfectly pink I love this car seat It was a present from my sister and mom My baby is almost three months old and we have had no trouble at all out of this seat and the directions that we got with it are so easy to understand The only complaint I can think of is that even with the pink carseat pink blanket and pink outfit our baby will be wearing they still ask Girl or boy 
5 0 LOVE IT I love this seat Its light easy to use and its PINK Have you looked for a girlly carseat Its hard to find one that looks ok for a girl Can t believe I found a PINK one I hated using the seat without the base for my other kids 4 So I purchased the extra base before I even new I needed it 
4 0 pretty good This is a pretty good chair Over all I m happy with it though I do not like the handle my daughter is now 16pounds and it isnt easy to carry her with it But for the most part she likes the seat its a pretty pink it fits well in the car and I m 99 satisfie 
5 0 It s been around forever I bought this potty for my kids over 20 years ago and bought it again for my grandson I must agree the plastic is not as heavy duty as it was 20 years ago but it works just as great It is easy for the child to place on the toilet by themselves Encourages independence The handles are well placed for them to turn around The step is adjustable to give your little boy the opportunity to stand and go I think this product is fantastic 
4 0 Item is great but parts missing We really like the potty trainer but the rubber feet inserts were missin 
4 0 My Son really likes it but steps could be longer I think this item is very good The only problem we are having is the steps could be just a bit longer to fit our toilet better When he goes to set down the steps come up off the floor and it gets a bit wobbly But he really likes the idea of climbing a ladder and using the potty big toilet himself Potty training must be one of the most challenging things to teach a child every little thing that can make it a bit easier is great The only thing with the steps is they really need to take off their pants shorts before stepping up They can not step up and get turned around with them pulled down and the steps are not secure enough to pull down their pants once they are up there at least my son can not do that yet without feeling like he will fall But if it gets him more willing to use the potty this item is doing its job IMO 
5 0 Great bouncer My son loves this bouncer and so do I The bright colored spiders slowly and slightly move up and down and are just the right size and colors to keep his attention and keep him busy talking singing with them The toy bar is perfectly positioned for the baby to kick and or grab the toys and it is removable for easy in and out with the baby The music is quite pleasant so I usually keep it running all the while it is keeping my baby busy This bouncer definitely does me the favor of allowing me to get things done while keeping my baby happy I highly recommend this product 
5 0 Fits on all narrow neck baby bottles These fit on all baby bottles that are not wide neck so I bought a couple packs to have extra lids for breast milk storage formula mixing and travel These work so much better than the two piece lids to prevent leaks And my Medela bottle lids cracked so I used these as a replacement None of these sturdy lids have cracked 
4 0 electronic catch phrase Having played the non electronic version this upgrade does help game play move more smoothly There are a few drawbacks however It s easy to accidently reset the game by pressing the wrong button and since teams are designated 1 and 2 on the controller AND the controller travels around the room it s easy to get confused and give points to the other team by mistake This happens a lot especially if you re playing with a group who has not played recently or are not familiar with the game The fact that there are no multiple parts is a big plus This is a very good group word game once everyone gets into the groove 
5 0 Buy lots of batteries you ll play this a lot I plowed relentlessly thru virtually all of the cards in the original set We even considered making our own playing cards so satisfying is the game So we were all thrilled to discover that there was an electronic version Catch Phrase is fast paced easy to learn and play and the game setup with discrete categories while not to my personal liking offers a bit of variation The only glytch is the scoring feature which does not allow for mistakes but this is a small quirk 
5 0 MOST EXCELLENT GAME This game is extremely fun I have played it with multiple groups of different people and the game is requested every time In fact the worst thing about this game is that it is addictive People who are wanting to head home for the party early find themselves staying for just one more round over and over I have also played the non electronic catch phrase and it is fun as well It s also cheaper Either way this game rocks It is along the same lines as Taboo just more fun I highly recommend this game 
5 0 Love this Product A lifesaver We recently used this with my 26 month old son on his Britax Marathon It was so simple With my husband s help we were able to attach it to the carry on while my son remained sleeping in his seat My son is a real busy body and hates strollers so I worried that he would not want to sit in it during our layover after being stuck in a plane for 4 hours but he loved it He actually couldn t wait to sit in it and be wheeled through the airport Once we got to our final destination he actually threw a fit because we would not take the seat out of the car and wheel him inside the house 
5 0 Great invention I was quite skeptical when this small strap arrived in the mail because it looked so simple But it worked very well and was a real life saver It was affordable and easy to use I recently traveled alone with my 13 month old and didn t want to bring my stroller I simply used the Traveling Toddler to attach our Britax Marathon car seat to my carry on suitcase It allowed me to wheel my son through the airport by myself while carrying all of the stuff I needed to carry I had a backpack as a diaper bag and I was good to go So simple I even had a hand free I couldn t believe it A flight attendant helped with the seat once I was on the plane The only drawback was going through security and having to un do and then re do everything But once you have the straps adjusted to the right tightness it s easy to put back on without having to readjust the straps 
4 0 Life saver This product is really wonderful when traveling by airplane It just hooks to your carry on luggage on wheels and the child sits right in it as you stroll through the airport So many people made comments about it as I walked through airports while traveling They thought it was the neatest thing I was 6 months pregnant when I first used it and it was great to not have to lug a big stroller around and I had less things to take with me I gave it 4 stars only because it does take a short time to hook unhook it every time you get on or off the plane I had to pull to the side and keep my daughter with me while I hooked the seat back on to the luggage But other then that it is one piece of nylon and not a huge stroller and I will take that anyday 
5 0 Awesome Deal I traveled this summer with my 18 month old I planned to take our car seat since we were renting a car when we landed I had a layover each way so I was looking for a way to move him through the airport with little fuss since airlines have strict stroller policies So I found the Traveling Toddler and thought I would try it It was awesome and so affordable It was easy to use even when I had to unhook it for security and when boarding the plane My toddler who was nearly 30lbs at the time loved riding through the airport and loved the security of sitting in his car seat Make sure your luggage has a locking extension handle so that you can push or pull your toddler A great product I have recommended it to many 
5 0 Love it love it love it We purchased this to travel over the summer and it is great I researched many options and not only was this the most economical it was the easiest and most efficient It is very easy and quick to use and very small to store when not in use Plus my daughter loved it because it allowed her to travel in her own seat where she is very comfortable Not only did we love it I had three different people stop me in DFW and Denver international airports asking where I got it because they wanted one too 
5 0 Great Car Seat We have one Eddie Bower seat and this Britax Roundabout It was well worth the extra cost for the Roundabout We knew Britax Car Seats got great ratings but we wish someone had told us how much better they are than the other seats It s a huge difference We re considering throwing out the other car seat and getting a second Roundabout Bottom line it s easy to use and super comfortable for our son 
5 0 Britax does it again awesome product well worth the money The only car seat I will ever buy again Comfortable attractive and withstands wear and tear of kids 
5 0 Worth Every Penny This carseat is the absolute best I purchased this seat when my daughter outgrew her infant seat and my only regret is that I didn t buy this seat from the very beginning It is comfortable and easy to use I looked at other Britax models but didn t find those as easy to use Do yourself a favor and invest in this seat 
5 0 You pay for what you get I bought this car seat for my daughter when she was 4 months old She is now 2 years old and it is still in perfect condition The straps NEVER get tangled It is also so easy to adjust the straps Everything about this car seat is amazing My mother in law has a Cosco and I HATE it Spend the extra money it is worth it 
5 0 Feel very secure with this seat after debating about spending the on this seat i purchased this and 2 others to try in our small SUV we have a land rover freelander the others were bulky and harder to install this was by far the best of the 3 i bought i returned the other 2 not only is it comfortable for my baby who has so far used it from 3 months to 9 months old and it still looks brand new but it also is easy for me to put her in the straps don t twist and i love the velcro that holds the straps to the side as i put in take her out this model also rated the highest in consumer reports crash tests my daughter will use this one til we have another baby that needs it then i will buy a big girl Britax seat for her 
5 0 I love this seat After searching for just the right seat I m happy to say I love this one The instalition was so easy I have an Acura and I was afraid it wouldn t fit well into the car rear facing but it fits very well With room to spare I would highly recomend this seat 
5 0 Great Seat for big babies I found this car seat to be much easier to use and instal than the other car seats we have used COSCO s Alpha Omega Elite Convertable My daughter is large for her age and it was nice that we were able to keep her seat in the rear facing position until she was one year old If you have a big baby over 9lb at birth this is your seat 
5 0 Happy with our purchase We are extremely happy with this carseat We saw no need for an infant detachable since we use a sling to carry our baby One note though If you plan on using this seat for a newborn make sure your purchase separate head support Our baby was small and for awhile even having double headsupport wasn t enough to keep her head from falling forward We just tucked a folded blanket under her chin to help give her support One major bonus she s very comfortable in this seat When she went through her fussy oops I mean high need period just sitting her in this seat not even driving anywhere calmed her instantly We love the fact that this is the only carseat we ll need to buy When you take that into consideration not having to buy an infant and then another carseat later the price is not bad at all Britax= quality safety 
4 0 Shannon s Review I really like the suction bowls The different sizes and lids are great my only complaint is that the bowls often come un stuck so every few minutes you have to reach over and push them back down 
5 0 Great for late night feedings Since our bedrooms are upstairs it is really convenient to have this product right in the same room There s no need to go downstairs and leave the baby crying until you get her bottle ready It takes some time using it to get used to the right temperature since the amount of water it states to use in order to heat up the bottle sometimes does not warm the bottle enough or sometimes heats it up too much I don t go by the amount of water stated to use for each bottle size Regardless of the size of the bottle or the amount of milk in it past 4 ozs I fill the vial with water up to 9 10 and push the button From time to time I take the bottle out and check the temp Once it is the way I want it to be I just take it out shake it and feed the baby letting the rest of the water evaporate on its own This way I know I will always have a warm bottle since once it is turned on and shuts off you have to wait 10 minutes to warm it up again Who has the time and patience with a crying baby to tend to Overall it is a great idea and has saved me many trips to the kitchen 
5 0 If I knew then what I know now I bought this product for the arrival of my second child I bottle fed my first child as well This product is a timesaver lifesaver I only wish I had it 4 years ago with my first child The key is to read the directions carefully before using this product If you use more than the recommended measurement of water for the warmer you will scald the bottle and formula and it won t cool down easily either As long as you read the instructions and follow them this product is a wonder and joy to use The cooler is especially nice because it cuts down on the nighttime feeding process but you must take special care not to chill bottles longer than the recommended 8 hrs You ll love the convenience and peace of mind If I only knew then what I know now 
5 0 Work great After having a potty seat that you take on off the toilet we finally tried this Potty Pal seat My almost 4yr old daughter can easily take the proper seat down to go to the bathroom The childs adult seat is light will not come slamming down They all fit in the seat cover nicely is not akward as an adult to use Highly recommend wish I would have bought this after she outgrew the stand alone potty seat 
5 0 At last Can I just tell you how much easier my life has been since I got the Potty Pal What a hassel it was to have to put the removable seat on in a rush and take it off ten times a day And when company came over Aggghhh Now it is as easy as flipping up the lid My daughter doesn t have accidents standing in front of the potty waiting for me to adjust the seat My guest aren t faced with that awkward situation of what to do with the potty seat when they need to use the toilet Thank you Potty Pal 
5 0 Seizure Dog We call him Seizure Dog because the color scheme is frankly almost nauseating to grown up eyes But babies react to this little guy like no other toy I ve seen It was really the first thing that my daughter ever responded to outside of food and people She used to fall asleep holding some part of Seizure Dog s anatomy and would wake up playing with one of the various dangly bits The high contrast and bright primary color scheme really draws infants eyes especially from generally and appropriately sedate and relaxing nurseries We now buy Seizure Dogs for all of our friends with babies The next one we get will be the 6th one of these we ve purchased so I d have to say we highly recommend it 
5 0 Love this little dog We have had this toy since my son was 3 weeks old he is almost 7 months now and he has loved it all along It still looks great and still barks when we travel we are always sure to take red Thomas favorite toy It has lots of chewable pieces and it attatches to almost all of his travel gear 
5 0 Best Loved I have had Pupsqueak attached to the carseat since my son was born He is now 7 months and loves him more everyday He holds him and plays with him on every car ride This toy is a great value for your money and a wonderful colorful durable and captivating playmate for baby 
5 0 So entertaining Right around the age of three months my daughter started to really become interested in the things around her and Pupsqueak was no exception She absolutely loves this toy and we take it everywhere we go I can lay her on the floor with this and she will move it back and forth grab at it and pull the ring into her mouth She absolutely loves the sound the ears make A great toy to teach your child grasping 
5 0 A Must Have My 4 month old daughter loves this toy The bright colors and textures are great The pupsqueak keeps her busy One of the best toys we have purchased 
5 0 Puppy love My 4 month old has enjoyed her Pupsqueak for a month now She can lay in her bassinet up to an half hour staring at her new buddy The bright colors and textures seem to facinate her The puppy s ears contain that noisy paper but that s ok Sometime s that s how I know that she s awake via the child monitor She isn t old enough to press his nose make him bark but I m sure once she s old enough she ll enjoy that feature too I highly recommend this product 
5 0 Baby Girl Loves This Toy Our little girl has loved this toy from the moment we purchased it when she was 4 months old and able to sit in her stroller by herself She is now almost 8 months and is still discovering new things to do with it It has held up well and she hears the laughing amp ribbits just fine she thinks they are hilarious 
5 0 Love this item I don t know who likes this toy more my baby or my husband and I This is an awesome invention with lots of gadgets and toys to keep baby occupied Fits really nicely with a Graco Quattro Tour stroller and doesn t have to be removed when the stroller is collapsed This will be on my gift giving list for any baby I have to purchase for 
5 0 They really worked I looked into these bottles because I was going on a camping trip and wanted to make life easier on me I was using the Dr Brown bottles but they are such a pain to clean especially if your camping I read some reviews on these bottles and heard they were better then the Dr Brown bottles so I tried them out my son was still spitting up a little with the Dr Brown bottles but now he dosen t spit up at all I am sold on these bottles I would say the liners are kind of a pain only because you have to buy extra and you have to make sure you have extra in your diaper bag But it is worth the change in my son 
5 0 Great choice for nursing moms I have used these bottles to supplement nursing for the last eight months Since the liners are steralized all I have to do is wash the nipples and other parts in very hot water and let dry These are convenient and easy to use Try the rubber nipples as well as the bottle series with the solid color tops that close down on the nipple I like those the best because they are so compact 
4 0 great utill my daughter turned 6 months I never wanted to use this bottle but a friend of mine gave them to me and i gave them a try we were using avent my daughter had very bad gas with avent I fell in love bought a million drop ins and now at 6 months old i need to stop using them while i was driving my daughter learned how to squrit the milk all over the car great bottle for gas bad bottle for car 
5 0 Excellent Bottle System Worked for my breastfed baby This bottle system is wonderful The liners are so easy to use and they re even better for keeping everything clean and sterile They re wonderful My baby goes between bottles and being nursed and she has no problem at all 
5 0 Best Bottles After trying the Avent bottles and my newborn hating them a friend recommened the Playtex Nurser My daughter has done very well with them from 2 weeks old to 7 months old The soft nipples are more like breastfeeding 
5 0 Recommended by our pediatrician While we were preparing for the arrival of our daughter we were hoping to use these bottles because of the convenience so when our pediatrician recommended them the decision was made These bottles are wonderful They don t have to be scrubbed inside with a brush like one piece bottles We just throw them in the dishwasher and they re done Our daughter has reflux and the silicone slow flow natural latch nipples work well for her Our doctor along with other doctors in the same group says that these are the best bottles to cut down on gas I would highly recommend buying the premium nursers featured here instead of the older original nursers that are slowly being phased out We have some of each The premium lids are a MAJOR improvement they re easy to pop on and off one handed unlike the original lids that you have to pry off with your fingernails You can interchange all the parts from both systems use any holder with any ring with any nipple with any lid but I think the premiums are much better Also the premiums come with the silicone nipples but the originals usually don t The liners for these nursers are very inexpensive especially if you use the coupons that come with the bottles or if you buy the store brand liners they work just as well The only downside to this system is that there isn t much room at the top of the liner to put in a full 4 ounces of water plus powdered formula and shake But that problem can happen with any bottle and I don t think it s a big deal GOOD NEWS for those who use these bottles I just discovered today that you can buy extra rings and lids on www teebop com I got the info from Playtex over the phone I plan to get some extra premium lids to take the place of the few original nurser system lids that I have and to make up for the ones I will inevitably lose along the way 
5 0 Wonderful toy I used this for my daughter starting when she was only a few weeks old and she loved it She would just lay there and look at all of the colors Later on it really helped with her hand eye coordination as she tried to hit the toys or grab them The bars unsnap easily to put the pad in the washing machine and the toys are easy to rotate It s also easy to travel with the bag it comes in is durable enough to use as a storage case which helps keep it clean This would be a great gift for a baby shower 
5 0 Take a time out This entertained my daughter for 2 hours of the day Make sure to buy extra hanging toys It comes with 3 hanging toys A musical toy a bell ringing mirror and a rattler is your childs starter kit It had my daughter reaching and rolling for the first time plus focusing great The colors and characters had her talking and kissing them 
5 0 What a great product This little gym kept my daughter busy exploring touching feeling and hearing new sounds I would highly reccomend in fact I bought it for all my friens who were expecting 
5 0 fun for everyone My 4 month old was losing interest in this toy until I purchased 4 new things to add on and now he loves it again The nice thing is that you can keep changing and adding toys as interest fades I think this will still be fun for a toddler to climb under the arches as a sort of obstacle course type play The durability of this product is excellent too I have not been able to keep my 6 and 8 year old children out of it The 10 year old thinks it s pretty neat too Not only do all of the children use it but 2 dogs love to climb all over it as well Durable and entertaining 
5 0 Everybody plays with it The Gymini is wonderful I have used it since the day I brought my son home from the hospital It helps a baby to develop focus and tracking skills and increases alertness in the first couple months It then helps with hand eye coordination You can dangle an assortment of toys from the arches We never purchased any of the extra ones you can get because I d just add some of his other toys with the clip ons you d use with a stroller It is hard to find an educational toy for a newborn that can be interactive as well and last This fits the bill You can lie on the floor and talk to them about what they are looking at sometimes my baby is just happy to have his playtime and can play independantly for about 20 30 minutes It is portable We have folded it up and taken it in a suitcase with us 5 times now Because it is so lightweight and folds up easily it is great for travelling Then you can set it up in your hotel room or at grandma s house and baby is in a familiar environment to play in which gives you some hands free time and baby some fun as well It has amazed me how much older children play with it to Thanksgiving and Christmas at Grandma s all the nieces nephews from ages 4 to 14 were playing with it on their own and with the baby Now at 4 months I think my son gets a little bored with it because he likes to be sitting up Yet he will still play with it for a good 15 minutes it may not seem like much but trust me on this if you want to enjoy a nice cup of coffee tea in the morning while it is still hot this is a good thing I tend to rotate his toys now so I think this will still bring entertainment for up to a year Toddlers we have had over like to crawl under the arches and past the dangling toys 
5 0 Can t say enough good things about this toy If there is one thing you are going to buy for your baby buy this Both my children went under it from newborn The toys were fascinating for them to watch and the mat is nice and soft to lay on As they grew they would bat the toys to make them swing and grab them to pull a leg or tail into their mouths for chewing They learned to make the noises that each toy makes The arches are soft and bendable so when they are rolling around they move with the baby so there is no risk of getting caught up in an odd position It s portable just folds in half so you can take it with you It washes up extremely well It s just a great toy 
5 0 An Incredible toy I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loved it She plays with it for at least 30mins Which is time that I can get things done I work 4 days a week and brought this to daycare and she plays with it all the time I highly recommend this produc 
4 0 Very Kid tough These cups are great I bought them for the 2 year old I babysit 3 months later and they re still in great shape The graphic on the front is starting to wear a little bit but that s not really a concern of mine They don t leak which is great 
5 0 Great item My 2 year old loved this cup before he wouldnt drink out of a sippee cup only a prober glass but would alway spill it This cup is so bright he cant help but look at the items and tell me about whos in it it helps also being bright I never lose it I hope this cup last over to be used by his brother The wide top makes it feel different than a reg cup I am buying more oif these 
5 0 IF ONLY I COULD GIVE THIS MORE THAN 5 STARS GIVING THIS ONLY FIVE STARS IS AN INSULT IT S JUST NOT ENOUGH THANK GOD FOR THE SECURE ME TRAVEL SEAT MY LIFE IS FOREVER CHANGED FIRST OF ALL IT TAKES ONLY 5 SECONDS TO SET THIS UP IN A SHOPPING CART I HAD MY SQUIRMY 9 MONTH OLD BABY IN ONE ARM AND MY HUGE DIAPER BAG IN THE OTHER AND THOUGHT TO MYSELF HOW IN THE WORLD AM GOING TO DO THIS BUT LOW AND BEHOLD 5 SECONDS LATER IT WAS IN SHE WAS IN AND WE WERE READY TO STROLL THE AISLES THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST 14 99 I HAVE EVER SPENT IN MY LIFE IF YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING ANOTHER BRAND YOU ARE JUST CRAZY 
5 0 a must have This is a great item register for it you will need it as soon as your child is out of the infant carrier car seat which my daughter was out of already at 4 mths she s very long and outgrew the height requirement The secure me travle seat works great it is easily adjustable and works in many situations regular chairs restaurant high chairs carts etc 
5 0 So easy no hassle Secures baby really well Started using when he was 5 5 mos sitting with help The wrap around belt that secures baby even helped him sit up in a cart kept him secure from sliding or tilting Now it s even more useful at 7 mos as he reaches for EVERYTHING The wide strap really holds baby secure keeps them from leaning over grabbing things I hook toys to the strap with links and his pacifier with a clip he is good to go for even an hour+ in a store I liked the look of the other kind that covers the whole basket but this one is less bulky has the wide strap for keeping him where I want him Update at 1yr of age I ended up buying one of the other types of cart protectors The other one was great until a few months ago when baby just can t be kept still in the cart leans or pulls feet up So the other kind became easier as he never hits his head on any part of the cart and also it can be used in restaurant high chairs 
5 0 Nice and protable This is a must have for moms who like to keep their kids secure in a shopping cart as well as clean from yucky germs My son is small for his age and the regular strap in the shopping cart doesn t fit around him corrrectly he is 2 and we still use it I tried the big cart cover that covers the entire seat and he just swam in it this keeps him secure and safe As well as away form the germy yucky cart handle I also like that this fits in my diaper bag better than the big full cover cart cover A must have by far 
5 0 Puppy Monitor Too Yes I bought this so I could hear my new Black Lab puppy at night on the first floor This thing works great he whines I come down let him out and everyone is happy The night light is a great addition my daughter in law says she likes mine better than hers and she paid more Great Product D Michael Bowie MD US 
5 0 Great business Practical product We used this gate to separate a large room into two sections to keep the little ones out of the big kids activities For the price it was really worth it to us Basically now we have two rooms instead of one minus the scary paranoia that babies may choke on the small part toys We ve had it for 6 months it is still perfectly intact and looks superb Since we are APO overseas US address the shipping is always very tricky Usually companies charge huge rates and ship it slow boat making tremendous profits alone on the shipment This company the Pegasus Shop Safe baby Shop did exactly the opposite small shipping cost and ultra fast shipment We got it just in a few days to our surprise Since then I had to deal with the business with other inquiries and they are wonderfully honest and helpful 100 satisfied 
5 0 third ones a charm This was our third baby monitor We bought this one as a backup at Grandma s house and we ended up liking it so much better than the ones we had bought at double quadruple the price The night light is wonderful and the sound is good 
5 0 Best Outlet Cover Out There Easy to install and covers the outlet entirely Other safety faceplates I tried never covered the outlet completely and my son could stick a straightened paper clip through Not this one They are very easy to use for an adult as well 
5 0 Works really well so far I ve had this pump for about 5 months and I use it before I go to work in the morning twice at work and once when I get home I was a little concerned at first because for such an expensive pump the motor only has a 90 day warranty I plan to keep my daughter on breastmilk until she s at least one and wanted a pump that would last I tried one of the Avent manual pumps but I had to be engorged before I would get a few ounces out of one side nothing out of the other The Medela pump is so much easier and does all the work for you The pump has held up so far and I m really happy with it I bought extra shields and bottles to pack with me to take to work and keep the rest at home The only downside I saw to these bottles is that they are made to fit only with Medela products Otherwise the pump is great and I d recommend it to anyone looking for something durable and easy to use 
5 0 This Pump is a MUST HAVE if you re Nursing Pumping I ve been using this pump every day for 4 months and I m absolutely satisfied with it Since my son was premature I had to pump exclusively in the beginning and I can say without reservation that this pump works just as well and quickly as the hospital pump It empties my breasts in 10 minutes it s easy and it travels well Also with certain bras not the Medela bras as they seem to require some type of adapter you can pump hands free by simply hooking securing the nursing bra cups over the breast pump cups One last comment I will make which speaks to quality is that I ordered extra membranes and tubing to have available just in case but have yet to need them as the original ones are still operational I can and DO recommend this pump to all nursing moms and if you think this one is expensive consider two things 1 the value of your time and convenience and 2 the total cost after you end up replacing the cheaper one when you find that it doesn t really meet your expectations or breaks down 
5 0 Gotta Have the Batteries I was debating between this and the Avent pump since I have nothing but Avent bottles In the end Babies R Us was sold out of the Avent and I bought the Medela backpack with an adaptor set so you can pump straight into the Avent bottles Avent doesn t advertise this well I m so glad I did The Avent doesn t have a battery pack so I don t know how you d use it on a trip unless you don t mind standing in the middle of an airport bathroom pumping I myself prefer the privacy of a stall Also no one can tell its a breast pump The backpack is very stylish and I was able to fit additional items in it so that I could use it as my only carry on The design is very innovative which you learn the more you use Most importantly I can get 5 oz per breast out in less than 10 minutes so you don t feel like you re waiting forever while pumping I d recommend this to anybody 
4 0 Great Bottles Would recommend clean great work well as long as they are screwed together properly 
5 0 My Son Loves These Bottles I bought Gerber comforthold bottles and Playtex Ventair natural shape bottles there were stage ones My son didnt like Gerber s nipples since the nipples are too short and he hardly get any thing i end up buying more PLaytex bottles and threw away Gerber s nipples and use PLaytex nipples for gerber bottles as well since they fit Gerber Bottles Another thing i like about these bottles obviously he got less air after feeding him i didnt have to burp him like i used to with other bottles the shape of bottles are easy to hold to me and my baby as well NO LEAKS RECOMMENDED 
4 0 Best for my kid but every baby is different I have read and re read reviews for bottles and have found that the only way to really find the right bottle is to try them out no wonder this is a multi billion dollar industry We tried Playtex Drop Ins and were frustrated about 6 weeks in that feedings were taking an hour with the Slow nipples The Fast nipples drenched our son in formula We moved to Avent with a Stage 2 nipple and found ourselves in the 50 of people who can t get them shut properly Loved the nipple shape and speed couldn t deal with the leaking We tried Playtex Ventaire Although this bottle claims to not let air in through the nipple we apparently couldn t get these closed correctly either Air entered through the nipple at every feeding and caused gas and spit up problems We eventually made our way back to the Drop Ins our son now old enough to handle the Fast nipple we like these the best I still feel reviews are beneficial but know that your kid will let you know if he or she needs a change Find what works for you and go with it I give the Drop Ins 4 stars If Playtex would put out a Medium flow nipple it would be 5 
5 0 Awesome bottles less gas I have tried many bottles for my daughter She originally used the nurser bottles for supplementation while I was breastfeeding low supply They told me to pump so I got cheap regular 4 oz baby bottles to pump into so she could drink directly out of She started having all kinds of stomach upset We then tried the Dr Browns bottles They were good but she had trouble with the nipple We switched to the wide neck Dr Brown bottles which she did better with but still didn t like the nipple Finally I got back out the playtex nursers Upset stomach problem got better She still has reflux I think always will but the gas is only occasional now Don t waste your time or money with other bottles Easier to clean too You can t microwave these liners but what I do is mix up a days worth of formula in a pitcher that I keep in the fridge and pour into the liner just before ready to feed I then put the liner with the formula in a glass of hot tap water It only takes a minute or two to warm up Then drop the liner in the bottle and you re ready to feed My favorite nurser bottles are ez feed with the slider to get the air out They are sometimes hard to find but are really easy to use One comes in the newborn set or you can purchase them individually at BabiesRUs or Publix Grocery store If there were more than 5 stars these bottles would get a higher rating Can t say enough good things about them Also easy to travel with 
5 0 Drop ins work for breast fed babes Calvin tried 6 other bottle systems including the Dr Browns and the drop ins with the latex nipple were the only one he accepted Introducing the bottle can tough for breast fed babies and this one seemed more natural than the others I can t stop bzzing about how good they are Hope this helps you on your bottle selection Amyco 
4 0 Great for Breast babies I bought these bottles when I knew my son would have to be away from me and need to get breast milk by bottle He had no problems going from my nipple to these and I liked that you could get all the air out of the bottle Now that my son is on formula I do find it difficult to prepare it in these bottles It is almost easier to put it in a seperate cup and mix the water and formula It can be done it the bottle but it is a little difficult to mix it well I have now mastered how to put the formula in and how long to shake it but it took some practice to get it right without the formula clumping a lot Warming the bottles is also a problem since you cannot microwave the liners or so it says my mother did it once without realizing you aren t supposed to and nothing bad happened but since it advises against it I wouldn t recommended trying it out Now that my son doesn t really care for warm milk it isn t an issue anymore anyway I still love these bottles and the fact that if I have enough nipples to change out I don t have to worry about having a clean bottle on hand since I can just drop in a new liner I currently have about 6 extra nipples in case this happens but it hasn t yet but it is nice to know that the option is there for us 
5 0 Nothing works better I had my first baby in 2004 and being a new mom spent tons of money on the cute little bottles with pictures and designs on them only to come to realise that they gave my daughter the worst gas ever I switched to the playtex bottles right away and didn t have any trouble after that My second baby came in 2005 and being in denial tried the cutsie bottles again thinking maybe it was just my daughter Sure enough tummy ache and lots of gas Playtex bottles came back into our home right away and never had another problem I just couldn t believe that they worked so wonderful They are so much easier to wash being the pre sterilized liners just pop right in and the larger nipple looks so much more comfortable than those tiny nipples that some bottles have My sister in law had her first baby in November and I swore to her that they worked like a charm I bought her tons for her baby shower and she started on them mixed with the breast and was also amazed that they worked miracles I would guarentee positive results to anyone who asked and wouldn t recommend anything else Those cute bottles may be calling but itn t worth your little one in alot of pain and discomfort 
4 0 Love these bottles i hate having to wash bottles every night and these are a great time saver Just throw out the liner and you only have to wash the nipples Baby just loves them and so does hubby he does like to wash bottles either and he likes how once you push the air out baby can feed in any position as long as there is suction i don t premix because you can t put them in the microwave but we have a bottle warmer so it works just as well put the powder in the bottle first before the water or it won t mix as wel 
5 0 Perfect bottle Wonderful bottle for breast or bottle fed babies My first daughter likes these and was bottled fed only My second daughter only liked these if it wasn t mommy if ya know what I mean You can find generic liners that work and fit just as well to cut back on cost Another bonus is there is less clean up Just wash the nipple and nipple ring and your ready to go for you next feeding 
4 0 I love them I love these bottles and so does my son They really do keep the gas out And the nipple is great when you are also breastfeeding my son didnt seem to notice the difference The only problem though is the measuring I m fine now that my son drinks regular milk but when I had to mix formula it was hard You can actually only mix 6 oz of formula in the 8 oz bottles What I ended up doing towards the end when my son was beginning to drink 8 oz was mix the formula in another container or bottle and then transfer it to the playtex Other than that its great not having to wash bottles over and over 
5 0 Love it but color is a little off I live in Northern GA and when I got pregnant I lived in Southern LA never thinking I would need something heavier than a blanket for my infant son After the first morning of scraping the frost off the front of my car with my 4 month old son waiting patiently inside the house for the car to warm up I realized that I was wrong I have the Graco Windsor Snugride travel system so I ordered the Celadon Bundle Me thinking that the two greens would match It is not a perfect match so I probably should have ordered the graphite instead but as far as the product goes my son loves it I even unzip the top cover and use it as a mat when we play at friends houses or when we visit family as a top cover in his Pack and Play My son likes to snuggle down into the Bundle Me and I like that I can just unzip part of it while we re driving if he starts to get hot I definitely suggest this for anyone who lives in a somewhat chilly area I will probably invest in the Lite version once spring arrives anything so my son doesn t have to get bulked up with a sweater or jacket just to be comfortable in the weather 
4 0 Perfect for the small tushie My son is little so it may not be good for larger kids starting to potty train He s about 27 pounds age 21 months Get some of those disinfectant wipes and clean it out each time and you re good Wear gloves and wash your hands after too Fits in a small space in my small bathroom without an issue 
4 0 The best quality but not the best design Although I am a die hard Baby Bjorn fan I am not a true fan of the LITTLE potty It s small in design with no removable bowl which makes it very hard to keep clean Save your money and upgrade to the Baby Bjorn regular potty which is well worth the money We keep our little potty in the minivan for those unexpected road trip emergencies 
5 0 Baby Bjorn Little Potty I had not heard about this product brand until my 5th baby was born We are doing elimination communication with him this potty works well for his first potty Currently he is almost 4 mo old we set the potty on the changing table hold him For safety reasons we never let go of him while sitting there When he can sit up on his own we will sit the potty on the floor Eventually he will out grow it We also purchased the BabyBjorn Potty Trainer eventually he ll use that next In the meantime the next older child is able to use it I like that this potty is all in 1 piece So easy to clean no crevises to worry about We dump the contents into the toilet Add a little water to the potty from the sink the potty easily fits into our bathroom sink to catch the rinse water dump rinse water into toilet The size is nice for storing it won t take up a lot of room The size is nice because eventually when he is older he ll be able to get on off it easily himself I would have prefered this item in white instead of blue but at the time of ordering the color blue was the best option After an additional item was purchased with my order I was also able to qualify for free shipping through Amazon The colors available would not be the fault of the manufacturer but who I purchased it from I was unable to find this at any of the stores in my local area We would have had to drive 50 minutes or more away from our home to purchase it at a certain baby store Then we would have also paid sales tax our costs to drive there I was pleased with this purchase through Amazon 
4 0 Wonderful This potty has been great for my daughter She started using it when she was 15 months old 3 months ago and seems comfortable on it I love the simple design and ease of cleaning I also love that my daughter will use it The only problem we have faced with this potty is sliding Our daughter cannot sit on it without help because there is no traction on the bottom of it We ve tried various methods to fix this and it s not much of an issue now 
4 0 great but small I bought this toilet when my son was less than 2 when I was tired of all of the typical childrens toilets The potty was perfect because of how portable it is my son could have it near at all times The biggest problem is how small the potty is even for my son it was somewhat tiny He outgrew it very within 6 months but I feel that for 10 it was well worth it It served the purpose I needed for the time 
5 0 Perfect little seat I love this little potty for car trips My 3 year old is petrified of automatic flushing toilets so we bought this chair to use on a recent vacation She loves it It is really easy to clean I just keep some clorox wipes in the car with the seat It now lives in the back of my minivan incase of an emergency potty stop We are also using a second one to train our 23 month old son The splash guard is great and he is very comfortable on the seat 
5 0 great potty BabyBjorn did it again Small and portable easy to clean Great to take when you leave the house so your child doesn t have to sit on not so clean public toilet seat 
4 0 great monitor but I thought the monitor worked really well I picked this one out because I loved the glow light feature It is so much better to use the low light during nighttime feedings but the light bulb in the receiver is not replaceable I have only used it for 6months and it burned out on me already It goes off after 15 minutes and the directions say it is long lasting Well not long enough and I am contacting the comopany for the warranty hopefully they will fix it 
4 0 Pleased I think that overall this booster is great It is lightweight and large enough to accommodate children as they grow My 3 year old son about 30lbs looks kind of tiny inside of the seat and he can slouch in the seat but the seatbelt position is at a good height on small children This seat would do well for a child who easily goes and remains in the seat but not for a child who likes to climb out of their seat 
5 0 Nice lightweight safe durable and fully featured I bought this booster seat after considering other seats from Cosco and Britax This one stood out for value simplicity safety and convenience At first I considerd a convertible booster seat that also has the latch system along with 5 point seatbelts but decided against it because my son at his age and weight 3 3 yrs 35 lbs does not need all these extra features in an extra bulky be all car seat The latch and 5 point features are intended more for a recent 3 year old while a toddler from 3 5 years to 10 won t need it so why bother with all this extra stuff You don t need the added bulk and complexity for features that will only be used for 5 more years The B510 premier is the top of the line and latest from Compass which has more durable fabric wider side supports and a carry bag My son loved it at first sight and it works great There is no neck support though so you may need to buy one of these separately for long road trips My son was literally propping his head up with his arm on the arm rest when he passed out in the car The price of the B510 was with free shipping and given the free carry bag which has a retail value of it makes this booster seat about which is the price of the older B500 model The only thing I have had to get over is that booster seats in general are not secured onto the car seat with a latch but instead rely on the seat belt to keep my son and the seat in place When driving around without the kids seats like this need to be secured even if a child is not sitting in it The base of this seat doesn t look like it ll rip into my car s leather seat and the headrest adjusts vertically easily I will need to buy a seat protector anyway though since my son uses the car s seat as a step stool to get into this booster seat Also you will need to train your kids when they can unbuckle the seat belt because it s easily reachable The only shocking thing to me was that this seat comes with an expiration date and is not recommended for use after 7 years from date of manufacture Therefore it s not meant to be kept forever and used as a hand me down for siblings 
5 0 Fleece Sleep Sack Blue Extra Large Muy buena adquisici�n El beb� se siente c�modo y confortable 
5 0 Wonderful These are wonderful My baby was getting uncomfortable being swaddled at about three months so we decided to make the switch to sleep sacks We were worried that with her arms free that she might have a hard time falling and or staying asleep This was true at first so we started by only putting her in these during the daytime in a light cotton one After about a week she was not waking early from her naps anymore and after two weeks we tried her in it at night and she slept straight through the night as she did when she was swaddled So the transition was painless and she seemed a much happier baby to be able to reach her hands and move her arms While I didn t notice shrinkage I did notice that the zipper does bunch up a bit but this hasn t been a problem Sometimes my daughter sucks on it if it gets close to her mouth but she has to reach for it it doesn t cover her face at all or trap air that she could rebreathe I didn t like that these don t have sleeves so I tried Carter s sleep sacks and found the sleeves to be too short and hard to get on my daughter Those sacks only come in one size which my daughter has already outgrown at four months 14 lbs 24 inches She has also outgrown the small size sleep sack but the medium size fits her perfectly with some room to grow I didn t want to use fleece at first since it is polyester I wanted to use cotton But we ve found that she sleeps longer and seems to prefer he heavier fabric of the fleece one Also we only bought these in blue even though we have a girl because the color is calming to our easily overstimulated baby We ve washed these many times and they look just as good and hold together just as well as they did originally We ve also found you can put your baby into the next larger size without it being so big that they can get their arms out or that it bunches up around their face So after everything we ve tried we ve loved these sleep sacks from day one 
5 0 Awesome Highly Recommend These are so awesome I never have a concern that my son is cold or will get strangled with blankets One night I had the sleep sak in the laundry and it was a cool night so I put a blanket over him well my husband checked him in the middle of the night and found the blanket wrapped so tightly around his neck he could hardly believe that our son was still breathing Very scary So if anything make sure you have more than one sleep sak 
4 0 Very Very Helpful I searched all over every store in what seemed like the world just to find a sleeping wedge for my 3 month old preemie son He has very bad acid reflux and sleep apnea he forgets to breathe when he s sleeping so he absolutely had to have one I bought this for him and he s been sleeping trouble free ever since The height may only be 2 3 but it works really well because any taller than that I actually bought another one to try under the first one and his poor little head will fall over and he can t breathe We have him in a cradle and thank God I found one that fits it 
5 0 no interference from neighbors OR 900 Mhz No probs with this picking up neighbors or interfering with our existing FP 900 Mhz monitor for our 2 1 2 year old We had to trash a Safety First cheaper one and invest in this but it s worth it and we really like it It s clear and we also like that it comes with two receivers Much easier even in our smaller home 
4 0 NOT BAD Does what it should but could be improved I give it 3 1 2 stars VERY IMPORTANT NOTE DOT NOT TURN ON SYSTEM BEFORE READING THIS You have to open up the parent receivers and plug in the battery pack before usage then Charge the system for 16 hours DO NOT TURN SYSTEM ON WHILE CHARGING FOR THIS FIRST TIME I did a lot of research on monitors and found this one to have pretty good feedback on several parents websites With most items there are pros and cons see below Pros You will not pick up any feedback from the neighbors This is a significant improvement from monitors in the past ABSOLUTLY NO INTERFERENCE Great reception You will have no problems picking up your child with this I can take it outside and work in the yard with confidence that I will know when my baby needs me Interchangeable AC power cords make it easy to move the system around to different rooms in the house Lightweight and compact system Cons The biggest issue is battery life HORRIBLE BATTERY LIFE TYPICALLY ONLY 3 4 HOURS at a time The battery drain on this system is almost a deal breaker in my husband s opinion This system comes with the options of 1 or 2 docking stations I HIGHLY RECOMMED the one with two stations because the system is constantly running low on batteries and and can recharge while the parents portion is on the dock Or the second receiver can be used while the other is charging on the dock With any power interruption the child s unit shuts off The parents unit beeps and flashes red to inform you of the issue but it can be irritating at 2 00 A M to have to get up to turn it back on Graco really needs to find a way to have the system stay on at all times that it is plugged in Belt clip does not work well with normal amount of movement The system is better left unattached to belt unless you want to be constantly picking it up from the ground A bit expensive A little of both Pros Cons Sound Pro Great sound very clear In fact I can often hear dogs barking outside with this monitor Con Picks up on every little sound because it is so sensitive For the light sleepers on the softest level still can be very loud Loud every 5 seconds parents warning Pro Beeping will let you know that system is not functioning correctly so you can fix the system This was nice for us one day when the baby s system had fallen and came unplugged If the system had not beeped we would not have known Con Annoying beeping while searching for signal a startling fact in the middle of the night Overall the system does what it should but there a few area s that could be improved I gave it 3 1 2 stars but rounded it up 
4 0 Same as Sit n Stand Elite Double Stroller from One Step Ahead I was wondering the same thing about this stroller i e how does it convert to stand mode etc I had seen the version of this stroller on the One Step Ahead website so I called Baby Trend and they told me it is the exact same stroller It is just marketed differently for the different vendors and they are different colors So you can go to the One Step Ahead website to get more views of the stroller I still have not purchased it yet worried about the quality and the overall length of the stroller But it does seem to be one of the lightest double strollers available Good Luck 
5 0 Can you put a Graco car seat in this stroller I m thinking about getting this stroller but I need to know Thanks 
4 0 The best out there for the price I have the baby trend sit n stand from one step ahead which is basically the same as this stroller It has rubber wheels a cup holder and few other changes I like this stroller but I am not thrilled with the quality The wheels don t look all that sturdy and the stroller has some play as you turn corners Since this is our third double stroller 2 used ones before I think this is the way double strollers are so they don t weigh a ton or cost a fortune For the price this is definetly the best double stroller out there I love the hinged front tray so you can easily get a toddler out My son loves the sit n stand options and it collapses very easily Putting the back seat on and taking it off takes a little time but not too difficult The second sunshade is also a great option during the summer This stroller is going to be especially wonderful at the zoo and the mall 
5 0 Happy MOM LOVE this for my 6 month old and 3 Year old Great stroller So easy to use It s smooth and lightweight It fits just fine in the back of my minivan My 3 year old loves the options to sit or to stand My 6 month old fits nice and snug in the front I have no complaints and have showed it to my friends who also really like it I compared and researched a number of strollers and am so pleased with this purchase The parent tray could be larger but that s my only beef with the stroller I have back problems and I think that it s easy to manuver and steer and I don t really notice a weight difference between this and my single Peg P stroller LOVE IT 
5 0 Very Happy With This Stroller I have a 23 month old and a 6 week old and initially thought the Joovy Caboose would be the stroller for us Thank goodness we had the opportunity to try one out before we bought it With the Joovy if you have an infant carrier in the front seat there is no room at all for the older child to sit on the jump seat Also for some strange reason the jump seat slides back and forth which seems very unsafe So if you have an infant in a carrier and your older child wants to sit the older child is out of luck What s the point of that With this stroller the older child has 3 options sit in the back seat sit on the jump seat or stand on the platform The back seat can be removed fairly easily and stored in the basket underneath and my little girl who is tall for her age has plenty of room She sometimes dangles her feet over the foot rest but this is not an issue Our infant carrier easily slides into the front seat and is secured with a belt This stroller opens and closes easily and is very easy to control as it steers beautifully it s not nearly as long as I thought it would be but both children have plenty of room Since it has the footprint of a single stroller it fits through doors and entranceways with no problem It is a little heavy when folded but I don t think I would find a stroller with these features that s not The basket is nearly impossible to get to but I can live with it Overall I m thrilled with this purchase and every single time I use it someone stops me to ask about it One woman even said That s the most practical double stroller I ve ever seen I have to agree 
5 0 Love this I keep this stocked with diapers and wipes in the back of my car so when I go out with my daughter for short trips I don t need to worry about bringing a diaper bag It s also great to bring to the mall etc and attach to the stroller 
4 0 Good Size It s a good size diapering kit 21 by 24 and is padded The plastic wipes case is a bonus 
5 0 A Necessity We love this compact changing do it all kit It s got a travel wipes box 2 mesh pockets one for the wipes one for 2 3 diapers It rolls folds up and then velcros closed VERY HANDY it also has a strap that you can velcro onto your purse handle stroller whatever We lost ours and I m purchasing a new one because I just can t live without it ha ha 
4 0 Love it My son is now 6 1 2 months old and he loves it He kicks away at it until he tires himself out It is a bit heavy and you must make sure you tie it tight so that it doesn t fall or get pulled off The sound has 2 settings low and high I read the review that said it was very low i suspect it might have been on the low setting Overall i d like to see a better way to secure it to crib but my son loves it 
5 0 This is a must This is great for when i need to get ready I put her in the crib ans she kicks away Music to your ear 
5 0 Not good for many cribs My baby does enjoy this toy He likes to kick it and hear the music and I like that it has 3 modes it will just play music for 10 minutes the baby can kick it to play songs or it can be set to play like a keyboard when kicked The only problem one I see with many crib toys right now is that it doesn t fit my crib It has 3 ties that are meant to be attached to the spindles of a crib The problem is most cribs now such as mine have solid ends and you can t tie anything to them This toy is meant to be used at the end of a crib and it simply won t fit If you have a crib that has slats or spindles on the ends then you will be fine I don t so the only way for me to use this toy is to hold it while my baby kicks at it Fun for him but not for me 
5 0 2 Months Old and loves it We got this as a shower gift My daughter is two months old and already loves it I put it on it s continous play mode and she will just sit there watching it and dancing her feet in the air I am able to get my morning showers in because of this now you know it s worth it just for that haha 
4 0 works well color is not as in photo works great and i use it often to see things and not wake up the baby the item is a very dark orange when lit almost red i might try the yellow one next time i hope it is a little lighter 
5 0 Zanzibar Wall Hanging Purchase The ordering process was easy and it was delivered in a timely manner 
5 0 Definitely worth the money I absolutely love these wall hangings they are a great addition to the nursery They match perfectly with the other Zanzibar products I haven t had any problems hanging them they came with loops on the back that worked wonderfully 
4 0 ridiculous We bought these wall hangings from Babiesrus They didn t have the hooks on the back So we just nailed it on the wall with holes on them Then when I recently went to baby depot I saw the same item but it actually had the ribbons on it so that it can be easily put on the wall Very weird Other than that we love it 
5 0 Another Great Item from Zanzibar We love these wall hangings They come in different textures just like the Zanzibar bedding set Ours came with loops for hanging so we haven t had the problems others seem to have had 
5 0 Great Idea I love this little pouch What a great idea rather than going though your whole diaper bag looking for the pacifier Another great thing about this Pacifier Pod is that by the feel of this little bad since it is connected to the outside of the diaper bag you can tell if you have a pacifier in it so you don t leave home without one and end up needing to buy another 
5 0 fantastic stroller I spent a lot of time researching double stollers and even test drove as many as I could and the BOB is super It really does turn on a dime and is extremely easy to push I have twins so getting outside for a jog walk is crucial to keeping my sanity and shape It is pricey but comparitively extremely durable easy to fold feels a lot lighter than it appears and I lOVE the separate sun canopies The ride is very smooth due to the shocks even on bumpy terrain 
5 0 Best stroller This is the best stroller We ve had a single BOB Revolution for 2 years and now purchased 2007 Duallie since our second daughter was born Our 4 month old loves sleeping in it and our two year old enjoys the ride and comfort Unlike most dual strollers this one can be pushed with one finger This stroller is not small but still fits through most doors If you are looking for a double stroller don t waste your money on anything else and just buy this one 
5 0 Best Pads I am on my second time around nursing and I have tried a ton of differnt pads These ones keep my breasts feeling good All the others seem to keep the moisture in making my breasts feel sore These Gerber Ultra thin breast pads are the best I will only use these I have waisted to much money on others that only seem to cause soreness Trust me These are the best kind to use 
5 0 The best I ve tried I have tried many other brands of pads and so many of them leaked and barely held any milk I ve also dealt with fuzz sticking to my nipples from one brand I tried the medium and heavy of these and they worked great I can wear them all night or all day at work and have no leaks I used the ultra thin ones when I was leaking a little and they worked fine although I m sure they wouldn t work if they had to be in for very long They are visible through clothes but I haven t found ANY that aren t I read reviews of so many who don t like them but for me they are the best that I ve found 
4 0 saved the crib The Gummie Rail Guard was a good investment My daughters crib has larger sides which regular crib guards wouldn t fit The gummie guards will fit any size The only problem I found is that the tape which holds them on isn t tacky enough Don t get me wrong they work but my daughter found an edge and started lifting off of the crib I had some left over and put the new piece on and she hasn t bothered with it Maybe I didn t put it on correctly the first time Gummie saved my daughter crib from her teeth 
5 0 Love it and it looks great This is by far the nicest looking bottle drying rack I could find I love it I ve never used the brush though as I use a different one Others have mentioned their brushes breaking so I m not sure how it holds up Easy to take apart and clean when needed 
5 0 Buy it for anyone who plans to bottle feed I have loved having this drying rack for baby bottles and nipples I don t have to have a soggy dishcloth on my counter anymore and it s really kind of cute 
5 0 Excellent Monitor System I bought this system after experiencing frustration with other wireless monitors For some reason this unit worked well even though I have a wireless computer network and portable phone The flexibility is excellent since both the monitor and cameras can work with a re chargeable power pack batteries monitor or AC power camera Because it worked so well we decided to import and resell them 
4 0 An absolute MUST for the airport Although this product isn t perfect I really couldn t imagine traveling without it Pros 1 Able to have hands free to push stroller hold child or other luggage while seat is on your back like a backpack 2 Travel case folds up small and nicely can fit under plane seat 3 Sturdy I didn t have any issues of rips tears like some other reviewers Cons 1 It can be a bit annoying trying to get the car seat in it but it does fit 2 Strap buckle dug into my shoulders tried to adjust it but wasn t able to make it much better 3 The carrier flips occasionally while in the stroll mode All in all DEFINITELY buy this product if you are traveling with a child I don t know of a better alternative and I can t imagine being able to carry everything through the airport without it 
5 0 great product a life saver for travel This is a great product for big trips or small Traveling alone with a toddler by plane is not easy with luggage a stroller and a car seat This product makes it easier You have the option to roll it along behind you or carry it on your back freeing up your hands to push a stroller It may take a little practice to get the car seat in at first but once you ve done it it s easier every time It also holds up to airport luggage handling coming out with a few scrapes but intact and ready to roll along I also love that it does double duty as a sun shade for the car seat keeping it cool for your little one I highly recommend it 
5 0 Love it I am really impressed with the potty protectors First of all they came quite quickly Secondly the size is pretty generous so it fits larger toilets I feel better about my little one using public toilets now 
5 0 safe easy cheap This booster seat was rated as the safest booster seat by consumer reports Safer than any other booster seat even the ones with backs It is also very easy to use and to move from car to car Highly recommend it 
4 0 Good Little Booster Seat My daughter actually picked this one out she really wanted pink Other than that the cupholders are convenient for her treasure and sippy cups Other cups we have to be careful with for fear they will spill out Overall it functions very well and very easy to change between cars 
5 0 Super Seat This is a great booster easy to move from car to car since you don t have to strap it in Cup holders are perfect Good quality 
4 0 Durable great price We bought this mattress for my daughter 3 years ago when she was 6 months old and it s now on her toddler bed It has survived uncountable jumping sessions and has been SO easy to clean literally just a soapy spongeing does the job It finally got a tiny split in the vinyl cover but I put a two inch piece of duct tape over it put on the sheet and it s back in business When we do replace it we ll just get another Pediatric 1000 An excellent value 
4 0 Nice Mattress We are very happy with this mattress but it is a little less firm than I expected The first night that my daughter slept on it she slept for 11 hours so the firmness doesn t bother her 
5 0 Pediatric 1000 mattress Excellent product fast deliver 
4 0 Decent Mattress No Problems at all I have had this mattress for 3 years now My daughter started using it as a newborn and is still using it on her toddler bed at age 3 I have had no tears or springs popping as described in another review I guess you could buy a 200 dollar mattress for your kid but does it really matter Have you noticed how little kids can sleep on ANYTHING Kids can sleep in the car with their neck bent 90 degrees to the side for 3 hours just fine They also fall asleep on the floor without complaining This mattress is soft and fits cribs nicely What else do you need Mine has held up just fine All in all it has been a good crib matress and I would probably buy it again If you like wasting money you should buy a pillowtop mattress with 12 000 springs for your kid Otherwise just save money and buy a basic one like this 
5 0 Pediatric 1000 Matress My 19 yr Old daughter just gave birth on July 14th 2005 to my grandson and I have to say the product turned out wonderfully Jordan sleeps in his crib peacefully and and it fit directly into the crib with no extra space so thank you amazon 
5 0 Washes great fits great This is a great product It washes great and fits great on my contoured changing pad It doesn t get pilly or anything Parents this is the one to get 
5 0 perfect for toddlers This stroller completely serves its purpose My little girl is almost 3 and 31Lbs I think this one is perfect for the little one who still needs a place to be when your out and about we tried umbrella strollers too small and searched for too long for the perfect one then I found it here on amazon at the best price and I did look everywhere I read complaints about the handles being to low and it made it uncomfortable to push well not for me I am 5 6 and it was just fine for me and my husband is 5 8 and we had no problems The only drawback is the storage under it but it is such a small price to pay you can still put stuff there but not as much as a full size stroller I would recommend this stroller to anyone I could who will need a transitional one size and all 
5 0 Love it WONDERFUL stroller So compact easy to fold comfortable for my baby and toddler easy to maneuver great 
5 0 Great Stroller This is our second Combi stroller and we like this one as much as the first except for the clasp on the belts We actually cut the belts off our old one and sewed it onto this one The stroller is sturdy without being heavy and our children love to have the bar across the front and they really like to be able to sit forward if they want to which is difficult in a regular umbrella type stroller I have read other reviews saying that if you re tall it s difficult to push this I disagree My husband is 6 1 and he finds it very comfortable to push as does a friend who is also over 6 
5 0 Food actually stays on After trying just about every toddler spoon out there we got these for our 20 month old She gets so frustrated when the food falls off before it reaches her mouth but with these the food stays on Finally eating is becoming less of a battle and she is really taking an interest Great product for self feeding 
5 0 Practical It is very good for toddlers that are starting to learn to hold the spoon the size and the handle are great 
5 0 satisfied mom this spoon is the only one that keeps my little one from getting frustrated and losing interest when self feeding the food actually stays on the spoon long enough for him to place it successfully into his mouth without food slipping down and him getting upset because of it plus the curve of the spoon provides just the right angle for him to hold it and enter his mouth as he turns his wrist other spoons which have a straight handle cannot do the job it takes too long to reach their mouths and food falls right out hooray for sassy once again other manufacturers should follow their example on this one 
5 0 Easy Feeding Spoons My six month old daughter loves these spoons The yellow and blue colors keep her interested while im feeding her The curved shape make them easy for me to hold and then manuver it into her mouth It s nice that two come in a pack 
5 0 MAM pacifier keeper what a relief While my son was still riding rear facing in the car he would often lose his pacifier Without a pacifier keeper it was next to impossible to locate I had trouble searching around the carseat because I could not see where to reach I found this pacifier keeper useful because I always knew Spencer s pacifier was near Now trips in the car are less stressful He is even big enough to find it himself I never have to worry that it has fallen on the floor of the car either What a great idea 
4 0 Mam Loves Me Pacifier Keeper I spend a good fifteen minutes every day searching for my baby s pacifier I hesitated getting a pacifier keeper before because I worried about the length of the cord afraid it would choke her However all that lost time and wasted effort have finally gotten to me and I have given in and purchased one It s not as bad as I thought The cord is not too long and I always leave her in view where I can spot her if she gets in trouble The keeper is quot a keeper quot 
5 0 Soft and durable I just recently bought one more changing pad for my second daughter I have a few other of these changing pads and I like them a lot They are nice and soft and very durable They haven t seemed to wear out at all the colors don t fade and the terry cloth stays soft and full 
5 0 lasts and lasts I love these covers Bought several 18 months ago when my son was born and just recently purchased some other colors when my daughter was born They last through multiple washing don t fade or shrink They will have some strings that will start to unravel but it is no different than a terry towel Tried other covers this one is much stronger and has significantly deeper side pockets The colors are great too Definately recommend 
5 0 My Best Friend I think I practically wore this every day for the first 6 months of my child s life It is awesome It is great to sit up in bed and feed because it gives you back support The child feels very supported as well The cover is very easy to wash I used it for a photo prop as well and to help her sit up when she was older My only complaint is that I did not invent it 
5 0 Best Bib Ever Invented You only need ONE bib forever I have a two year old who has only used this bib his whole life and it s still in great condition This bib is almost as soft as fabric but completely waterproof I wash it in the sink w a scrub brush after every meal and it is always dry by the next meal I buy this bib for everyone I know who has a baby 
5 0 Best Bibs ever I bought a set of three of these bibs when my now 7 1 2 year old was a baby and I still have them and they still look great I just went ahead and bought more for our new little one You can wash and dry these and they come out looking great I always preferred to wash them in the sink and hang dry 
4 0 Good value for the This is a good car seat I can t quite get it to be level with the ground like it is suppose to be when the base is attached but it works the same still Also the clips for the buckles get turned around sometimes on the strap That is the biggest pain I have had with this My daughter loves it 
5 0 Great Car Seat I am very happy with this car seat It came very quickly even though it was around Christmas The car seat fits well in our car as well as in our truck and our daughter seems to be very comfortable in it 
5 0 Very Versatile Carseat I am totally satisfied with this carseat It was a bit tricky getting it installed in the car I recommend reading the instructions and having an extra set of hands to help you install it but all carseats can be a bit tricky My 7 month old son loves this carseat because it sits higher up than his first seat and he can see outside this makes our road trips MUCH more pleasant There are lots of places for you to adjust the straps buckle and headrest so you can really make the seat fit your baby I am not sure how well it would work for a newborn because it doesn t recline as far as carseats that are only rear facing and it might make it harder for your little one to take naps and keep his head in a comfortable position Plus it is SO nice to have a carseat with a detachable base for a brand new baby so you don t have to wake them up when they are sleeping But if you only want one carseat I am sure a neck support pillow in the carseat would work great for newborns My favorite feature of this carseat is that I won t have to keep buying more carseats and then find a place to store the old ones until my son is old enough to ride without one 
4 0 Hard Core Seat Love this seat it s nice and cozy for baby and doesn t move around when hooked in correct The only down part is if you take it apart to wash everything be prepared to spend forever putting it back together 
4 0 I LIKE THIS SEAT I LIKE THIS SEAT IT WILL LAST TILL MY SON IS OUT OF A CAR SEAT IT IS HARD TO BUCKLE WITH THE CARS SEAT BELT WITH THE BOSTER SEAT STILL ATTACHED BUT WHEN YOU TAKE IT OFF IT WORKS JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHERS I HAVE NO COMPLANT EXCEPT THAT IT IS HARD TO BUCKLE IN THE CAR WITH THE CARS SEAT BELTS I HAVEN T TRIED THE TEATHER SYSTEM 
5 0 Great for tall parents I shopped around to find an umbrella stroller that wouldn t break my back to push as I am 5 11 and this stroller is perfect I found it at Target It s so light and folds up easily which I found helpful when traveling and going through security at the airport I would definitely reccomend this to others 
5 0 Great stroller This is an excellent stroller and well worth the money My husband and I purchased the red one from BuyBuyBaby We intended on purchasing a similar Chicco one for about � the price However after test driving them and other brands in the store the Maclaren won hands down The handles are higher good for tall people it is sturdier than most other umbrella strollers it steers well and the canopy actually works to shade the child from both sun and rain I would recommend purchasing the organizer that allows you to carry water and other bottles with you It is worth the extra 20 or so When we fold up the stroller we just flip the organizer over the front 
5 0 Stroller heaven I love this stroller I bought a cheaper umbrella stroller and it was not near the stroller this is The handles are at a comfortable height and my son sits comfortably in the stroller The basket is perfect for a diaper bag and a couple of shopping bags I highly recommend this stroller It is a great investment and worth the money 
5 0 My yuppie indulgence Handles are at a comfortable height Stroller is extremely lightweight and has a convenient carrying strap Classic design Good for bigger taller children their feet won t drag on the floor Bigger wheels equals comfort on different types of terrain A brand I would buy again and recommend to others 
5 0 A Must Have Item I absolutely LOVE this stoller I bought it because I am tall and my cheapo 20 umbrella stroller was causing back pain and I kept kicking the wheels while pushing This stroller is SO much more comfortable to push The fabric breathes easily and my daughter doesn t complain when she has to get strapped in The only drawback is there is no cupholder I tried to get a generic one to attach but then the folder wouldn t fold up arg All in all totally worth the investment 
5 0 Great for taller parents The angle of the rear wheels and the handles make walking comfortable if you re a taller parent unlike really cheap umbrella strollers It folds up very small so it s easy to throw on the floor of the back seat if you don t have trunk space available It also has a nice carrying strap so you can throw it over your shoulder like a gym bag which was nice when I walked from my office to day care several blocks away I always recommend this to my friends for ease of use and good value 
4 0 Awesome product These shells work really well in early breastfeeding to occasionally protect sore nipples They also work for increasing milk supply throughout the day without added pumping I use them to collect milk on the opposite side during my nightly feedings and have stored up a lot of milk that way The only reason they got 4 stars is because they are kind of hard and sometimes feel kind of obvious under certain clothing 
5 0 Helped me get started These were a huge help getting started on my first baby I bought them on a whim and boy was a glad They help get my milk started because they apply a light pressure which also helps extent the nipple They keep things such as a bra from rubbing against very very sore nipples Another great feature is the air vents at the top of the cups They are there to get air to nipple you don t want them getting dried out that just makes the pain of feeding much worse Determined breastfeeding mom s these are fantastic until your milk supply comes in at a steady pace They do not look flattering under a TIGHT fitting shirt loose is always best anyways but what does when you are breastfeeding for the first few months as things are adjusting I felt that they looked better that two huge wet spots from leakage 
5 0 Saved from Stopping Nursing For my first breastfed baby these were my salvation It helped relieve soreness while breast is in bra It keeps the sore nipple suspended in midair and off of rubbing on your bra It also helps the nipple stick out a little which I found made attachment of baby s mouth to nipple easier as a first time breast feeder You do need to check the shield now and then to dump out any milk or some may save it The only way I see a product could improve in that area would be to have a bottle size attachment to your boob and whom of us would really want to walk around with that There are holes in the top of the shield to allow air circulation For me esp at night I would put a nursing pad over the holes so that it would help soak up any leakage But by FAR this product is worth it I m due soon with baby 2 and am back to buy more I gave mine to a mom friend who was ready to give up breastfeeding her very hungry son who ate all the time and her breasts were unbearably sore She swears these shields are the reason she didn t have to give up and is extremely grateful Definitely worth the try 
5 0 Great Help To Me These breastshells helped me during pregnancy and post During pregnancy they helped draw out my flat and what I know now as small nipples Post pregnancy they helped relieve engorgement because they exert a small amount of pressure on the areola This helped my baby latch on better b c the breast wasn t soooo full I have a lot of milk The shells catch milk really well and if they are sterile you can even save the milk The other great thing about these breastshells is that they prevent sore nipples from rubbing on your bra I d put a little lansinoh on my nipples then the breastshells then the bra Just felt better Only precaution Make sure you put them on with the holes on the top or else you will be soaked and they really can t be worn outside your home They are obvious and unattractive 
4 0 Function over form They look awful but if you have sore cracked nipples or inverted nipples they are the only thing that will really fix what s wrong The good news is if you use breast shells when you need them for the above mentioned maladies you won t have to use them for long because you will heal after just a few days even if you wear them part time They come with little curved white sponges that you just drop in the bottom of the shell These sponges absorb the milk that leaks so that you don t have to worry about it comming out of the vent holes at the top when you bend over I just would rinse them with soap and water to clean and let air dry I think each breast shell set come with four sponges and you can buy more if you need them but 4 was enough for me NOTE don t use them to collect milk to give to your baby as one reviewer suggested The milk collected in a breast shell is to be discarded as it states in the package instructions 
4 0 Like Them I found them very comfotable for my sore nipples They also collect leaking milk but don t bend over as they will spill all over your feet my first try Other than this and having to wear a loose shirt to hide them I will use them everyday instead of pads that get wet and irritate my nipples 
5 0 Fast and reliable great for the other car or grandma s car easy to use and secure 
5 0 Very Happy This is our second Combi stroller and we like this one as much as the first except for the clasp on the belts We actually cut the belts off our old one and sewed it onto this one The stroller is sturdy without being heavy and our children love to have the bar across the front and they really like to be able to sit forward if they want to which is difficult in a regular umbrella type stroller I have read other reviews saying that if you re tall it s difficult to push this I disagree My husband is 6 1 and he finds it very comfortable to push as does a friend who is also over 6 
5 0 Great product Gave as a gift to my son and his wife and they rave about it They like it s compact size light weight carry strap and especially the swing out arm so their toddler can climb into it herself 
4 0 correction to my other review Okay so the canopy Well it was touching my sons head however there is a natural bend in the metal that holds the canopy up that slides through the canopy like a curtain rod where it connects to the stroller and I took it out and put it though the other way and my son has like 2 inches between his head and the canopy For the other people that had or will have this problem this is an easy fix I hope some people who already left reveiws will come back and read this I give it 4 stars now instead of 3 on my other reveiw My other reveiw is labeled kamarina 
5 0 Best Stroller Out There I got this as a gift when my second child was born and I absolutely lvoe it My children are a year apart and are both very comfortable in it The ride is magnigicent We can hit a bump and the kids don t even notice it It provides excellent sun protection from a wonderfully deep canapee I would recomend this to anyone who needs a double stroller Then only drawback and it is small is tht it is not portable It doesn t fit in the trunk of our car But other then that it is a great stroller 
5 0 Great value I decided to purchase this stroller after testing our neighbors Our street is full of parents with babies and on Sundays the street looks like a stroller racing track That was great for me and my wife We were able to see and test many strollers as they all seem to be on our street and in the area I was lucky to push some other brands that are more expensive and I must say this stroller just felt better then the other strollers we tested This stroller is fully loaded with all the features a parent and child could ask for I especially like the individual lower recline feature The stroller rolls with such ease and the rain cover being included is a great idea as they cost around which takes the base price up on many other strollers Our little guy s both a year old now they are twins have a great time in this stroller and seem to be very comfortable I was thinking of purchasing a model with front swivel wheels but I just did not like the way the swivel wheel felt I tested three different brands The one I liked sold for more then and compared to this stroller I just could not justify spending that kind of money The other two front swivel wheeled strollers that I tested had a rattle feel to the front wheel area which I was so surprised about considering they both sold for more then I am not sure if that was because they were 12 inch wheels or if it was the designs This stroller is one of those purchases I am very pleased about and it has held up perfectly for us over the last year 
5 0 Works Well This is exactly what we needed to keep our baby from getting hurt on the bath tub spout 
5 0 Snap apart dish This is a great product and has tight fitting lids It is also dishwasher safe and microwaveable This vendor also ships to APO addresses thank you 
5 0 Great To Go Dish This dish is great for those parents that are on the go and need to take baby s meal with them The snap on cover is good and it s all dishwasher safe 
5 0 BEST DISH This dish is the best especially if your child will be with a sitter at all You can prepare meals with a hot dish and cold fruit that can be kept seperate during heating I am getting several more for our second baby 
5 0 TIME SAVER This is one of my favorite gifts to buy new moms they ll get more use out of this gift than just about anything I can think of Not only is it easy to use it s dishwasher safe it can fit just about anywhere you can store anything in it the colors are bright and kids like to play with them I think it s also economical and enviornmentaly friendly since ziplock baggies are so expensive you ll end up saving a lot of money by using the snap apart dish The best part is that these hold up really well while keeping your snacks food fresh I just love these 
5 0 Great carseat latch is a little hard to use sometimes I ordered this carseat after reading all the great reviews it got it is a really nice attractive and comfortable carseat Only thing is the plastic latch that snaps in front of the baby s chest can be kind of hard to unsnap sometimes but overall I love this carseat Matches the black interior of our car too 
5 0 Magical Car Seat This car seat is magical We had ot switch to this seat when our boy turned 4 months old when he grew out of the infant seat carrier He is so comfy in this seat that he never cries in the car and he easily falls asleep in it Sometimes he falls asleep the instant he gets put into the seat This is a baby boy that used to cry cry cry all the time in the car I am so pleased with this purchase 
5 0 Roundabout Carseat by Britax I searched for months before buying this seat for my daughter I read lots of reviews on the internet and had a hard time deciding if I should spend 219 on this seat of just buy a cheaper one I am so happy that I went ahead a spent the extra money This seat is SO worth it The print is great and the fabric is very easy to clean My daughter loves to snack in the car and can make quite a mess I just vacuum the crumbs occassionally and wipe down any other messes with a damp cloth The restraint design is great and very easy to access and use The straps have never gotten twisted or tangled like some other cheaper seats do I used this seat in the rear facing position for about 3 months until my daughter was big enough to turn forwards It was very easy to use in this position as well I love the button you push to loosen the straps and it was still easy to use even in the rear facing position this is a problem in some other convertible seats I have a Nissan Maxima and the seat fit very well both front and rear facing in this relatively small car I highly recommend this product 
5 0 Love it You can download your own music into an mp3 player or an ipod Great sounding speakers latches onto crib 
4 0 It s all a baby needs We have this system on our baby s crib and he seems to like it more than just having music playing on a nearby stereo The sound quality is good at low volumes which are appropriate for a crib at bed or naptime but quality deteriorates quickly once you raise it at all So if you are planning on using this for yourself think again but that s not what it s designed for I do agree that the no A C adapter option stinks but having caught our baby holding on to the IPod charging cord when the IPod was in this device I realize that having an A C adapter would just be a hazard rechargeable batteries would be a great addition that s the only reason I m giving it four stars Our baby LOVES to look at the lights The 15 minute timer is great too as that s all he really needs I d buy it again and plan on getting it for friends with new babies 
5 0 iLove the iCrib After throwing my First Years crib CD player literally in the trash can don t get me started on what a complete hunk of junk that thing was I was on a search to replace it That is when I came across the iCrib You really can t beat the price I m guessing it is reasonable since most of the controlling is done from the iPod itself Granted I have only had it a few days I cannot rave enough about it It mounted perfectly on the crib and I think the sound is fantastic I have only tried classical and not music with lyrics so I cannot comment on that sound quality I inherited my husband s older iPod Shuffle after I gave him a Nano for X mas I searched and searched online but could not figure out whether the iPod Shuffle would work with it Muchkin s customer service verified that it would because it came with a few adapters to accomodate different MP3 players Now I don t really think they made one to specifically fit the Shuffle but it did fit well enough in the small adapter they included so I was happy see the picture I posted of the Shuffle in the iCrib The iCrib itself has 3 modes light only iPod is off light and iPod or just iPod You can also have it play for 15 30 or 60 minutes before it shuts itself off The light is actually what I would consider a light show with the light slowly changing colors which I think is rather calming as does my baby or at least it seems The only things I would change about the iCrib is that I would really like it to have the option of playing longer than 60 min I would also be happier if it had the option of providing a steady soft light to serve as a constant night light no light show to guide me during the middle of the night feedings Otherwise I am thrilled with the iCrib 
5 0 Munchkin s iCrib What a Concept Bella my seven month old daughter was recently given the opportunity to try her very own sound system She was enchanted by the nightlight display and soothed by the music Bella is easy to please Mama is a harder nut to crack a product has to meet several criteria to be deemed developmentally appropriate or at the very least not harmful to her children or those of her readers Cost is important with all the available products on the market for babies and children you want to get the most for your dollar Quality and safety are essential not only do you get a system with superb sound Munchkin has added a volume control device to the unit to protect baby s delicate hearing from undue noise levels I love this feature because many baby products and toys have been found to be so loud they reach levels high enough to cause permanent hearing damage Bravo to Munchkin for the added protective feature Extras are always nice when spending your hard earned dollar this unit offers a nightlight feature a delicate display of changing hues bright enough that mom or dad can check baby in the crib soft enough to encourage sleep The iCrib can be used with or without the nightlight The iCrib also has an auto shut off allowing for 15 30 and 60 minutes of play Ease of use is important when you are running a busy household Set up and installation is simple and if it easy for me anyone can do it You pop your MP3 player into the back of the iCrib then hang it on the crib railing with the adjustable Velcro straps found on the back of the sound system The unit can also be used for travel or enjoying in another room as it has the ability to stand on its own Munchkin s iCrib was found by Bella and me to be an excellent product It exceeds our expectations for cost effectiveness quality features and ease of use The recommended age for the iCrib is 0 and up making it a wonderful gift either for the holidays or a baby shower 
5 0 Angel Baby Blanket With Halo Wings My new great granddaughter looks like she s wrapped in the wings of an angel in this blanket It s very soft and unique 
5 0 Very soft also helpful The blue cat cushystraps are SO soft They are very easy to install and have the added bonus of helping to keep the straps straight in her carseat this way when I go to put her in the seat the straps are not and don t become twisted in the process That used to be a bit of a problem with our Graco seat before we used the cushystraps My 3 month old daughter loves to rub her face and mouth on the straps I imagine theywould have helped hold her head too when she was a newborn 
5 0 Awsome way to carry your little one This wrap is soo comfortable I initially purchased an over the shoulder ring sling and found that no matter how I positioned my baby my neck and back would end up killing me afterward Then someone at my mothers group introduced me to the Moby and I fell in love No more aches and pains and my baby loves it Whenever he is fussy and he sees me take it out he calms down It looks complicated to put on but with a few practice runs you will soon become a pro I just started carrying him facing out and he is really enjoying it This carrier is a great investment since it works for all ages newborn toddler and there are so many different ways to wrap it There is even a wrap for nursing and one for carrying twins I cannot recommend this enough 
5 0 A great carrier I received a different carrier and both me and my baby hated it he couldn t see what was going on and it seemed to smother him and it hurt my back I decided to purchase the Moby and I am so happy with it You can wear it a million different ways well not a million but a lot and it s so comfortable It only took me twice to get the hang of how to put it on My son loves it too My shoulders or back never hurt after carrying him in it I also love the book it comes with to show you the different ways in which to wear it If you lose it you can go to the manufacture s website and you can download and print from there I ve bought two more for my friends since I got mine 
5 0 A Must Have for Colicky Babies This is number one on my list for how my husband daughter and I have survived her months of colic What we like about it The Moby wrap was able to be used the day we brought our preemie baby home from the hospital The Moby wrap swaddles your baby snuggly to you If your baby likes swaddling as much as our does this is the baby carrier for you It spreads the weight out evenly across your back and shoulders and feels much better for longer periods of time in comparison to our Baby Bjorn There are a variety of ways to wear your baby with this carrier We have used it 4 different ways so far Being able to pull the cloth completely over her so she can sleep soundly is a plus The instructions are easy to follow and while it looks difficult to put on it really is quite simple after you ve practiced it 3 or 4 times The Moby wrap is easy to clean with being machine washable and dryable and there are no parts that can be broken or lost What we don t like about the Moby wrap If you plan on wearing your baby to go grocery shopping or other things out in public you need to put it on before you leave the house It can be difficult to put on in the car or in places where you do not feel comfortable with the wrap touching the floor parking lot public floor etc This is not a big deal but important to remember before you run out the door During the cooler months I put the Moby on then my coat Bottom line The Moby wrap was an excellent purchase Putting our daughter in it and walking around or bouncing on an exercise ball was one of the few ways to calm her during the height of her colic Our daughter is now 5 months old and still enjoys the Moby We expect to continue to use our Moby wrap for many more months 
5 0 Moby Wrap Well I don t have any children nor do I plan on changing that however I bought this Moby Wrap for my best friend for a baby shower gift and she was absolutely thrilled She told me it s very ergonomically designed and comfortable for both mother and baby She s been coveting one since the birth of her first child she s pregnant with 2 now She also told me that if you are creative there s all sorts of different ways you can wrap the dealy to attach your child to yourself so that should be fun The Moby wrap comes with a little packet detailing different adventures in child wrapping I m very happy I purchased this for a gift 
5 0 Best Carrier I ve Ever Used I ve tried a lot fleece pouch my 2nd favorite Snuglies Maya Wrap OTBH The Moby Wrap is comfortable and flexible you don t have to worry about size It s not too heavy or bulky no buckles rings snaps or straps It s great 
5 0 soooo worth it The most useful thing I have had since I had my baby I don t have inverted nipples I have 38 DDD or E breasts which were not to easy for a little baby to get a hold of the nipples with all of the extra flesh smothering her face I know that sounds weird but hey everyone has their own problems with breastfeeding in the begining I just needed an extra boost so that my daughter could get a good latch I stopped wearing them after a couple of weeks after she got the hang of it Like I said The most useful thing I have had since I had my baby It really calmed us down in an already stressful time 
5 0 Would Highly Recommend this product Our son was born in the middle of September During the first day we definitely had problems The day after having him my lactation consultant suggested these and hubby ran to babysrus to buy these I wore them for an hr before feeding time and our son truly fed for the 1st time and was able to stay latched for the entire 40mins that he took They were effective immediately and these were such a godsend You dont have to worry about the nipple confusion etc that you might have with a shield and previous review is right most of the time I would easily forget they were there and would have to check to make sure Also they are not noticeable under clothing so you can wear these anywhere I also wore these when I had leakage problems and I never had to worry about leaking through my clothes in public or something Our son is now 4mnths old and I havent had to use these since he was 2mnths old I m saving these for any future kids of ours and I recommend them to anyone with inverted or flat nipples 
5 0 The best My daughter was hospitalized and forgot how to nurse and would naw and get frustrated The nipples on the shield are long and she was able to re learn how to nurse using these shields I highly recommend these for moms who have trouble nursing 
5 0 life saver these works wondres I have flat nipples and was getting very frustrated with breastfeeding This was my last resort before I was going to give up They have worked great with drawing out the nipple I noticed a different within the first day of wearing them They also help sore nipples too 
4 0 More than satisfactory for the price We are expecting triplets and needed three cribs Though affordable this product does not look cheap at all My husband assembled them all by himself in three hours It fits a regular crib mattress Although one of the height adjustable sliding frames had a problem with its spring and the drawer is somewhat unstable we are still more satisfied than disappointed Hope the babies will love them too 
4 0 Great crib for the price I ordered this crib for my daughter who will arrive on or before March 30 2007 We received this crib one week before the actual delivery date so that was a nice surprise My husband and I put the crib up with no problems at all The wood is not the best quality but what do you expect you paid 180 for it The finish is nice and makes it look like an expensive crib There was only one scratch mark and it was on the back of the crib so it really was not a big deal Overall we are extremely pleased with this crib and cannot wait for the arrival of our daughter 
4 0 good product for the price and good customer service Like the cherry to suit our bedroom furniture and it is not very flimsy as the other cribs we saw for similar price range The box arrived in time and had almost everything in good condition except for the rails Called the storkcraft customer service number and they shipped the brand new rails in time Overall a pleasant experience 
5 0 The best stroller there is Me and my wife have two toddlers the older 3 years and the younger 9 month old We searched for a sturdy twin stroller for quite a while that would be comfortable for the kids and comfortable to use In short this stroller is a dream The Duallie Revolution is by far the best twin stroller on the market and the BOB products seem to be built to last Highly recommend 
5 0 Great Item for cooler days I have a Bundle Me already but it has been getting too warm for it However it s still chilly enough and at times windy that I still needed a cover I love the Original Bundle Me so much I invested in this liter one and I love it My little one loves it as well It s so soft and still keeps her cozy Highly recommend 
5 0 Super cute and fun I love this little Tigger jumper It has a Tigger head on the front and a little tail on the back I read reviews of kids getting injured from other jumpers that had trays which is why I chose this one We also have a Jumperoo which I like too 
4 0 bouncing tigger this is a great item the only thing i don t like is it is hard to get child in and out of otherwise baby loves it 
4 0 love it I have a 5 month old and a 23 month old they both love it the only thing is that it is REALLY hard to get them out that is why it got 4 stars 
5 0 You NEED this item Twenty five years ago my son had a Johnny Jump Up We spent hours laughing at his antics and he loved it This item is a definite improvement over the old It s higher and gives more support it s cuter and most important it s actually washable Now I know not all kids will like these I ve heard of a few who just hung there and refused to bounce but chances are your little ones will love it My new grandson sure does 
4 0 Wonderful Product The Bouncing Tigger that we purchased for our daughter is wonderful I love how the front and back of the seat come up high and it supports her Also how it is washable She has so much fun bouncing around in it Also the clamp that holds it in the doorway is extra tight I feel secure in knowing that it is going to support her while she is playing 
5 0 table for everything For tykes that are always creating new things from playdough to serving tea This folding table and chairs are just great 
5 0 It Does What it Claims Love this I ve washed it a few times run a mop over it and even had the vacuum on it as well Not one part of it is falling apart Nice grip on the bottom too Love it and it doesn t have some silly cartoon character printed all over it My kitchen doesn t have to look like a nursery yeay 
5 0 The best baby item yet I got this mirror as a baby shower gift I absolutely love it I can just look in my rear view mirror and see my son in his car seat I like that I can check on him while we are driving It s great 
5 0 Best value for the price Product arrived in record time It was quick and easy to assemble Best yet it fit and looks good in the hard wood hall way entry we needed to place it in to keep our pet from entering a Music study practice room where my wife keeps her precious Baby Grand Piano and Persian carpets 
4 0 Dawn This was a really nice buy The toys are very bright and colorful and they were pretty well together My niece loved them The only thing that I have as a con is it comes in one box and some pieces were loose Other than that very nice 
5 0 Great For Newborn And Toddler In The City I purchased this stroller for my newborn and a 2 year old I originally planned on getting a tandem front to back stroller but when I test drove it at the store it felt like a huge long heavy and clumsy tank and that s without the kids in it There is no way I d be able to maneuver the tandem stroller on the busy city streets Then I tried this Aria Twin Side By Side stroller and it felt so much better then the tandem it was so light and easy to maneuver So I purchased it and I really like it It says that the stroller is from 6 month old and up but I successfully use it with a newborn the seat reclines almost fully and the newborn lays in it and sleeps This stroller fits through all standard doors and most supermarket isles The basket is large and fits a lot of stuff Walking in the city with my 2 year old and newborn is pretty easy with this stroller The only major downside of this stroller is that it doesn t hold a car seat 
5 0 Practical very light weight I am very happy with stroller car seat combo I take it everywhere because it does not weight a lot You can store it anywhere Very convenient to carry It is highly recommended The price of the set is terrific 
4 0 Great Stroller but not for city dwellers I received the Combi Ex Travel System for my baby shower It looked like the perfect size weight for city living Unfortunately it did not work out that way The stroller began squeaking and falling apart from all of the bumping around on brick and cobblestone through the city The basket is also very very tiny and is inhibited by a large bar through the middle I would reccommend this stroller for use on smooth surfaces The carseat is great and easy to use but the stroller was not what I expected One tip for the urban parent sink your into a good stroller with shocks It s worth it 
5 0 Love it after checking it out moving things around open and close a few times took the seat out and put it back and I love it Easy to use very soft and perfect for me but I m 5 10 
4 0 Very Luxurious and Stylish I received this travel system yesterday and couldnt wait to put it together The car seat comes fully assembled but the stroller needs to be put together I didnt find it difficult at all since everything just snaps into place I gave this 4 stars because I find it a little difficult to attach the carseat to the stroller I find myself having to try quite a few times before it snaps into place The other thing is that closing the stroller needs some practice before you can get it right Other than those two issues the stroller system is very classy and different from others out there The material is very soft to the touch and the huge wheels make it a whizz to push around 
5 0 STYLISH STROLLER AWSOME I purchased this stroller for my grandaughter and I can t say enough good things about it The stoller and carrier are beautiful The color teal is true to color it s very suttle My daughter is a young mother so she wanted to have a stroller that s effective and looking good at the same time This stroller is the best 
5 0 A must have for pumping mamas I went through many AA batteries before discovering this little gem This fits my Medela Pump In Style Advanced pump I ve heard that it doesn t fit all Medela pump models so just verify first 
5 0 A Must Have I too bought this for a road trip I was taking It worked like a charm As a little warning I usually pump on speed 5 however with the vehicle adapter I guess the power is that much stronger I could only pump on speed 1 or 2 Don t go cranking that baby up at first The cord was nice and long so I was able to pump from the back seat I keep it right with my pump just in case 
5 0 Great for Long Trips I purchased the car adapter for a 10 hour drive that my husband and I were making with our toddler and infant I pump exclusively not able to breastfeed so the adapter was a Godsend We didn t even have to pull over Just make sure you are well covered and don t end up stuck in traffic next to people who are probably wondering what you re up to unless you re into that sort of thing 
5 0 Excellent product seller This seller provided this great item hard to find locally quickly conveniently at a great price The diaper pail works great wonderful that you don t need special bags Very pleased 
4 0 A must have I have placed the stinkiest and most foul diapers in this diaper pail and TRUST ME It works The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because I do have to change the garbage bag once a week and I feel that the bag is only 1 2 to 3 4 full I read the others reviews about the odor seeping out but that hasnt happened to me My husband even throws diapers in this pail unwrapped poop hanging out everywhere and we have not had any odor problems I think this is a wonderful buy 
4 0 I ll Get to the Point I purchased the stroller sight unseen no one around here has it in stock yet I have a 20 month old and a 7 month old YES it is STILL heavy but Graco never claimed it was LIGHTER just more COMPACT so I just figure it will help tone my arms up It gets around great The only two things I found I would change on the stroller are 1 the cupholders are small in diameter and do not accomodate most of my sons sippy cups and 2 I have a hard time lowering the cargo basket maybe its just my model I received the stroller with the brake shattered but called Graco and they immediately sent a replacement free of charge great cust service I d spend the money again 
5 0 great stroller I have a 19 month old daughter and one due in August so I have been on the look out for a double stroller that I actually liked When we saw the quattro duo we couldn t wait for it to come out We waited for it to hit the shelves which did not happen around here yet So we nervously ordered it online without a test drive Our nerves were settled when we recieved it the other day Yes it is heavy but I manage fine It is longer than the picture but if it was any shorter you could not fit 2 children in it This stroller has too many nice features to dwell on the small negatives The best part besides the easy fold down is that it fits easily with room into my car I have a Mazda 6 This was a big worry but not anymore I love this stroller and and very happy with the purchase 
5 0 Best Stroller Ever Well Worth the Wait I have never been so excited about a new gadget Put it together in ten minutes with the assitance of my very excited toddler I was getting very impatient waiting for this stroller to come on the market but couldn t be more pleased that I did I had researched them all and was going to buy it sight unseen which made me nervous Went to a local retailer yesterday and after an instore test drive with my almost 3yr old and my 3 month old bought it immediately I can t say enough great things about this stroller Especially as a mom of toddler and infant It handles like a dream all the bells and whistles are fabulous Folds like a piece of cake Which I can t say about my perego The basket drops down so you can access it without changing the rear seat position My 3yr old thinks it is the coolest thing ever and she loves the fact that her baby sister is right behind her Yes it is a little heavy but I am a small woman and can manage just fine After all my oldest weighs 28lbs It is a little longer in person than in the photos no big deal We all went for our first family stroll after dinner last night it was amazing Handles fantastically over bumpy sidewalks no need to prop up the srtoller to get over a bump So STURDY feel like both my girls are snug and safe Love that the five point harness is attached to the seat unlike the perego Really if you have to children particularly a baby and toddler this is the way to go 
5 0 What a cool stroller I just received this stroller yesterday I am 9 months pregnant and I was able to bring it inside and put it together by myself in less than 15 minutes I did notice that the right break had been crushed in shipping I called Graco this morning and they are sending me a new one for free no questions asked The stroller is a bit longer than it is portrayed in the picture but it is still smaller than the Duo Glider and it handles wonderfully It is definately something I would not mind taking to the mall I love how the rear basket can be dropped down not being able to access it with the baby seat in was a peave of mine with my quattro tour single It is a little tough to get the baby seat in and out because there is not a lot of space but it is nice that it is so compact I am sure I will get better with practice If you are looking for a double stroller this is the one to buy 
5 0 Love this stroller After receiving no help from Babies R Us in trying to order this we decided to go ahead and purchase this without even touching it It made me nervous but after reading everyone s reviews I figured lets give it a shot Wow love this stroller I am still working on putting the infant seat in and out but as far as menoovering this it is great I have a son who is almost 3 and loved it so much that he wanted to be pushed to his bedroom in it and this thing went around corners with no problems without even bumping the walls Now I know the purpose is not to use it in the house but after reading a review that this was hard to steer I had to make sure I put this comment in here This stroller is so much more attractive than the old Duo Gliders I feel like a hip mom 
4 0 Happy so far I have been researching strollers for months I also considered the Combi Aria twin and Maclaren I test drove the side by side strollers but they couldn t fit through tight store aisles I liked the Combi and the Aria s width but they were awkward to steer and I didn t care for the storage in any of them I agree with the above comments but the pros outweight the cons It is heavy and it doesn t fold down as compactly as I would like but my son absolutely loves climbing in the front seat I am 5 2 and I liked the handles and found it very easy to steer I love the storage baskets and my infant seat fits great I am happy with the Metropolitan fabric It seems like I can wipe clean I fit most of my grocerys in the basket underneath so I don t have to put both children in a germy shopping cart Cup holders are nice too Very easy to fold easier than my single Graco stroller 4 stars because it is heavy and a bit awkward to carry 
5 0 Awesome stroller worth the I owned the Quattro Tour single stroller and was so excited when the Duo version came out I ordered it without ever seeing it and it has definitely lived up to my high expectations Simply stated this is a heavy duty deluxe version of a Duo Glider worth the extra money if you can afford it The seats are large enough for growing children I have a one yr old and a two yr old and I foresee they will both fit in the stroller for a couple of years I test drove all other double strollers at Babies R Us and Baby Depot and they all seem to have low seat backs which won t give any head support if the child falls asleep The stroller itself is heavy so if you have to lug it around or upstairs keep this in mind I keep mine in the back of my truck so just getting it in and out is no big deal I read other reports stating it is hard to steer and I have had no problems with steering at all One thing I can say is if you are a tall person this stroller is awesome because of it s higher handle grips I am 5 9 and my husband is 6 4 and we both use it with ease The underseat basket is large and there is an additional cubby under the front seat great for extra storage Parent cupholders and child trays cups are designed well Fabric is high quality The only minor thing I am annoyed with is the low quality seat restraints Seat belts My single Quattro Tour and DuoGlider both had high quality padded seat belts with much better buckles This one has very low quality nylon straps and marginally acceptable buckles I also received my box in very poor shape open crushed on one side I only noticed scratches to the stroller so didn t feel it was worth going through a return process for cosmetic issues What is up with the shipping ULTIMATELY After hours of test drives and quite a bit of research I would recommend this over all other equal and higher dollar strollers It is overall very high quality and for those worried about style it is a very sharp looking stroller in person 
5 0 I LOVE this stroller I received my Graco Quattro Tour Stroller last week after waiting over a month for it to be released It was SO worth the wait This stroller is so easy to steer and both kids have plenty of leg room There is a large storage basket underneath and plenty of cupholders It pushes like a dream even with my 2 boys who are over 30 lbs each I have owned Duo Gliders in the past and they were so much bulkier than this and so hard to steer I HIGHLY recommend this stroller On another note I was very pleased with the service I received from Amazon com 
4 0 Good bottles few problems My strictly bottle fed 11 month old has used these bottles from day one and has done fine with them I saved money by buying them at thrift stores about half of them I bought still in the boxes and the other half barely used I ended up switching out the older nipple design square top with the newer nipples because I liked the design better It seemed to me that the newer design is more correct for suckling I also bought a lot of new boxes of liners at the thrift store too My daughter suffered from mild gas but nothing major I liked these bottles because of the liner idea and my best friend had used them I wish the nipples would have come in more than two stages though because when my daughter hit about 4 months the slow flow were too slow and the fast flow were too fast I ended up putting straight pins in the slow flow and boiling them with the pins in to open the holes a little more It worked fine The only time the bottle ever leaked was when I used the drop in liners and that s because it wasn t seated right on the rim of the bottle Many reviewers complained that the drop ins don t hold a full 8 ozs and they are correct To solve this problem I simply stuck with the standard liners and I don t buy the Playtex brand I buy the Parent s Choice PC brand at Walmart Another thing to be careful of is the measurements aren t always correct I bought the Target brand 4 oz liners and realized after several bottles that the 4 oz mark on the liner was only 3 ozs The PC liners are correct All in all I like these bottles but am getting tired of the liners I am currently reading reviews of other bottles and considering switching with our next child I m really liking what I m reading about the Dr Brown s but will possibly try a couple other brands as well I m realizing that saving tons of money isn t always what s best for my daughter We ll see 
4 0 Just about only bottles I ever used for 15 years I absolutely love these bottles I have used them with all 3 of my children with great success and my oldest is almost 15 Gas was never a problem and my babies hardly ever spit up Everyone always commented on how nice my babies always smelled because they never had that sour smell that babies that spit up so much do I worked in numerous daycare centers and any time a parent had problems with a gassy baby that spit up all the time I always recommend Platex Nursers to them 9 x s out of 10 their problems were drastically reduced thanks to Playtex I am now pregnant with my 4th baby and though I plan to breastfeed as much as I can if I need a back up bottle or nursing doesn t work for some reason then Playtex will be my bottle of choice Of all the new bottles out there on the market Playtex will still be my number 1 bottle of choice If there would be any drawback at all it would be the cost of the liners But I often got lucky and would find some at yardsales or on sale and would stock up Also some store brands carry liners just as good I had a few plastic bottles around just in case of running out but my babies didn t like them nearly as much and I could always tell a difference in their happiness because they would get gassy again Buy the Playtex Nursers They are well worth the money 
5 0 what a great tub We recently just bought this tub after having one of those convertible tubs which we hated This tub is great and my daughter loves it Her long legs aren t scrunched like in the other tub and we don t have to worry when she squirms because all the sides are soft It is easy to fill and drain and travel with The bottom isn t slippery so although she can t sit up without assistance she is able to sit up in this tub without slipping We highly recommend this tub The Jr size is perfect for the younger months she just turned 4 months and maybe we will even get the bigger one the deluxe This makes bathtime enjoyable for us all 
5 0 Great Tub for 6 months+ I have twin girls 8 months old and once they learned to sit up they no longer wanted to lay back in the original tub I bought them I tried to fix it so that they could sit up but it was complicated and they were just not comfortable I bought the Snug Tub Jr so that they could have a place to sit and enjoy bath time safely Even better I bought two of the snug tubs and they both fit in our standard tub They sit up face each other and the inflated sides make me feel comfortable that they won t hit their heads The only bad thing I have to say is that it is a little hard to close the plastic stopper But overall we LOVE it 
4 0 Great gate for wides spaces hard to install The gate is wonderful once you get it in right The instructions don t give you clear enough directions and I ended up putting the latching piece on upside down the first time The pictures were pretty useless but once you figure out the right way to install it goes in in a snap To make it more stable you can keep the gate locked to swing only one direction which makes it extra stable against kids puching on it We had to move our once our kitchen remodel was done and it came down simple and went up in a new door way really easy The latch itself on ours has to be pushed down as it will not latch into place by itself now but it is a very solid gate And for being over 2 years old it has held up great The latch handle can t be opened by anyone with small hands as you have to squeeze both sides so anyone with kids under 2 3 who can open it have installed it wrong Make sure the latch is hooked to the wall properly 
4 0 Serves the purpose I got this as a gift off of my baby registry Although it is quit heavy to carry I haven t had any major problems with this seat I like the look and quality of the product My son doesn t mind the straps and I hope that as he grows it won t be a problem for him We are happy about this gift and plan to buy the stroller to match soon 
5 0 Very Happy With New SIP Primo Viaggio We ve been using Peg Perego s newest SIP car seat since our son was 6 weeks old Our son LOVES this car seat he NEVER fusses in it and is always happy to go for a ride As other posters have mentioned the seat angle is very high and upright We personally didn t find this to be a problem as it helps with our son s reflux Another poster mentioned the straps are uncomfortable however pads for the shoulder straps are included with purchase We found the canopy to be quite sufficient We have an older Primo Viaggio from 2002 and like the features of the 2006 version ever better Yes it is expensive but IMO the safety of the seat is worth it Plus you don t have to re thread the straps everytime you need to readjust the shoulder height 
5 0 a must for anyone with a newborn This swaddler is a must for anyone who has a newborn i have two of these and we use them every time he sleeps both at night and during naps They are so much easier then regular swaddlers that he squirms out of or just come undone arent big enough ect 
5 0 Swaddle away We swaddled our daughter until she was 6 months old This blanket does not work on very small babies but we started using it around 2 months It is wonderful The only problem we had with it was when our daughter was strong enough she could break out of it At that point we switched to the Miracle Blanket which really works like a straight jacket there is no escaping Our daughter is now seven months old and sleeps unswaddled She has slept through the night 12 hours since two months of age and I really believe that she is such a good sleeper because of the swaddling 
4 0 Worth it These things are great If you have a colicky baby and most of us do to some extent read the Happiest Baby on the Block and get the SwaddleMe baby wrap Yes you can learn how to swaddle with a blanket but these are SO much easier in part because how many LARGE square blankets do you actually see out there required for swaddling Only downside for us is that the velcro loop section wears out in about 2 3 weeks depending on usage levels Not a huge problem since the need for swaddling usually ends around 3 months and they aren t expensive It would also be nice to have the loop section larger to accommodate longer skinny babies Our son is a bit too long for the small but WAAY to skinny for the Large 
5 0 Great for the first few months of baby s life I received this bassinet as a gift while pregnant with my second child after telling my mother that the second time around I wanted a better bassinet that has a side that comes down to access baby easily the one I used with my first was a cheap hand me down bassinet which was fine except I couldn t see the baby or pick her up without having to basically get up out of bed This was a great find My son is almost 5 months old now and he doesn t want to leave this bassinet but it is definitely time he is big for his age and is really outgrowing it Things I am happy about I am able to see him without having to hardly lift my head at all and can pick him up without having to strain or get out of bed WONDERFUL This is the mini co sleeper and is small and unobtrusive Fits nicely next to my side of our bed with not a whole lot of extra room in that space Easy to tote around when traveling as well once broken down is quite compact Folds up very easily similar to a pack n play but even easier I think once you know how to do it take the mattress out press the buttons on the rails and fold Has a great little place to store extra blankets the instructions the carrying case etc below in a zipped up compartment Things to note The mattress is a bit hard basically like a pack n play mattress a board topped with some padding and a polyester or whatever material cover so I top it with the sheet it came with along with a blanket that I tuck tightly under the sides The mattress does not sit flush with the side rails The lowered side rail sits at the same level as your bed and the baby mattress is a bit lower than that so the bassinet is not exactly an extension of your bed you cannot just reach across and scoot baby to you I thought it would be like that but it isn t but actually I like this a bit better after all They sell leg extensions that raise the bassinet to the height of your bed if need be We needed the extensions and after putting them on the lower side rail was at the same level as our bed The extensions made the bassinet a bit wobbly which worried me some but turns out it is just fine even with my 2 year old bouncing around in it Our little one did end up with his head against the side on a few occasions but like someone else wrote the one side is mesh and he was just fine You kind of have to make sure the mattress lies level in its spot kind of hard to explain without a visual aid but basically the board in the mattress creates the level surface underneath it is just a mesh screen that has Velcro to connect the sheet which also has Velcro in the right place Hopes this helps in your decision making 
5 0 Great peace of mind Having lost a neice to SIDS I was very nervous that my baby would stop breathing at night This co sleeper got me through the first 5 months because I could reach over and check her breathing any time during the night I could sleep or nap right next to her without fear of rolling on her She would not sleep in it until she was 3 weeks old but after that she was just fine I would definitely use it again if I have more children 
5 0 great product My first child was a terrible sleeper and ended up spending most nights of her first year sleeping in bed with us When my second was born I did not want to repeat the horrible year of sleepless nights We got the co sleeper and have never slept better with a baby in our room It was not hard to set up I put it up by myself 2 days before I delivered without any problems All you have to do is follow the directions It was nice to have the baby so close to me for nursing but not actually in the bed Everyone slept better As for the sheets I went to the fabric store and bought a long piece of flannel and tucked it under It stayed put and worked for the 7 months we used the co sleeper I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has a baby sleeping in their room 
5 0 Great Item This item was well loved in our family I want to go ahead and state my only disappointment with it though that was the fact that it took a lot of elbow grease to collapse it for travel or storage It was very stiff always became my husband s job He didn t like to do it either by the way Otherwise it was great to have I was able to use it until my daughter was 8 months old by then she could crawl out so it was not safe to use It was nice to have her close for the middle of the night breastfeedings And since we only have a queen bed it was good to be able to put her into it after a feeding so my husband I could have more room in the bed Finally for the middle of the night diaper changes or clothes changes my daughter was a HUGE spitter upper it was wonderful to have everything right there where I needed it It was like a second changing table I used it as a changing table while I was sitting on the bed If I was standing it was uncomfortably low I had to bend down too much I m 5 10 One more thing it s great for when your baby wants to nap I rolled it close to the window when she was a newborn so she could get some sunlight to help rid her of jaundice 
4 0 Great buy I live in a studio apt with limited space and this is perfect for me I love the storage on the bottom I keep all my sons blankets and sheets in there It is just the right size and fits snuggly in the corner I do however have the same problem as another mom My son likes to scoot himself diagionally and ends up sleeping with his face against the wall But his nose does not press against it and the walls are ventilated so I dont worry to much I have cats and the canopy works perfect in keeping them out of the sleeper The sheets are very pricey at about 15 each one of my complaints I like the fact that the matress has a wipeable surface It is so much easier to clean I would recommend this product to anyone as well as grandparets who are looking for something when thier grandkids come to visit 
4 0 Delightful for years still enjoying it When I saw this toy on Amazon I kid you not I jumped up and down This is one of the most beloved of all the toys that we bought our nephew and he has lost the cars over the years So I may buy it again just to get them back for him he loves it so much that when I called the other day he was playing with the empty garage The garage doors can get off track momentarily but it s easy to fix If you teach a child and the adults who play with him to put the cars back in their garages each time it becomes a marvelously portable toy with which to play for hours We gave it to him around 21 months and now at almost five he still likes it It s especially gratifying to see such love for a no tech toy from a kid who constantly receives toys that light up beep and do other 21st century tricks Here is a simple toys that brings hours of fun for years and years 
5 0 So far so good My daughters are preemies so I was very concerned about the spaces in the crib This product has worked very well so far and I m happy that I purchased it 
4 0 Both Good and Bad Used for 2 kids so far The Good It protects his feet arms from getting stuck in the slats When they pull up they can chew on the material instead of the wood Easy to remove to wash The Bad The velcro straps at the bottom aren t long enough so they don t stay done The head and foot pieces slide down when pulled on First son pulled one of those pieces down and climbed up on it If this is all you can get I d get it but it does need some improvements 
5 0 Get one Don t fool with frilly bumpers This shield can be used longer than a regular bumper pad you don t have to remove it when baby starts climbing It prevents lil arms and legs from going through the slats when they start wiggling and it s breathable so no worries about baby suffocating in those fluffy bumpers Everyone should use this system 
5 0 Wish we had this to begin with After waking to serious screaming from the nursery to find her six month old had caught her leg between the crib rails my daughter and I searched for a solution to the problem Thanks to reviews from other parents who had experienced similar problems we found the Crib Shield System It works perfectly Although baby Emma tries she has not had a repeat entanglement So now she is on to bigger and better things The Crib Shield System would make a great gift for exspecting parents One less thing to worry about One you probably never even though of but baby will 
5 0 Clear is cool I like that these are clear Unfortunately my daughter stopped using a pacifier but when she did use it I liked being able to still see her beautiful face 
5 0 wonderful product My babies loved to be swaddled in fact they slept best swaddled in the Swaddleme This blanket was just great I didn t discover it until they were about 2 months old so I bought the larger size which we used for a good long while The velcro is large and never did get worn out I had one other brand that didn t stay put the way this one did I used the Swaddleme for many months I found it nice to use in a sling as well Highly recommended if you have a baby who loves to be swaddled 
4 0 Swaddleme Adjustable Infant Wrap The Swaddleme is an awesome product if your baby enjoys being swaddled Our baby slept best when swaddled but could often work his arms out of the blankets that we swaddled him in We found that he stayed swaddled longer and thus slept longer when he was in his Swaddleme I gave my sister one when she had a baby and she loved it so much she ordered two more I couldn t find a local store that sold a large when he outgrew the small one and thus ordered it from Amazon 
4 0 Buy the gingham instead I LOVE this product It s a far better velcro swaddler than the other brands because it uses bigger patches of velcro In comparison to a blanket this is much easier to use and provides much more durable swaddles I m quite good with a blanket but by six weeks of age my son could wriggle out On the other hand at three months he s never wriggled out of the cotton flannel Swaddleme However even in cold weather the microfleece is too hot Several times I ve felt under the blanket to find my son sweaty It s even worse when we combine the swaddle with a sling On the other hand the cotton knit solid colors blankets are too stretchy my son quickly converts his knit Swaddleme into a toga leaving both arms flying free The cotton flannel gingham prints has less stretch than the other two fabrics and plenty enough cover to keep a baby warm at indoor temperatures It is trickier to find but worth the search The microfleece Swaddleme does however make a great non swaddle blanket on cold days particularly when the baby is in a front carrier The velcro is quite versatile 
5 0 The best thing ever I love this product Our little one loves being swaddled and this is so easy to use I dont have to worry about her becoming unswaddled throughout the night We just moved up from the smaller one to the bigger size The fleece ones are nice and warm too 
5 0 5month old still being swaddled It is wonderful to find a product like this that fits older babies My son is 5 months and still has to be swaddled at night to sleep 
5 0 PERFECT PRODUCT I JUST had a baby so writing a review is a totally amazing thing to do at this stage of the game that s how much I love this thing They should pass it out at the hospital Regular swaddles come undone This one stays in place and you can change a diaper without disturbing the arms which is so important Buy more than one 
5 0 Works great The Advanced pump works just as well as the Symphony pump that we used in the Hospital I would definitely recommend this product It is very helpful 
4 0 Handsfree pumping I ve used all sorts of medela pumps hospital grade Lactina Symphony and the PIS advanced is just as good if not better I didn t like the Symphony at all b c the diaphragm that goes on the machine has to be really tight or it won t have good suction which is most of the time I m on my third PIS advanced With my first child I had the PIS advanced backpack first generation and pumped for a year The amount of milk was adequate had enough frozen away for extra month after I stopped I just didn t like the faceplate I broke 3 where you attach the tubing to the faceplate and the storage space for the backpack is very limited Then I bought the PIS advanced shoulder bag with my second child The storage area is better but the faceplate is still the same Then the PIS advanced limited edition came out I saw it and fell in love with it So I had to get it It s the nicest one thus far and long overdue The motor sits in a separate bag and the tubing can fit in the side pocket There is no danger of breaking the faceplate I can just carry that to and from work I have two sets of parts one for home and one at work The bag has lots of storage space and best of all it s chic They have blue chocolate and black It also doubles as a diaper bag for me As for hands free pumping the only reason I was able to pump for a year fist time and now 11mo and still going is b c of the hands free pumping kit You have to get the Medela softcup bras they re comfy anyway that supports handsfree pumping There are 2 tabs inside on the bottom and one latch on the top You don t need to buy the whole hands free pumping kit you just need the loop and hook attachment part 3007073 That hooks onto the top of the bra where there is a latch Then you tie a rubber band thicker kind from any office supply store around the tabs 3 of them two sewn in the bra and one from the loop and hook attachment Then you put the breastshield with connector with bottles attached on your breast Then you loop the rubber band separately around the connector the part where you re suppose to attach the tubing Connect the tubing Viola it should stay there snugly You don t have to hold them anymore You can also use this method with the softfit breastshield If you have larger breasts use bigger rubberbands or link two together Now you can massage to get more milk eat lunch type on the computer whatever just can t lie down You can buy adapter for avent system and pump directly into their bottles or other brands And there is no need to pump every 3 4h after your milk supply is established that s insane In the first few weeks it may be necessary to establish supply I pumped 4 times a day and was able to get min 30oz a day I was bottle feeding breastmilk exclusively then slowly decreased to 3 to 2 to 1 as my baby got older The key is to pump all the milk out with massaging and squeezing your breast and then let it run 1 2min longer Also use the maximum suction you can tolerate this will increase and plateau as you pump If you want to decrease supply just pump shorter and longer period of time lapse in between pumping If you want to increase pump longer and more frequently as well as drink more water eat more I could increase and decrease my supply at will even without breastfeeding I pumped directly into 9 oz or 11 oz avent bottles using the avent adapter avail at Babiesrus There are other systems out there I used the lansinoh milk storage bags to store my milk I store about 10 12oz max 12oz in each bag squeeze all the air out and deep freeze it for 6mo I know lansinoh suggest less than that but it can be done as long as you get all the air out The trick is to use the side of a table push the milk up to the ziplock and squeeze close the ziplock as the air is pushed out Since there are two zippers a little milk can leak out of the first zipper to help get all the air out The bag will expand in the freezer just fine Once it s frozen just don t nick the bag b c it s easy to damage it and it will stay fine for 6mo in a deep freezer Even if you do damage the bag it s ok it s just a pain when you thaw it When you thaw the milk you might see a little precipitate but baby likes the milk just like it was fresh Happy pumping 
5 0 Still running strong with child 2 I received the pump in style as a shower gift for my first child over 3 years ago 2003 Due to medical problems early on I had to exclusivly pump for child 1 The pump worked great I used it several times a day and it was very effective and comfortable I used it for about 3 months straight after she was born I stopped using it not because it wore out but because pumping several times a day for months was so much work that I couldn t keep doing it My determination ran out before the pump s did After that I packed it up and planned on using it again if I had another child Child 2 was born early December 2007 and I was very pleased to find that my Medela pump was still in excellent working order Child 2 was a professional breastfeeder from day 1 so I only used the pump when trying to boost my supply or to relieve pressure from engorgment when the baby wasn t hungry I d say I used it a few times a week for the first 2 months After 2 months I had to go back to work and my Pump in Style came with me I ve been working for a few weeks now and I use the pump twice a day It works as good today as it did 3 years ago The quality has not gone down one bit I plan on feeding child 2 exclusivly breastmilk as long as possible and I m confident that my breastpump will allow me to do so If you plan on going back to work and pumping or if you plan on having multiple children then this is a great pump for the job It LASTS Its expensive but better to spend the money upfront get a pump that works great is effective comfortable and will last you through the years than to throw money away on a cheaper model that you ll end up replacing The pump is so great that I m willing to bet that it ll last right through child 2 and if we decided to have another child it will be ready to go again in a few more years 
4 0 Pretty good but I was hoping for better for the price I like the convenience of being able to carry this pump with me and I like that it comes with pump freeze serve bottles in a separate carrying case with a cooler block Plus the bag is good looking and you wouldn t even know it s a breast pump And the pump itself works well What I was not thrilled about is that the bottles didn t come with nipples and the Medela nipples are not easy to find on their own I had to buy a separate pump and store starter kit 4 bottles caps nipples to get a decent supply Also the pump is a little louder than I thought it would be but if you zip the pump s compartment while you re pumping it does cut down on the noise Another thing is that I expected there to be different speeds of pumping like there was in the Ameda hospital pump I rented for a couple of weeks but even at 319 it has only one speed although you can adjust the vacuum strength Last and this isn t directed specifically at this pump but at all pumps that can pump both breasts simultaneously I don t think they re worth it I don t really even pump both breasts at the same time anymore because it s not easy to sit there holding both cups over both breasts on top of adjusting the dials and possibly holding or trying to soothe a baby I constantly broke the suction seals and dripped milk on my lap And I spent so much time readjusting the cups and trying to get comfortable that I could have just pumped one breast at a time which I do now Fortunately the Medela pump works pretty fast magic on me 
5 0 EXCELLENT I have such a difficult time breastfeeding that it is near impossible for me to do it without crying After seeing tons of lactation consultants I finally decided to pump all of my sons feedings I was given a slightly older model of the Pump in Style Original and was not very comfortable So I rented the Medela Symphony for a month 90 + starter kit That pump was amazing but at 90 a month not so practical So I bought the PiS Advance Although it s not as efficient as the hospital grade Symphony this pump does an amazing job It s much quiter than the original and has the 2 phase suction Not only is the 2 phase suction more efficient I have found that the initial short suck phase preps my body for the more intense longer pulls that follow For most I m sure the original is fantastic but if you re very sensitive the Pump in Style Advance is what you need unless you want to shell out 90 a month The Symphony retails at around 1250 00 OUCH Good Luck 
5 0 Simply the Best I am a daily user of the Pump in Style Advanced breast pump and very happy with the product I ve had to replace the Adapter and the Ice Pack which after contacting the Medela company they replaced it for free and shipped the items out to me pronto Make sure to have extra membranes on hand as they do wear out after frequent use this will affect the efficiency of the pumping if you have faulty membranes Their customer service line has also helped me out with troubleshooting which I have greatly appreciated as well I ve been pumping for 9 1 2 months now and plan to go the full year with the help of my Medela breast pump 
5 0 Love It got a deal I absolutely LOVE this pump It is fast and effective and I get way more milk with this pump than I did with any other that I tried Also these things are expensive so shop around so you don t overpay I got mine from a private practice LC at Add A Little Love com and got not only the pump at a great price but the owner helped me with the issues I was having Bottom line the pump is great but only if you have someone to help and support you too 
5 0 Love it I have been using the My Brest Friend pillow for three months and I LOVE IT It is so secure and never slips or slides like the Boppy pillow or traditional pillows do The cover comes off and can be machine washed but does have to hang to dry which is annoying but still not enough for me to take a star away MBF is also nice and firm which I find a big advantage over the Boppy I cannot recommend this pillow enough I will be buying it for all of my friends who plan to breast feed 
5 0 Better than Boppy easy to clean use it standing up Removable cover zipper make this easy to clean just make sure the velcro is stuck to itself when you wash it or it will stick to all your nice socks My wife tried a boppy for the first month then got this which she used continually for the next six You can even use it standing up or when you move around since the strap goes around your back The strap also provides back support The pocket is a nice touch you put your Lansinoh in it The only possible downside is it isn t that easy to put on with one hand if you are already cradling the baby 
5 0 If you travel by plane 2 times a year well worth the investment We lived abroad with my first born and we used our sit n stroll for three or four international flights a year The kid was comfy and as I was traveling alone with my son most of the time I found it to be very managable with the sit n stroll and my backpack Moved back to the states and had baby number 2 used it often as a loaner stroller to the grandparents when they had the kids in tow and I still used it for flights here all in all a wonderful investment Tips You will need to ask for a seatbelt extender on airplanes no big deal they have them and you will need to raise the armrest to click the seatbelt and then lower it for takeoff Good luck 
4 0 great travel stroller We bought this product back in 2005 and used it during an international trip through several airports It worked as advertised in all the jumbo jets and elicited generally positive reactions from other passengers and flight crew however it could not pass through the aisles of an Embraer commuter plane that we had to take on a short leg of our journey In order to secure it correctly on the airline seat you may have to get a seatbelt extender from the flight attendant Having this car seat stroller is great if you are travelling with small kids they sleep comfortably in it and makes for more efficient transfer between gates I share the observation that others made regarding its inability to take bumps for that reason it is not a good choice beyond travel and maybe use within a shopping mall As a car seat it was OK it just takes some getting used to We never used it in a rear facing configuration so I cannot rebut comments made by other users as regards their problems in that mode 
4 0 Fantastic and convenient Going from lugging around a heavy infant carrier to the convenience of pulling this out of the car and pushing down a lever to bring out the wheels has been a glorious transition It s not the best carseat out there and is a tad inconvenient in some areas but the ease of converting it to a stroller and taking my little girl into stores with it far outweigh the other annoyances One thing I will say when the carseat is in the rear facing position it does tilt forward a bit for my liking When my girl falls asleep her head is usually hanging forward because of the forward slant The seatbelt has to go over the top of the seat so you have to reattach everything every time you put your baby into it and that can get a little annoying The stroller part is great though And it s SO EASY to adjust the tightness of the straps Despite the small wheels it s actually a very smooth ride on concrete and bumpy parking lots Much smoother then any shopping cart with her carseat in it ever was lol I got this as a gift from my mom and didn t think I d like it but I really love it now 
5 0 1 star for Triple Play Products 5 stars for Sit n Stroll Triple Play Products are a joke of a company They have no customer support for example I needed to get a handle for my sit n stroll it took 3 weeks of me calling nonstop for them to get aggravated enough to send me one They also left a voice mail saying I was swearing and harassing them First I never swear when talking to any kind of customer service even if it is a voice mail every time you call for three weeks straight Second if by harassment they mean the first ten days that I called I was nice and the last 11 days I called I told them that their customer service is nonexistent and a joke and that the company had no business ethics what so ever then guilty as charged I also got in touch with Strolex the actual maker of the sit n stroll and tried to get parts thru them they gave me the Triple Play Products phone number When I explained my problem with Triple Play to Strolex they didn t seem to be shocked and even said other people have had the same problem with them The product is great you can get one at with the mesh bag and the sun cover and shipping Great product I just hope you never have to replace parts and if you do need to get parts plan on waiting 3 weeks for a response and to be called a harassing customer because Triple Play Products has no clue what business ethics are 
4 0 Good at both great at neither The stroller is a little flimsy for everyday use and the whole thing is kinda heavy especially with the baby in it It is not hard to transfer from stroller to car seat and back but you need to have a little upper body strength if the baby is still in it I use it as our regular carseat but not our regular stroller We only use the stroller option in airports As for using it for flying I wouldn t do without it It is FAA approved fits in all airplane seats that I ve tried coach and it goes easily through the security checks It is worth the cost just for this I really like this product if you are a frequent flyer however it is kind of a money waster if you don t 
4 0 All important stroller I must say that this is a really good car seat stroller We needed it for a long trip from Europe to Oklahoma It made it sooo much easier Then when we got to the states it was great for the ride from the airport then the other cars we had to use As we were waiting for our other car seats when began to love it even more We were able to go from car to mall church movie store what ever with ease The only thing we didn t like was that it didn t have an umbrella or something to protect for shade and it isn t suitable for rough areas like gravel or large brick areas It tends to move funny around those kinds of areas other than that it has been great 
4 0 Great go everywhere stroller Several months of research combined with real world experience pushing my nieces and nephews in different strollers brought us around to the Bob Revolution We wanted a stroller that could handle rough uneven sidewalks cobblestone streets and off road trails We also wanted to use the same stroller at the mall grocery store and small shops We have a compact lightweight stroller for travel so we focused on three wheelers with air filled tires a rotating front wheel a must have feature for 3 wheelers and a canopy with excellent coverage We looked at strollers from Mountain Buggy Valco Baby Jogger Phil Ted Dreamer Designs etc we were willing to spend a good amount on a quality stroller but we were not about to go for a Bugaboo We decided on the Bob Revolution and we have been very happy with it PROS 1 It is very easy to push over all kinds of surfaces and up hill as well as to steer with one hand 2 The canopy is by far the best we ve seen on any kind of stroller 3 The front wheel swivels 360 degrees and can lock 4 It folds unfolds easily 5 The seat is roomy and seems reasonably comfortable 6 The shock absorbers do more than on the few other strollers that have shocks 7 For a stroller of this size category it is not too wide so we can bring it into small shops and navigate tight aisles and turns easily 8 Although not compact at least this stroller folds up to a decent size that is easy to fit into a car most strollers in this category are much longer and a little wider than this when folded up 9 Wheels are easily removable 10 Not too heavy lighter than similar strollers of this type 11 Plenty of accessories available 12 Good rugged build quality 13 Wheels are made of sturdy plastic = nothing to rust CONS 1 The seat does not recline very far and it requires you to adjust two straps one on either side of the top of the seat back 2 The footrest is not adjustable and I would have preferred a metal plastic kick plate 3 When you fold the stroller it is a little awkward to carry because the front wheel sticks out and you can t keep it folded up without rigging the wrist strap a simple locking mechanism would be better 4 Storage basket could be a little bigger 5 Handlebar is not adjustable however it is high enough for me over 6 tall 6 Seat could use a little more padding Our son seems to be more comfortable in our little Combi 7 No included accessories Keep in mind that this kind of stroller is typically stored in a garage and not folded up all the time This is an excellent stroller and worth the money FYI here s the main reasons why we selected this stroller over similar ones from Mountain Buggy canopy doesn t provide much sun protection too big when folded seat seams uncomfortable hammock style limited padding = squishes the child s shoulders in great build quality though and easy to fold up Valco too difficult to fold up expensive fancy stroller with good padding optional toddler jumper seat looks uncomfortable for toddler if used more than briefly Phil Ted s seems less sturdy fabric footrest too close to wheel so kids can actually push and impede the front wheel optional second seat is innovative design but sacrifices the storage area Alternative We were nt able to actually see test one but the Boogie by Zooper looks interesting because it has a great feature set adjustable footrest with kickplate full reclining seat back and comes with great accessories Apparently the 2006 model has been redesigned to be lighter and fix some issues in older models 
5 0 Worth the Dough My husband and I really hesitated about spending this amount of money on a single baby item We can look back now and say this is was our smartest purchase The swivel wheel is perfect for the curving sidewalks in our neighborhood The shocks make the ride as smooth as glass for our little girl We bought the infant seat attachment bar and the beverage handle attachment bar as well We are absolutely thrilled with this jogger 
5 0 Amazing This stroller is worth every penny The pivot wheel is fantastic I have friends with their jog stollers and the stationary wheel and they struggle to turn it when we re out for walks This one is so smooth and manuverable I think the best feature is the sunshade It is so much bigger than all of the other strollers It really does a great job of keeping the sun off my baby s skin 2 wishes I wish it had a tray for the baby to keep cheerios a sippy cup and I wish that it reclined more 
5 0 A fun smooth riding stroller One of the coolest features on this stroller is the front wheel that you can either lock into position or unlatch so that it rotates Turns on a dime and is so smooth to push it actually makes using this fun The shocks are great baby isn t getting jolted around like in his regular stroller Very pricey but if you can afford it well worth the cost 
5 0 Perfect Perfect traveling changing pad our Graco baby wipes container fits into perfectly if need be along with diaper cream and two extra diapers so if you re on the go you can have it ready and not worry about the whole diaper bag thing This product is easy to set up and take all the stuff out of the pockets you need I can do it with one hand and easy to clean A must have for traveling parents 
4 0 better than plastic I purchased this for my daughter when she out grew her baby tub I didn t like the plastic rings because if she fell back she would get hurt This is a very soft ring It is definately for kids that can sit up on their own I had other friends use this and they loved it enough that they also purchased one It also comes with a nice hanger to hang it on the towel bar in the bath tub I didn t find it too heavy to hang 
5 0 My baby loves it My baby loves the change pad He loves having his diaper changed and as soon as I place him on the pad he starts getting hyper and happy It s soft enough and I like the straps in case I need to grab something near by don t leave baby strapped by himself though 
4 0 great bath set I thought it was a great gift but it was a little high in price 
5 0 Love this seat We love this seat Our son is almost 10 months old and we have been using it since he was 4 months old I was going to go buy a highchair when we needed one but we never needed one I love this chair You can adjust the height as he grows the whole thing goes in the dishwasher the swing out tray is wonderful He is very safe and secure when buckled in We have never had a problem with him kicking off the tray and he s a very active baby I would highly recommend this seat especially if you do not have a very big kitchen and a highchair would be so cumbersome Just make sure it is securely attached to your kitchen chair 
5 0 Gotta have a Bumbo This thing is awesome We even took it to the restaurant with us before my child could sit up on his own We didn t want to leave him in the car seat for an hour because 1 he would get restless and 2 the babies can get flat spots on the backs of their heads from frequent pressures of car seats swings The Bumbo allows you to sit your child if they are unable or unstable sitting on their own in front of you so you can face them and interact with them without having to support them We took our child to a baby class and all of the babies had one of these It really helped free up parents hands so they could play with the children versus holding them up Someone was really thinking when they made this product Get it Don t think twice You won t regret it 
4 0 short lived but satisfies it purpose I bought this for my four month old daughter Within two weeks she was already sitting up unassisted for more than a few seconds because of the Bumbo It satisfies it s job of being a sitting aid and the baby enjoys it for about 7 8 minutes at a time First I was a bit hesitant about buying this due to it s high price but I gave in and did Am I glad that I did I think I could have saved my money and used my baby bouncer for the same purpose 
5 0 Absolutely best monitor on market I ve tried a number of monitors for both my kids returned several as well but this monitor hands down is the best for longest range and for least crackling noise It s pretty much quiet as can be In my view it s not worth buying any other monitor but this one 
5 0 excellent range monitor this monitor has excellent range and picks up even the slightest sound it clips onto my pants and has long battery life as long as i recharge it overnight highly recommended for range and clarity 
5 0 Great monitor This is our first baby monitor so I can t compare it against others but we love it It is very quiet when the baby is asleep There is very little static or interference We haven t ever picked up any other conversation I haven t been able to figure out what frequency is broadcasts at The box and the instructions never say As some others have mentioned the LED lights indicators are nice If I m in the shower I can watch the monitor and see if the baby is making noise even if I can t hear it Also we have no problem with reception anywhere in the house Our house is 2500 sq ft one story just for comparison 
5 0 Works exactly as advertised The monitor works perfectly no hum or buzzing sounds it is really silent until your baby makes a sound Also the range is very good much better than any other unit i have tried before 
5 0 Love it If you like transportation themed rooms this one looks so cute set up We first got a sports themed set for our son but changed our mind to this one The quality is great the bumper is thick and the cars trucks stop signs are soft and fuzzy Definitely a good choice but I like any of the kidsline crib sets We bought a set from this company for our daughter and 2 years later and through many washes it has held up nicely 
5 0 Love the Mini We don t have a large bedroom so the Mini works great I love that our baby is right next to us I m right there if he needs me and I feel quite secure using it It s also quite small which makes for easy travel when we go on an overnight trip somewhere It was definately worth it 
5 0 Fabulous Product CoSleeper is a must It works as a stand alone Bassinet as well as I can put it close to my bed with one side open and when baby wakes I don t have to get up very convenient 
4 0 easy to setup and feels very secure I like this because it was very easy to setup it unfolds quite magically and the strap that goes under the mattress keeps it quite securely close to the bed The only complaint I have is that they don t include any height adjusters with it So I will have to order them seperately We decided the baby needed to sleep on a slight incline so we ordered a foam wedge from Amazon 
5 0 Compatible with Playtex airvent I originally purchased the Avent Isis to use with DD because I was sure I would feel like a cow on the milk line if I used an electric pump and I had read great reviews about the Isis After the first two months though I decided that the Isis was rather uncomfortable to use and the massaging breast shield kept losing suction and leaking milk out the back so I started researching pumps again I knew I wanted a Medela but some of their pumps weigh in at 8 pounds and I knew I didn t want anything that NEEDED to use the complimentary stylish backpack When I found the Swing and read the reviews I knew it was what I wanted It is nearly as compact as hand pumps but uses the same two stage action as the more expensive Medela pumps It is comfortable to use I ve had no problems with leaking it seems more efficient and in general I just really like this pump You can use double A batteries to power it which is great if you are traveling Airport Camping The best part though came about five minute ago when I realized that the threads on the Swing match the threads on the skinny Airvent bottles that are the only ones we can get DD to use No more random bottles and no more pumping in to one container and then pouring into another container to use 
5 0 I know you are not supposed to love your pump but I do My baby was small 4 pounds 14 ounces when born and was not able to nurse well I established my supply on a rental Symphony from the hospital When it came time to return the Symphony I debated whether to continue renting it or to purchase my own pump The purchase price of pumps really scared me off but I considered the Swing because it is intended for daily use which is what I needed but was not as pricey as the Pump In Style I LOVE THE SWING THe Swing is as efficient if not more as the SYmphony THe fact that it is a single pump does not bother me at all because it is so efficient I am done pumping in 20 minutes both sides It is so lightweight and portable that you can go anywhere After a month of being tied to the huge Symphony every three hours it was a wonderful and welcome change to be able to go places with the pump I am a full time working mom and currently use the Swing every day I fully recommend this 
4 0 great pump Bought for my wife the pump works great She was using Eveflo pump and this while not much faster is MUCH quieter The only problem was having to buy a bigger shield to go along with it so that added to the cost but she is very happy with it 
5 0 Wonderful I m so happy that I splurged and bought this I was using a manual pump and getting sore wrists and it took forever to do The Swing though a little pricier is totally worth it The two phase part really works well I was pretty dubious at first but it s been a great help to me as I return part time to work 
5 0 I ve tried a bunch this one is GREAT OK so I ve been told the Symphony is the Cadillac of breast pumps but with a price tag of who can afford that Renting it cost a month if you can find a place to rent it I did and used it for a month I honestly was not totally impressed for the price Then I read up on the swing this pump ALSO like the symphony includes the Medela 2 Phase Expression Technology the new standard for unsurpassed naturalness comfort and efficiency AND after buying it I liked it BETTER then the symphony Infact I think it works just about the exact same which is crazy of Medela when the price is SO different I have tried the Medela Pump in style as well as the Avant Isis and this one is the best I would highly reccommend this pump POSITIVES This pump is portable Comes with a travel bag runs on batteries OR you can plug it in The pump itself is about the size of a Hardees Hamburger The breast shield is soft and very effective you can control the speed and it has the letdown mode as well that automatically turns on after a few minutes The breast shield is soft and comfortable the suction and speed is the same as the symphony the pump is SIMPLE to use FOUR buttons you can t NOT figure it out easily It is FAST and emptys your breast totally NEGATIVES I have to stretch on this one cause I love the pump It s not quiet I don t know why the other review says it is It s actually louder then I thought it should be but not louder then the Medela Pump in style or symphony But just not quiet I don t want you thinking you are going to get something you can pump with at the front of a mini van and noone in the back is going to hear It s a Single Pump I know DUH but it is a negative if only they made a double with this size base I m almost tempted to buy another I highly reccommend this pump as a mom of three I ve tried a lot of pumps I think Medela is selling this pump short saying it is like the pump in style I think it is comparable to the symphony 
5 0 Great value I use this pump all the time for 95 of my baby s feedings I actually have 2 of them I keep one in the car with a clean bottle at all times and one in the house The pump is easy to clean and comes with spare parts This manual pump is comfortable to use I know that all of the experts recommend electric pumps but I have done just fine using this manual pump and saved a ton of money over the electric pumps The Avent bottles fit directly only this pump so it s quick and simple to take the full bottle off the pump and either freeze it with a sealing disc feed your baby by putting on a nipple top or store it in the fridge with a nipple top storage cap I must note however that 1 of my pumps is the older version of this model and the other is the newest version The newest and current version leaks a little where the screw on grooves from the pump meet the bottle as the older version with a different part did not So just be a bit careful when using this otherwise you ll have drops of milk on your clothes 
5 0 I liked it so much I bought a second pump and I would never have bought a second electric All the other moms I know said get a Medela Pump in Style but I thought if I could just maybe get a pump that took up 1 4 the space and made NO noise for 50 I d try it I m not at all interested in trying another pump I love having two so I can keep one at work and one at home or on weekends when traveling I can use one and then use the other and both will be clean I like the Avent bottles and nipples too It took a series of complicated training sessions to show my husband how to properly assemble and use the Playtex Ventaire bottles but the Avent bottles require a nipple that s it So easy 
5 0 Very quiet I purchased this for when I was breast feeding my daughter and this allowed me to pump wherever I went if I didn t want to feed in public Very easy to clean and assemble A little pricey but well worth it 
4 0 Great Pump but the white valve star wears out after a couple of months use I use my Avent Isis manual breastpump 3 5 times a day and it works pretty well but the white valve star got worn out after 2 months of use When buying this pump make sure you buy extra white valves stars as spare parts they are not expensive its 1 25 british sterling pounds per piece make sure you buy 10 if you are planning on using this pump for a year or more 
4 0 Great product This is a fun and exciting new addition to my son s stroller He really loves music so he is having a bawl playing with the piano on the toy 
5 0 LOVE IT My baby loves this toy all the lights work fine and the 6 school blocks are so cute I have no complaints Baby plays with it everyday 
5 0 Great Stool I did a little research before buying this stool and I always came back to the baby bjorn I decided to order it and give it a chance and I m glad I did It s small enough to fit in my bathroom and wide enough to hold my daughter on it comfortably She loves to stand on it and brush her teeth all the time now It s wide enough to move around on and not fall as well as it has a grip on the top surface for little feet I d highly recommend this product Baby Bjorn knows what they re doing 
5 0 A Great Stool I usually write very long reviews but I think I can cut this one short Other step stools skid around are too brightly colored and too short My 3 y o b g twins have used this since they were 18 months old They use it for getting to the sink to get on the potty to reach something up high to get on the chairs to eat an deven to get into bed sometimes They LOVE them The stools are very sturdy and I recomend them for ANYONE whether you have kids or not it holds almost any weight and is very convinient and the perfect height We have one in each bathroom one in the upstairs hall closet and one in the cabinet under the kitchen sink or under the table lol That means we have 4 of these stools They are very simple to use and I even use them to sit on when I wash my younger babies I plan to have these around for YEARS They are great clean and blend perfectly into any room Buy them they dont skid and are great for ANY age 
5 0 Expensive but STURDY Unlike some cheaper plastic stools this one can hold Mom or Dad It may not look like much online but when you see and feel it in person you realize that it really is much nicer than the 5 stools you find at discount stores 
5 0 Fabulous My son who is 2 1 2 took this stool directly upstairs and placed it right in front of the potty where he proceeded to climb up onto the potty and proclaim himself a big boy It is sturdy it doesn t tip over and the colors are not offensive Baby Bjorn products are definitely worth the extra bucks I ll have this stool for my grandchildren We paired it with the Toilet Trainer by Baby Bjorn and we re super satisfied 
5 0 Safety stepping for children over 2 We have three of these stools in our house and we love them Although my son is not particularly careful we simply have not found a way to tip them I even use one to reach high places in my kitchen They don t slip they are sturdy and they look great They may cost some money but as I have found with many different Baby Bjorn products they are worth it 
5 0 Can not live without We love our placemat We have a 9 month old and she really likes to feed herself This makes going to restaurants great for all of us Kate can eat her cheerios etc and we do not have to worry about the table not being clean or Kate trying to teeth on the table etc I have also used it on the airplane and it was great It is great quality and easy to clean It rolls up nicely and fits easily into our bag Everywhere we go people ask where we found this great item I highly recommend this for families who love to eat out or fly 
5 0 Love It No more dirty tables for my 11 month old to eat off of It keeps her food of the table and even has a piece that catches the food that does not end up in her mouth The suction cups help to hold it in plac 
5 0 Great Product I use these mats with my 2 1 2 yr old twins at my dining room table They keep the mess off wood and are easy to clean You can also travel easily with them 
5 0 Convenient and cute My friend has one of these for her 18 month old daughter It s very convenient for use in restaurants as it keeps the inevitable mess confined to the mat and when you re getting ready to go you can slide the mess into the little pocket for quick disposal It suction cups to the table and your child has an instant food toy mess mat that is not only convenient for mom and dad but is also appealing for baby to touch and play with I am going to be having a daughter this year and have registered for one of these I think it s a great addition to the diaper bag 
5 0 This is great for a squirmy 3 year old I bought this booster seat because we just bought a new table and chairs and our previous hard plastic booster seat had rubbed some of the paint off of our old chairs This seat is wonderful It is soft enough to be comfortable and my three year old can climb into it by herself without it sliding around on the chair It rests against the wood of the chairs without damaging them in any way I highly recommend it for the older toddler but you might want something with a little more support for a younger child 
5 0 Great product After looking at nearly every booster seat on the market I decided to get this one and I m glad I did My 4 yr old daughter loves this seat The other booster seats are hard plastic and hurt her rear This is the only one that I found that had a cushion and seemed easy to clean and it is easy to clean I like that it came in black too as my table is black so it doesn t stand out or look ugly I also like that it came with a carry bag so I can bring it with us to the movies or plays that we attend and I don t have to worry about her being uncomfortable during them anymore Great product 
4 0 It really works I trained my son using this method when he was 2 years 2 months My mom used a similar method with me in 1977 and recommended it It worked really really well He took a bit longer to learn to go poopoo at first until I realized that HE thought he was making messies if he went in the toilet I solved this by taking him around the house and showing him that the dishes go in the cupboard clothes in the closet toys in the toy box and poopoo in the toilet He totally got it after that He only had a couple accidents that I recall I reminded him to go pee pee quite a lot at first which I believed helped I stopped all liquid drinking an hour to and hour 1 2 before bedtime and had him pee right before bed and right after getting up I would highly recommend this prodect to everyone who s ready to potty train 
5 0 An end to toilet fishing I love this secure and easy to use toilet lock I used this lid lock with my toddler from 10 months until 3 years The best thing about it is that it works well but does not have to be attached with adhesive so it can be installed and removed easily for use or cleaning I think that the previous reviewer must have had a strange potty or more likely just had it installed improperly If used properly it clamps onto the rim of the potty without being permanently attached I found it was difficult to remove and couldn t remove it just by pulling It also doesn t rattle if it s installed on the front half of the toilet and NOT under the little buttons that keep the seat off of the rim I have tried it on a variety of toilets We were able to have a spare for travel so every toilet was safe I really can t understand what went wrong for the previous reviewer I wish I could help her try to install it so it would work There are two sizes of clamps to fit different sizes of toilet rims I found I had to use one for our very old upstairs potty and the other for the more modern downstairs potty You HAVE to clamp them tightly on the rim though or it won t work and would certainly rattle Maybe that was the problem The base is a clamp that s adjustable to fit the rim of the toilet tightly Then there s a swing up down latch that clamps over the lid and seat keeping both of them down You have to lift two buttons at the same time as you lift the latch I found I could easily do it with one hand while holding a newborn but my toddler who could easily defeat all of our cabinet drawer and door locks just couldn t do it Because I did it one handed the trick wasn t obvious Well I recommend this to all my friends and will buy more for my new house 
5 0 Extremely happy with quilt fabric This sleepsack is perfect I was a little skeptical and didn t know whether to buy the cotton one or this one I am very happy with the quilted one It is a fairly light cotton fabric with quilting stitched into it It is extremely soft and seems to be of awesome quality After washing it holds up wonderfully My daughter has not arrived yet but is expected to any day now I feel good about putting her to sleep in this blanket to help keep the SIDS epidemic down 
5 0 Good blanket This is a very good item that every parent should have an awsome gift to give and receive I got it from a friend who got it as a gift from another one of our friends and honestly it is one of my favorite gifts ever I take my baby a bath and then I put an onesie on her and then I put her in this sleep sack and I dont worry about her getting cold during the night because as she moves arround her crib the sack moves with her now I dont have to check her during the night and at the same time I am not afraid that she will cover her face with it You will not regret this purchase 
5 0 Great Changing Pad This pad works very well on top of the dresser We didn t want to buy a changing table and this made for a great alternative 
5 0 Perfect for our 4 year old Grandaughter This booster seat is so convenient small and easy to use The pocket on the side is nice for a water bottle snack It s perfect for our 4 year old Grand daughter and doesn t take up a lot of room in the car 
5 0 great for 6 year old attractice lightweight and comfy grown up enough for a kindergartener who would rather not have a booster at all 
4 0 Love Love Love this monitor I received this as a gift and I love it My daughter is 6 months old now and this product was so helpful during sleep training as well as those nerve racking newborn days I can peek in on her with out disturbing her When she was learning to fall asleep on her own I was able to see that she was ok without running into her room and waking her all the way up everytime she let out a cry The monitor works all over my house includding the basement and even out in the yard The only thing that I don t like is that it will let out a loud static sound from time to time It is also pricey but if you can swing it GO FOR IT 
5 0 the absolutely BEST pad cover I have 2 Change Pad Covers This and Munchkin It s a world of difference so soft and fluffy this cover is Though we have been washing this cover every other week my baby is 3 mo old now it still feels and looks like new 
5 0 very pleased super soft wish they made these for big people heheheheeh very nice product lovely color 
4 0 Fits Simmons Contoured Changing Pad I just bought this changing pad cover for my baby who is expected this summer and one of the things I was a little concerned about was if it would fit my existing changing pad that my son used We have the Simmons Contoured Changing Pad which seems to be a popular pad for people to use and I was happy to find that it fits very nicely The fabric does seem a little thin but I will not know how well it will hold up however until the baby comes Pottery Barn Kids also sells really soft chamois covers in a variety of colors for 19 a piece and I have one of those for my new baby too The Pottery Barn one is a bit thicker Once I test them both out I ll be sure to update this post and let you know what I think 
5 0 Love it This thing is great We use it to safely co sleep you can safely co sleep why most doctors in this country refuse to even discuss it when it REDUCES the risk of SIDS is beyond me It works SO well and you can just pull the baby down with the little pad she sleeps on nurse her till she falls asleep lying down and then pull the pad back up into the sleep nest without waking her That has been SO helpful I really recommend this to those thinking of co sleeping It s definitely a safer alternative than the adult mattress pillows blankets We put it between us and the sides keep the pillows from getting near her face perfect 
4 0 Great help I bought the lil snuggler sleep nest for my 3 month old daughter who did not like sleeping in her crib She had been sleeping in an infant chair but we were concerned about her safety I bought this hoping the closeness of the sides would make her feel more comfortable like the chair It worked perfectly She is now 4 months old and sleeps through the night in her sleep nest I even was able to prop it up so that it has a slight incline which she loves I highly recommend this product 
5 0 Great for all ages My 4 month old received this dog as a gift for Christmas It smells so lovely He buries his head in its face to snuggle with it I leave it in his crib until he falls asleep and then I remove it for the rest of the night It has completely baby safe features which I really appreciate The biggest surprise is that my 4 year old keeps sneaking it out of the baby s crib so she can sleep with it too It is on her list for the next holiday 
5 0 great i love the wireless option you can take it anyware i hear alot noise with the wire but i bought it to be wirless i use it wireless only there is no noise at all when used wirless i like it it is what i have been looking fo 
4 0 More fun than you think I thought that because there were no buttons or batteries that my three year old daughter would not enjoy it but I was wrong She loves it This doll goes every where that she does I purchased this doll to help with potty training and it did the trick This is a quality doll that when you squeeze her tummy she can go potty Feeding her the water is a little hard because you have to make sure you get the bottle in her mouth all the way But she doesn t care if she spits the water up or if she actually goes potty She also loves taking her into the bath tub too Not as expensive as other dolls but well worth the money spent 
5 0 Granddaughter Christmas present An excellent shopping experience in all aspects Great item and excellent shipping Very pleased Thanks 
5 0 Great Bouncer I initially bought the Rainforest bouncer but wasn t too happy with it The hanging toys hung way too low and were made of a hard plastic My baby got his foot stuck in them I returned it for this one and my baby boy loves it He smiled immediately at the puppy when I turned it on and watched it the entire time then went to sleep I actually liked the idea of this bouncer because the puppy is more upbeat rather than soothing like the other bouncers so my baby gets some playtime By the time he gets tired the puppy and music shuts off and he sleeps peacefully in the vibrating chair My ONLY minor complaint is I wish the ball on the toy bar cracked or squeaked But overall a terrific purchase 
5 0 Great Bibs Not too much to say here It s just a great bib It s waterproof and the pockets catch a lot of the stuff that normally ends up on the pants 
5 0 Great both my 4 year old and my little daughter 5 month old hate having their noses suctioned My little girl has reflux and spits up a lot due to that she always has quite some Milkbuggers up her nose and to add to that she s teething like a Mammoth right now which makes her congested as well First she wanted to sqirm away but the hummingsound that comes from it and the nice Tune it plays destracted her Since it vibrates quite a bit I first touch her cheek with it so she knows what to expect and she immidetly calmes down and today started even to giggle because it tickled her nose The long and short tip are both very soft and have no sharp edges and the suction is very gentle Yes I do agree that it won t suck crusties out of the nose but even with a bulb hard stuff should be soaked for a couple of seconds with a squirt of saline up the nose to soften it Once you do that the bigger buggers will come out with the big tip I personally find the Bulbs to invasive and the aspirators in Hospital pretty strong so strong that not even the stuff will use them unless the Babys oxygen drops due to stuffiness in the nose I KNOW I just spent 1 week in the hospital in February with my duaghter due to RSV and yes those aspirators there shouldn t be used unless there is no other way but even there they use always saline first to soften the stuff and then use the suction Oh by the way the Aspirator comes with a handy little sack to store the tips and the easy to take apart and clean Aspirator sure the Suction is not as strong as the Hospital one but the Hospital cannot be used as often as you want to this one is gentle enough and even fun for the little ones while giving them relieve and can be used as needed it is that gentle That s why it gets 5 stars from me 
5 0 This thing really works This paid for itself the first morning my son couldn t nurse because he was so stuffy Two minutes later with no screaming he was all clear and I didn t have to pin his hands down or anything It is also much easier to clean than a rubber one 
5 0 So much better than a manual aspirator I am a first time parent of a 4 month old I was surprised to learn that babies can t clear their own noses until they are about 3 years old I tried using the manual bulb aspirator but my little one would get frustrated and I would have limited success clearing his nose It usually took several attempts to get into the nostril and once there I was only able to get good suction about 1 3 of the time Maybe others have better luck than me but these are my stats I ordered the NasalClear about a week ago I was concerned that the vacuum might be too strong for little noses or that the tips would be too invasive The vacuum is very gentle I prefer the shorter stouter tip as it seems less likely to go too far up the nostril Either tip is certainly shorter than the one on the manual bulb The suction while being gentle is very effective at cleaning the nostril I was surprised by how much a little nostril could hold That being said the NasalClear comes with a collecion cup that has a max fill line on it that seems absurdly large I have yet to get even a drop into the chamber there is quite a bit of storage space in the tubes leading to the chamber that does get filled so I can t even imagine filling it I don t find the music feature to be very important It s a great product that works well and doesn t irritate my baby So far there hasn t been a tear caused by NasalClear which is a huge improvement over the manual bulb 
5 0 Serves its purpose We have a very large opening between our kitchen and living room and this was the only barricade with a gate that we could find We went ahead and bought it and it was fairly easy to install Pros 1 You can angle it so that it custom fits your space You can also make it longer or shorter without having to buy extensions 2 It has a gate so you don t have to continuously step over it or take it down 3 Its soft mesh material means fewer bumps on the head for our little one 4 The gate slowly closes after you walk through it but it doesn t latch shut FYI Cons 1 Although the gate can be opened with one hand it s not the easiest you have to move a button and then lift up not a huge deal though 2 Its also not the easiest to close have to lift up and then push down 3 It s wall mounted not pressure mounted so it leaves holes in the wall Overall I would recommend it 
5 0 Wonderful only gate that would fit You can see in one of the pictures above I needed to cover a 20ft area to keep the dog out of my young son s play area he s only five months old I purchased two of these gates connected them together and voila you have a ready made wall The look is great and goes with any decor Unlike the one review below I have had no problems with it coming out of the wall You have to have it anchored into a stud just as you do with anything you screw into the wall I have ran into it a few times not realizing the gate was latched and it didn t budge I feel good knowing that if I have to step out of the room for a minute my son is safe Everything was easy to install and connecting the two gates together is a breeze I recommend this gate to everyone If you want peace of mind buy it And if you have a babies r us around you they sell them there 
5 0 Perfect gate for wide odd sized openings We needed to gate off our basement stairs but it is a large opening and there aren t two walls directly across from eachother that we could put a gate between This gate is the perfect solution because we could install in an L shape It works great the gate is easy to open but not so easy that my son can do it it is stable and sturdy and I no longer have to worry about my son climbing the stairs It is a nice khaki brown color that actually matches our wall color perfectly I like that it s not your typical white metal prison bars gate 
5 0 Perfect for long spaces We have a nine foot opening into the kitchen which is entirely off limits from my daughter We have a large amount of small items in there that could easily be choked on besides the inherent danger of a kitchen So my daughter has to be kept out This gate was one of two that would span the distance and this was the more affordable My husband installed it quickly within about ten minutes of getting home adjusted it to the size we needed and voila My daughter is turning one this month and the gate looks like it did when we bought it months ago Even when she puts her full body weight against the mesh trying to push her way through it doesn t give not the mesh the seams the hardware anything I was worried about the bar below the gate being annoying or tripped over but it is so low to the ground that it has never been an issue The latch on the gate takes a bit to get used to but the gate stays in place even if the latch is dropped in the cradle and not snapped in Love it 
5 0 Absolutely love this Would not want to be without This Bundleme Wasabi is wonderful It is so convenient I would not want to be without it for any baby The inside of it is very soft and comfortable It keeps my 6 month old daughter toasty warm which is much needed here in Chicago I like it so much more than having to put on her bulky coat everywhere we go I just lay her in this slip on a hat zip up the Wasabi and go I highly recommend this if you live somewhere where the temps go below the 30s 
4 0 Bundle Me Brilliant Although expensive the JJ Cole Bundle Me is a great investment I receive a lot of compliments on the one I use for our daughter No more worrying about scraping baby blankets along dirty cars as you maneuver in the garage with the car seat Our daughter appreciates having less bulk in her seat as well The Bundle Me is the best quality of car seat covers you ll find Buying the cheap brands only costs more in the end when you buy the authentic Bundle Me My only warning NEVER buy from Target their return policy is meant to trick the consumer Even with receipt and tags their merchandise will not be accepted after 90 days Buy your Bundle Me from Amazon or the JJ Cole website Trust me I ve registered for my wedding and baby with Target We ve lost over 500 00 due to their ridiculous return policy Learn from my mistakes 
5 0 Great Item I purchased this item for my 6 month old and I love it It replaces the need for a jacket and I can unzip the Bundleme when we are out shopping to keep my little one from getting too hot I still put a hat on him when its very cold out but I do not have a problem with the wind blowing the top flap off I have seen that complaint in other reviews as my car seat has a canopy and that has never been an issue The material is very soft on the inside and my baby is very comfortable in it I would highly recommend this product 
5 0 This is so much better than struggling with a blanket We love the Urban Bundle Me It is a wonderful product and I would highly recommend it I was so frustrated with the blanket falling off the car seat all the time and this is the perfect solution We live in California so the Urban Bundle Me was a better option than the traditional one which I have also but use in the stroller it keeps my son nice and warm and shielded from rain and wind The only negative I think is the zipper which could be better quality It fit my Peg Prego Car Seat perfectly 
5 0 My can t live without it item I have lived in cold climates for each of my kids and have hated the dreaded bundle up and squeeze into the carseat routine It makes traveling so much easier now that I can leave baby without a big bunting and know she ll be warm and cozy The zippers are great almost 6 months of use every single day and not a problem I have washed it several times and it looks like new and has held up wonderfully I have used it on windy days when I was a bit sceptical about it being windproof and it stood the test Moving it from the carseat to the stroller is a sinch with the velcro closures in the back I don t have any cons to list this has been such a great item for us 
5 0 cute soft this bunting is soft on the inside and like a breaker on the outside it s well constructed and a good buy for a newborn it looks and feels better than other carriers out there 
5 0 Great booster love that it folds Great booster seat It is exceptionally safe and sturdy Easily fits into our small car My daughter seems to be very comfortable in it and naps during long drives I love that it folds up and comes in a carrying case great for airline travel I highly recommend this seat 
5 0 I bought this even after the reviews and LOVE it I did a lot of research on everything I purchased for my sons room I am a first time mom and was very hesitant to buy anything because of price I wanted quality on a budget We really wanted a crib that had a drawer at the bottom for ALL of the blankets we had been given but could not find anything that we both like and was affordable I LOVE this crib We ordered it and was told it would be delivered in two weeks we got it in 4 days It was in excellent condition and took just over an hour to assemble the entire thing It was so simple and looks great I feel bad for those of you who had a bad experience but ours was great I suggest any parent looking for a great looking crib at a great price to buy this one 
4 0 We love this crib We ordered this crib on line from Babies R Us Amazon and we like it a lot Not only that it arrived one week earlier than the estimated arrival time but it also came in a very good condition I had read the reviews before we ordered the crib and realized that we were taking a risk as quite a few customers were complaining about problems with trasportation or serious damages due to poor packaging Our crib arrived in an almost perfect condition The only reason I did not give it 5 star rating is because one piece that we re going to need when we convert to toddler bed has a chip in it it is not too bad though Also assembling the crib was not a problem at all for my husband and one of our friends Following the instructions they were able to assemble in about 1 and 1 2 hour As I said before we re very satisfied with our selection now we re just waiting for our baby girl due March 21 2006 to see how she likes it 
5 0 Love it It took us forever to decide on a highchair and we actually took our then 6 month old on shopping trips to see which one he responded to the best We found this one to be the most versatile and the least likely to catch his fingers in the tray I also like that it has a five point harness I see that a lot of people had problems with their babies reaching the tray Our son is very tall so this wasn t a problem for us I also find it easy to clean the straps come off and are machine washable and I use a damp cloth to wipe it down It folds up nicely to go to grandma s house and it s nice to have so many levels of adjustment so that we can feed from the couch if necessary The chair leans back for those times that he eats from a bottle or wants to snooze in his chair It wheels easily from dining room to kitchen to living room I know that it s pricey but it supports kids up to 50 lbs so I plan to use it for a while and it s durable enough that I m sure someone else will get plenty of use out of it after we re done 
5 0 love this chair I had the eddie bauer chair and my son hated it he is six months old I returned it and purchased this chair I love this chair I can t believe how many people complain about cleaning it I purchased the clorox everywhere spray that is safe for babies and tht is it just wipe clean 
5 0 Great bag stylish and functional I have purchased several diaper bags and received several at my shower As a person who loves pocketbooks I m horribly picky about any bag But a diaper bag especially should be functional and stylish The COMBI urban sling is just that At the time of this writing I ve only had it a week so I can t speak to it s durability What you can t see in the pictures on this site are the many pockets in the bag The front flap closes messenger style via velcro There s a zipped pocket which spans the width of the front flap inside the front flap Upon opening the front flap velcro there are two pen holders and two compartments pockets which will fit a wallet or checkbook or even diapers if that s where you want to put them There is a zipped compartment on the side of the bag which holds one bottle This is the only drawback that only one bottle can go in the insulated compartment However in the part of the bag which is the deepest there are two deep compartments and one zippered compartment on top of a spacious inside The bottle thing was remedied for me by putting another bottle on the inside compartment in a ziploc bag to keep the temperature The shoulder is heavily padded in the middle of the bag which is a joy on my shoulders And the key holding section is convenient as well On the back of the bag is a compartment which holds a large changing pad This is one of the best features as the changing pad itself isn t bulky and taking up oo gobs of diaper bag space I took this bag to the hardest possible test site the suburban mall This was his first trip there and I was able to pack two nine ounce bottles wipes diapers a change of clothes his medicines disposable changing pads a receiving blankie albeit thin my wallet and essentials and still had pockets in the bag that were empty With the rubberized shoulder pad I didn t have to worry about the bag falling off of my shoulder as it rubbed against my shirt I know I m not the only one who is sick of readjusting bags on their shoulder over and over And the way it is designed it leaned flat on my hip instead of jutting out Made turning those store corners with a stroller much less difficult And the bag came in super handy on his doctor s visit yesterday in the middle of heavy rain The material seems waterproof I really love this bag As I m on maternity leave now I am using it strictly for the baby However as someone who works in social services and is often at meetings and in the field in neighborhoods I can see using this bag transitioning to work upon my return If it holds up it also seems the perfect bag for those theme park trips Overall it was money well spent 
4 0 Great Diaper Bag I love this diaper bag First it doesn t look like a diaper bag It can pass for a purse and looks very sporty I don t feel like a frumpy mom while carrying this Also it carries quite a bit without looking bulky I regulary carry wipes diapers for my infant and my potty training toddler plus at least one change of clothes for each child in the two larger compartments I still have room for my keys wallet cell phone sun glasses and a hair brush in the two inner zippered pockets I only gave it 4 stars because the shoulder strap needs a little more padding But overall it is a great diaper bag 
5 0 Great Product I bought this for my second son s infant carseat before he was born My first son always had a slumpy head in his carseat and the rainbow shaped head supports were useless This works great It did a wonderful job of keeping his head supported even when we were comming home from the hospital and I am still using it today 5 mos later I wish I would have had one for my older son and I would definately recommend it 
5 0 He Likes It I purchased the Twilight Turtle as a Christmas gift for my 27 month old grandson and he says I Like it He asks for it every single night at bedtime His favorite color is the amber which is almost impossible to see but he likes to hold the turtle and aim the stars at his pj s and the wall behind his bed so it works for him While he does not use the toy as it was meant to be used sitting on a dresser so that the ceiling wall is illuminated and prefers to hold onto the turtle and aim it like a flashlight he really enjoys it and that s the whole point 
5 0 A soothing nitetime friend Our two grandsons 4 years and 18 months are completely in love with the stars and color choices within this hard shelled plush turtle It has become a bedtime routine to star gaze with O ma first and then quietly and individually afterward in their own room Overnight stays are even more frequent Because it shows real constellations it will be a Grow with Me item The CD is lovely 
5 0 Wonderful gift I bought these for my 3 and 6 year old nieces and they loved them They are afraid to sleep with the lights off and now they use the turtle to light the room until they fall asleep It s great because it turns off in 15 minutes by itself They loved it 
5 0 TWINKLE TWINKLE LOVE THEM STARS LOVE THE TWILIGHT TURTLE MY 2 1 2YR OLD LOVED HER ROOM AND CRIB BUT LATELY DID NOT WANT TO GO TO SLEEP STATING IT WAS TOO SCARY WE GOT THE TURTLE AND EVER SINCE SHE GOES AND STAYS IN BED NO PROBLEM IT S LIKE A BEATIFUL NIGHT TIME SKY IN HER ROOM GREAT FEATURE IS THAT IT TURNS OFF AUTOMATICALLY IN 45 MINS 
4 0 Twilight Turtle My 2 year old loves this turtle I can t wait to show her the constellations The only thing that I do not like is the amber colored bulb the stars aren t quite bright enough 
5 0 Twilight Turtle We were having trouble getting the 10 month to go to bed peacefully and the turtle has made a big difference By watching the stars on the ceiling he is calmer and just falls asleep The CD helps with this also 
5 0 Unexpected favorite My son s Godmother gave this to him for his 4th birthday and it has become his favorite toy It s a stuffed animal nightlight and toy all in one He turns it on every night with great discussion given to what color his stars should be I would never have purchased this for my son but now I will recommend it for anyone with children in the 3 5 age range 
5 0 Perfect for keeping an eye on my autistic son I bought this video monitor system right after we moved into a new house when my son with autism was 4 Because his bedroom was on a different floor I was repeatedly going to check on him at night to make sure he was okay and still in his room I mounted the camera for the widest possible angle near the ceiling in a corner of his room and now I can check on him all night long I leave the volume on very low so I can hear if he yells but he doesn t wake me up if he s just playing or drawing As parents of autistic kids know our little ones are often very clever escape artists so having the reassurance this monitor offers is fabulous 
5 0 Best Gift I Received At first we thought that an audio monitor would work out for us Then we found out our son had reflux and we had a scary incident with him choking Soon after we received the hand held color monitor as a gift and we were able to sleep at night knowing we could peak at the monitor all night if we wanted to Our floors are very noisy so sneaking into his room to check on him would wake him most of the time To us this is a must have and I highly recommend This product has worked out perfect I can not think of a negative Even though we received this as a gift I would pay for the for it 
5 0 Nice product fair price We recently ordered this monitor and really like it It has wonderful color during the day and is clearly illuminated up to about 8 feet away from the camera at night We have a 900 MHz 2 4 GHz phones in our home and have not had any interference problems with the monitor We have an older two story home and the nursery is on the top floor I can do laundry in the basement or cook in the first floor kitchen and both the sound and picture are clear I especially like the time out feature that turns off the display screen after a few minutes but leaves the audio monitor on when the monitor is operating on its battery The display is turned on by a big button on top so if you hear something that you want to check out just push the button and the room is in view It s very nice The monitor has a belt clip and also a flip out stand so that it is stable on a counter or wherever I would recommend this product without reservation 
4 0 Great for milk storage I ve used these for two babies now and have used the milk after 6mo in deep freeze They are great most of the time I freeze about 10 12oz in each bag yes they say no more than 6oz it s a myth 12 is the maximum I found tho The trick is to make sure there is no air It won t leak b c the bag will expand unlike plastic storage containers I use the straight edge of a table push the milk all the way to the top and zip it as I push the air out Don t worry if a little leaks out b c it has a double zipper Then I freeze it on a flat surface singly After it s frozen I put 8 10 of these in a big gallon zip lock bag and date the outside and put it in deep freezer It s easier to organize them this way in deep freeze The bad thing about these bags is that once frozen the plastic nicks easily if you drop it scrape it against something etc as with all frozen containers Lansinoh had really bad problem with leakage before but they ve improved Just thaw the bag in a container in case it leaks Lansinoh customer service is great and will replace them if you encounter leaky bags 
4 0 Not bad on par with other walkers This walker is very easy to put together It doesn t need any tools to assemble it just to open the battery compartment small flat head screwdriver The instructions are clear and easy to follow The walker itself looks cheap but actually I was surprised how sturdy it is once put together I do have to say that the washable seat for this is a little tough snapping into place so I won t want to remove it much to wash it still that is a small price to pay for safety the front wheels are casters which rotate in a complete 360 the back wheels jsut go forward or backwards this is a safety feature as are the traction strips on the underside of the walker The baby will only be able to move backwards at first but with a little time s he will be cruising all over I am a little concerned about the activity toys on the tray From the reviews it looks like baby may bang her mouth a little If that is the case it will take me 2 minutes to detatch the toys and save it for later when she has more control Also the sound for the toys is actually not bad Most toys have 2 volume settings loud and louder this one in my opinion actually has 2 real volue conrols soft and medium Still If I ever get annoyed at the noise I can turn it off by flipping the switch or just let the battery run out the worst part of the whole thing is adjsuting it to different height levels I found it easier to turn the walker upside down and adjsut it that way still my thumbs will be bruised for days for all the pressure it took to adjust Hope this helps definately worth the 40 
5 0 immediate gratification our five month old son took right to it he immediately began pushing himself around and within an hour he figured out how to direct it to where he wanted to go this is a great product this is injection moulded plastic so there is no paint to flake off perhaps he is reviewing the wrong item 
5 0 GREAT WALKER We purchased this walker for our son because he loves Elmo and Sesame Street We love it Our son loves pushing the musical buttons and spinning the red circle in the middle It glides easily and is a breeze to get our son in and out of The cover also comes off easily for washing if necessary I m not sure what Papa Bear Paul was talking about because there is no paint on our walker and there is no way our son s hand can get caught Even if your little one doesn t enjoy Sesame Street as much as ours you will love this walker 
5 0 Love these placemats These placemats have saved my oak table from getting scratched by forks etc They are great for catching food before it hits the floor or my childs lap Love them I am now ordering another set to have on hand 
5 0 I love it I purchased this because my sister in law had one I thought it was great when we went out to dinner It is the right size Not to big where it takes the whole table and not to small where the baby doesnt use it The flexablitity of the maerial makes it very easy to take along 
5 0 You will need this if your baby grabs Our baby grabs and throws stuff on the floor So it was difficult to feed him and ourselves when we went out to restaurants The TinyDiner sticks right on the table and allows baby to eat off of it letting us eat in peace Its pretty easy to clean I run it under water in the sink and wipe it I make sure its dry before I stick it in the diaper bag Love this item 
5 0 development is a journey We love this item and people always stop us to ask where we got it It is a little hard to clean but I feel better using a reuseable product and taking the effort to wash it than I would if I used disposable plastic placemats A few wonderful waitstaff folks have willingly cleaned it for us in restaurants We only use this when we re out We often wet the suction cups to help them stick My 18 month old can rip it off but that tells me he s done eating The surface is also a bit clingy so his toddler trick of flinging his arms to scatter food is a little tougher for him This is a great product and won major daughter in law points for me with my germaphobe mother in law 
5 0 Great product I use these mats with my 2 1 2 yr old twins at my dining room table They keep the mess off wood and are easy to clean You can also travel easily with them 
4 0 great product You never know what is on the table you feed your kids off of I mean yes they may wipe them down but else have they cleaned with that same rag We have never had a problem with the suction cups not sticking It fits in our diaper bag just fine its about the same size as a bottle maybe an inch or two longer When we are done we dump any solids onto our plate Roll it up and take it home It rinses off with great ease We love ours 
5 0 Excellent seat protector After using the Sunshine Kids Ultra Mat for 4 months I purchased two more mats This is the best seat protector I found for several reasons It doesn t smell I had to return everything I had bought at Babies R Us due to a heavy rubber smell that never went away even after airing the products for a week It s made of two pieces so it can be used in stages Use the bottom piece only when using a rear facing infant seat or both pieces when using a front facing car seat It s made of two pieces so it fits any height car seat I have a Britax car seat which is really tall The other seat protectors did not reach all the way to the top of my SUV s seat so the car seat rested directly on the leather but with this seat protector I could raise the back piece as high as I needed it to fully protect my SUV s seat It s thick enough that even after months of use there s no marks on the SUV s leather seats It has indentations in the bottom portion to accommodate car seats using the latch system A note on the height issue A friend of mine bought the Duomat 2 In 1 Car Seat Mat which he found to be very nice as well and it did not smell He had to return it however due to the fact that the mat was not as high as the seat of his Honda Odyssey and his Britax Marathon car seat at the very top rested directly on the Honda seat with no protector in between 
5 0 Have it and love it I have had this stroller for about 7 months I love it No complaints and the pattern is way cuter in person It has everything you need at a great price Compare to Graco Spree or Metrolite I really like that it takes multiple carseat brands my sisters have actually borrowed it and they have a different infant carrier has a parent tray and child tray with toys 
4 0 Happy So Far We just recently purchased this stroller as we were traveling and our other stroller just broke I looked at several different ones the store had to offer and thought this would be the best It offered all the features we were looking for reclining seat storage area cup holders lightweight and compact and all for a good price So far I am very happy with it Our son loves the toy bar and the cup holder It is easy to assemble easy to steer and adjust the seat It folds up with just one hand Right now I love it 
4 0 Great overall organizer This is a good quality organizer at a good value I appreciate the neutral colors and I have had no problems using the velcro fasteners to affix this to the changing table The middle compartments could be a little larger but overall this is a great way to keep some essentials close at hand without cluttering up the changing table 
5 0 Great Organizer I love this organizer I keep diapers wipes cream pacifiers recieving blankets socks and a rattle and book on it to occupy baby during changes it isnt meant to hold very heavy things so i put those things in baskets on the shelves of the table it holds the things you need though and i like the plain color one less annoyingly bright thing that i am trying to put in a unisex neautral room i have had no problems with the straps like other readers have well worth the money great timesaver and also a great babyshower gift 
4 0 A great way to get organized This item is so handy Now I have every thing I need right at my finger tips I placed mine off the end of the changing table I have had no trouble with it staying in place using the velcro straps It could have been a bit larger I would definetly recomend this item 
4 0 Work Pretty Good For Me I went back and forth before I finally decided to add this to my baby registry I received it as a gift and I m so glad that I registered for it True the velcro isn t too strong which makes it slip if alot of heavy items are placed on it However I used the strategy that another reviewer used and tied it to the crib with some pretty ribbon and it works wonderfully I have powder lotion baby oil vaseline some shoes as well as a package of diapers and a few more items stored in it and it is holding up fine I think this organizer can be a very useful and convenient way to keep the much needed items close at hand especially if you are lacking storage space I would definitely recommend this item to anyone and I m so glad that I did finally register for it The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because I did have to make an adjustment being using the ribbons instead of the velcro that it came with Otherwise I have no other complaints 
5 0 Get Organized I bought this item a little sceptical afetr reading some of it s negative reviews I thought it was going to be unsturdy It is light weight but it carried everything perfectly I put my baby s diaper in it along with a bunch of her little bathroom things The velcro straps were a little too short for my crib which I thought was a negative at first but I had some pretty ribbon and I tied it to the end of my crib using the little loop holes in the back It gave it the prettiest effect I would recommed this over anything Everything is just a reach away 
4 0 Lamp I love this lamp shade It is really cute matches perfectly with everything The cost is high for just a shade but worth it 
5 0 Great crib set for a great price My husband and I couldn t agree on a theme for the bedroom He wanted sports and I wanted animals I didn t like most of the sports sets out there b c they were all dark blue and red I am so happy that I found this set The colors are light and babyish and it looks GREAT in the nursery I have also bought accesories and it really pulls the room together They huge bonus of this set is the fantastic price on All other sites have the same exact set listed at over 
5 0 Cute and Great quality I love this bedding My husband picked it out and he did a great job There are all different textures on the bumper and comforter Really cute We also bought all the accessories to go along except the mobile and lamp The nursery looks adorable I am very pleased with our purchase 
5 0 sleep sheep Great The sounds are perfect my baby loves them all especially the whales I love the fact that it has a volume dial and two choices of time Small enough to pack and bring with you anywhere Highly recommend 
5 0 Lamb Nature Sounds Soothing We just purchased this item for new grandbaby that is on the way When my daughter in law received it she called me and played all the sounds to me so that I could hear them Soooo cute and soothing I think I want one for myself Great soother 
5 0 Saving Grace This little lamb has saved us from suffering through sleepless nights Our baby loves it especially the whale sounds Really works to calm her and soothe her to sleep almost immediately 
5 0 Love this bib In my experience using a bib without a pocket is pretty useless My daughter always makes a big mess when eating and a pocket is mandatory I love this one because it is soft enough to be comfortable and has a pocket that is actually firm enough and large enough to do what it needs to I love that the entire thing is hard plastic without any fabric all you have to do is wipe and go No staining or mildewing or anything like that We have 2 one to use and one to spare and that s all we need The mechanism for clasping is very easy to hook and unhook for mom or dad but is secure enough that your little one won t easily pull it off It s also adjustable for little necks and bigger necks alike We ve used several types of pocketed bibs in the past but now that we ve found this one we will never need another kind In my opinion this is the perfect bib for messy little eaters 
5 0 Doesn t get any better than this I bought these for my twin boys after about two weeks of washing a mountain of regular bibs I started using them when they were about 7 months and have used nothing else since Now that they are ten months and self feeding they have saved me from doing tons of extra laundry Their clothes rarely have any stains I love that I can just rinse them after each meal and either put them in the dishwasher or hand wash them at the end of the day They make mealtime so much easier One of my boys loves to rip off his bibs but he can t budge this one They also love to fish out any dropped food from the trough and try again to get it into their little mouths Everywhere I take the boys I get such positive feedback on them 
5 0 I d give it 10 if I could This bib has changed mealtime for the better I tried all sorts of fancy bibs because I thought this bib would be uncomfortable for my tiny baby Boy was I wrong After the initial fuss she now loves this bib She is comfortable and clean The bib catches every drop of food water and her super staining vitamin drops FYI Even this fantastic bib can t shield you from unexpected baby sneezes during feedings I stained and ruined so many cloth bibs before I finally took this out of the box and now I only use this one Plus one in my car for on the go feedings More colors please Baby Bjorn 
5 0 The Only Bib There Is Always where it needs to be durable easy to clean My daughter used it as a part of a five tiered food buffering system plate tray bib hands and cheeks all of which seemed vital somehow If anything she probably liked it better than we did and we liked it a lot It was always a bit of a letdown to get out somewhere and realize we only had one of the terry or soft vinyl kind 
5 0 Best bib we ve found This thing is great Catches most of the drips and spills from our 2 year old Other bibs keep the stuff off of the clothes this keeps a lot of it off the floor too They ve redesigned the latching mechanism to keep it from catching kid s hair and to make it easier to open 
5 0 this bib catches everything My son is now self feeding so I was looking for a bib that would catch his mistakes but be easy to clean after each meal Although this bib is a bit stiff it does a great job of catching every single thing he drops And it s easy to clean I just wash it along with the dishes after each meal and it s ready to go for the next meal 
5 0 Thanks to these I m still breastfeeding My first son took to breastfeeding like a champ from the get go I never experienced sore nipples with him My second son is a whole different story though For some reason my second son just didn t want to open his mouth wide enough to get a good latch on so that made for excruciatingly sore nipples for me for about the first two weeks of nursing It was torture pure torture A nurse at the hospital gave me these gel patches to help with my sore nipples and I must say I don t know what I would have done with out them I probably would have given up on breastfeeding I tried the nipple cream and that did help a bit but these gel patches are really what made breastfeeding manageable for me I healed faster wearing them than I did with the nipple cream If you put the patches in the fridge for a couple of minutes then put them on they feel really great This is a wonderful product and I attribute them to getting over that huge breastfeeding hurtle for the first two weeks 
5 0 Quite impressive The unit s work very well together and monitors the newborn s every move We can walk around the house and yard and still have our child s safety foremost Great produc 
5 0 Great monitor We purchased this monitor to use in our 2 year old daughter s room We were intrigued by this product since we were able to communicate with her without going to her room she likes to try to get us to come to her room when she doesn t want to go to sleep That was our only reason to buy this monitor Now it s our favorite out of 3 different brands There is no background noise static like we had with her old monitor It also has a rechargeable battery so both receivers are charged and ready to go whenever and wherever you want to use it It s very easy to use and quite clear I plan on buying another one for our son when he gets a little older 
5 0 On a budget and found a product worth every penny My Wife and I had twins recently and I went looking about 3 hours of internet searching and reading reviews at all kinds of different nursery monitors I even looked at some costing over 500 dollars with built in wallmounts ect Pretty much every thing I read said try this one Well they were right Rechargable batteries Good clear signal even between multi floors Durable hand sets with a easy to use switch between the base the babies room and the other hand set Easy to use durable and reliable Good volumn control Good response from manufacture and from Amazon when a switch went bad Can t ask for more than that even if it cost twice what I paid I strongly recommend this set and product I have used others and they can t touch this one My babies and more importantly my wife s emotional well being were a serious consideration on finding something that would make them feel safe and in communication After 3 months of continous use I can t imagine a better choice It even allows us as adults to have quiet time casue we know we can hear everything even the slightest wimper Do yourself a favor and buy this Jay Saldan 
5 0 I searched for that a long time This Baby monitor is working very well for us I looked a long time for the imho simple features of a three units 1 each for mom baby and dad b the ability to talk to each of them The Connection is good very faint noise if you crank up the volume Downsides A little annoying is the loud beep you hear before speaking And the rechargable battery on the two parents units don t hold very long After a couple of months of use we have to recharge them now every three days we use them about 4 hours a day The baby unit has no battery but I don t think that s a problem Still the best monitor I could find 
4 0 It works and great for the money It s not the clearest or the easiest to use but it does work You can tell the difference between the baby and other sounds It s pretty sensitive and we ve been happy with it I don t think you can go wrong for the money If I were grading it by value for the money I d give it a higher rating But I m rating it based on what it does over others I ve seen or heard about 
4 0 Easy Comfy Attractive With the new Summer 2007 law in Washington that extends the booster seat years to age 8 I needed to purchase a new booster for my older daughter She likes this bright red seat It s comfortable and she s eased back into booster seat riding without protest The seat was easy to set up and was in the back seat of our Volvo in minutes This review would be 5 stars if Graco had come up with a new concept for booster seats ones that are soft not hard plastic perhaps and quite inexpensive Something that would encourage everyone who might drive a kid around to get one or or maybe even car manufacturers to include one per seat as standard Something that won t soon be a big pile in the landfill With this seat Graco has provided a solid option for the current design standard But they haven t innovated 
5 0 Child Seats No Longer Frighten Me My son is 3 1 2 and this is the FIRST seat of his that I was able to assemble and get into the car without one ounce of help from my husband All others left me frustrated and baffled I have overcome my fear of kids seats with this one Next you ll find me out back putting up the swing set all on my own Loooove it 
5 0 turbo seat Excellent product and Target is very fast My grandaughter especially likes this style of seat 
5 0 Perfect This seat is so easy to put together place in the vehicle and strap a child in to it is definitely worth every penny Safety ratings on this seat are great It is also convenient that when the child is old enough to move on to a booster without a backrest the backrest is removable Our daughter loves the cupholders for snacks and drinks She also loves that she can climb in and out of the seat by herself which is good for her self confidence as she grows up We use this seat between 2 cars and it is easily removed and replaced with a simple slide of the seat belt The seat is even color coded to show where the belt should be placed across the shoulder and the waist Definitely a great product 
5 0 Great Transition Piece My 3 4 year olds absolutely love their new big boy seats with their own cup holders The seat gives a really nice support system using the in car seat belts The head neck and shoulders are all supported nicely I would absolutely recommend this item to someone who is ready to upgrade from the baby seats 
5 0 Considered the safest on the market This seat is easy to secure in the car has a high back for additional support two arm rest for comfort and two cup holders for convience Test show this to be one of the top seats manufactured I give it a thumbs up 
5 0 Great Booster We bought an earlier model of this seat when my son was 4 and we are still using it as he turns 8 We have one in each of our two cars and we keep a third out on the west coast for when we are there traveling Unlike the other review currently posted for this seat we have really loved the cupholders there is room for them to pop out in our car so they are kept out all the time They work for water bottles crayons little plastic toys etc It has held up well to abuse adjusts to different sizes looks sporty and generally gets a thumbs up 
5 0 The BEST high chair ever I have not been pleased with high chairs in the past they were bulky and took up way too much space This high chair went right on one of my dining room chairs no more tripping over the awkwardly large inconvienent high chair This high chair is easy to clean and it reclines for the infant who can t quite sit up yet It turns into a booster so when my baby gets bigger he can literally eat at the table I highly recommend this for all 
5 0 Awesome High Chair We could not have asked for a better high chair than this one We have a small house and not a lot of room in the kitchen area so this is perfect for us It attaches great to one of our kitchen table chairs I love the fact that it reclines too My son can hold his own bottle so I can recline him after he eats his food and then give him his bottle while I get things done I totally recommend this high chair to everyone 
5 0 love this highchair There are many good things about this product It is easy to clean wipe it with a cloth to clean it is small it reclines it has a 5 point harness the tray is dish washer safe it is sturdy and it grows with your child After using a more expensive product twice the price that was very difficult to clean I am thrilled to find this highchair I only wished i had discovered it 2 1 2 years ago with my son 
5 0 On a quest not to be overtaken by baby gear this seat is great I live in a relatively small townhome and my son s baby gear has taken over most of the space Between activity mats jumpers swings and kicking contraptions I couldn t bring myself to buy a full size high chair I actually bought a Bumbo Seat hoping I could use this instead of a high chair but that didn t work out too well So I was pretty excited when I saw this high chair and read good reviews I m happy to report that I love this this high chair The vinyl seat is pretty plush and looks comfortable He actually looks like he s sitting on a little throne when he s in it I strapped it onto a barstool and it feels very secure The vinyl seat along with the rest of the chair material is easy to clean The tray says dishwasher safe but my dishwasher is too small to accommodate it It doesn t seem to be the highest quality chair meaning some of the functions aren t as easy to use as you might hope like the reclining seat and the tray but it wouldn t deter me from buying it again It was only 50 so I wouldn t expect it to be any different It s also very portable which isn t a normal expectation of a high chair Overall I m very happy with this product 
5 0 NICE LIGTH WEIGHT STROLLER Very light weight Only 8 4 lbs Comes with a shoulder strap for easy lifting And very easy to fold unfold My daughter is 5 yrs old and she fits nicely in it And it manouvers smoothly with her added weight We purchased this stroller to use on a Disney vacation Rental stroller in Disney is 10 00 per day This we can use for many more vacations Best stroller we ever purchased You will be pleased if you purchase this stroller 
5 0 Best stroller for town and country This is an excellent lightweight stroller and is the one we use most often We have a more expensive larger safer stroller with more features but we have found we never use it and always use this one Collapsing the stroller to pop into the car is a breeze and there is an adequate shoulder strap for you to carry the stroller when you are doing portage over rough ground We take the stroller everywhere We ve used it on well groomed trails for hiking museums restaurants we ve even used it at the beach and we ve used it on the Paris Metro This is a great stroller for train and subway travel The wheels have a lock feature which allows them to rotate or swivel and the rear wheels have a brake mechanism which is a little awkward to release but I find that comforting rather than frustrating I want solid brakes There is a small basket in the back of the stroller for a baby bag purse and a few groceries so this again is an excellent stroller for when you are just running out for a few things or going on a small picnic If I was an apartment dweller in the city this is the stroller I d get The only bad feature this is not a stroller you can run with Don t even try The harness is excellent but takes time to adjust it correctly so that it is not too snug nor too loose This is a super lightweight stroller but is a quality product with excellent engineering and design It is not like those flimsy twenty dollar throwaways and just has the MacLaren name on it this is the real deal We have used it for two kids still works like new We should get sales rep compensation because no one really had these in Paris and all our friends saw ours and got one too 
5 0 NO PROBLEMS HERE Our son is almost 16 months old and we have been using these sippy cups for about 10 months now We have never had them leak mold spouts push through or anything I suggest reading the directions before tossing these sippy cups in the trash I cannot get over how many parents assume that the Avent line is alot of hype just because they failed to read directions As for the complaints about mold and sour milk that s just gross Wash the sippy cup after it s used I m sure any other brand would get moldy and smelly if you left it in your trunk all summer not Avent s fault Anyway as for the green spouts being stiffer than the white ones and more difficult to clean OK maybe for the first few times because they are new but they WILL get more pliable I spoke to an Avent rep at the Baby Fair in Edison NJ and she suggested buying new spouts every month or so same for nipples with Avent bottles They do wear out especially if you re using the same two or three sippy cups every day I just bought and tried the sport spout and although it is quite a mouthful of liquid that comes out our son has no problem with that spout either No leaks so far All in all read the directions and you will see the leaks disappear like MAGIC Good luck 
4 0 Never Had A Leak I will first admit that there are additional parts to these cups that need to be washed but since we used Dr Brown s bottles I was used to a few pieces The soft spout on these cups is great and made transitioning to a cup SO easy for us My son hasn t taken a bottle since his first birthday and never missed them a bit There are two levels of spouts one harder one softer I ve tried other soft spout brands but have had leaking from the collars Avent cups NEVER leak as long as the valves are inserted correctly Our little guy will use any brand or spout type but these are his favorite and nice on sore gums I really recommend these cups despite the extra valve pieces which I simply pop in the dishwasher in a basket You ll never have spills on your sofa or carpet 
5 0 I love these things These are so handy to throw in the diaper bag They have everything you need to eat out with your little one in a compact package 
5 0 Very Nice They came very quickly and were what I expected Thank you seller 
4 0 good walker The service by target is very good Item arrived in good condition and quite fast The walker although is not as colorful as it seems from the picture but is good enuff to keep my son engaged It is safe and at the same time glides both on carpet and vinyl floor 
4 0 Great for a mover I was given this walker from a friend who s child progressed so fast he skipped the walker stage When I brought it home my son instantally fell in love with it for the shear fact that he could move around pretty freely he really enjoys it It is a little basic in design and I have found that the toys do not stay put for very long they are not made very well and are very basic My main problem with this walker is that it is a pain in the butt to put away it doesn t fold up easily and it doesn t stay folded for very long I also am having problems ajusting the height of the walker my friend put it all the way down and now I can t get it to go back up so my son s is basically standing all by himself when he is in it which I am not complaining about 
4 0 I like it Our child is still to short at 7 months age for her feet to touch the ground but until she can she enjoys sitting and playing in it 
4 0 Perfect for the price I purchased this walker for my 7 month old daughter and she loves it Great for the price My only complaints were that it was kind of a pain to put together pieces didnt snap together easily and second the toys were a little too far away for her to reach at first 
5 0 Safety 1st My granddaughter age 7 mos is enjoying her new found freedom and I think this product is well worth the money The folding take along feature is great as they live quite a distance from me and this makes the walker easier to pack 
5 0 Walking to Freedom We bought this walker for my son when he was about 8 months old He immediately loved it and always wanted to be in it This walker is so easy for him to turn corners and move all around the house in It keeps him busy and happy for hours The tray on the front is also great to put snacky type foods for him to eat while he is in it as well as his sippy cup to drink from when he needs it I would reccommend this walker to anyone with a baby especially a baby that really wants to move 
5 0 Beautiful dresser for the price We are very happy with this dresser especially considering the reasonable price when looking at other dressers It looks beautiful with the matching Ellis crib and was easy to assemble Although the drawers may not be sturdy enough to last for 20 years of wear and tear this is perfect for nursery furniture and we plan to use it for all our future children s nurseries Fortunately we didn t have any scratches or dents with this dresser but Simplicity had good customer service when we needed a replacement part for the crib 
5 0 Love these bags I started out pumping and thought I would store all of my milk in Medela s bottles When I realized how much milk I would need to store I quickly realized that would cost me an arm and a leg the bottles run about 20 bucks for 4 and came upon these little wonders They are made of a thick polyethylene plastic safe for long term storage and you can t beat the zip loc style closure compared with other tie bags those scared me every drop truly is precious Granted they are a bit awkward at first because you are dealing with a container that is much less sturdy than the plastic bottles most women pump into but it works well once you get used to it 
5 0 My daughter LOVES this Toy Intstead of adding yet another musical instrument to the toy box I purchased this for her at just over 2 yrs of age It is our only Xylophone and she loved it immediately I still hear the tingling of chimes downstairs when she is upstairs at bathtime with her dad She makes her own melodies She hits any note and sings her favorite songs to it It has held up well 
4 0 Budding Musician After several attempts to get my 6 year old interested in some form of musical instrument I found this toy We both love it It combines two of her favorite things making noise and playing with water It floats on the water or sticks to the walls She is even learning to recognize the positions and names of the notes on the water proof song sheets included and can now play the songs on her little piano and her recorder Songs like Twinkle Twinkle and Mary had a Little Lamb etc I wish they would make additional song sheets for her to learn 
5 0 floating tub fun this item is about as festive as you can get besides the water flutes i was afraid they wouldn t resonate they float they piece together like a puzzle and they sound terrific 
5 0 My baby loves it My 4 month old loves it and has loved it since he was around 3 months old I hang it from his bassinet the toy bar on his stroller car seat and the toybar on his swing It always catches his interest and as he s growing he s discovering new things about it That the feet make sounds or feel crunchy etc It s great to watch him engage a toy like this It s the first one that he had interest in and the longest lasting 
5 0 held head up in days My newborn hated tummy time on the floor Would lay his head down and just cry just like my daughter had I bought the lamaze spin and explore and he loved it Within days he could hold his head all the way up for minutes at a time and now that he is four months old he spins himself around playing with the different toys attached Great buy 
5 0 unseparable for 5 years now My daughter received a small Fluffles from grandma when she was 4 5 months old She had a visible reaction to it right from the start and has not spent a single night without him for the past 5 years We have bought several backup Fluffles thank goodness some have been lost but we were able to replace I regularly wash them in the normal spin cycle with normal detergent and I dry them in the gentle cycle of the dryer They are not as fluffy and texture of fur has changed a bit but they have held up fine 
5 0 We can never leave home without Lamby We bought this for our daughter when she was approximately 5 months old She is now 3 and has been sleeping with it every night since then Whenever she is upset about something she gets her lamby and cuddles with it until she feels better We always take it on trips with us and she hugs it in the car It has sewn on eyes so we don t worry about choking hazards WARNING When she was very young my daughter got her fingers caught under and twisted in the ribbon around the lamb s neck We have two back up Fluffles and have cut the ribbons off all of them 
5 0 Fluffles aka Lambchop My son has had the smaller version 11 Fluffles aka Lambchop since birth He is now 9 months old and has to have Lambchop go everywhere he goes Needless to say Lambchop gets very used The label says surface clean only but my Mother keeps our son and she decided one day to try to wash Lambchop He really needed a good washing because our son was going through the heavy drooling stage and Lambchop s fur was getting crunchy Well he made it through the gentle cycle and through the dryer on a rack with the air fluff cycle He has been washed this way several times He comes out so nice and fluffy Of course wash at your own risk but it works for us I am going to purchase our son the larger version 14 Fluffles This will be so handy in the event we have to retire the original Fluffles Lambchop and Fluffles will be able to grow with our son also We love this toy 
5 0 Couldn t live without this My twins are 3 months old and have been sleeping through the night for a month because of these blankets They are super soft and keep my babies nice warm during cold nights especially their hands I worried about them pulling their blankets over their faces at night and swaddling with receiving blankets wouldn t hold them they wiggle a lot so these are the perfect solution I m ordering 2 more in the large size to get us through the winter I highly recommend and will be gifting these to my expectant friends in the future 
5 0 Helps Baby Sleep When my daughter was born I didn t know about swaddling and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep then put her in her crib and she d flail her arms wake up and cry and I had to start all over What a nightmare Then I figured out that since her arms wake her it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn t move them as much so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets It worked It became much easier to get her to sleep But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again When she was a little over a month old somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it It worked like a charm It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it and it stayed put My daughter started sleeping so much better I wish I found those blankets sooner it would ve saved me from so many sleepless nights I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep 
4 0 Works great for our infant Our son now 3 mo s old is a great sleeper when he s swaddled in this thing Without it he thrashes his arms and legs and startles himself awake With it he settles down and sleeps like a champ We ve been using it since he was a newborn The little square of velcro doesn t hold the bottom part on well at all but it s winter so we dress him in sleeper jammies underneath the Swaddleme anyway so it s not a big issue When we came home from the hospital at first we tried swaddling using receiving blankets but our son wiggled right out We re huge fans of the SwaddleMe and now give it as our standard baby shower gift 
4 0 Wait until your baby is born to purchase This is a great idea which I really thought my baby would enjoy since I had read they loved to be swaddled But my daughter did not like to be swaddled at all So I ended up returning this product and using our Halo sleepsacks instead which gave her hands and feet more freedom My advice is to purchase only one of these before birth and then if your baby enjoys being swaddled then purchase more if not you can return it or not and not feel bad that it was only 9 99 Also remember once babies can move their hands around more freely they should not be swaddled 
5 0 Great seat We have three of these one for each vehicle and they have served our daughter well They are lightweight for easy portability and soft as booster seats go 
5 0 Contoured Changing Pad This was a really nice changing pad It was soft and comfortable The only thing I didn t like is that you will have to buy a cover for it so that s more add l money It was worth the price though 
5 0 Great monitor I absolutely love it I got this monitor new on ebay it has a great range I love the clarity that it offers I can tell if the baby is waking up just rolling over giggling in his sleep I recommend it over the other higher priced monitors 
5 0 very good product This product works very well It has a long range the battery last long and the reception is very good Also the feature of having two AC adaptors helps to save the battery life of the receiver 
5 0 Much more than I expected I ordered this monitor to listen for my mother who is unable to get around because I am unable to sit with her every moment I wanted to be able to have some freedom to roam around another room and be able to listen for her in case she needed me The monitor wasn t that expensive so I wasn t expecting much I was pleasantly surprised that this monitor picks up every noise in the room There is also a clip so you can attatch it to yourself and not be contained to one room of the house It can either be plugged in or ran by batteries I couldn t be more pleased with the monitor I would recommend it because it is worth every cent 
4 0 Don t be fooled Don t be fooled This carseat cover is no where near weather proof That s not to say it isn t a nice product I do like it much better than any other cover I ve found It does keep my 3 month old nice and warm however the flap that goes over her head is not secured by anything The wind easily catches it and blows it off 
5 0 So comfy I tried it out myself and it was so comfy womfy I couldnt even believe it you silly tootzii wootziis 
5 0 Winter Baby Must Have This is a must for any parent that lives in a cold climate we use this item on a daily basis and I could not imagine having to struggle with my newborn trying to get her into a snowsuit I have had many comments on how cute the bundle me is and have found that is washes up very nicely and provides the utmost in convienence 
5 0 Incredible I received this gift after my daughter was born and we used it for the first time today and I LOVE IT It was so soft and warm that I wish they made them for adults The colors are beautiful and the entire thing is washable The only downfall is that there is no way to cover her head without her suffocating Luckily there is extra fabric on the top piece that I tucked underneath my hand while I was carring the carseat and it did block the horrible Michigan wind If there were 10 stars then the Urban Bundle Me would receive all 10 
5 0 Urban Bundle Me Limited Diva I love this carrier cover It is so soft and it keeps my baby warm It also protects her from the rain when we step out from the car to the places we are going to Everyone is always asking me where I baught this cover There is nothing like it I totally recomend this product 
5 0 Chic bundle me I love this bundle me product and so does my baby girl I also got many compliments from other parents on how it looked and the fabric 
5 0 My favorite training pants These are awesome training pants They hold one accident really well and are the trimmest training pants I ve found They look like real underwear Great for when the child needs protection from occasional accidents They are not as absorbent as a diaper so they should be used once the child is doing well with potty training 
4 0 Secure seat and good for travel too My daughter is only 2 and a half but she is off the charts for height and weight As such she simply didn t fit into her regular car seat anymore To be honest I was a little apprehensive about switching her from a car seat to a booster seat before the age of 3 but she was VERY uncomfortable in her car seat and would cry whenever we stuffed her into it So I bit the proverbial bullet and bought this booster One feature that really interested me in this seat was portability My father lives out of state so we will be doing a lot of traveling I wanted a seat we could easily check on an airplane This seat fit the bill The seat is not as compact as I would have hoped but it is no bigger than a small piece of luggage and could be easily carried onto a plane However I think this seat will be a little cumbersome to carry on if you are trying to manage getting onto a plane with a 2 and a half year old and everything else that comes with her coloring books portable dvd player snacks etc so I will more than likely check this seat As such I am going to order the carrying case I saw in some reviews that some folks checked the seat in the box it came in but I find that to be too cumbersome As for the seat itself my daughter LOVES it She is very comfortable in it and calls it her big girl seat no more fights getting her into her seat I LOVE that it has a compartment to store the owner s manual in so that you always have it at hand Also even though it is not a five point harness I feel my daughter is very secure in it I love that it has the wrap around headrest and the height couldn t be easier to adjust we figured it out before we even opened the manual When you thread the shoulder belt through the catch under the headrest it positions the belt correctly over your child s body so that he she is not choked by it Make sure you pull the belt all the way out and then let it slowly wind itself back until it is taut over your child this will lock the belt in place I would have given this seat five stars if it folded down a little more compactly and or came with the carrying case it has a built in handle but if you are going to check this on a plane I would feel more comfortable having it in something to protect the fabric from ripping staining etc Overall this is a GREAT product which is comparably priced to other full booster seats which don t fold I have recommended this to my friends 
5 0 I love this product That s just it I love this product and I am so happy that we purchased it It saves time and space and is very safe for my children We bought 2 one for each of my children and they have been wonderful 
4 0 New mom essential tools I really love this diaper bag It is compact and light weight I have other diaper bags but this is the only one I use Its many pockets allows you to carry everthing you need for the you and your bunble of joy I m serious it all fits I m really happy with this dipaper ba 
4 0 Take only what you need I have a 2 5 year old and a 16 month old and this bag leaves my hands free to carry them or hold hands without having to constantly adjust a bag It is the perfect size to take just what we need and not be bogged down by an inconvient bag The very bottom pocket is very easy to get into without taking the bag off it s a great place for your wallet and keys If you need to carry sippy cups and not bottles make sure they are not too tall or they won t fit in the middle compartment which is meant for bottles The bottle attachment is good to store snacks if you don t need to carry a bottle 
5 0 I wish I knew about this bag 4 years ago This has been the perfect diaper bag so easy to wear and compartments for everything It looks compact but is pretty roomy I have a 3 year old and 18 month old and carry my cell phone wallet plenty of snacks sippy cup 2 diaper and wipes everywhere we go I haven t missed all the excess stuff I used to carry in my uncomfortable previous diaper bags Love it 
5 0 Useful and stylish Years ago with my first child I learned to hate those clich� oversized diaper bags especially when most of my outings were short errands Why bring what amounts to a piece of luggage on those short trips This diaper bag is the ULTIMATE in functionality for brief jaunts holding a truly amazing amount of stuff but holding it stylishly to boot It may look small but I can carry three or four diapers a small container of wipes a change of clothes a nursing shawl a burp cloth or two spare baby socks and a hat a teething ring or two a snack my wallet keys Palm pilot a tube of diaper rash cream and a few other odds and ends in there with no problem There are lots of zip compartments to keep it all organized I get a lot of compliments on it which is strange considering it s a diaper bag In fact a woman stopped me in the store the other day and wanted to know where I d gotten it because it was exactly the purse she d been looking for she was shocked to learn it was a diaper bag It s sporty enough that my husband and 13 y o son don t mind carrying it either If you re going on a day trip you ll need something bigger but for those typical quickie errands you can t beat this bag 
5 0 Baby loves it My daughter loves this toy She got it for Christmas I didn t have batteries for it for a few days but she played with it even without the sounds lights She loves the phone that hangs from it I finally got batteries for it and it kept her entertained quite a bit on our 11 hour trip to the beach The remote came in handy I d just hit a button it would light up play music for her while she was in her car seat Highly recommend 
4 0 Keeps germs away from my daughter me I love it Great way to keep my daughter from touching chewing the cart and me from having to touch the cart handle There are loops to attach toys and 2 side pockets to hold small items I find the material thickness to be perfectly fine I mean come on this isnt a carseat it s fabric meant to be a barrier between baby cart If it were padded or had an organizer in the back it would be too bulky take up cart space The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the safety belt is too long it isnt attached to the product which means it will most likely get lost Mine did Overall great product makes an excellent babyshower gift 
5 0 Easy to use and comfy for baby I had originally tried another type of shopping cart cover which was difficult to use A friend of mine was using the Buggy Bagg and I was impressed that she was able to install it in the cart with one hand while holding her baby in the other I liked that the Buggy Bagg completely covered anywhere the baby might touch It comes with a pillow but frankly the padded back and seat were so comfortable that I never needed to use the it You may find the pillow more useful with a younger baby that isn t sitting up steadily yet I ve also used it to cover a restaurant high chair the fit is very tight and a bit lopsided but if you have a small baby it works out great The large pockets on the back are also a great feature I keep wipes diapers and diaper cream in the large pocket all the time and the smaller pockets come in handy while I m shopping for my sunglasses and coupons 
5 0 Deluxe My mom insisted that I have one of these So I shopped and shopped around and found this It is truly the ultimate cart cover It s very plush and the Jungle fabric had both my husband and I entertained for a 1 2 hour Tons of teriffic features I highly recommend this one 
5 0 Excellent toy With three children in our household we ve seen our share of good and back educational toys This one is one of the best particularly for households that want to promote musical affinity It provides endless combinations of choices depending on where the child places the cube It also gives three different styles of music jazzy classical and funk The only reservation I have is that it may be a little to difficult for babies less than 1 year old 
4 0 Has been a favorite toy for a long time My daughter received this on her first birthday and still plays with it two years later We ve been able to use it for naming colors matching shapes and putting together different musical compositions The cartridge with African beats Irish jig is a lot of fun We haven t had any trouble with dropping this toy and it not playing and it s been dropped thrown kicked loved My only complaint is the price the reason for 4 stars 
4 0 Urban and Lite BundleMe good products We have both an Urban and the Lite Bundle Me I m glad we bought both The thicker Urban has been great in the colder weather It s thicker and so stiffer than the Lite which makes it easier for me to zip up in the carseat and then fold the flap down to leave my daughter s face exposed In windy cold or nasty weather I bring the flap up to cover her completely for the short outdoor time between car and destination The Lite is flimsier and was perfect for early Fall and I m starting to use it in the stroller for warmer winter days I personally prefer the stiffer Urban but the Urban is so much warmer than the Lite I m glad to have both Switching the 2 is very easy and takes only a minute or two With both versions we just put on a hat and the baby is ready to go No jackets or snowsuits needed We also have a set of Cushy Straps cute fleece animal shaped covers for the stroller carseat straps that cushion the straps AND help keep the child s head from lolling around and those help keep the top of baby from being too exposed when you have the Bundle Me folded down or partially unzipped 
5 0 Very Handy I love this product I got it after taking a shopping trip during cold weather and struggling all day long to keep my baby warm with a blanket Since I got this shopping in cold weather is a breeze The only thing is as soon as you get inside anywhere you ll need to unzip the top and take it off or your baby will get way too hot I also use it on my stroller during walks and even in 40 degree weather my son is able to take a cozy nap while I get my exercise It s really easy to take on and off your carseat They make one for toddlers also so I may get another when my son outgrows this one 
4 0 Overall a decent product Overall we are quite happy with the BundleMe which fits perfectly into our infant car seat Graco SnugRide The product is of good quality though the zippers are not running very smoothly Regarding its design the only downside we see is that the front part is very loose making it difficult to get a tight enough fit around baby s neck and shoulders to keep him warm in colder weather Bottom line however is that it is a good product that we can recommend 
4 0 Keeps baby warm without all the blankets The Bundle Me is a nice accessory to have during the cold winter months It attaches very easily to the carseat and I can leave all the extra blankets at home except for a light one This particular model is wind and rain resistant which is nice for keeping my little one dry It s a great concept kudos to whomever invented it I do have 2 complaints though First it s not as effective for younger babies My daughter is just 7 weeks old and I don t zip up all the way This keeps the fabric out of her face I will use one light blanket until she is bigger and the Bundle Me is a bit more snug around her Secondly the zippers aren t as smooth as I d like them to be They occasionally catch the fabric on the inside so zipping up is sometimes more work and always when I m in a hurry But overall I m glad I bought this It s nice having a barrier against the wind rain and cold with just one item 
5 0 Well worth the money If you travel with a toddler this is a great item to have We had one of the cheaper ones before and you get what you pay for The cheaper one didn t last through the first leg of our trip This one is very heavy duty and well made 
4 0 Works great We have the Britax Marathon Greatest seat ever and this is our second carrier the seat fits into the bag very easily It hooks up to our suitcase and is ready to be pulled We strongly recommend this seat 
5 0 Very convenient This was a great purchase The bag fit my Britax Boulevard carseat with the GoGoBabyz wheels attached to it I was able to wheel my baby in the car seat at the airport and up to the gate and then easily place the carseat with wheels into the bag and gate check it It kept the car seat clean and I was able to store an extra blanket inside the bag 
4 0 Loved it A Life Saver I couldn t imagine traveling with a wandering toddler alone with all the carry ons AND the car seat This car seat carrier sure is a life saver It s easy to use easy to roll and easy to fold store It makes a big difference having those wheels My only concern with this product was the fabric it was thinner than I expected If it were to have a sturdier fabric it would be perfect 
4 0 the wheels are worth it This is the second car seat carrier we ve owned but the first one with wheels The wheels make SUCH a difference when you re traveling with kids Both of our car seats fit we took the lighter of the two with a little extra room for coats toys etc The bag held up well for our first trip and it was easy to use I only wish it had 4 wheels instead of 2 but you can t beat this one for the price 
5 0 very convenient We used this carrier while on a trip to Florida It was very convenient to use and wheel through the airport since we dont check the carseat so we can use it on the plane Since the bag as 2 zippers on it we were actually able to leave my sleeping daughter in the car seat in the bag with the zippers part way down in each side so her face was out This way I didnt have to carry a sleeping baby and by other bags through the aiirport I just pulled her along in the car seat since it has wheels She fell asleep in her carseat while on the plane and didnt wake up until after we got off the plane picked up our baggage got our rental car and put her car seat in the car and were traveling to our destination We also have used the Eddie Bauer bag on a past trip the strap broke while carrying it through the airport and it doesnt have wheels so it was much more difficult to carry 
5 0 Exactly what I was looking for This is exactly what I was looking for my little thumb sucker Keeps his hands clean Fits all shopping carts so far inc Costco I use it on restaurant high chairs as well Worth every penny you spend on it 
5 0 Thank you very much It is worthy for me to purchase this item for my daughter to stay so clean while going shopping 
5 0 must have i received this as a baby welcoming gift back in oct 2003 i have used it every single time we need a shopping cart and LOVE it i leave it in the back of my car and grab it when we go to a store almost everytime we re out i get someone asking me where i got it i wash mine probably once or twice a month and it still looks fabulous my second child is using it and loves to eat a small snack off of it while we shop i am buying one for my friend who is due next month and will buy for all my future expecting friends perfect gift and dearly loved 
5 0 Great value The Whimsical Clean Shopper has met all my expectations it is easy to use fits both shopping carts of all sizes as well as restaurant highchairs it is large enough to cover all those germ infested areas that my baby might touch or chew on quickly folds when we re done with it and easy to wash I couldn t ask for more 
5 0 Great product We ve been using this cart cover for four months now and have really liked it I originally ordered it to provide a little extra cushioning in the cart seat but have liked that I can attach a toy to it and stuff a bottle in the pocket When my son goes through a teething phase it s handy as a barrier over the various carts It s much easier to throw the cover over the cart than wipe down the entire seat I like the whimsical pattern it s so bright and cheery We re expecting a baby girl in a couple of months and are happy to be able to use this pattern with her also We ve also used it as a highchair cover in restaurants from time to time It s a little bulky but functions as a great crumb catcher 
4 0 Good product but not perfect My son is 7 months old and just started sitting in high chairs at restaurants and shopping carts So far the Clean Shopper is working pretty well for us The fabric is thick so it doesn t make a tiny package It also doesn t fold up neatly so you have to kind of just wad it up It isn t cushioned but if it were it would be huge and I have enough issue trying to carry my son a cart cover my purse and whatever else I might need Besides he doesn t really need cushioning Even at 7 months he s perfectly comfy on the thick bedspread like fabric The Clean Shopper comes in a thick plastic bag the sort of thing bedspreads or other linens come in that zips closed It s a snug fit to get in there because of the wadded nature of the bundle but it works fine The handle is short and taut so isn t of much use A longer strap so it could be shoulder worn or hung on a stroller would be better The loops work well and it s a relief to have a clean place my son can sit and play with anchored toys He can t throw the toys in the floor and he stays entertained There are velcro tabs on the front that can be fastened around the front of a shopping cart or high chair This keeps it in place better The leg holes don t match up exactly with whatever he s sitting in but it doesn t cause a problem My main problem with the Clean Shopper is that the belt strap does not attach to the seat It s a completely seperate piece Unless you are careful to snap the belt clips together looping the belt around a part of the seat you will end up losing the strap Somehow I ve lost mine after only a few uses I kept it rolled up inside the thing when I removed it from a cart and it probably fell out in a parking lot somewhere When handling a baby your purse whatever is in your cart or trying to eat at a restaurant it is very easy to overlook such a small item Since the website sells replacement straps it seems they are aware of the issue It s a shame they don t have velcro tabs that stick it to the back of the shopper making it harder to lose the strap I ve ordered two replacements in black so I can see the strap more clearly against my blue Clean Shopper I will also make certain I buckle the strap clips It s a good seat cover overall definitely worth having Just be careful of the strap 
5 0 Buy it Give it as a Gift I love my clean shopper and every time I use it I have at least one person asking me where I got it I also buy it as baby gifts for all of my friends It s the best purchase that I ve bought There are no strings to tie no velcro to deal with no snaps or buttons it s just a piece of fabric that covers pretty much all size carts To keep my now toddler occupied while I shop I still use it for him I place some goldfish either next to him or in front of him and he eats them while I shop Those who say there is no cushioning that s not really the purpose of the clean shopper It s purpose is to act as a buffer between you and the cart If there was cushion to it and tons of bells and whistles then it would be too bulky and too cumbersome to deal with I can easily flip it on the cart with one hand while I ve got my kid in my other I highly recommend the clean shopper to any parent 
5 0 Best thing I ever bought This is a great shopping cart cover The cost is a little more than other covers but is definately worth the extra money It covers every part of the cart your baby can touch I am even able to use it over restaurant high chairs not a perfect fit but covers everything There are little loops to hook toys into in the front and inside side pockets to stash snacks or whatever I hide my wallet in there while shopping sometimes It is a bit large when folded to big to fit in diaper bag if you have more than a few diapers in it but that is due to the nice soft and durable fabric It comes in a plastic carrying case with a handle I m guessing it s about 12 x8 and about 2 thick I leave mine in the car I just wish I would have found this sooner my daughter loves it too Would be a great gift for a baby shower 
5 0 A HUGE HELP This potty helped our son to go from sitting on the toilet to standing Like Daddy He loves it and our youngest son is now trying to follow his big brother Quality construction and a breeze to clean and store 
5 0 Practical Peter Potty is Perfect My son was learning to potty on the toilet but I was in no rush due to all the extra time I had to spend cleaning the potty splash zone around our toilet I was happy to purchase the Peter Potty and give it a shot and happier that Amazon had free shipping on it at the time It arrived quickly and was easy to set up My son loves it He is proud at his new talent and I am happy to spend less time wearing cleaning gloves I add a tiny amount of bleach to the water in the top compartment so when he flushes there is a little less cleaning for me Thanks Amazon 
5 0 No more mess I keep my 2 yr old grandson and bought this in hopes it would stop the mess at potty time It went everywhere except where it was supposed to go if you know what I mean It works great NO MORE MESS The only thing I disliked was it was so easy to remove the water container and that is just what he liked to do Since he has gotten used to it he no longer messes with the container He uses it flushes it and on his way My other grandson was here this weekend and he chose to use it for the first time and did great also It is a great product and I would highly recommend it I might be buying 2 more 
4 0 great training for our boys this was one of the best devices we ever got to help with toilet training The boys really took to it right away and now prefer it over the sit down The flushing mechanism is not well made and broke pretty quickly But we still use it a lot 
5 0 Great Potty for standing up We bought this potty for our son while he was potty training At first he didn t want to stand up but once I got The Peter Potty it s all he uses It s very easy to use and it s his own potty We did have some trouble with it not flushing but figured out that I was screwing the lid on to tight I would recommend this potty for any little boy Remember to dump the tray every night too 
5 0 Nice play yard sheet This sheet is soft and nicely padded It fits the play yard well I would recommend it to other parents 
5 0 Seatbelt lays fine I m not sure what the other reviewer was talking about we used this for my daughter all fall winter and spring and her seatbelt laid just fine there was no difference at all It velcros around the seatbelts so I m not sure what the nurses were talking about Other than that this thing is wonderful My daughter was a summer baby so we usually just used receiving blankets But we got this in the fall and were able to use it all winter and into the spring It kept her warm enough even on the cold days I would probably suggest getting the heavier version for newborns in the winter but this worked great for our older baby in the winter There s no need to worry about blankets or extra layers of clothes or snowsuits The Bundle Me Lite stays attached to the carseat all you need to do is zip it up and you re ready to go It detaches very easily because it s just velcro and can be washed It actually acted as a protective barrier for the carseat for those accidents We still washed the carseat for these situations but it greatly minimized damage This is a fabulous extra for the carseat we ll definitely be using it again with the next baby 
4 0 Cool Days Rainy Days Any Days I just purchased this for the cool wet spring months of New England I also have the Bundle Me Original which was great for the winter months This is a nice alternative when the Original becomes too warm to use but you still need a little something The inner lining is soft against your baby s skin and the outside lining protects him her against cool weather and rain The only negative thing I have to say about this is that it does not fit as well on my car seat as the Original It tends to slide down a little I have the new Graco Safe Seat which is larger than most car seats so this could be the reason It may fit better on smaller car seats I also love the pink girly color Now that the weather is warming up a bit it works great when going into air conditioned buildings that are just a little too cool for baby It is also a nice barrier from the sun s harmful rays 
4 0 Nice for spring summer babies I bought one of these and a regular bundle me for my daughter I have an older child that goes to school and it protected my daughter from the wind rain when we had to go to the bus stop in bad weather I only gave 4 stars because I used the regular bundle me much more than the lite Given the choice to do it over I would still have bought it though 
5 0 Not Safe I bought one of these for my daughter I had it in the car seat when we left the hospital The nurses made me take it out They wouldn t let her leave the hospital with it They said it wasn t safe to use They said the it doesn t allow the seatbelt straps to lay properly over the baby s shoulders making it unsafe I wish I would have known this before I bought it 
5 0 Beautiful lamp This lamp is perfect in my baby s nursery It matches all the other Hello Kitty stuff 
5 0 HK Lamp perfect for baby or little girl s room This lamp is so cute and just what I had hoped The kitty is stuffed and the only down side to it is that her neck slightly slouches I d prefer her sitting more upright though I am sure there is a way to straighten her out a bit Lamp is well made and gives off good light without being too bright Perfect for your Hello Kitty fan 
4 0 exactly as described easy to use fast with a flexible tip I believe the readings where accurate and the beeping was a nice signal of fever before you even looked at the thing And the flexible tip also comes in handy when you re doing underarm temp taking I hate doing a rectal one but this makes me feel like I m not being totally invasive 
5 0 REPLACEMENT FILTERS ARE VERY EASY TO FIND I love this humidifier because it lasts long My brother is already through his 3rd humidifier in 4 years while I ve only had this unit for 4 years it has more years ahead Also I find the volume at the low setting very soothing and helps me fall asleep I ve read the posts that mention the filters being hard to find However they are very easy to find The evenflo filter is the SAME EXACT filter as the Holmes HWF62 filter which is available in many places since Holmes still manufactures humidifiers which require this filter I just purchased a colorcheck by Holmes filter from Walmart and I still have an original evenflo branded filter from last year I put them up to each other and they are the SAME EXACT dimensions Actually I prefer the colorcheck over the original evenflo filter because I think it lasts longer before needing replacement If you look at the bottom of the evenflo humidifier box it will say that this humidifier was manufactored by Holmes for evenflo Therefore it would only make sense that a Holmes filter would be compatible with this unit 
4 0 Love it I have been through 5 humidifiers in the last 2 months This is the only one that I have found that sufficiently does the job There is no dampness or residue left after using this humidifer for a length of time because there is no vapor After buying others like this that draws dry air in and releases cool and moist air I was skeptical to spend the money on this one because I found the others not to work well at all When running this humidifier for the first time I could actually notice a difference in the humidity level in my daughter s room after running it for about an hour This did not happen with the others Yes it is a loud unit but you get used to it and it does a great job of draining out all of the other noise in the home for my toddler while she is sleeping I have never had a problem with the filter or finding replacements nor have I had a problem with my toddler taking it apart I am very please with this product and will continue to recommend it to others 
5 0 DEFINETLY A HELPER After reading the other reviews on this product I felt that I needed to put a positive spin on this product I registered for this item and received it at my shower My son is 5 1 2 months old and was severly congested I took the box out of his closet and set up the machine After the first night about 10 hours he woke up for the first time in 2 weeks able to drink his bottle with out me using saline drops and an aspirator I am continuing to use this product every night and every morning is much more pleasant As for the noise level I do not find that to be an issue I don t have a problem hearing my son cry or even move around on the monitor I feel the noise is actually soothing for the child and helps fade out other noise in the house I am glad I got this product and would personally recommended it to anyone I do understand this product is a little pricey but I believe it is worth every penny 
5 0 Great baby s book My granddaughter loves this book She has other similar types of books They are great for chewing on without getting ruined No one gets hurt if she throws it Bright and cheerful colors Also very durable 
5 0 Great Book My 8 month old loves this book It is fun to read and she enjoys the interaction with the caterpillar 
5 0 Great Bottle Finally Finally a bottle that is easy to clean and my baby loves We have been through every bottle out there and wasted so much money that I vowed never to try another but when my second baby refused the bottle I had settled on the playtex with my son because it was problem free and refused playtex I tried these It s the only bottle she will take She is also breastfed so I m not sure if these are just better for breastfed babies but she has no gas problems with these and they are incredibly easy Also cool how the cover fits on the bottom of the bottle so if you are out and about it s easy to find 
5 0 It worked when my daughter rejected every other bottle My daughter is breastfed and we started her on 1 bottle a day of breastmilk when she was 3 5 weeks old She started using the Playtex Ventair and had no problems for over a month Then all of a sudden she went on a bottle strike We tried different bottles Dr Browns Avent cheapies and different nipple flows she wouldn t take any of them When I found out that Soothie made bottles I thought it was definately worth the try since that was the only pacifier that she would take She took the Soothie bottle instantly 
5 0 Love the Soothie Love it Love it My 5 month old has been breastfed with an occasional bottle I decided to move her to bottle only and she refused any kind of bottle I tried Avent Playtex Nurser Evenflo Elan and Gerber I even tried different flows and materials of some of these bottles I tried them over and over again but when I tried the Soothie she took it the very first time and hasn t even complained What a relief Besides being relieved that she will take the Soothie they are also very inexpensive which is another plus 
5 0 WE LOVE SOOTHIES Our son would never take a paci if it weren t for soothies and there is no giving it up now now that we have the same nipple for our bottle no more nipple confusion oP They are great no complaints I don t know why the previous reviewer only gave 4 stars If you don t screw ANY bottle tight enough it leaks duh 
5 0 Dream Teddy Hamper The hamper is very sturdy It is also large enough to hold quite a lot of clothes I would highly recommend it 
5 0 Good Quality Easy to Use Not only does this hamper match the Dream Teddy line it also nice quality It comes pre assembled just unfold The mesh bag that hangs inside makes emptying the hamper easy Definitely worth the money Also it is worth ordering from Amazon I tried ordering this from a different site that had it offered for less and never received it 
5 0 Love at first sight The minute we opened the box i knew i made the right desicion to purchase this stroller The weight is unbelieveable the ride is smooth ONE FINGER push is what it takes My 7 mos old baby girl looked very comfortable in it recline is pretty good for an infant a 2 hr nap is the proof My previous purchase of Britax Blue Blaze sold it on craigs list the day after we received it was a big mistake Spend a little more the get whole a lot A good stroller is a good investment 
4 0 Great for travel We bought this stroller from BRU in Dec for a trip to Disney Our Graco was too bulky and hard to fold to mess with getting on and off buses and rides I chose this stroller after trying out ALL the strollers at the store and made sure it was easy to use and very lightweight I love that the 5 point harness comes off the back so my son can sit forward in the seat The back lays all the way down unlike my Graco The basket is a good size but difficult to get things in and out of if the baby is laying down We have no trouble keeping the cup holder in the tray One warning make sure you take the buttons off the handles after you fold the stroller if you put it on an airplane They pop off easily and luckily an airline worker found ours in the luggage compartment This is the only stroller I use now and my Graco is collecting dust 
5 0 Good Stroller HORIBLE customer service The stroller arrived and said nowhere on the box it was the MT so when I called to make sure we has received the stroller we ordered the service rep was QUITE nasty and kept telling me to just send it back I LOVED the stroller and wanted to of course keep it just wanted to confirm it was the right one Apparently that was too much to ask I finally got a supervisor who with the click of a button could tell me there was a note for all service reps regarding this model stating it is in fact the MT it just doesn t say it on the box That was fine and dandy but the service rep was incredibly snotty and didn t want to take anytime to bother making sure it was the correct product would have rather just had me send it back Bad for business I d guess Not to mention they do have a serious issue letting people know when items are out of stock It was IN stock when we ordered and magically out of stock the day it was to be shipped then when I went to cancel the order via phone 48 min on hold they said oh it had already shipped they couldn t cancel the order How odd since I had no shipping info Turns out the stroller didn t ship for another WEEK and they could have easily canceled my order I don t plan to buy the Amazon again anytime soon The stroller however is FANTASTIC It folds up small easy to use with one hand and very nice on the eyes Stroller gets 5 stars Amazon gets 
4 0 New Baby new Stroller This is the 4th stroller I ve purchased I had a lightweight COMBI that was GREAT for travel as it folds to be tiny and was only 40 But it was not going to hack it for the everyday use The larger travel system stoller I had is so cumbersome in stores and difficult to load into the trunk This ARIA is very easy looks great lightweight and found the balance between small and sturdy I love it I recommend it to other moms when I get the chance Peg has a great reputation for lasting so I hope that this entry level price point meets that expectation So far I feel like it s a great value as far as strollers go 
5 0 Very nice for the price I have been using a Maclaren Triumph for the past 18 months and have been envious of all the features my friends strollers had What my stroller was missing a leg rest window through the canopy a greater sun shade the ability to increase the recline thoroughly are all found with the zooper twist plus more I love the matching boot and that the accessories are included I may go ahead and order a more structured cup holder cuz I dont trust the mesh one for coffee Also the wheels are smaller than what you might find on a more expensive stroller so for longer walks you may want a nicer zooper model Other than that it is gorgeous and perfect for mall walking shorter street walks My friends now have stroller envy of me for a change and thats fun 
5 0 Durable easy to use placemats These are great our 8 month old can t rip them off the table like she does everything else that s NOT taped down one note though is that you can t use them on restaurant booster seat trays you need to have a totally flat surface Overall though the placemats are great with cute designs and the bonus Purell doesn t hurt either 
5 0 Great for long trips We purchased this Fisher Price soft travel tray prior to our 12 Hour plane flight to Hawaii We have a 2 1 2 year old and she used this for everything on the plane as well as in the car while we were in Hawaii The tray is great for snacks coloring playing and pretty much anything else you can think of It is especially beneficial on a plane as the trays on the plane don t work well with for kids in carseats I won t go anywhere without this product It is comfortable as the bottom is squishy so it won t hurt their legs and it straps on so they don t lose any thing We plan on buying another one when our baby is old enough to use it 
4 0 Helpful gadget Having twins we always had to write down everything or we wouldn t remember whom we feed when we feed them or any details We used to keep a chart but then I received the Itzbeen as a gift It is so much faster to press a button then to write everything down When we go out I just toss it in my purse and when the babies start crying I can just pull out the itzbeen look at the timers and figure out if it is time to eat or they are just being fussy If the boys do eat or require a diaper change I can record it easily no more carrying around a clipboard I didn t give it 5 stars because it would be even better if it could track how many oz of formula the babies eat and if it could total the number of hours the baby slept But still it is a nice tool for forgetful people I m buying a 2nd one so I have one for each of my twins 
4 0 Worked OK for us We have a GE XL44 gas stove Installation was all of ten seconds We have a crawler not yet toddler So far he can just reach the knobs and can t get enough leverage from that angle to do anything For us it s pretty easy to open and close the covers to use the burners 
4 0 The best we have found for stove knobs A little annoying at first but once you get used to them they are great 
5 0 These covers are great I ve been using them for 5 years now the SAME ONES and they re fabulous They re not hard at all to use nothing like the doorknob covers those things are annoying and they DO keep my children from touching the knobs which is what they re for I ve never had a problem with the babies pulling them off or figuring out how to open the stove AND if they go towards the stove at all it gives me that extra split second to deter them that I might not have without them 
5 0 Great for stay at home moms I bought this upon the recommendation of my lactation consultant and so far I ve been very pleased I wanted to have a few bottles of breastmilk available so my husband could feed our baby when I m out running errands There are just a few parts so assembly disassembly and cleaning is very easy But the best part about the pump is that you can buy different sized breastshields to use with it I needed a larger one than what came standard with it It makes pumping more comfortable The first few times I used it I considered switching to an electric pump because I wasn t pumping much milk But the more I pumped the more milk I produced This breastpump is worth every penny I recommend it to anyone who primarly breastfeeds but wants the option of being able to have someone else occasionally feed the baby 
4 0 Good Pump If you are planning to stay at home and you are going to pump only a couple of times a day maybe 2 or 3 this is a great pump I didn t know how to use it at first but after calling Medela s customer support line I was able to use it easily I didn t rate it 5 stars only because you can t use it many times throughout the day Your hands would hurt But other than that I think is a great pump for the price 
5 0 Love the Hooks With 2 little kids in a stroller I depend heavily on these hooks to help me carry all the gear I have especially when traveling or shopping The diaper bag and coats fit into the strollers basket but I ve used the hooks to carry an additional beach bag to the beach or pool as well as shopping bags I ve also used them to hold my purse and camera bag They really increase the holding capacity of the stroller I wish they were more widely available Unfortunately they can be hard to find in stores and on the web 
5 0 My baby LOVES his Snuggle Nest My son is 7 weeks old and has been using the Snuggle Nest in my bed since he was 3 weeks old He loves his Snuggle Nest and began sleeping 3 4 hours at a time the very 1st night in it We now use it in combination with the Swaddle Me wrap and the techniques I learned in the free Happiest Baby on the Block DVD that came with our Snuggle Nest Thanks to this wonderful combo our 7 week old baby sleeps through the night 7 8 hrs This is my 3rd baby and the 1st I used a Snuugle Nest or swaddling with and he is the 1st to sleep so well so early If I could give this product 10 stars I would I also plan to use the Snuggle Nest when if we transition our baby to his crib in a month or two I am sure it will make the transition easier on him 
4 0 Gave Us Piece Of Mind I really recommend this product our baby did not like the bassinet for some reason and as a newborn we didn t want him too far from us This was the perfect solution although I would agree with some of the other users that it takes up quite a bit of room in the bed But I honestly didn t mind being a little squished given that my son slept so well in it and he was right next to us And it s great for travel 
5 0 Love it We bought this the day after our son came home and we had one night of constant worry We had planed on using a bassinet by the bed but I had an emergency c section and it was too difficult to get out of bed to get to him He is now 2 months and we still love it We don t have to worry about him at all during the night and he is very accessible for breastfeeding We have a king size bed and it fits fine It also makes it much easier to reach over and put a hand on him to quiet him during the night 
5 0 PEACE OF MIND I recomend this item to parents who want to have peace of mind while their baby is asleep It protects the child from rolling onto his her side and allows the parents to sleep with their baby without the fear of smuthering the baby However it is best if you have a King size bed My Huband and I sleep on either edge of the bed while the baby is asleep in between us feeling a little cramped 
5 0 Life Saver I bought the snuggle nest when my son was almost 10 weeks old We realized that he slept better in smaller more confining places where he could touch the sides at all times He had been sleeping through the night in his baby carriage but was getting too long for it This was perfect I put it in his crib at the bottom so he couldn t wiggle out and he continued to sleep through the night 
4 0 very cute a little tipsy Everyone who sees these bath turtles comments how very cute they are My son 13 months loves playing with them However they get turned over pretty easily and float upside down and the bottom sides are not the fun spinning twirling rattle mirror sides 
5 0 Bath Time Entertainment My son has a great time with his bath turtles He s learned the colors and play features on each turtle so that s an educational plus that I did not expect at all Somehow the turtles end up floating upside down during bath time splash factor maybe But that s half the fun making him turn them over again for more play They are easy to clean and dry so that s a plus The one bath turtle I don t completely understand is the one with the mirror inside Because of the temperature of the water it causes condensation in the protective plastic bubble so he can t see the mirror anyway so what s the point in that one Nevertheless he kinda looks at it in the middle of his bath and probably thinks Hey I was there a minute ago He picks that one up holds it up to his eye level struggles to find himself for a second laughs and puts it back in the water and picks up another turtle Go figure It s still good fun for him and the turtles keep him occupied during the shampooing and what not therefore they re okay by me Totally safe and drain proof 
5 0 Cute Dry Quickly these toys don t hold water they re colorful and cute they are also pretty durable when dropped 
5 0 Floppy Seat comfy easy to use durable We used the Floppy Seat for a couple of years when our daughter was young It was extremely easy to use No I didn t usually install it with one hand while holding my daughter although I did a few times it s not that hard I normally parked near a cart put the cover on ran the belt through THEN took my daughter out of her car seat placed her in the shopping cart Why carry your baby heavy diaper bag through the parking lot if you don t need to It was a bit stiff to get into the stuff sack at first but after one or two washings it was a cinch to put it in the stuff sack when we were finished using it It fit all the shopping carts we used including the oversized ones at Costco It s held up well to repeated washings a bit faded but still looking fairly bright There was hardly a time that we went shopping that someone didn t come over say Oh I wish we d had one of those when my children were small Overall we were very pleased with this product 
5 0 Confortable Safe and Clean Great product for those grubby shopping carts Suitable grocery carts at Target Ingles Kroger Wal Mart etc and it s easy buckle your infant in it Hard work right nahh Throw it over your shoulder and walk in the store You don t even realize it Pop it on cart and buckle your child in the seat Boom It fluffy comfortable clean lockable secure seat belt You re ready to go 
5 0 MUST HAVE I use this every time I go to the store This is probably one of the most important items I have purchased for my kids It keeps them germ free and is nice and cushioned for when they are babies and can t sit real well yet HIGHLY RECOMMENDED Buy it you will love it It is made really well 
5 0 Germ free shopping I hate to think of all the germs in shopping carts I always used this seat cover and never let my son touch the shopping carts or restaurant high chairs Too bad at 26 months he is now too big for it and now sits in those germ infested car shopping carts Oh well Purchase this product and you won t be disappointed I washed it often and it lived in the trunk of my car I do have to say that I did not put it in the carry bag form because it took too long to get it that way but it didn t matter anyway it was quicker to put it in the grocery cart when it was not in the bag form A great baby shower gift 
5 0 Only cover that fits Costco Sam s Club carts I started out with a different shopping cart cover that I bought at the grocery store It worked ok but it didn t work at all at Costco because the carts are extra wide I bought the floppy seat and it works like a charm It s the only one I ve found that s wide enough for the Costco and Sam s Club carts And it s fluffy comfy and easy to use Regarding the one reviewer s comment yes you do have to feed the strap through the back but every shopping cart cover out there requires you to do that I can t get it on with one hand but it s big enough that I can put it in the seat put my son in the seat and then get it perfectly situated once he s sitting and strapped in My only complaint is that it s pretty big but if it were smaller it probably wouldn t fit the big carts which is why I like it so much in the first place Plus it covers every inch so my very curious son can t find random shopping cart or highchair spots to suck 
5 0 I LOVE my Mei Hip We started out with a Baby Bjorn after my son was born that a relative gave us It was fine for the first few months but once he hit 17 lbs the shoulder pain was just out of control We did a bunch of research online and found lots of positive reviews for the Ellaroo Mei Hip I ordered it and have truly never looked back It is so incredibly comfortable even now when he is far heavier He is nearly a year old now All of the weight is down on my hip and I regularly walk the 3 mile path around the lake by my house with him on my hip with very little effort and no pain It also packs so small light that it is really easy to keep in the diaper bag and pull out whenever we get somewhere in the car A great product 
4 0 Great idea that didn t work This product is really a great idea it s also well made Sadly it worked for about 10 minutes with our 3 year old daughter she figured out how to get it off Certainly a recommended item to those whose children don t like playing the Houdini escape artist routine 
5 0 great item the best when you re traveling and don t want to waste much space Will definitely buy it again 
5 0 SO convenient These bags are GREAT My son had an extended NICU stay so I pump exclusively and have to be very careful with hygiene With these I can quickly and easily sterilize my pump attachments his bottles his pacifiers or even a couple of his toys All I do is add some water microwave drain and done No boiling water no timing no accidentally melting things on the bottom of the pot no hassle with complicated electronic sterilzers and almost no storage space Each bag is good for around 20 uses then you toss it out and get a new one so a package of them lasts quite a while Very handy when traveling too since many hotels and gas stations have microwaves so you can sterilize what you need to on the go without trying to haul a bunch of junk around with you 
5 0 I LOVE THESE BAGS I nursed my now 4 year old daughter for almost a year and pumped daily I hated always having to boil the pump for 20 minutes which was also tough on the pump s plastic parts which would yellow until I replaced them Now I am nursing my 3 month old son I was thrilled to find these micro steam bags I use them not only to sterilize the pump after each use but also for bottles Though I pump daily I only occasionally use bottles so always boiled them too this is sooooooo much easier I am so glad they came out with this product it just makes things a lot easier And it s so inexpensive too 
5 0 love these bags The micro steam bags are wonderful I use them at work and when travelling and they make cleaning sterilizing so much easier and faster I use them on my pump parts bottles nipples pacifiers anything that can be microwaved Definitely worth the very small price 
4 0 that s a wrap This is a wonderful wrap and my baby loves it It can be tricky to figure out the best fit but comes with helpful instructions I also like the nice big pocket in the front My back hurts a bit but I am still figuring out the best way to wear it The important thing is that my baby is happy and secure in it 
5 0 It s wonderful It s so comfy and much easier than you might expect I wear it all the time 
4 0 A simple useful product Not much to it just a swatch of cloth really But it does what it says it does 
5 0 LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT This is a great product for any parent I love how easy it is once you get the hang of how to get it on watch the included video and how cuddly my newborn is when I get her in it I can cook take a walk or just sit on the couch and feel like I don t have to worry about her head flopping all over or hanging on to her She loves the closeness and so do I I live in Texas and can say that so far it s not too hot I liked the one I got for a gift so much I ordered another 
5 0 Works Great for a Hand Pump If you are going back to work and pumping full time you will probably want to go electric but as far as hand pumps go this one is great Great suction if you put it together right there is a little piece that if you put it in upside down you get frustratingly little suction if any at all The cup is comfortable though it does puddle a small amount I have not noticed any other leaks in this unit It is small compact and able to produce 4 ounces in under 15 minutes 
5 0 A LIFESAVER I went to work when my son was 7 months old I origionally bought a pump that was electric and manual It was HORRIBLE I looked on Amazon and found this one It was great having it all so I took it to work and on every break I d use it It was really nice to have 
5 0 easy to pump I have been using the Avent On the Go pump set for over 4 1 2 months now and I think the pump is very easy to use I find it very comfortable and am easily able to pump 4 or more ounces in under 10 minutes I used a Medela electric pump I do not know which model once and found the Avent Isis manual pump allowed me to pump more milk in less time The only thing I would suggest is for new mothers and their significant others to practice assembling the pump a few times prior to the arrival of their little one I found that in the first week of my baby s life I was too overwhelmed to sit down and read the Avent instructions on how to put the pump together correctly 
5 0 this funky bottle drier makes me happy Good design makes me happy When as parents we can still enjoy good design I am even more happy This bottle drying rack is greta to look at well designed for use and very convenient yay 
5 0 These ROCK I love these bottles Easy to use easy to clean I can actually pump about 5 5 oz of milk into them and I can tuck one into my purse if needed 
4 0 Great for storage These are very convenient if your child is already using the Avent bottles If you use a Medela pump you can get an adapter and pump straight into these containers eliminating a step in the breastmilk collection chain I also find that the small sizes are convenient especially if you normally pump four ounces or less out of one or both breasts I didn t give this product five stars though because really these are just four more Avent bottles with a sealing disc If you have a bunch of bottles anyway you can just buy a pack of sealing discs for about 4 and use those instead 
5 0 Easy to store use milk These sturdy containers make storing and feeding breastmilk very simple I am using a combination of bags and these containers but these are the easiest so far Great choice if using the Avent system for bottlefeeding pumping 
5 0 very practical The avent bottles are better than anything else for storage I used the bags the via containers you name it This is by far the best way to store breast milk Don t spend your money on anything else You can even use the bottles to store baby food later on You just put them in the warmer and its ready There is no mess and nothing gets wasted Good investment 
5 0 Used them with my 1st and will use them again We used Avent with our 1st baby and loved it Now that we are expecting another munchkin we planning on using them again I loved these I loved how simple it made it to store my milk Straight from the Isis Pump to my fridge freezer Simple Yes the defrosting takes longer than some alternatives but I always had a bottle in the fridge while one was defrosting I found warming it in a boiling pot of water to work the best for quick defrost They do take up more room than the bags when storing but I think the convience outweighed that problem I stored milk in the fridge and freezer and learned to rotate so room wasn t a terrible problem If you do this it is important to label and date the containers This also saved me from defrosting last minute I had some leaking issues from time to time but figured it out If you tighten the container bottle too much it will leak Simple fix don t over tighten Avent s site has a short trouble shooting list for leakage problems We tried other products but Avent was the best for our family 
5 0 Excellent containers Love this containers These work well with the Avent on the Go breast pump system I haven t had any problems with freezing them and they haven t cracked Love the fact that they are small containers 4oz so they freeze well and when it s time for the milk to be defrosted it doesn t take long I plan to make my own babyfood and I am going to use these containers LOVE THE 
5 0 Great and convenient I love these containers I have the Isis breast pump and these attaqch directly to it and then I just pop in the disk and freeze I don t have a problem defrosting them at all just soak in warm water Although I do try to defrost ahead of time if I know I ll need to use it 
4 0 great but don t freeze I use these storage containers for mixing breast milk and rice cereal to feed my daughter while we are out I love these containers for this use I don t have any problem with leaking and I can feed my daughter straight out of the jar I gave these 4 stars because I didn t get any use out of these for storing breastmilk in the freezer which is why I registered for them in the first place It takes FOREVER to defrost the breastmilk in these bottles I just ended up using the Lansinoh and Gerber milk storage bags because they defrosted quickly and took up much less room in the freezer 
4 0 Great chair if you don t mind turning it back on every 15 minutes for the vibration I love this chair Not only is it comfy cozy for a newborn but to finally have something pink for a girl is great The only downside is that my daughter loves the vibration and it shuts off after only 15 minutes and it wakes her up It also EATS batteries I have had it for 5 weeks and have replaced the 4 C batteries 3 times 
5 0 She loves it but it eats batteries like you would not believe Okay the day we arrived home from the hospital we put her in this seat and she slept for hours she loves this chair The downside to this chair is that it cost 50+ dollars to begin with and then you have to replace the batteries once a week 3 C batteries which isn t cheap We have spent well over 15 dollars in batteries in the 2 weeks that we have been home and we only turn the chair on when she is fussy it doesn t run all of the time But if you can afford to run out and get batteries every 4 days or so this chair is awesome It is very soft and she loves it I am not sure what we would have done without it 
5 0 great product My baby also has to have cereal thickened formula for his really bad reflux as ordered by his doctor i might add These nipples work great as long as the formula is too thick to use in a regular stage 1 or 2 nipple The only problem i have found with these nipples is that you have to be gentle when you are using a nipple brush to clean them so that you don t tear the y cut opening 2 of our nipples tore at the cuts causing the hole to become larger But gentler cleaning and checking the nipples before each use has remedied this problem Also want to add that my son started using these nipples at the age of 2 months and has had no problems sucking from them 
5 0 Worth every penny I have had this stroller for a little over a year now and it is an awesome stroller I have not had the wobbly or hard to steer problem at all I have had my son in it since he was 4 months old he is 20 months now and it is still very sturdy I had a Graco Quattro Tour for 2 days and took it back it was too big and way too big of a hastle to get in and out of the car I can put my Aria in and out of my SUV with one arm and it opens and collapses VERY easily like any stroller it takes a little practice I bought a mommy canvas tray for drinks and keys no big deal and I have always been able to fit my diaper bag and a few small shopping bags in the under carriage We are expecting baby 2 and are registering for the Twin version I highly recommend the Aria if you are a mom that is more about having a light weight stroller 
4 0 Great Lightweight Stroller Love it LOVE that this stroller is so light weight I purchased this stroller for our second child I wanted something super light since I would have 2 kids to trek around with I was tired of the big Evenflo travel system I had from our first child I can take this in and out of the car easily with one hand I ve never had an issue with the steering as others have stated There were some complaints about the harness It sounds to me that they just did not read the directions I use the 5 point harness everytime I put my daughter now 20 months in the stroller The harness is simple to use and is very secure The stroller hood is easy to keep clean dry Any liquid that drops on the fabric just beads up you can wipe or flick it off I even ran over this stroller with our minivan and it works as well as the day we bought it The snack tray bent but that was the only dammage to stroller I was easily able to order a replacement The only complaint I have is the lousy adult cup holder hanging from one side of the handlebar It doesn t stay in place and my water bottle slips out easily I did see this stroller at Sea World last weekend I saw a Peg Aria with a tray and cup holder that extends to each side of the stroller just below the handlebar Check with Peg I would definately puchase this stroller again 
5 0 Love the stroller I had a Combi until a few days ago I loved it but the basket was just too small it was the net kind I also wanted a snack tray for my one yr old son Also I felt that my son was already growing out of it I did alot of research wanted a light easy to handle stroller and a bit bigger than my Combi I purchased the Aria a few days ago after ALOT of steering in the store with my son in it I found no problem with the steering as a matter of fact it was so easy to steer even with one hand My son has more elbow room in his new stroller and the snack tray is great I don t use the 5pt harness much but the times that I have I had no problem with it The basket is great lots of room As far as the cup holder for the parent it isn t big by any means but I never carry around a 32 oz big gulp so it isn t a problem for me I usually have a small bottle of water or small Starbucks cup Unless you travel with large cups or bottles it works just fine I am very happy with this stroller the weight of it and carrying handle are both wonderful 
5 0 Love It My sister is always losing the binkies for her babies so I bought her a paci pod in every color and she was so excited Now she has one on her diaper bag her purse and on the crib I don t have kids but I like it so much I use it for my keys 
4 0 Good deal It is wonderful deal for the price I especially like the safety feature t bar that holds the child in without the tray 
4 0 high chair Once assembled this high chair is functional Assembling it was rather difficult but overall this high chair serves the purpose 
4 0 Awsome Warmer for Any Age Child I bought this because my 18 month old grandson whom I am raising started having fits when it came time to change his diaper This really helped to make diaper changing a breeze Even though it states you should use the packages you can just put a stack of wipes in although sometimes you have to add water on them to keep them moist but it works like a charm I always thought baby wipe warmers were just another gimmick because I did not have them when my kids were growing up but it sure helped to solve his problem Thanks so much for a great product 
5 0 THE BEST WARMER ON THE MARKET After reading over reviews of nearly every wipe warmer out there including Prince Lionheart brand we decided to go ahead and buy this one and we are SO HAPPY WITH IT Since you leave the wipes in their plastic they do not dry out at all The wipes are so nice and warm and our son LOVES THEM He can actually sleep through diaper changes and he is only 2 weeks old This model warms from the top so it doesn t dry out the wipes and there is actually liquid still left in the plastic by the time we run out and change to a new pack of wipes We go through an 80 pack refill per week with no problems whatsoever and you DO NOT add any water or anything to this warmer just plug it in and leave it plugged in and pop in some wipes ANOTHER GREAT FEATURE is that there is a mechanism in this warmer that keeps the wipes pushed to the top so you never have to reach down in there to get wipes a hard to find feature with warmers They do not brown and they are perfectly warm for about 10 seconds out of the warmer plenty of time to wipe their bottoms off We HIGHLY recommend this warmer it is THE BEST in our opinion as new parents

5 0 Avent Infant Feeding Set I used these bottles with my first son and they were wonderful They never leaked which is mentioned in many other reviews In fact they were the only bottles I found that never leaked The nipples made an easy transition to bottlefeeding from breastfeeding I now have a second child on the way and have already stocked up on Avent bottles 
5 0 Even more Cute once you see it person Okay first off I didn t get this from babiesrus because they wanted to charge an arm and leg to ship it However I got a great deal on it at babysupermall com I ordered it the week of christmas and got it that same week Shipping was free and thats great when you have to purchase something you can t see in person I love it Looks really adorable in a white crib Very good quality and the colors on it would go great in a lavendar or pink room We did our daughter s room in a dark pink at bottom with white chairrail light pink above chairrail and white crown molding Add in the wall decorations and other accessories and its tooooo cute Go to the website I mentioned to find ALL accessories for this Also you ll save in the pocketbook in shipping especially if you want the whole collection 
5 0 A LIFESAVER WON T TRAVEL AGAIN WITHOUT IT We just came back from vacation over the holidays and used the TOTEaTOT for the first time It was a lifesaver I purchased it right before we went away because I had been agonizing about how we were going to manage all the logistics of maneuvering through the airport with all of the gifts were were bringing along plus our luggage and ourselves without losing one of our kids in the process It worked just as it promised It was easy to attach the suitcase to the car seat Our son was happy as a clam getting wheeled through the airport We could easily bring his car seat on the plane without having to lug it through the airport A car seat is a must have on the airport for a happy child and happy neighboring passengers We were able to carry our gifts as carry on because we didn t want to check them and we brought a carry on suitcase in case our other checked luggage was lost we d at least have the essentials for our little one and the rest of us We had no problems with it at all It had pockets for us to store my son s bottle and we were able to use the backpack portion of the TOTEaTOT to hold his diapers and some toys I read another review where they experienced an issue with a buckle but we had no problem at all and in fact I was worried that we were perhaps over weighing it because all the stuff we had hanging off our roller suitcase besides just the TOTEaTOT car seat and our son like my handbag and a laptop computer but again no problems at all Just lots of smiles and curious faces in the airport I d highly recommend it 
4 0 It works I got this set for my daughter s 3rd birthday The quality of fabric is pretty low but my daughter seems happy with it I wish the top sheet was fitted at the bottom like other toddler sets we ve gotten however 
5 0 lovely bedding set this set is great my daughter loved it since shes doras fan and everything i love the sheets they are soft and great and if anything spills on it it is easy to clean just perfect i got this set from S D kids for 29 99 but for the amazon price i say its worth it its a great buy 
5 0 Excellent Diapers They are soft and pretty colors Very absorbant I started off with prefolds and covers and moved on to contours MY baby has had chubby legs from day one and these leave no red marks As some of the fitteds tended too I love to use these they are fun and easy to use I have no problems with the Snappi and these Sometimes I even let her run around without a cover and just the kissaluv and snappi Pretty reasonably priced Easy to wash and dry They do tend to get folded up in the dryer so I go in midway and unfold them and continue to run the dryer and they work well Excellent fit I use the med large ones on my 24 pound baby She was able to fit into the small ones even until she was about 20 pounds A close fit but they fit The med large ones are a better fit for her They are nice and trim and you can use them inside a pocket diaper too I would use them again I would recommend these any day 
5 0 We love these These are both Mommy Daddy approved cloth diapers Dad loves how easy these are to put on and figure out no folding techniques no guess work Just fold over and use a snappi or pins and throw on a cover Many times we don t even use fasteners on our more snug fitting covers They are soft absorbant and dry in a relatively short amount of time compared to others I have tried They include a doubler with a single seam design to cut down on drying time We love these 
5 0 Wonderful These are wonderful When you first get them the are thick and fluffy so soft After some washes in Washing Soda and Borax I found that mine aren t as soft but they are still very nice They are thick My baby is a heavy wetter and rarely soaks all the way through these The picture on this website makes it look like the front of the diaper isn t contoured but it is It is just not as wide in the front as in the back as it should be If you like you can just use these with a pin on either side and they d work great without anything else though there is no elastic to prevent leaks out the side and the outside would get damp You also can t tell from the picture that there is a rectangular doubler sewn into the inside of these with one line of stitching right down the center to hold it in place It is the full length of the diaper I think I would have rather had it stitched on both sides so one side wouldn t accidentally get folded over the wrong way but then perhaps that would have caused bunching problems I use the Bummis Super Whisper Wrap diaper covers with these and they fit perfectly I have no complaints After numerous washings they haven t started to fall apart like some others do I really like them 
5 0 love this stroller handles well folds easily so light and compact it works great for us our son is a year old and weighs 22 pounds 
5 0 Eddie Bauer Pop Up Seat This pop up seat is great for at the table or on the go My one year old loves it It sits him up a lot higher at the table than if we use the high chair at the table It is so convenient to take places where we know there won t be somewhere for him to sit It s great for restaruants too because he is very wiggly and it keeps him seated and he s comfortable in it unlike those restaraunt highchairs 
5 0 Love it I didn t register for this item but ended up receiving it from a friend She must have known how much I would end up liking it We ve used it to go out to dinner and my daughter will sit in it for the whole meal It is much better than those wooden high chairs that most restaurants have It sets up and folds up very easily and is very lightweight I highly recommend this item 
4 0 Cute snuggly bunny ears I really am happy that I purchased this item the ears are too cute and definitely serve a purpose only thing is that my girls like to suck on them so I constantly have to throw them in the wash 
5 0 Wonderful product keeps baby s head and neck comfortable when sleeping or riding The person I gave this gift to just love it because their young baby look and is more secure while napping 
4 0 Cute Cute mobile not too difficult to put together Looks great with the rest of the Hello Kitty crib collection 
4 0 Hello Kitty mobile Item is very cute and looks cute with the hello kitty bedding and would look cute with pink bedding as well 
5 0 Awesome Cup I love it I love this cup These are the best cups I have ever bought My daughters loves them too They don t have any valves inside so you don t have to worry about taking anything out or forgetting to put them back in or even them falling out They don t leak they are just wonderful I love them 
5 0 No Leaks I ve tried many sippy cups but these are the best They don t drip when tipped over on the floor The hard top is a little tricky to drink from at first but my daughter got the hang of it after only a few tries Now this is the only brand of sippy cup that we buy 
5 0 love it i have just purchased this toy and i love it Must admit a little confusing at first but once you get the hang of it the toy works just fine Have patience and all will be fine and read the directions Both my 16 month and 2 month old love it Does not drive parents crazy a big plus in my book 
5 0 Very functional bag I ve had this bag for well over a year now I have a toddler and a preschooler and it works just fine to carry their stuff and mine for everyday outings It has also held up well I ve washed it a few times and it comes out looking very good I really like the separate compartments which make it much easier to find that one little thing I like the pockets on the front strap for a cell phone and a nuk So nice to have those right at hand I also like the fact that it goes across the body no more hitting my daughter with the diaper bag when I lean down to pick her up The bottle holder thing is very small so I don t really use it 
5 0 The Perfect Bag A Mother s Best Friend I read several reviews about the JJ Cole Essentails Sling Diaper Bag before I chose to purchase it The reviews did not let me down This is a great diaper bag that even dad will be proud to carry around The compartments are large enough to hold a days outing worth of supplies for your little one and even a few items for yourself This bag is large enough to work as both your diaper bag and purse while being small enough to not feel as if you re taking your whole nursery with you The best feature of this diaper bag is that it is a sling You won t have to fumble around anymore like with the usual shoulder bag that just doesn t stay in place while toting a little one on your hip or over your shoulder 
4 0 use it for myself too This bag is very useful many pockets so everything is in order Looks very cool I sometimes use it for myself as aswell The downside is sometimes it is hard to remember which pocket you put your stuff in And it would be easier to use if it was symetrical so that I can carry it either on my left or right shoulder But as a result I am glad that I have it 
4 0 great size ok quality I have a 2 year old daughter and a little boy due in July so I wanted to get something a bit more portable than my big Kate Spade bag I ve been looking for something like this for a while The size is great you can fit so many things in it about 5 sz 4 diapers and a wipe container as well as snacks toys cell phone wallet the list goes on and on However I am on my 2nd one already the quality of the bag is not the greatest The cord that cinches the bottle holder broke within 2 days and one of the zippers fell off I just took the 2nd one on vacation and though it was great for traveling the bottle holder is already fraying along the top I will keep this one however it is only 30 so I guess I could always get another one later down the road and not be too upset about it 
5 0 GREAT BAG this bag was purchased a month ago to ease my long flight from california to NY with my 10 month old who was sick and teething at the time well it was a great purchase i didn t have to fumble for my id or fumble for her juice or anything i use it everyday now it holds everything we need it to hold the middle pouch we put her container of cheerios and dried fruit snacks with some biter biscuits as well and the bottom pouch i put my wallet with disposable changing pads and placemats and bibs and the top one i put her diapers and wipes and occasionally her juice cup since they re wider than a bottle is so they don t fit in the bottle holder i also use the bottle holder to put her crackers in it for the restaurants it s a wonderful bag hooks onto the stroller which is a wonderful thing and it doesn t slip off your shoulder like the big bulky bags i think every mom needs one of these bags 
4 0 My Kids Love it People may say a leash for my kid in inhumane but I d rather than they get run over by a car or lost at the mall My kids love wearing these things and they look cute The leash part being on the tail can be a little annoying if my toddler is lagging and she gets mad cause I m pulling the tail up over her shoulder 
5 0 ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL This harness buddy is the best harness system I ve ever brought and i ve brought several It s soft and cute so my son loves it and it s sturdy and strong so i love it It gives me the peace of mind that i need and the space that my growing little one needs Its just perfectly wonderful If you have a busy little one that doesn t like to stay in any one place for very long then you definately need one 
5 0 Awesome Keeps My Son in Tow My son loves the way this looks and keeps his little cars in it while we re on the run and shopping etc The cars keep him busy while I shop and the tether tail keeps me from worrying about him scurrying off as he has been known to do in the past Others have actually stopped us to ask where we got it 
4 0 CHILD HARNESS I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A KIDDIE BACKPACK INSTEAD OF A LEASH EVERYONE SAYS IT IS CUTE I FELT BAD CAUSE SOME PEOPLE LOOK AT IT LIKE A LEASH BUT WHEN YOU GO SOMEPLACE LIKE DISNEYLAND I SAW EVERYONE WITH THEM SO I DIDN T FEEL SO BAD IT GIVES A FREE SPIRITED CHILD LIKE MINE THE FREEDOM THEY CRAVE WITHOUT PUTTING THEM IN HARMS WAY OR HAVING TO DROP EVERYTHING AND CHASE THEM ALL OVER THE MALL 
5 0 Very usable product from super seller Very happy with product and extremely pleased with customer service of travelwithkids 
5 0 Now we both feel safer My 1 year old went from crawling straight to RUNNING I bought this harness after I set him down in a store while I paid at the checkout and he was gone in a flash Luckily we were the only ones in the small store It scared me enough to search out a harness We tried it on at home and it works great It comes fully assembled all you do is click the two belts into place It goes on like a vest It s light and soft and loose enough to not bother him at all He wears it around like a backpack and thinks he s pretty awesome with his new accessory We only use it when we re out shopping and there are no carts for him to sit in though But please use it sparingly if I wanted a wild thing on a leash I would have bought a puppy 
5 0 some peace of mind in a little bear package our 2yo is the type to take off at a moments notice so it was nice to find this Indespensible in the airport mall or theme parks I don t recommend overusing it though 
5 0 Great for cloth diapers Most diaper hangers have one compartment for a big stack of disposables We use a variety of cloth diapers and this organizer is great because it has space to hold our prefolds fitteds doublers pockets and inserts and covers I haven t loaded heavy things onto it but I ve never had a problem with the shelves being unstable as another reviewer did 
5 0 Great portable kids potty This potty is so small and easy to use on the go making it an indespensable tool in potty training It comes with a little carrying bag and folds up so small you can fit in in a small bag a large purse under a seat in the car just about anywhere so you can have it handy when kids need to go This way kids being potty trained don t have to use large adult toilets in public restrooms if they aren t comfortable and they can use this anywhere if there isn t a restroom nearby The refill bags could get expensive so we just use generic plastic bags and they work fine too 
4 0 great seat for the price We brought this seat for the daughter when she out grew her infant seat I think we paid about 35 00 at wal mart for it It lasted her two years and then we used it with oru son for a year until the plastic on the seat where you hook up the harness broke It is also easy to clean Alothough taking off the cover can be a little tricky 
4 0 Great product easy to install and handle For the price this car seat is great Seem similar products for double the price Quality is also great 
5 0 Great seat great price I bought this seat to bridge the gap between baby seat and booster seat for my 17mos old boy He s 24 lbs and 32 and the fit is fine No issues with the harness system or the installation It s not the most stylish seat but for that price who really cares Seems comfy easily adjustable and has a cup holder The boy likes it better than his Eddie Bauer baby seat that cost 3 times as much 
5 0 Comfortable and easy to use The top clip is not difficult for me to use but my daughter hasn t figured it out yet which is the way I want it I ve also used it as a booster and I was satisfied with the way the buckle looped through and stayed in place I also like the strap on the bottom that allows me to add a little slack or tighten it a little I think that s a really important feature especially in this season when my kid may be wearing a jacket one day and none the next and also if you use the car seat for different kids that are similar but not exactly the same size I have another car seat without that and I find that sometimes I can t get it closed because it s too tight and sometimes there s too much slack 
5 0 we now walk to the lake everyday Our daughter is 9 months old she is only 16lbs but I wish I had found the Moby wrap sooner We live about a mile from a large lake and before she was born we would walk there at least twice a week we also do a lot of hiking We had been using our baby Bjorn but it was starting to hurt our backs and especially our shoulders and the padding got lumpy after i washed it I received my wrap on Friday I have walked to the lake and back with my daughter in the wrap everyday since we have tried the Joey and hug positions and I can feel her weight a little in the Joey one but on the way home I turn her around into the hug position and she falls asleep and it feels like I m not even carrying a baby The weight distribution is great and now I have no excuses to not get out and exercise She seems to love it too I have two friends who are due in the next three months and I think I will have to get them their own as baby shower gifts I heard before i ordered it that it was hard to use but once i read the wonderful book that comes with it it was a piece of cake 
4 0 easy on your back It is true what others are saying this product is really easy n your back I have tried others and this one is far more better My only complaint is that it is a little difficult to put on but with practice you get the hang of it Oh be patiente too at time while you are learning your baby might not like it because she might get fussy waiting for you so do it when she is in a good mood or practice first with a doll 
5 0 Why didn t I get this sooner I purchased this when my child was already going on 4 months old He s a long tall boy and it being winter time I haven t had the occassion to use this as much except in church and around the house Why oh why didn t I get this initially I had the NOJO baby sling which was great when I was in my twenties but really pinched a nerve literally on me over a decade later My back feels SO much better with this product Especially if you are already a top heavy person this sling is a relief I love the color and we ll be going to Florida in two months I intend to use this at the beach and maybe the zoo 
5 0 Best bottles on the market If you have a fussy baby or just bottle feed Dr Brown s are the best We have twin girls and first 3 months they were gased up and it was not fun Someone recommended Dr Brown s bottles which we were willing to try anything and they were the best thing we have ever used If you have a fussy baby then you will know what I am talking about If you are giving a gift for a baby shower this is the best gift you could give I can t say enough good things are Dr Brown s I was upset our doctor did not tell us about these bottles instead she had us giving them drops and buying the most expensive formula on the market Nothing worked until these bottles 
4 0 Overall Good Stroller worth the Good 1 Light weight 2 Mesh breathable fabric for warm weather 3 Handles are tall enough for woman in heels or husbands 4 Nice colors 5 Easier to steer than other stollers can use 1 hand 6 Folds flat and has carry handle Bad 1 Too light to put your bag or purse on the handles will tip with no baby in it 2 Doesn t recline 3 Sometimes the 5 point harness takes more effort to unclip Overall this is a good investment Turns out most parents will end up using thier compact umbrella stoller way more than the deluxe super gadget stoller It s so much easier to use these simple light weight strollers than their bulky wide heavy counterparts 
5 0 The Only Stroller You ll Keep When I was pregnant with my son I received one of those big bulky strollers as a baby shower gift but after my son grew out of the attaching car seat he quickly grew to hate the stroller as did I After much research we bought the Maclaren Volo Carbon Stroller with mesh backing we live in Florida so the mesh was perfect for our climate and I am sure I will never own another stroller I remember cringing as I spent the 100 but we now joke that it was the best 100 we ever spent It really was We have traveled all over the country with the stroller it s lightweight extremely collapsable and comes with a shoulder strap that was a genious addition The wheels don t stick like cheaper umbrella strollers it can take a beating and still keep going At 4 years and 42 lbs it still carried my son without a squeek Ok we did WD 40 the wheels once in the 4 years we had it The mesh backing made cleaning the stroller a breeze It can easily be steered with one hand and we personally loved the shape of the handles and the handle padding pushing other strollers feels so awkward now The basket underneath is incredibly handy and carries a surprising amount It folds easily with one hand and foot My son doesn t use a stroller anymore but the Volo still looks and works perfectly so we are saving it for our next child Bottom line this stroller is worth every penny you pay for it The ONE and only complaint I have about the stroller is that it would be nice if the seat reclined for younger infants If you are thinking about purchasing this stroller for younger infants consider spending the extra for the model that does recline A sun visor might be something to consider too 
4 0 Nearly perfect I love how easy this stroller is to use the way it looks the way it handles and drives and most importantly my son LOVES to ride in it I say nearly perfect only because I wish it reclined But this doesn t seem to prevent my son from having a pleasant nap in it I just think he d be more comfortable if it reclined I d keep everything else about it the same and I would definitely recommend this stroller for someone who travels with her child as much as I do once a month at least 
4 0 Good Bottles Over all these are pretty good bottles The only thing that I feel could use some improvement is the shape of the top of the bottle it s a little bit too wide Example When you get to end of feeding and have to tilt the bottle upward to get the last 1 2 ounce or so the base of the nipple is actually touching babies nose Other than that these are GREAT bottles They are resonably priced never had any problems w leaking absolutely LOVE that cap snaps onto bottom of bottle GENIUS 
5 0 Quick ship The item came quickly and the bottles are nice but my baby won t convert 
5 0 WE LOVE SOOTHIES Our baby would never take a paci if it weren t for soothies Yeahhhh soothie Bottles are great We switched to the soothie bottle just because our son was confusing the nipple on his bottles and his paci We need him to keep taking his paci so we are thrilled to have the soothie bottle with the same nipple No complaints they work great Not sure why the other reviewer only gave 4 stars if you don t screw ANY bottle on tight enough it leaks DUH 
5 0 Beautiful This crib makes our nursery Every person that has seen the room comments on what a beautiful crib this is The wood is very thick and expensive looking for a very inexpensive price The crib is very sturdy when put together and with no movable parts the front piece doesn t lower it is very safe for the baby Knowing that this crib will grow with my baby through toddler and childhood years is reassuring too I m glad that I purchased this crib You can t beat the quality for the price 
4 0 Crib Looks Great Packaging needs more protection I have got this crib last week I have opened the package today and crib s headboard is damaged with big crack Called Amazon about it hope to sort this problem out earliest I will keep posted about my Progress on this 
4 0  I bought this Crib for my 3 month old son My wife said it arrived quickly and was in great shape She put it together and says its good quality with the only probelm being that is scratches easily 
5 0 Very very nice product Easy to assemble solid wood no damages nice color and good price 
4 0 Nice valuable crib Need appropriate service The cherry wood itself is very great however the painting is easy to be scratched during delivery and installation Both the packaging delivery should be more careful The deliverer put it to my condo guard while I was at home why not sent the huge heavy item directly to my door 
4 0 cute and good price We just ordered this crib last weekend and have already received it and put it together It looks really great However when we received the box from UPS it looked terrible and we were really afraid that the crib would be damaged It looks fine although we did have to touch up a few places with a stain pen I would recommend that you inspect each piece carefully before putting the crib together Also the directions that came with the crib said nothing about the washers that were included in the hardware We just sort of had to figure out to use them with the bolts SO if you order this crib and it comes with washers don t forget to put them in because the directions won t tell you to We were impressed by how fast the crib arrived and the free shipping was great too It wasn t terribly difficult to put together pretty sturdy and I would say it was worth what we paid for it 
5 0 Beauty and quality at a reasonable price Although we have yet to use this item our baby is not due for another 2 months I can say we are very impressed with it so far It was in perfect shape when it shipped the instructions were easy to follow it was easy to build and it looks beautiful It s also very sturdy and seems well constructed It s a very elegant addition to any nursery and I love the cherry colour Much more classy looking than many more expensive products We also bought the Emily changing table and the Emily 4 drawer dresser and are very impressed with both of those too 
5 0 Beautiful crib at a great price I m so glad we opted to go with this crib not only did we get a great deal on it w no shipping costs but it s beautiful easy to put together I did it myself at 8 mos pregnant and got to us quickly It s nice and sturdy w a gorgeous dark cherry finish that matches our nursery Highly recommended 
5 0 Great Product Wonderful product This is just what I needed I don t want to carry a big diaper bag all the time This is big enough to put 4 5 diapers plus a changing clothes and wipes and the whole bunch of other stuff I can also have my both hands free I love it 
5 0 Perfect for Short Outings I love this bag and use it every day There is room for wipes and 3 or 4 diapers snacks mom s essentials Great for short trips to the store or other short outings Comfortable and easy to carry especially if you already have your hands full with more than one kid If we are going somewhere for longer periods of time I do pack a larger bag though so we can fit a change of clothes blanket toys etc 
5 0 MOMMY S BEST HELPER This wipes is the best It smells good non alcoholic and is perfect for even the most sensitive skin Try it You won t regret 
5 0 these smell so good the smell on these is wonderful they are very soft and do not crumble and irritate like huggies wipes the package is very convenient for the diaper bag too because it closes completely so the wipes don t dry out 
5 0 superior thermometer I LOVE this product and actually contacted the company to let them know Here is a copy of my communication to them I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for making such a superior product As a mother to a 2 � year old and an 11 week old I own several thermometers and performed my fair share of temperature readings A few months ago I purchased your QuickRead digital thermometer to keep in my diaper bag as a spare After using the product a few times I have decided to replace all other thermometers I own with more QuickReads From end to end what a great product Here is what I love about it Extremely quick readings The shape of the tip allows for perfect insertion Tip is also flexible allowing for wiggle room Button is the perfect size and easy to trigger Most importantly the readout faces the reader not the tush it s reading A digital thermometer is a parent s necessity Unfortunately the only way to find out which one works best is by trial and error I am so glad I finally what I consider to be the best one on the market and I thought I d let you know what a good job your company has done 
5 0 I Love this Thermometer I love this themometer With my first child my husband always called me a hypochondriac stating I always thought my baby felt warm well with this thermometer it actually glows an flashes if your child does have a fever and only takes a few seconds I love this and have recommended it to others 
4 0 Excellent for little infants This activity mat was expensive I bought it full price at almost 60 but there is a lot of usage in it I started using it with my baby when she was 2 months old she enjoyed seeing the colorful toys above her As she grew she loved being on her tummy with the colorful mat especially the crinkling leaf The attached toys were excellent themselves and I used them to clip onto her carseat and crib Only when she could finally get up and crawl did she tire of the mat My only criticism is of the musical toy that dangles It does have a switch on off which is great However the volume of the music is LOUD Many a dark night I tried to tiptoe past it and had a heart attack when I accidentally tapped the toy the music blasted ALso the sun mirror comes off easily and is hard to prop up Again this is well worth it and a well designed toy for any infant 
5 0 great for the busy working mom I am a pharmacist and I usually don t get a scheduled lunch break so I must pump whenever I get a free minute I work 10 hour shifts so I sometimes need to pump twice a day These wipes work great when in a hurry without access to the sterlizer or dishwasher I still sterilize the pump every night and morning before I go to work but they have saved me lots of time during my lunch break so I can actually eat instead of trying to handwash and dry each piece at work 
5 0 A life saver I am a teacher and I have very limited time and space in which to pump These wipes have saved me one wipe can clean all the accessories for the Medela double pump There isn t a strong smell or nasty feel either as long as you can allow the pieces to sit and dry for at least 10 minutes they are ready to go Obviously it isn t as good as getting to a sink but in my situation they have been perfect I would recommend having these on hand for an emergency even if you can usually wash your accessories every time 
5 0 Not pretty but works great I was afraid to order this chair at first too But mine came in yesterday and I am ordering 4 more It is very sturdy and is easy to put on the table I was worried about the kids pushing it off from underneath with their feet but it has some adjustments under there to secure it to the table There is also a button on each side to fold down the screw adjustment and just slide it off the table It also folds flat This is great for my grandkids and we can always be assured of a clean chair for them when dining out The colors aren t pretty but it is washable 
5 0 GREAT I received this very quickly and was thrilled to find it in excellent condition My son loves his new Superman bed 
5 0 Match just fine But they do match the ruffle on the diaper stacker the border on the wall hangings and quilt the trim on the hamper etc It is not as if there would be this one item with an odd color or pattern Exactly what the previous reviewer has stated These drapes go along with the Zanzibar set perfectly We have two windows on either side of our son s nursery and both look really well fitted with these drapes and the Zanzibar window valances 
5 0 happy with buggy board After doing a lot of research we are pretty happy with this product We have a 4 year old a 2 1 2 year old a 1 year old and one on the way so we were happy that there was a product out there that could help our 4 year old when she gets tired of walking and there is no room for her in the stroller We attached it to our double stroller and it works fine It makes it a little heavier and awkward to fold up but overall we are pleased with this purchase 
4 0 Excellent for travel This is great for toddlers when you travel I felt I got my money s worth yes it s pricey from the airport parking garage to the first security checkpoint We used it throughout airports and on our vacation with our 3yr old six month old in stroller It does make walking a little awkward if your stroller doesn t have real long handles but it is not hard to accomodate overall Well worth it especially if you don t want to end up carrying a toddler 
5 0 Bath Cubby This bath cubby is great Its made very well very durable and attrative It holds ALOT of bath toys and drains the water out I have had no problems with mold or meldew on the basket bath toys or the corner of the tub My 17 month loves to put his toys in and out of the basket while in the tub 
5 0 Cute and works well too I just purchased this bath toy organizer and I love it It fits perfectly into the corner of our tub and holds many toys plus the shampoo and wash clothes I was hesitant to get this item because of some of the other reviews but I think it is great and I have no regrets in buying it I only wish I had bought it sooner 
5 0 Holds a lot and stays in place We haven t had any of the problems that other reviewers have We have regular square tile on our bath walls The basket holds several floating toys plus a cup for dunking water shampoo wash cloths etc We love it 
5 0 Finding Nemo Bath Mat I just love this bright cheery and something for baby to look at while bathing Safety first then good looks 
5 0 Good bath mat for baby This mat does exactly what it s supposed to it stays in place and keeps the baby from sliding in the bathtub And it s pretty cute too 
5 0 Finding Nemo No Slip Bath Mat What a perfect way to safely decorate my grandson s tub He thinks it s so cool 
4 0 Highly recommended car seat I had a Graco car seat for my first son He was always uncomfortable in it and he outgrew it by the time he was four months old He was also uncomfortable in the accompanying stroller and I hated trying to get this heavy stroller in and out of my car The whole travel system was a waste of money After a lot of research I bought the Combi Connection car seat with the Flash EX Universal Car Seat Carrier for my second son I have been very happy with both My second son is almost 10 months old and I m still using this car seat He has been very comfortable in it and I m dreading having to give up the convenience of having him in an infant carrier My son isn t exceptionally small He is light for his age he s in the 25th percentile for weight but he s tall 90th for height I am completely shocked by the previous reviewer who thought this car seat was too small The only reason I gave this car seat 4 stars instead of 5 is because the canopy isn t very sturdy Other than that it is highly recommended 
5 0 got it at JC Penny instead I really liked this dresser and the matching 5 drawer dresser but I was hesitant to order it through Babies R Us I found it online at JC Penny com and found a free shipping code online as well saved lots of with that Both pieces arrived in about two weeks and in perfect condition My husband and I put the pieces together in about 2 3 hours and are very pleased with the quality considering the price I would recommend JC Penny if you really like this furniture I give JC Penny Five stars 
4 0 Graco carseat base This base and the Graco system in whole are great however we did have to put a blanket under the base to get it to level up in both of our vehilce a 2004 VW Jetta and a 2002 Dodge Dakota Over all I would recomend it to friends and family 
4 0 Utility Bottles These bottles are great for storing and heating breast milk The standard opening they have fits the wife s breast pump Almeda Purely Yours and allows her to pump longer than the stock bottles that come with the pump I feel better heating milk in these glass bottles and using plastic bottles to feed my son Overall they are sturdy and come with a lot of old school nipples and caps 
5 0 A great product I love the glass bottles I now have peace of mind During the late night feedings my husband and I just place the glass bottles in the bottle warmer without fear of chemical contamination The only down side is that the glass bottles are heavier than the plastic however with time your baby will learn how to hold them 
5 0 great product if you re concerned about plastic bottles this is an excellent alternative too bad it s hard to find them in retail stores it should be promoted more no babies should be drinking out of plastic bottles that leach toxic chemicals anyway 
4 0 8 oz clear glass baby bottles 3pk They are good except being heavy due to glass design but I guess it is expected My boy is developing arm muscles now from holding it for few months now hahaha Three in a pack is a very good idea four could have been better though 
5 0 tried and true I love these glass bottles the same ones my mother used in the 60 s and I used in the 80 s with my first baby and am using again with my new babies twins They just seem cleaner to me they shine after being washed in the dishwasher 
5 0 Glass bottles are a healthier choice I have researched plastic bottles extensively They are known to leak a little cancer causing chemical into the baby s milk when they are heated I am not some wacky nut job who thinks everything gives you cancer but when it comes to our children s health why take a chance I use these glass bottles at home with my daughter and strongly recommend them to my friends I know we can t protect are kids from everything but I am going to do as much as I can for my children 
5 0 Perfect This is the best Baby bath thermometer we have used It is very fast and accurate Very simple you take it from the base duck s legs and place it in the water It tells the temperature and warns if it is COLD HOT or ready for bath Very simple yet perfect We are highly satisfied and would absolutely recommend it 
5 0 good buy This drawer is one of the good buys I ve made for my kids room Easy to assemble I m very happy with this product 
5 0 Best wrap My daughter is almost 6 months old and slept through the whole night wearing her new Swaddleme She normally wakes up frequently because she kicks off her blankets But last night she didn t wake up once I m definitely going to get another one these 
5 0 should come with every baby These swaddlers calm a crying baby during the day and help them sleep at night The tighter you wrap the better they sleep Thank you Swaddleme 
5 0 Ahhh sleep I swear by these swaddlers I put my baby in it and she sleeps SOOOO well It is also easy to calm her when we place her in her swaddler Great item 
5 0 Essential Baby Item When my daughter was born I didn t know about swaddling and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep then put her in her crib and she d flail her arms wake up and cry and I had to start all over What a nightmare Then I figured out that since her arms wake her it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn t move them as much so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets It worked It became much easier to get her to sleep But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again When she was a little over a month old somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it It worked great It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it and it stayed put My daughter started sleeping so much better I wish I found those blankets sooner it would ve saved me from so many sleepless nights 2 years later my son was born and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket Out of curiosity I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket and his arms wake him right away exactly the same as my daughter I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep 
4 0 Works wonders on a squirmer We have been swaddling our little girl since birth We started off using just the receiving blanket but as she got bigger she would escape from it or kick her legs free and it would end up like a donut around her waist by morning She still at 4 months sleeps better with her arms restrained so we have continued swaddling and the SwaddleMe is perfect for that It s very easy to get her into but doesn t constrict her legs as much as the blanket used to My only complaint with the product is that there needs to be a large area for the velcro bears to attach to To wrap it tight enough to hold her arms leaves the bottom bear with nothing to attach to She may just be on the smaller side for this Large version but she had definately outgrown the Small one because she could no longer straighten her legs in it 
5 0 Unbelievable I received this as a gift for my shower I had forgotten all about it My baby was extremely collicky and wouldn t sleep at night I would be up until 3am EVERY NIGHT After about a month I was desperate I pulled out the swaddle me and gave it a shot Well she slept all night I jumped out of bed at 7am and ran into her room I thought something was wrong She was SNORING Had I known that this product was a Godsend I would ve paid 100 bux for it She is 4 months old now and I ve been swaddling her for the last 3 months she sleeps 8 10 hours straight I just wish they made it in size medium She s in the large now and it s a bit big She manages to get her arms out But I love it anyway She ll grow into it BUY IT 
5 0 The best of all the Swaddle Me fabrics Within the first two days home after the hospital I realized I needed more of these So my parents went out and bought a couple of each cotton mircrofleece and flannel My baby definitely preferred the microfleece It fits the most snugly of the three and didn t shrink like the flannel one The fabric has a little give and she wasn t able to break free like she was with the cotton one The cotton ones are also a bit larger in circumference Overall the Swaddle Me is very soothing and it greatly improved the quality of sleep for baby and me 
5 0 This is wonderful This is wonderful My 3 month old has been sleeping 8 9 hours a night for the last month or so thanks to this We had the smaller one when she was newborn thank goodness they make it larger She always seemed to big to swaddle in blankets she would work herself free but this is very soothing to her I would recommend it to any new parent 
5 0 Very Useful I traveled alone from USA to Venezuela with my newborn on this carrier and was very helpful to have my hands free and the baby slepping the most of the time In the city is the best to go out alone with your little one 
5 0 The Best baby wrap ever I just had my third child and had to buy all new things because I got rid of everything after my second child I had a sling with the other two but instead of getting the same one I looked at the new ones and this is far better than the old I like the lighter fabric and its easy to fold up and stuff in the diaper bag You do need to watch the DVD but with a little practice anyone even husbands can use it My son is 11 weeks old and has loved it since day one When he is fussy we put him in the sling and he instantly get quiet This is the best one for back support also I think 
5 0 Great Product Wonderful Very easy to put on and my daughter loves it she falls asleep everytime It is the most comfortable carrier I have tried as it doesn t dig into my back 
5 0 Great Fit and Durability I have the Zanzibar Bedding Set which I love I bought a few extra crib sheets to have handy They crib sheets are beige and white checkered just simple They are fitted sheets and fit well on a standard crib mattress I have washed them a few times and they still look good as new 
5 0 BEST Diaper Holder with NO Odors We had a Diaper Genie it s a total waste of money and plastic The Diaper Genie was so hard to use and didn t do anything to stop odors My son s room smelled as if we threw the diapers in an open garbage We replaced it with THE FIRST YEARS CLEAN AIR DIAPER DISPOSAL SYSTEM It s awesome The greatest thing about it is that it can store about 6 7 days of my son s diapers without NO yucky odors WOW It has a clean air venting system which is totally 100 silent I actually though it was broken because it made NO noise It runs on D batteries that last about 9 months There is a little light that briefly flashes to let you know that the lid is secure and the vent system is working It uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags saving us money The only drawback is that occasionally you will shut the lid and it won t fully secure You d know that by two clues the first being that the little green light won t flash Later you ll get the second clue your baby s room will start to smell I now check to see if the light is on each time I put a diaper in to make sure the lid is secure We love this product so much Our son s room smells clean with no poopy odors and we save money by using our own tall kitchen bags It s also very easy to change no confusing bag twisting I highly recommend using this diaper holder it s the best 
5 0 great bottle These bottles actually came with my pump and I had never used them My daugther made it clear very early that she preferred me to a bottle and refused all bottles and pacifiers She does know how to use a sippy and will take one no problem Recently I pumped some milk to take with her when her grandmother was going to watch her for me This is the first time I had pumped since she was really little and I had gotten rid of all the bottles that fit the pump besides these I had meant to give them to my sister but forgot about having them I pumped into the bottle to take with and Mom transferred it to a sippy there When it was time to go home there was still a lot left and it was transferred back to the bottle to come home It was placed in the fridge and I had planned on giving it to my older daughter today so it wouldn t go to waste When I went to get it I could t find it and I discovered Kathrynn sucking away at it She had almost totally finished the three ounces One of her siblings had decided to be helpful by giving her the bottle and an oatmeal cookie I was floored seeing her actually using a bottle And it wasn t because she was desperate It hadn t been that long since she had nursed She absolutely loves this bottle I tried again later with a bit of pear juice and she took it no problem although she pushed away any other nipples I handed to her I had no problems with this leaking I ll still stick with sippys I have more of those and it just seems silly to go buy a bunch of bottles and nipples when I would be taking her off bottles in four months anyway But I definitely recomend them My sisters little guy really likes them too which is why I had meant to give them to her These are the only bottles she uses and she does use formula 
5 0 Great Set My daughter loves these bottles they are the same as her pacifier and they work very well I have seen a few complaints about the vents leaking but really that happens with all bottles that have vents and these arent nearly as bad as the avent bottles I am glad I bought these 
5 0 Easy for Breastfed Babies Like the other moms who have reviewed this product my son had difficulties with the Avent bottles I have what seems to be a million Avent bottles from my first pregnancy and my newest son could not handle them He would choke spit up have gas and much of the milk leaked from the sides of his mouth soaking him and who ever was feeding him My son loved his soothie paci it s the ONLY one he would take so I decided to try the bottles He has absolutely no problems switching between the breast and these bottles I haven t had any leaking problems as mentioned by other moms 
4 0 Soothie set I nurse my daughter but she supplements with formula and takes a pacifier too The lactation consultant suggested the Soothie products to improve my daughter s latch because of the long round nipple shape that s more natural for nursing babies It s too soon to see if it made a difference but my daughter LOVES the soothie bottles and paci s now It took weeks before she d take a Mam and over a week before she d successfully drink from a Gerber bottle but she took to Soothies instantly and in 5 mins or less prefered them to the products she d been using for months They re so much easier for her to suck and hold in her mouth The price is great too about 1 2 the price of the same set with Avent products My 2 complaints are 1 the leaking bottles and 2 the pacifier looks weird and doesn t attach to a pacifier keeper The leaking can be fixed by getting the part where the rim of the bottle meets the nipple wet to create a full seal Also it helps to swirl the formula to mix instead of shaking it it takes a bit longer but you end up with less mess and less bubbles 
4 0 Not for cloth diapers that soak Someone wrote this is good for cloth diapers Only if you put them in dry If you put water with additive of your choice to put your diapers in this is dangerous babies ie ones old enough to get about and pull themselves up have drowned in diaper pails Esp if they step on the front and the lid pops open and they try to reach inside headfirst Only use a diaper pail that latches solidly closed if you are going to put in cloth diapers that you soak For dry diapers of cloth or disposable variety this is a great buy 
5 0 Best Diaper Pail I m extremely impressed with this diaper pail It keeps the odors in I ve read some reviews that complain about the smell when opening the diaper pail but as soon as you close it it disappears It s not rocket science Absolutely worth your ten bucks And you can use your own grocery bags or trash bags Just fabulous 
5 0 Keeps Cydney warm and cozy I love this bundle me prevents me from taking a jacket and blanket for Cydney and thats one less thing to carry aroun 
4 0 Very Versatile I bought this valance to go in my nursery and didn t know what to do when I got home saw how big it was We decided to make a cornice board and stretch the fabric over it It turned out great you can see all of the animals and I had extra fabric left over to do other things with in the nursery 
5 0 Versatile This valance is great I have 2 smaller windows in my baby girl s room and was able to cut the valance sew the edges and make it fit both windows It hangs straight down so you are able to see all the animals and I didn t even have to cut an animal in half I have gotten so many compliments on this pattern it s just the best for either a boy or girl s room 
5 0 Tip for hanging your valance The Zanzibar valance is adorable We hung ours up this weekend and because the valance is much wider than our window some of the animals weren t visible we took the valance down and stuffed it with bunched up tissue paper It now looks great and you can see all of the animals We also purchased the matching drapes which complete the look 
5 0 Great accessory for a Zanzibar nursery We love the look and feel of this valance We have a double window in our nursery and were concerned that we d have to buy an additional valance but one was plenty Highly recommended 
5 0 Beautiful Valance I actually received this valance in the Zanzibar bed set But if you need to purchase another one for an extra window in the nursery do not hesitate This is a beautiful valance and actually has the same lovely fabrics including suede like fabric textured animals as the bed skirt bumper quilt I have noticed other bed sets even the expensive ones where the valances are quite plain The valance measure s around 90 inches wide But is meant to have a bunched up look so it looks great on narrower windows Also beige or sage colored drapes or sheers would be a great complement to this valance to shield the nursery from day light during nap time 
5 0 Love this Great babyproofing idea my 16 month old has not been able to open this cover Additionally I think it actually looks better cleaner now that the cover is on the power strip 
5 0 Couldn t have lived without it After having sleepless nights listening to my husband snore I was on a mission to find something to help me sleep while pregnant I found this pillow at Target and have been sleeping soundly ever since A MUST HAVE if you pregnant It s a little expensive but worth every penny 
5 0 Bulky but so comfy This is a must have item if you re pregnant and having trouble sleeping through the night I loved how it kept my head spine and legs in alignment and relieved the pressure from my back when I rested my belly on it For moms to be who are having difficulty getting comfortable on the couch you can prop the pillow behind your back and even bring one half onto your lap as a make shift cushion for a laptop or magazine 
5 0 My wife loves hers Hy wife was having a hard time sleeping while pregnant One night as I watched her toss and turn I decided to do soemthing for her I went to Target and bought her the boppy body pillow That night she slpet sound for the first time in over a month She drags the thing from room to room in the house she lays on it to watch tv and to sleep It does take up some room in the bed but it is well worth me having a little less room for her to sleep sound Also a few times I have stolen it and used it while I lay on the ground and watch football It is very comfy I have never been a pregnant woman but from what my wife tells me this is a must have 
5 0 I Would NOT Have Survived Without This As any pregnant woman knows at some point during gestation it becomes nearly impossible to sleep comfortably When you can t sleep on your back you can t sleep on your stomach and your only choice is to balance on your side with your belly slowly pulling you off balance your body actually gets pretty tired After getting very little uncomfortable sleep for some weeks I searched desperately for relief I intended to purchase the snooggle full length body pregnancy pillow since they had it on Target online where my baby registry was Some time passed and I decided to go straight to Target in person and get the snoogle only to find it was not there BUT the Boppy pillow WAS and I got it right away I have to say that it is one of the BEST products I bought during my pregnancy I would not have had a good nights sleep without it Some people complain that the preggo pillows they have bought take up too much room in the bed but this one is nicely shaped to hug your body and cushion where it is needed without too much extra bulk The slipcover that comes with it is very pretty and easy to take off to wash It also comes with a zippable pillowcase that you can fold the whole thing into to make one nice round pillow I am still using this pillow after my son was born since it folds nicely in different ways and makes a nice pillow just to recline on Definitely a MUST HAVE for any pregnant woman You WON T regret it 
4 0 so far so good I bought this stroller for my baby girl I haven t used it yet my wife will be due in a month from now but everything came in perfect conditions no broken pieces also I got it for 130 00 with a 60 off good deal I don t know how it is using it on the streets but I come back and share my experience 
4 0 A great potty chair I bought this potty chair for my son who is 21 months old He really likes the chair but really isn t excited about the sing along CD I had to buy another CD for him to me it wasn t a CD that kids could follow and sing too But the potty chair was really nice and my son got adjusted to it really well 
5 0 We love this potty As first time parents we have pretty much field tested every kind of potty training device on the market from seats that attach to the Big One to more traditional little potties Here s why we re keeping this one forever or at least until our kids are done having kids 60 br 62 60 br 62 1 It s sturdy no balancing needed 60 br 62 2 Also one piece construction means no chasing pee out of crevices or finding it in surprising places We empty wipe with TP and wipe with a Clorox wipe 60 br 62 3 Facilitates a modified squat position which makes pooping easier Success = compliance 60 br 62 4 Got a boy Your walls will thank you This design is more effective than splash guards or turning Junior backwards on the Big Seat 60 br 62 60 br 62 Note We also have the one piece Baby Bjorn model It s smaller so it works well at Grandma s house 
5 0 Love the sleek new design after years of potty chairs To Target this is a re do of review I just sent Please use this one instead as I did not explain it right the first time Love the sleek new non potty design and it gives more of a sense of privacy No wonder kids did not want to sit on the old fashioned chair ones The different size measurements info is informative but need to know in liquid measurement how much it would safely hold 
5 0 Great new design after years of chair potties Finally Love the sleek new non potty design and it gives more of a sense of privacy No wonder kids did not want to sit on the old fashioned ones The different measurements info is informative but how deep in inches is the most important part of the potty the bowl 
5 0 Good diaper cover for the price Keeps clothes dry holds in everything Breathable affordable Easily washable as well 
4 0 Just like old fashioned rubber pants These are super Bought several pairs for each of my daughters for their baby showers and they loved them They launder great last long and provide nearly the same over the diaper protection as regular ordinary rubber pants do 
5 0 Beautiful and solid crib This is a great buy Easy to assemble and looks gorgeous One of the most important things it is very solid 
5 0 Great Product It was easy to put together and came faster than expected The price matches the quality Overall I was very impressed with the crib 
5 0 Love the crib I spent hours online and in stores comparing cribs for my grandson Was very hesitant to purchase something this big online especially after reading some reviews about it coming damaged but when I saw the price and cheap shipping I figured it was worth a try I am so glad I did The crib arrived in time in perfect shape packed very secure with not a scratch The directions were easy to follow all the parts were included and we had it up in about an hour Even for two old grandparents My daughter spent almost 500 on her crib and I think this one is more sturdy and better looking Haven t had the chance to put our little guy in it yet but so far I believe we will be very happy with it I do plan on getting the round teether covers for the top rails since I don t want him scratching it up with his teeth Would recommend it to anyone especially at this price 
5 0 so far so good This crib was easy to assemble and it is very pretty I like how versatile it is for the price I put it together by myself and 6 mos pregnant in an hour It was very easy to do One concern I had was that some of the pieces were missing paint in some spots nothing extrememly obvious that wasn t eventually covered up by the mattress I have several more weeks before I get to actually try it out so my rating is based on looks and assembly only I am confident however that it will stand the test of time 
5 0 love it very safe too I love this bumper it keeps my son arms and legs inside the crib and gives me piece of mind from SIDS It also matches my Pottery barn Green Gingham pattern perfectly 
4 0 Peace of mind for parents and not bad lookin I searched online for sage colored crib bedding for weeks before my daughter was born and finally settled on something close I was satisfied that it matched well enough to maintain the cuteness of her nursery of utmost importance and was affordable at the same time I had seen the breathable bumpers but opted for the cuter bedding confident that my child would be safe My daughter started sleeping through the night at 8 weeks which meant I was not going into her room for 7 9 hours at a time depending on the night Even though I swaddle her for sleeping she still manages to travel around her crib during the night as well as during longer naps One morning when I heard her wake up I went into her room to find that she had wiggled her way down to the southwest corner of her crib and her face was pressed up against the adorable nursery matching affordable crib bumper I jerked that bumper out of the bed and ran down to order a breathable bumper Since I put it on her crib she has been pressed up against it two or three times and is able to breath I am delighted because I think it s actually cuter than the one I had before and I don t have to worry at all at least about that It s a very clean look and the green gingham matches the crib skirt I got perfectly The only reason I didn t give it 5 stars is because of the fit It comes in 2 pieces one for the side of the crib that moves up and down and one for the other 3 sides This leaves 2 openings one at each end of the front of the crib that an arm or leg could potentially get stuck in It hasn t been a problem for us yet as she has quit the southwest travelling and now just spins in place However I would much rather risk a let getting stuck than having a suffocated baby I have no regrets about buying this and am advising all of my pregnant friends to consider the breathable option over the puffy ones 
4 0 Safe Bumper Keeps your baby from getting a foot stuck through the side of the crib but still fits tightly and safely 
5 0 Excellent Value My husband and I are very happy with this armoire We have a small apartment with little storage space and this armoir is the perfect size providing loads of extra storage I read other reviews so I knew it didn t have a hanging bar but I knew I wasn t going to be hanging clothes One thing I didn t expect was that it was white inside but it makes it easier to see We had it put together within an hour instructions were easy to follow A solid piece of furniture well worth 240 Jessica NY 
5 0 A nice addition to our kitchen We needed more pantry space and this was a cheap option to get it The first one came damaged and missing parts but they replaced it so that is not a problem The bottom of the drawers is weak and the drawer facces come off too easily but I can add an angle to strengthen that joint and use the drawers for lighter foods so I am happy with the product The color is wonderfull 
5 0 Great idea We love it I bought this for my son a couple of years ago We used it lots when we were out especially when he was potty training and just couldn t wait It s wonderful Just wish it was easier to find the liners Another reviewer said there are sharp edges Ours doesn t have any sharp edges It does collapse if the legs aren t snapped up properly but otherwise isn t a problem Our daughter is potty training right now and we have it ready for her whenever she needs it It will also be great for our upcoming car trip 
5 0 SUPER POTTY What a Godsend this has been Our daughter is 3 years old and we take this thing everywhere Sure we keep Potty toppers with us but sometimes that just isn t enough This On The Go Potty is far better than any porta potty or gross outdoor park restroom We have used this potty at the park while making rounds at build construction sites at baseball games even in the parking garage of our hockey rink Our daughter can use it just about anywhere It s small size allows her to use it discreetly and comfortably If you EVER venture more than 30 seconds from a clean toilet you NEED this Then you ll wonder how you ever got by without it 
5 0 worked for my convertable crib toddler bed I purchased this product because I had a crib that converted to a toddler bed but it didn t come with any kind of railing to keep my little guy from falling out Since the toddler bed uses the crib mattress I was a little concerned about the large size of the bolster it covers the entire length of the mattress but my son figured out how to climb right over it to get into and out of bed It does pop off the mattress sometimes when he is getting in or out but it isn t too difficult to strap it back on when I tuck him in I couldn t find any other kind of railing that fit my son s bed so the BedBugz saved me from just having to pile pillows on the floor next to the bed

4 0 Very useful crib We love this crib we looked at several bassinettes and pack n plays because we wanted to have our baby in our room with us for the first few months before transitioning her to her big crib in her room but we also wanted something versatile that could be used for her to play in we have hard wood floors and I wanted something I could push around the house from room to room so she could be with me This crib is so much more attractive than pack n plays but functional and lasts so much longer than other cradles or bassinettes One of the biggest advantages is that it fits through doorways which the pack n play does not and I had wanted something I could roll around from room to room This was useful when she was a newborn and we wanted to keep her in the room with us or just push her to the next room where we could hear her I also plan to use it to roll around the house when she is older and is using it to play in The nice thing about it is that it works just like a regular crib with the side that lowers and the mattress level which has two settings The other reviewer is right you can push it up to your bed if you want a co sleeper type of bed and you could even lower the side down for easy reach of the baby I have not used it this way but it would be the perfect thing if my baby got sick Tho other thing I love about this crib is that as a sleeper or play area it lasts much longer than a bassinnett or cradle as long as a pack n play I believe up to 50 pounds Finally it is really nice looking and since we have it in our master bedroom I wanted something that would be cute and not bulky or would stand out too much This one is really attractive Negatives The mattress is pretty wimpy which is why I gave this 4 stars But she at just 6 months is still sleeping on it at night and seems to be very comfortable in it For the next baby I will probably look around for another mattress The other negative is that the crib does not travel too well unlike the pack n play It does fold up for easy storage but unless you have a minivan or SUV it is still pretty large to store in a trunk it does not fit into our volvo 4 door car trunk I would also recommend buying one of the port a crib bumper pad sets around 40 50 00 from Babies R Us because they fit this crib the best I bought the 15 00 Koala Kids bumper pad and it is too big and buckles around the bed so I only recently started using the bumper pad for fear that she would press up against it at night But you need a bumper pad with the crib as they get older because they start sticking their legs and arms out the slats while asleep Nice crib good choice 
5 0 I like it alot I received this as a gift at my baby shower I had 2 pumps from the hospital and 1 pump from WIC The Avent one is the one that I liked the best and I am still using it It s small and easy to use It s also nice because you can attach a bottle or the throw away containers or use the collapsible liners it comes with I don t have to pump a lot or often so it has been perfect for me 
5 0 Wonderful I used the medela hospital grade electric pump and also the manual and always had a hard time expressing enough milk to relieve my engorgement let alone feed my infant while I was away Received this pump as a gift and wouldn t use an electric again if givent the chance I love this pump I am able to express enough milk for her feeding in about 15 20min I have no discomfort like I did with the medela Very easy to assemble once you figure it out the first time easy to clean using microwavable steam clean bags are great very compact After reading the reviews about the flimsy neck I now tighten the pump to the bottles using the pump base as to avoid breakage Good luck I very highly recommend this pump 
5 0 Awesome and efficient I love this pump Letdown occurs within thirty seconds and I can pump several ounces in about ten to fifteen minutes I haven t yet fed my baby with the disposable bottle but I do feed her from the regular avent bottles She had her first bottle at 2 weeks and she goes from the avent bottles to breast with no problem I do agree though that milk leaks from the corner of her mouth but baby s are messy anyways so I don t think that is a big deal I would recomend this pump to any mother I pump when her father watches her when I have appointments as well as when I go shopping so that I can feed her in the store quicker 
5 0 Wonderful I love this pump I am a first time mom and wanted to breastfeed but I work 3 nights a week and would need to express milk for my baby I read all the reviews and wanted to try the ISIS since it isnt as pricey as the medela I have had the best experience with this pump One thing to note is that to get a comfortable amp good suction you have to get the cushion petal thing wet and leave it wet when you put it on the pump My baby is now 3 months old and still exclusively receiving breastmilk thanks to the ISIS 
4 0 Works Great A bit tough to get used to but works great at keeping kids out of the cabinet 
5 0 RUG MAT Hey people There are things called rug mats Any rug will scoot around on hard wood unless you have a mat under it If that is your only complaint go spend the 9 99 it would take to get one 
5 0 great accessory The Zanzibar rug is a great accessory to the nursery We have wall to wall carpet in the room and have placed this rug in front of the dresser It s soft and very cute We highly recommend 
4 0 Good product so far This has been a life saver to protect my babies lily white skin from the hot Florida sun The only draw back I can see so far is that it kind of makes her stroller hot like a tent Otherwise it has been great and allowed us to go for daily walks in the beautiful weather and get some fresh air 
4 0 Don t use the eye screws We installed railnet on our large deck and found a better way to attach it Rather than using the strings and eye screws that came with it we bought some clear plastic zip ties from the hardware store electrical department They re much quicker to install and probably easier to remove Better yet we won t have 1000 little holes in our wood 
4 0 works well in loft area We actually bought this from the babies r us store and found it to cheaper here So far it works well in our loft area We need to buy another one though as it wasn t long enough our store only carried one My husband installedin one night and the nice thing is that it blends well into our white stairs you barely notice it s there Haven t let the baby play up there yet but it s always nice to know it will be safe when that time comes Now if only I can find a gate that will work for our uneven stair top 
5 0 I finally solved a tricky problem I have a contemporary home The front stairs to the second floor are slotted w spaces in between plus metal tubular hand rails with spaces and a landing with the same hand rail We moved in when my children were much older Suddenly I have a two year old grandchild and one on the way I panicked What to do about safety Glass or pexiglass would have taken too long to install and very costly Suddenly I saw the ad for the railnet While it is probably easier to put it on a straight opening we were successful in figuring out how to string the netting on an angle I feel so much better knowing that children will not be able to fall through the railing We plan on putting one under the stair slats as well I highly recommend this product It is inexpensive simple and strong 
5 0 Great Product I bought this product to keep my 10 month old safe upstairs and I love it It was very easy to put up and I stapled the bottom part to the floor and the carpet hides the staples It looks neater and more secure Same with one of my walls and when I m done with it I ll put a little plaster in the holes and repaint the area I m very pleased 
4 0 Safety is 1 This product serves its purpose very well It may not be the prettiest thing but it keeps children safe and is very versatile You can adjust the height and length by folding the ends up and it is pretty easy to install 
4 0 Nice Idea I like the net becasue it does what it says it does It may not be pretty but isn t all childproofing stuff pretty tacky looking It is worth it to feel safe to have this especially because without it I would have a pretty nasty fall possibility onto tile floor 
5 0 Expanding on a great idea I purchased the two panel extension kit for the Summer Secure Surround gate system which attached easily and has made a great idea even better My granddaughter has more than enough room to play and not feel as though she is being caged in This summer it will be easy to bring her outside to play and not worry and watch every second we are out there The system is tall enough to be useable for years and when the good weather comes we can think about the other attachments shade umbrella etc available 
5 0 Hard To Find Accessory This was a much needed and welcome addition to our existing Summer Secure Surround Gate We actually use this for a dog that we have who had a major surgery on his leg and needed to be penned up while he recovered The extra two panels were advertised on the box but I could only find them here Price was fair and shipping was too Arrived in a timely fashion They came in a plain box that was not descriptive but they are true Summer product and work well Great for growing children pets etc Thanks for having everything Amazon 
5 0 Great Quality Highchair This is our second highchair We owned the evenflow discovery highchair and found it to have many problems so we were forced to buy a better product This chair is worth the price Our daughter is very tall but at 23 months she still uses this highchair with no problems PROS Vinyl seat makes for easy cleanup Safety harness is superior Extra tray is very convienent Folds up nicely and has locking wheels Seat moves up and down CONS The release tabs for the tray are easy to break If you don t properly push them in or out they will snap right off and your tray will no longer lock in place 
5 0 We Love this High Chair We bought this same high chair 10 years ago when my first daughter was born and we absolutely loved it At the time the only reason we bought it was because they had it in all white and we didn t want one with colors all over it But as far as the high chair goes we loved every thing about it super easy to clean and the reclining positions were great for a determined 4 month old they always want to be at the table with everyone Also many a times my kids fell asleep while eating and rather than wake them all I had to do is recline the seat and they would sleep with out a problem because it has such a comfy seat cover It held up wonderfully for 7 years We thought we were done with kids and got rid of it now I am expecting again and I have researched high chairs all over again and have decided that this model is still the best for your money out there We are buying this again 
5 0 Couldn t Of Asked For Anything Better Had a Graco high chair on my registry list and received this instead from Mom because it was pink and she just had to buy pink Very easy to put together especially at 8 1 2 months pregnant I love that it reclines and the height is adjustable It s on wheels which makes it easy to manuever throughout the house and it folds up very easily which makes it easy to store out of the way while not in use Everything seems to be great about this chair Our daughter won t be using it for a few months since she isn t even here yet but I m sure she ll love it as much as I do already 
4 0 Love it We bought this high chair for our daughter and we love it It s easy to use and set up I would have given five stars but to unfold fold it you need two hands which sometimes isn t too handy when you have a crying baby in one of the them The seat adjusts up and down so your child can sit right at the table with you As stated above the legs fold together so you can store the chair when not using The chair cover is also easy to take off when it needs to be cleaned which we do in the tub and is attached with snaps My little one is ten months old 19 pounds 27 5 inches and not even close to outgrowing this chair I definitely recommend this chair Hope this helps 
4 0 Overall really great only 1 big con I have had two kids use my Evenflo carseat I HATED it It was like they never even tried it out to see how well its features worked I finally got so sick of it when my 2nd child was 4 months old that I ordered a Babytrend Flexloc At first I was seduced by the high safety ratings but even after that Consumer Reports article was rescinded I still liked a lot of the features Pros very comfy seat good padding the canopy is twice as long as my Evenflo so it can cover baby almost completely the canopy stays in place it doesn t fall forward or backward behind the seat the tightening mechanism under the baby s feet is easy to reach and VERY easy to adjust to make the straps tighter or looser depending on what baby is wearing the harness mechanism is very easy to adjust the shoulder strap height My Evenflo had to be rethreaded every few months and even my mechanically inclined husband said it was horrible The Flexloc is just a dial on the back that you turn it s a breeze The seat can be transfered between cars without the base It can be strapped directly to the car by using a seat belt on the car seat or by using the LATCH system if your car has it the triangular handle has a nice grip and is easy to hold in any position this carseat is lighter than my Evenflo The cloth is very wipeable not as absorbant of spills and stains as my Evenflo Cons I found a few minor cons that definitely would not deter me from buying this carseat and one that might depending on how I can resolve it once I contact Babytrend The release button to take the seat off its base is at the toes under the seat It s a little harder to reach than the ones behind the head if the carseat is backward facing As others have said the buttons to move the handle are a bit stiff but not horribly so I was prepared for them to be way worse The handle is thinner and doesn t FEEL as sturdy as my Evenflo when carrying baby around but it hasn t had any problems This is the one BIG one that I have to check with Babytrend on Twice when I have turned a corner sharply the carseat has tipped to a 45 degree angle I have tightened down the seatbelt as much as I could putting my full weight on it and using the seatbelt retracting mechanism But maybe I m still not doing it right The base is narrower than my Evenflo s was so maybe that s why So I need to contact Babytrend and see if they have any suggestions Until then I guess I ll take the corners slower Overall I have felt like this seat was a MAJOR improvement over my Evenflo and even over the Graco Snugrides I checked out at the store It was intelligently designed to be easy to use and adjust as baby grows I would recommend it for sure Just make sure you strap it in tightly or use the LATCH system if you have it 
4 0 Beautiful Crib This is a beautiful crib It was fairly easy to put together lead to no fights between my husband and myself You do need to read the instructions and go in order My only complaint with this crib is that it scratches really easy The bar in the front already has two scratches just from the process of putting it together Will have to see how it holds up when there is a child sleeping in it 
5 0 One of the best cribs on the market I have one of these cribs already for my son We have another one on the way and when it came to the choice of which crib to buy there was no question This crib is so versatile It goes from a crib to a toddler bed and then to a full size We can use it for years I m only 5 4 tall and I was a little worried about the side not moving down but it works out great for me even when it is on the lowest level I would recommend this crib to anyone 
5 0 A Nice Crib My husband and I looked at several cribs in store and were a little unsure of buying one over the internet however everything worked out and we are very pleased w our purchase The price no shipping and handling etc can t be beat The crib went together relatively well and is quite sturdy The wood does mark rather easily but with our budget a hardwood crib was out of the question We also purchased the DaVinci Emily Changer Dresser They look great together Overall we are very happy w our decision 
5 0 Really a nice bed We just received this bed and it is a really nice bed for the price My husband and I had very little trouble putting it together We highly recommend it 
5 0 Great crib at a great price I ordered this product on a Thursday and received it on the following Tuesday The package was in great shape when it arrived It only took us an hour and a half to put it together The instructions are very easy to follow I am very happy with this purchas 
5 0 Replaced my diaper bag This changing pad was a great investment I take it everywhere instead of lugging around a big heavy diaper bag I am able to fit several diapers and the travel sized bag of wipes in it It is small enough that you could add it to your diaper bag as well if you would like I think this is also a great gift idea 
5 0 Great for Baby I love this changing pad it is great no matter where you are I have had to change my son s diaper in some crazy places and I know that he s clean on this surface and it s easy to wipe clean if he makes a mess It has a little cushion to it as well in case you need to use it on hard surfaces and it folds up to fit in my small diaper bag nicely I really like the wipe pocket and small zipper pocket too 
5 0 the best in entertaining babies my grandson just laughs constantly in his jumper it s the highlight of his day 
5 0 The Jumper for the Non jumping Child This jumper has been great My son doesn t really like to jump in it but he does love to play with the attached toy Plus it has loops on the straps so I can attach my own toys to it too I bought it thinking he would spend a long time jumping away but as it turns out it s just a portable exersaucer that he plays in which is great for travel or just another place for him to play Had I bought some of the others on the market without the toys he would be very bored Maybe my next child will use it to actually jump 
5 0 Jump Baby Jump My baby loves this Jumper I put him in when he was just 3 months He s a big strong boy Now he is almost 5 months and he s doing great in it Doesn t bang himself at all 
4 0 We re loving it My 4 5 month old son LOVES his Jump Go It was a Christmas present from Santa and my husband and I are happy with it as well I ve seen some of the reviews calling it dangerous but I think the only danger comes when parents aren t watching their children We NEVER leave him unattended in his jumper and we ve had no problems For the first week or so he just kind of hung around in it moving around in circles He s finally gotten the hang of jumping and he also realizes that he s the one controlling all of the sounds The only drawbacks I see with it and the reason I can only give 4 out of 5 stars is that the volume setting goes from loud to EXTREMELY loud I wish there was one more quieter setting Also as with any doorway jumper there IS a bit more potential for injury than with stationary jumpers But as I said before if you monitor your child said child should be fine I highly recommend this product 
4 0 Let s Everyone Please Calm Down I loved my doorway jumper The noise I could ve done without It really is the kind that claws it s way into your head and then you hear it when you lay down to take a nap and want to sneak in the other room and toss it But that being said I don t know what these other reviewers are talking about My baby had a great time in her jumper and it was a fabulous way to burn of fifteen minutes Anymore than that and I recommend an Exersaucer I mean how long can you just jump before it gets boring Just put the jumper in a wide doorway and you won t have the problem of the baby hitting their hand against to doorway or whatever people complained about And for god s sake when your kid is over like 20 pounds move on to something else All it all I think this was a great investment 
4 0 Great car seat I really like this car seat I did a ton of research before we bought this one and I can say I am very pleased with it The straps are really easy to use and do not tangle it tighten with a pull of the strap in the front Getting it in and out of the car is also pretty easy All you have to do is grab the handle on the back of the seat and lift up To get it in the car you simply place it in the base and listen for a couple of clicks to make sure it is in securely The only things I have found that bother me is that the baby seems to have a hot and sweaty back whenever I take him out The material doesn t seem to breathe very well Also I have had a few grocery carts that it has not fit into I found that if I lowered the handle bar all the way back I could sometimes make it work Worst case I just place it in the large part of the cart sideways I have the Peg Perego Pliko P3 stroller and it fits into it perfectly Be sure to have the installation of the car seat checked We thought we had it in our car correctly and when we brought it to the police station to have it checked they showed us it was in wrong 
5 0 Safe simple and attractive carseat This carseat is the best Not only is it the easiest installation ever we actually went back and re read instructions because we couldn t believe it could be so easy but it s also a very safe seat They have the special bicycle padding to add more protection for baby The safety features are outstanding The child restraint is so easy to use with non twisting straps an easy lock system and a pull belt to tighten the harness without struggle And it looks great too We have the Explorer print and love it All our Chicco products are fabulous Polly high chair and the playard too 
5 0 excellent car seat this is the best car seat I have owned I have three children and have owned many light weight and easy to use car seats but the Explorer is the best one yet Extremely light weight and easy to carry The base is the best part with clear bubble levels on both sides and easy one hand isntallation It uses seatbelt like clips to hold the latch system connections in place The only down side is the required use of the base but extremely minor issue with a newborn car seat Excellent product 
5 0 2nd Infant Car Better than Britax Infant We had the Britax Companion and it was very hard to use We had even purchases extra bases I was a pain to use Our daughter sits in the middle of our car so we need something easy to use The store that we bought it from said it had the same lining at Britax that they use in helmets for motercycles Most infant carriers to not have this protectant We like the snugride but they said it doesn t have the lining in it So we bought this one plus an extra base Let me said that it clicks in and out so easily It has saved my back Plus it doesn t wake up our daughter when she is sleeping too It is a wonderful seat I hope consumer reports gets a chance to review it this year I bet it will be among the top seats P S It also will fit with Baby Trend or Kolkraft Universal Strollers D 
4 0 love it This crib is heavy duty and very sturdy great quality i am so impressed i thought that it was easy to put together the packaging took a serious beating in transit and there wasn t a scratch or missing piece for the price it is an exceptonal value 
4 0 Pleased with the product but not the shipping I received the crib in a box that was in shreds Amazingly all the pieces were intact because the hardware was in a sealed smaller box The delivery people must have stuck some other hardware that was loose in shipping into the box because I got some that weren t even part of the crib They must have thought the pieces had fallen out of it because it was in tatters There were a few marks on the metal crib but if it had been wood I m sure it would have been worse Very disappointed in the shape of the box but the crib was acceptable 
5 0 My son loves this The fabric is good quality It has different textures and the animals seem to pop out at you My two month old loves staring at it The matching mobile sold seprately is worth a look at too It doesn t have any fancy lights or anything but my son adores it 
5 0 Very Cute and Fun This bedding is so cute My son is 10 months old and he loves to rub on the animals while he is in his crib Each animal is a different texture and color We use the comforter as a floor mat and he will play on that and pet the animals The only thing I did not like was the sheet that came with the set was really lose So I dont use it But other than that it is a fun bedding set for him and he has not gotten bored with it yet We just love it 
5 0 this is the best crib set ever i bought this set because it was something different normally people paint the walls blue and buy things that have the colr blue everywhere when they are having a boy and the zanzibar is different it has animals everywhere and i love the color the material is great and all the extra pieces that the crib set has make your nursery come alive everytime i walk into my sons nursery i think i coundnt have pick a better theme and now they came out with the play yard and feeding chair which i plan to purchase 
5 0 Great Color and Great Set The pictures of this set on Amazon and kidsline do not do the set justice The colors of the actual articles are much more vibrant than shown in the pictures The set is made of fabrics with different textures It s really a high quality product In addition the design allows you to use the set through your child s toddlers year 
5 0 Zanzibar is the best Zanzibar is the best We love it all It is good quality and we couldn t imagine our nursery in anything else We were so picky about what we wanted but we made the right choice We recommend everything in the Zanzibar line We got most things from BabiesRUS Baby Depot has some other things that BabiesRUS didn t have light fixtures nightlight etc 
5 0 It s almost like 3D Zanzibar is a great theme I have twin boys and the characters seem so much like 3D that they just like to stare at almost everything I have with Zanzibar characters Including the valance Also everyone has given me great compliments on the theme I would also like to add that I think it will go a long way during there toddler years because it works for when they are babies and when they are toddlers It is a bit of a mature theme I love it 
5 0 love our set this is a gorgeous set we bought this set to go with our rochester crib beatrice combo tower armoire we just love how it compliments them worth every penn 
5 0 Great walker My son loves this walker He loves the music as well as the toys on the walker The other great thing about this walker is that once he was ready to actually walk you can take the seat out and he can use it to walk behind Also the fact that it can be folded down made it very easy for us to take with us when we visited grandma 
4 0 GREAT LITTLE WALKER MY GRANDUAGHTER IS ONLY 5 MONTHS BUT I AM SURE WE WILL GET GREAT USE OUT OF THIS WALKER 
4 0 Good for you foods My daughter is about to turn two and LOVES to pretend to cook and feed her dolls I chose to order this item for her birthday during a free shipping promotion after seeing the poor choices of play food offered in my local toy stores It s disappointing that most play food available is fast food branded i e McDonalds Even the knock off tubs of play food are primarily junk food hot dogs donuts cupcakes ice cream cones etc I chose this set because it consists of the foods my daughter primarily eats fruits and vegetables eggs cheese bread etc Some of the pieces are solid plasic and some are hollow which leaves a greater question of durability But even the hollow pieces are made of a very thick rather ridged plastic which I think will stand up OK over time I am not even able to squeeze them myself I also like that the foods are on the small side and actually fit in the small pots and pans sets available right now although we set aside a few questionably small things like the carrots and mushrooms until she is older Definitely worth the price I think when free shipping is available 
5 0 READ the Instructions and Don t Worry About Probe Covers I ve owned this thermometer for three years now and I still love it even though I ran out of probe covers a long time ago My husband and I both use it and it works great on our 3 year old boy The beeping of the thermometer makes him giggle even when he s sick As far as the probe covers go we ve found that it works just fine without them We use rubbing alcohol to clean off the probe tip in between uses just as we always did with the old school mercury thermometers our parents had when we were growing up Yes the instruction book for this ear thermometer says that the probe covers help ensure accuracy but we haven t found that to be a problem Keep in mind that this thermometer is ONLY for use with babies OVER 6 months old because the ear canals of newborns aren t large enough to accomodate an ear thermometer Exceptionally accurate temperature measurements are very important for newborns so use a different type of thermometer not an ear thermometer but usually all we really need for older babies children and adults is a measure of normal a little above normal or significantly above normal In my opinion if the temperature is over 101 you ought to be calling your pediatrician anyway If the probe covers really do matter to you pull out that instruction manual and READ IT It specifies that you can use any brand of probe covers and recommends a particular model number of Walgreens brand covers In my opinion The First Years company is being VERY helpful with regard to the probe covers the instruction manual does not say You must buy ONLY our brand of probe covers Instead they make it clear that just about any brand will work as long as the style is similar and even specify a brand that is readily available from a particular national drugstore chain The factor that DOES significantly affect accuracy is how you hold the thermometer and the ear The instruction manual includes both descriptions and diagrams that show how to hold the child s or adult s ear and insert the probe tip It s VERY important that you use the right ear holding technique For smaller babies you pull the back of the ear STRAIGHT BACK and hold it while inserting the probe tip But for older children and adults you pull the top of the ear UP and hold it while inserting the probe tip When I neglect to hold the ear in the proper position I always get inaccurate results I know for a fact that my normal temperature is not 95 degrees but that s what it reads if I hold my ear incorrectly When I hold the ear in the correct position depending on the age and size of the person whose temperature I m taking I get very accurate results My guess is that the people who have complained about the accuracy of this thermometer did not read the instructions because the diagrams in the manual show you quite clearly how to hold the ear and thermometer Also some of the reviewers mentioned getting inaccurate results on their young babies e g 3 months old Remember this thermometer is NOT for babies under 6 months It s not intended to be used for newborns so you shouldn t expect accurate results when you use it on a newborn Plus I can t imagine trying to stick the probe tip into the ear of a newborn That would hurt So my bottom line is that this is a GREAT thermometer as long as you use it properly And the probe covers really aren t a big deal Get well soon 
4 0 Don t know why others have so many problems I love it This is the only thermometer we use at our house my husband and I included It is so easy Just be sure to hold the top of the ear straight up then insert the probe this should give you the right angle As for the probe covers you can use any generic cover I bought a package of Walgreens brand covers and they work just as well They are not the exact same and do look different but looks and functionality are two separate things Get over the cover issue and go to Walgreens or any drug store Please don t let the other reviews scare you This is a great product 
4 0 Don t know why everyone else has problems with this I purchased this thermometer 18 mos ago and absolutely love it It is quick and easy to use and there is no maintenance As for those who are having trouble finding probe covers they are sold at Walgreens or any other drugstore They are not first year brand but the Walgreens brand works just as well I hope this helps Please consider this theremometer your children will thank you because of the unintrusive painless readings 
5 0 Very pleased This product does what it says it will do on the box it warms up the first couple of wipes that you use It is a nice product to have 
4 0 Use now Not later We bought this sleeper for our son to help with plagiocephaly at 5 months Unfortunately we didn t get this product soon enough By the time we began to use it our son was moving and flipping around in his crib more It soon became more of a hazard since he would slide down and his head would end up between the sleep positioners We had bought other sleep positioners to use when he was a newborn and wished that we had used this instead The product itself is great It s easy to wash and care for 
4 0 Very helpful My son has GERD so we needed to prop him at an angle and this wedge was great It s just enough so that he isn t flat but doesn t slide down while he s sleeping 
5 0 Loved it I loved this piece of furniture Good solid construction and priced well when purchased with the matching storage unit with bins 
5 0 The best ever My daughter loves it bathing her now its a pleasure for her and for me too 
4 0 Good for storage and keeps em safe The best transition from baby tubs to the big tub It lets the babies comfortably play and you not as worried the ll slip and fall 
5 0 This is a must have item This is a must have item It makes bath time so much easier I have been using this since my baby was 5 months He is in the 90 of the weight scale and I have never had problems getting him out of the seat Of course you still have to watch them at all times But this seat gives the baby some freedom to splash and play with out having the option of crawling around the tub Highly Recommended 
4 0 Best of its kind I ve been using this bathseat for about 4 months now since my daughter was about 6 months old She loves being able to kick and splash while sitting in it I originally had this same type bathseat for my son minus the little elbow rest but when trying to purchase the same one 7 years later I see that it is no longer available The great thing about the other one was that when putting your child into it the front would rise up and snap shut With the Safety 1st Tubside Bathseat you have to slide your kid into it Also be very careful if you have a climber My daughter loves to try standing in it Fortunately the elbow rest makes it secure so there are no fears of the seat tipping over just your little standing monkey You will still have to remove your child in order to wash their little bottoms 
5 0 awesome product No more searching around for the baby food jars in the diaper bag It keeps the jar safe and sound as well as chilled We used this all the time It is great 
5 0 Well worth the money My baby loved this car seat from the start We ve used it through all stages including rear facing and now forward facing with my currently 19 month old toddler The seat is easy to adjust as baby grows and easy to install using the Latch system The removable infant padding was perfect Biggest bonus is the adjustable crotch strap with padded cover shield to prevent chafing and scratching between baby s legs I m due with my next baby in a month and have already added a second one of these to my baby registry A wonderful car seat you will not be disappointed Note that this seat is quite heavy and best for permanent installation in a single car I would not recommend it for repeated swithching to other cars because of it s weight 
5 0 Decathlon vs Boulevard It took me several weeks before I finally opted to purchase the Decathlon rather than the Boulevard I was very interested in the extra side impact protection that is only available in the Boulevard model but was concerned about whether or not my large 4 1 2 month old son who is in the 95th percentile in length and weight would need the adjustable crotch strap positioning that is only offered on the Decathlon I am so glad that I purchased the Decathlon It turns out that my son DID indeed need to have the crotch strap adjusted to the last slot he would be sitting on top of the buckle in the Boulevard at this point which would have made it impossible to buckle and very uncomfortable for him If you re purchasing for a thin toddler rather than an infant or chubby big baby you might not have to worry about that I love the extra padding which is removable unlike the pads in the Boulevard and the soft cover which is machine washable unlike that in the Boulevard He seems to be VERY comfortable and I know that he is safe I know that it doesn t offer as much side impact protection as the Boulevard but it does offer some definitely much more than a conventional car seat as it is made to far exceed American safety standards Plus if your baby is placed in the middle of the back seat than that offers some additional protection as well I was also concerned about the size of the car seat and whether or not it would fit comfortably rear facing in the back of my Toyota Avalon car It does Perfectly My husband is 6 4 and doesn t have to move his seat up to accomodate the car seat in back something I was very concerned about AND I can see out of the rear view mirror with no problem It DOES NOT block your view at all It s very easy to install and if done so properly doesn t budge It is a little tough to adjust the straps when it s installed rear facing but not too difficult and even if you had to take it out to adjust the straps it s no biggy because the carseat takes only a couple moments to install EASILY and it s not like you ll have to adjust them on a daily basis or anything I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend the Decathlon to anyone looking for a SAFE COMFY and ATTRACTIVE carseat that will take them from the chubby baby stage all the way through the toddler years o 
4 0 Doesn t smell baby like I use this for my infant and it seems to work very well It s very gentle cleansing and leaves skin soft My only complaint is that it doesn t smell like the usual baby kind of smell It s a little too perfumy smelling for me but not bad enough to make me stop using it 
5 0 This is how you get a sqeaky clean baby My baby was born with a full head of hair and for some reason even though I bathed her every day her hair would look greasy by the middle of the day this product eliminated that It really left her hair and body residue free and very clean It has a great subtle smell and I just love the pump It s a really good quality pump and it really makes the product easier to use I have also been using this on my 2 yr old and even my 5 yr old 
5 0 Pink Gingham Clean Shopper I saw a mother in the store with one before our daughter was born and thought it was a good idea to buy one as well I use it everytime at every store and dont leave home without it 
5 0 Cute and functional I definately enjoy this hamper You don t have to drag the whole thing to the washing machine because it has a removable liner It holds quite a lot of clothing and the design is very adorable I do recommend this item 
5 0 Loved it My son was huge at birth and around 2 months started to get fussy in the evenings I discovered that swaddling helped but had a hard time finding a blanket big enough The Ultimate Swaddling Blanket was perfect Unlike some of the other swaddling products that can only be used to swaddled it s actually a functioning blanket as well Now we don t swaddle him any more but we still use the Ultimate Swaddling Blanket to cover him up It s the perfect weight for covering him up without him getting too hot 
4 0 Great for the money I searched high and low for a double stroller that wouldn t break the bank and I have been very happy with my purchase I have a two year old son and a five month old daughter and both kids like facing forward I also like the side by side style I couldn t see myself pushing a stretch limo as I ve heard it called It s easy to maneuver I can fit down most aisles and it fits in the trunk of my compact car with a full load of groceries Drawbacks the canopy could be a bit higher my son thinks it s a game when I pull it forward and immediately pushes it back the seat covers are velcroed in place and tend to slip when I put the kids in and I need to fold it before it will fit through the front door of the house I ve also taken it on two cross country plane trips with layovers Baggage handlers in general aren t very gentle and the front bars come off fairly easily when the stroller is folded One now has a small rip in it but I m lucky it didn t get lost Overall I ve been happy with it 
4 0 nice piece I am very happy with the quality of this product It arrived with no scratches or marks and the pictorial directions were easy to follow The dresser looks great and I m sure that it will provide years of use for our baby 
4 0 nice piece of furniture We just received the Natural Combo Tower and are very pleased with it The directions were easy to follow and took my husband about 2 hours to get it together My husband needed my help for about 10 minutes I would recommend this product to other 
5 0 The safest bumper easy to install easy to change sheets I love this bumper The only reason I got this to begin with was because when I removed the old traditional fluffy cotton bumper pads which I realized weren t safe my 4 month old would squirm around and his legs or an arm would end up sticking out of the slats and he would get stuck So I realized I needed something to block the slats I was happy to find this new breathable bumper to keep his arms and legs in the crib My only concern was whether or not I d be able to easily change the crib sheet once this was installed And I can My husband secured this bumper velcro pads extremely tight all the way around Spend the few extra minutes to do that it takes 2 people and then you will not have to remove the bumper to get the sheets off I can even completely pull the mattress out of the crib to get the sheets off easier if I need to and the bumper stays in place since it fits so snugly against the sides of the crib It s almost like it s not even there I HIGHLY recommend this product 
5 0 So far so good We have had this seat in my husband s car and so I have not used this as much as our infant seat Now that my son is outgrowing the infant seat I will be using it more often I bought it for the great ratings and the only thing I don t really get is why there is prickly velcro on the side of the straps where the baby s arms rest I m wondering if I m doing something wrong It seems like the velcro is to hold the straps out of the way for putting the child in the seat but when buckled they are sitting on top of his legs I am also looking for a car seat stroller to fit this and have no idea where to look I ll post again after I use this seat more but so far so good 
5 0 Great Seat Comfortable and Safe We bought two of the Britax Marathon s in the Onyx when my daughter turned 1 was 20 lbs and ready to be forward facing She has loved this seat and it has been comfortable for her during long road trips We are replacing it only because of an accident my daughter didn t even acknowledge the accident she was so secure that completely disabled my Jeep Liberty We re looking at a booster now that s she s 4 and over 40 tall I would recommend this to anyone wanting safety and comfort 
5 0 Great car seat We already had a Britax car seat for my 3 year old daughter I was hoping to move her up into a booster seat but she was not ready to give up her car seat for her younger brother yet That s how I decided to get a new car seat for my 10 month old son And since I had good experience with my first one I just stayed with the same brand and type Both my children are tall and this car seat seems to accomodate that 
5 0 Britax Marathon convertible car seat onyx Received timely and product is excellent quality Very happy 
5 0 Works Great I actually have a five year old Doble Select pump that my sister gave me She used it frequently through two kids and I have now been using it for five months I am very happy with it I have never had any problems at all 
4 0 Works well but may need additional padding inside to guarantee locking This works well but if your door handles are thin you may need to add some additional padding to make sure this springs back to the locked position I taped some cardboard around some of our very thin elegant door handles to make this fit better Note that some reviews elsewhere state that installing this on one side of your door could lock you out from the other side That is flat out wrong regardless of what type of handle or button is on the other side of the door I used screws I wouldn t count on double sided tape to protect my child If you had to use tape then I would try the kind that comes with the 3M removable hangars It is very strong and removes without damaging surfaces 
4 0 Great for price I think this is an excellent quality product for the price It is very sturdy and extremely lightweight It does have a few cons though The visor is pretty much useless as it doesn t fit good enough to block much sun Also I wish it reclined just an inch more Otherwise it is pretty great 
5 0 I wish I got this to begin with I got this body support about a week ago and I love it Not only that my daughter loves it too My favorite thing is that the strap covers are small enough for her straps All the others that I saw were too big for her straps It keeps her very cozy and she cuddles right into her seat now Makes the rides in the car much more pleasant when they are comfortable She is 2 months old now and I wish they had had it when she was born because I definately would have bought it It is also reversible which I love but I have kept it on the soft side so far I definately recommend it 
5 0 Great product We use this on our daughter s crib and it is great It is easy to install and is durable 
5 0 The Best The is a wonderful bumper The original bumper we bought was way too fluffy This is a much safer option Plus it s cute with our white crib I sleep at night much better knowing we have a breathable bumper on 
5 0 Better than a regular bumper peace of mind too I worried so much about a regular bumper and my baby getting his face shoved into it and having difficulty breathing especially after he learned to roll over This bumper was perfect and I no longer worried about suffocation dangers or about the bumper coming off inadvertently This is a wonderful product I first got mine from Wal Mart it was stated as a mom invented product Genius 
5 0 Awesome Toddler Cot I was looking for a toddler cot to take on trips with my grandson I think I found the best one on the market This cot is so easy to use and it travels like a dream I set it up by myself and I was able to collapse it and return it to it s carry bag by myself as well Furthermore my grandson thought it was great 
5 0 Great Bed This Portable Cot has been wonderful We purchased it for the holidays when we would be visiting friends and family My daughter is two and does not fit in a pack and play comfortably She could not sleep on an air mattress or the floor because many of them have hardwood floors To keep her warm we opted for something off the floor and we found this It is so easy to put up and take down and it stores nicely This is the greatest thing we could have bought for the holiday travels 
5 0 big AND disabled babies My son is a 20 pound 6 month old He was born with club feet and has a Dennis Browne Bar between his feet We can t put him in a shopping cart because he wears the brace all the time We used to use a front carrier but chunky butt got too big for it and it was a hassle to put him in by myself I used the traditional sling with my other 3 kids but couldn t use it for this little guy because of the brace We just hook the hammock waist strap on feed the rest between his legs pull up and over my head tighten and we re ready to go I love it I superglued some bathtub no slips to the inside of the neck strap to keep from sliding Works great Highly recommend for anyone looking for nonconventional methods of transporting nonconventional kids 
4 0 Love it I carried my first child everywhere in this She didn t care for the stroller and who would With the hip hammock she was carried around able to see everything at eye level instead of looking at everyone s knees was close to mommy or daddy and got cuddled constantly I would walk the mall for hours with her in there She slept in it and I could sit down with her in it and rest or even feed her I loved that I never needed to take it off but even when I did it s so simple The trick to getting it to fit well is to make sure the waist strap is very snug and the child should be slightly in front of your hip not actually on the side I put my girl in make sure she s evenly positioned in the middle of the seat and then pull her closely to me while adjusting the shoulder strap You do have to pull it nice and tight but not so tight that it rides up on your neck I recommend trying it at home at first and getting it just how you like it then only undo the front strap to take it off Otherwise you will have to pull at front and back when you re out and that s difficult I found the best positioning for baby and mom is to have the baby s back arm under the mother s arm which is then draped over the child s back and can then easily hold the bottom of the hammock or just hang free I found that I didn t actually have to hold my daughter while she was in the hammock My big complaint is that the strap gets twisted in the padding and eventually there is no fixing it I wish they would put a non slip gripper on the bottom of the strap so it doesn t slip toward your neck I think this would fix the bunching of the padding that happens However I loved this thing so much that I m just going to buy a new one for my second child I know I will get my money s worth It saves my back and shoulders I have tried the front carriers and just can t stand to have them on for more than 15 minutes 
5 0 Love this I have 6 1 2 month old twins so needless to say I need all the help I can get I have found the Hip Hammock FAR easier and more comfortable than the sling style carrier I have had such a great experience with this that I m getting a second one to keep sized for my husband so we can both carry a baby at the same time for walks or other outings or even just around the house I highly recommend this product It is very easy and very comfortable 
5 0 We Love It My 19 pound 6 month old and I both love this carrier It feels almost exactly the same as when I hold her on my hip minus the tied up sore arms 
5 0 great product After doing much research we decided to purchase the Evenflo Titan Deluxe It fit well in our pickkup and it seems to be very comfortable for our son We like it very much 
5 0 Good Safe Seat I picked this car seat because it got high marks on the Consumer Report tests and it was very reasonably priced I was confident in my choice after reading customer reviews here and on Target com I have a 2 door Civic and placed the seat forward facing in the middle of the back seat Adults can sit next to it but it is a little cramped Because of the seat styling in the Civic I had to put rolled up towels under the sides of the base to stabilize it but I had that problem with the infant seat The belts are easy to fasten and very easy to adjust since it has a button to push for slack and a strap you pull to tighten We are happy with the seat and would buy another if we needed it 
5 0 Great car seat This is a WONDERFUL car seat I purchased it in the Cobblestone design It s wonderfully made convertible car seat and a much better value as the higher priced alternative car seats We had a Britax before purchasing this one and I think I ll definitely stick with Evenflo This is one the best rated car seats and less than HALF the price of Britax It s super sturdy great safety features everything you d want in a great car seat It is a little bigger than I expected and had trouble getting it in my car but we used to have an infant car seat so I didn t keep that in mind that it d be bigger because the baby s bigger Also for first time parents I would DEFINITELY recommend getting a convertible car seat instead of an infant car seat Infant car seats are only a maximum of 22 lbs and the baby will usually reach that by about 7 months I paid 200 for the infant seat and hardly got any use out of it And convertible ones will go until the child reaches 40 lbs A MUCH smarter and more economical choice 
5 0 Cheaper at Wal Mart You can buy this exact same care seat at Wal Mart for 76 87 
4 0 So far so good I wanted to write a review for this seat because after much researching I couldn t really find any helpful information I have a Britax Blvd for my 15 month old daughter in my Honda minivan which she is very happy with but it couldn t fit in my husband s Dodge Ram 2500 truck It was too tall and would leave her in too much of an upright position After looking at the back s of a lot of other car seats I felt this on would be a good fit without losing too much of the comfort for my daughter It fits very nicely in the extra cab and my daughter seems very comfortable It is very easy to install and it s very lightweight After lugging the Britax seat all over the airport and on and off the plane on a recent trip I will be looking forward to traveling with this one instead The straps do not come with any covers but that is an easy fix Adjusting the straps to fit her was very easy and there are multiple options to move them as she grows Overall I think it will be a great seat to have as an extra The Britax will still be her main car seat I don t think you can find a better seat than that one If you need a seat to fit in the back of a truck this is a good one 
5 0 Great second seat purchase We already have the Evenflo Triumph Premier After a few initial problems with that one we got used to it and my large 9 month old son is very comfortable in it I decided to buy the Titan because it also had good safety ratings and was lighter than the Triumph As a second seat we wanted something more lightweight and portable since it would be moved between my husband s car and grandparents cars It s very easy to use equally as comfortable as the Triumph but slightly less plush I find the more simplistic harness adjustment much less of a struggle with the Titan That was my husband s 1 complaint about the expensive Triumph Good all around seat purchase No complaints 
4 0 Excellent expensive hard to find Leaking put the pieces in wrong or over tighten and they will leak Pay attention to the assembly so you put the small plastic pieces in exactly as they came out and it won t leak Hard to find local stores markets rarely cary Avent line of products I would guess it s because they don t sell They probably don t sell because they re Expensive finally found an Avent Magic cup in a market It was 8 for one cup Since then haven t been able to find any at any price at my local stores We re raising our granddaughter and she s a drug baby Change doesn t come easy to her and it s very hard to teach her anything new After trying every cup on the market the reason I only purchased one at the time this one finally did the trick 
5 0 Great Cup I have to agree with the other reviews My daughter is 6 months and when the doctor gave the ok for juice I wanted her to start drinking it from a cup I bought other cups and she would just cry for the bottle I decided to by these AVENT cups because we also use this brand bottle and this is the only cup she will drink out of We are still in the practice stage considering she is still young but I don t have to fight with her at all She is still getting good at holding the cup but it is not a problem because when she drops the cup nothing spills I have even tried to see if she would drink from the other cups and she just screams until I give her the AVENT cup 
5 0 Definately Magical My son was a breast fed baby exclusively for 10months then he cut teeth and decided that he wanted to bite Well that just wasn t gong to happen He would take a sippy cup just fine for juices and such and had been from about 5months but when it came down to drinking milk the sippy cup idea didn t seem to appeal to him nor did the bottle Then I got him one of the Avent Magic cups he loved it and still at 2years of age it s the only cup that he will drink milk from We never had a problem will spilling leaking infact the only problem that I have is you can t find the Avent line locally where I live 
5 0 The Best Seat ever Our daughter has been in this seat since she was 7 months old It is FANTASTIC She is now 3 1 2 and I recently invested another 50 into the seat I replaced the harness and the HUGS and was fortunate to find a new cover on clearance in a children s shop in Seattle It now looks like brand new We use it in a 2001 Toyota Tacoma double cab a 1996 Chevy Suburban and a 2003 BMW X5 In the Toyota and the BMW to get proper fit we have to remove the head rests NO PROBLEM As for the wieght I am ok with having to lug a heavy seat if it means my child is as best protected as she can be When you get the seat into whatever car you want it in my recommendation is to literally climb into the seat with one knee pushing as much of your weight into the seat as possible We do this when installing ours and it doesn t move a millimeter Our daughter is always comfortable in the big cushy seat doesn t slump when she falls asleep can t escape from it and I never deal with twisted straps Well worth the money the inconvenience of the weight and size Crazy that people would spend the money on this knowing it is the safest seat and then just because it is heavy put your child in a piece of junk in another car An accident is only going to happen in the car with the best seat Think again Take the time to do it right If you have trouble installing it find a local fire department or insurance agency that will properly install it for you 
4 0 Good Quality car seat Good quality car seat The only reason I m rating it 4 instead of 5 is that it is big it does not fit easily as a rear facing seat in a sedan car but fits well when used forward facing Straps are easy to adjust The velcro on the sides of the seat are helpful in keeping the straps to the side when putting the child into the seat 
4 0 nice but enormous This is a terrific car seat if you plan on keeping it in one car If however you frequently swap car seats between your cars or want to have a car seat that you can bring along when you travel by airplane this isn t it I bought this seat when my 3rd child outgrew his infant seat Compared to my previous one a Century ovation from 1997 this is plusher and the harness straps really don t get all twisted up But I m still hauling the old Century car seat out every time we fly anywhere as the Britax Marathon is just too big 
5 0 Great Carseat Ok so it took some work convincing my husband to spend the on this but pointing out that it will last all the way to our son being 65lbs helped a lot When it arrived we put our son in there and he was happy My son is never happy in a car seat but he loved the fact that he could sit up straighter than in his infant seat He can finally sit up like a big boy the way he wants to now that he is 5 months old and is a supported sitter I like the fact that I can recline him if he falls asleep which is usually the case in the car I am sure he also appreciates the incredibly soft fabric I know I would like to sit in a seat that soft Considering we travel 4 6 hours to visit grandparents his comfort and happiness is very important to us in a carseat We pray that we will never have to use all the excellent safety features of this seat but it is great to know that this is also top of the line in that respect 
5 0 A godsent Superb product I cannot say enough positive things about this item I absoloutely loved the fact that it helped to keep my son warm on cool nights but it was safe enough for him to use in his crib every night This item needs to be brought mainstream so that it can be available to all parents for their kids 
5 0 five stars is not enough My son has been wearing the halo sleep sack since the day he came home from the hospital Being a winter baby it was the best thing in the world to know that he would be warm and not have to worry about loose blankets He began sleeping through the night at 7 weeks old I think the sleep sack gives him a feeling of security He was never able to sleep without being in it He is now 30 months old and still won t go to sleep unless he is in his sleep sack We had to have a friend of ours who is a seamstress add additional material to the bottom because he became to tall for it That is how much he loves his sleep sack It is by far the best thing I ever bought for my son 
5 0 Fleece Sleep Sack Blue Extra Large Muy buena adquisici�n El beb� se siente c�modo y confortable 
5 0 Wonderful These are wonderful My baby was getting uncomfortable being swaddled at about three months so we decided to make the switch to sleep sacks We were worried that with her arms free that she might have a hard time falling and or staying asleep This was true at first so we started by only putting her in these during the daytime in a light cotton one After about a week she was not waking early from her naps anymore and after two weeks we tried her in it at night and she slept straight through the night as she did when she was swaddled So the transition was painless and she seemed a much happier baby to be able to reach her hands and move her arms While I didn t notice shrinkage I did notice that the zipper does bunch up a bit but this hasn t been a problem Sometimes my daughter sucks on it if it gets close to her mouth but she has to reach for it it doesn t cover her face at all or trap air that she could rebreathe I didn t like that these don t have sleeves so I tried Carter s sleep sacks and found the sleeves to be too short and hard to get on my daughter Those sacks only come in one size which my daughter has already outgrown at four months 14 lbs 24 inches She has also outgrown the small size sleep sack but the medium size fits her perfectly with some room to grow I didn t want to use fleece at first since it is polyester I wanted to use cotton But we ve found that she sleeps longer and seems to prefer he heavier fabric of the fleece one Also we only bought these in blue even though we have a girl because the color is calming to our easily overstimulated baby We ve washed these many times and they look just as good and hold together just as well as they did originally We ve also found you can put your baby into the next larger size without it being so big that they can get their arms out or that it bunches up around their face So after everything we ve tried we ve loved these sleep sacks from day one 
5 0 Great for little squirmers Like any parent I was concerned about SIDS so the SleepSack seemed like the perfect alternative to blankets Little did I know I would come to LOVE the SleepSack for it s warming capabilities After a few months under their belt babies get VERY squirmy in the middle of the night so blankets are useless and dangerous So I relied heavily on the SleepSacks to keep my little guy warm even after the risk of SIDS passed They come in fleece for winter months and cotton for warmer months and they re generous in size so they are not outgrown easily I only wish I d purchased them in yellow or white in case my next baby is the opposite sex 
5 0 Awesome Highly Recommend These are so awesome I never have a concern that my son is cold or will get strangled with blankets One night I had the sleep sak in the laundry and it was a cool night so I put a blanket over him well my husband checked him in the middle of the night and found the blanket wrapped so tightly around his neck he could hardly believe that our son was still breathing Very scary So if anything make sure you have more than one sleep sak 
5 0 perfect for travel in hotel rooms I loved this We had to drive to california from washington And this helped me so much she loved it the pillows on the side made her feel like i was there next to her the nightlight was even a nice touch because I could wake up and see what she needed quicker it was easy to pack up and carry I thank goodness I purchased this 
4 0 Love This When we bought this item I was going to use it in our bed as a co sleeper for nursing As it turned out I did not nurse We were having our cradle worked on and our son was 3 weeks early so his bed was not ready when he came home the snuggle nest was a life saver His is almost 7 weeks old and he still sleeps in it It is so wonderful I take it to the daycare everyday and we put it in the play pen where he sleeps It has been on day and overnight trip to grandma s house and he sleeps so wonderful because it is his bed This item is very easy to travel with This was the best item I bought The only reason I gave it 4 stars was this The actual bed has two layers that are not attached When both layers are put in like they are suppose to be the baby sleeps at an inclined position After about two weeks our son started wiggling and could wiggle all the way to the bottom where there were no side protectors and he could fall out The way I fixed this is to pull the bottom layer down a little so he was not inclined and laid flay and that fixed the problem of him wiggling out Other than that I love this product 
5 0 A baby s best friend No longer does my son wake at all hours of the night nor do I worry about blankets coming lose in the crib This is the best money I have ever spent on a baby product He loves it and so do I My brother is expecting his first child and I plan on buying this for him as well Great great product hands down no comparsion in the peace of mind that it gives me and the comfort that it gives my son 
5 0 Car Print SleepSack Great item Well made and the zipper from the bottom up makes it practical and easy to use Seems to keep my grandson warm and happy because he can still kick 
5 0 Wonderful Product This a great and beautiful drying rack It fits ANY bottle and the brush works really well too It even lets you hang pacifiers off of it and allow them to dry as well A wonderful product 
5 0 Great little stroller This is a great little stroller for me as I am in Japan where you really need a stroller that fits in small spaces The stroller is very sturdy but light which is great for quick trips in and out of the car The recline is good for my 4 month old but I did put a neck insert in for extra support when she falls asleep The basket is decent size for this size of stroller will fit small purse or diaper bag It folds very nicely and has the handle on the side for carrying Another thing I like about it is that the canopy is hugh and covers my daughter completely I love the fact that it comes with all the accessories too I really don t have any complaints exept that the handles don t adjust so a taller person might say that they are too short I m only 5 2 Overall I would recommend this stroller to anyone 
5 0 Mom of a 1 year old I have been searching for a light weight stroller for about a month now and after looking everywhere I found the Zooper Twist online I was a little hesitant because there was only 1 review on it and I could not locate it in a store to see for myself I am so happy that I went with my instincts and purchased it I love it The features on it are great and it s so light It is so easy to carry and it comes with a handle that s attached to the side It is also very easy to open close It even came with a rain cover and a boot I wanted something with good quality without spending a fortune I couldn t believe the price on Amazon and for free shipping you couldn t beat it The only thing that some people may not like is the basket being so small but if you can get past that I think it s a great stroller I would highly recommend it to anyone 
5 0 knee saver It is a great product if you are bending on your knees a lot to bathe children 
5 0 LOVE IT I initially bought this to bathe our small dog but will now use it for my toddler It is small enough to not be in the way and doubles as a stool It is soft and cushiony and saves banged elbows The suction cups often do come unstuck but overall it is a great product 
5 0 Very Happy I bought this bedding set for my sons Cosco portable crib It made very well and washes nicely It is so cute My son and I love the animals on the bumpers he likes to make noises at them If you have a portable crib I recommend buying this bedding set 
5 0 i love it i love this crib set i had a Snoopy set in the porta crib i think it was recently discontinued before i put in this one it was cute but the bumper didn t fit too well kinda awkward and uneven and the quality of the fabrics used for the fitted sheet and the bumper felt cheap i got the malawi porta crib set as a present i added it into my registry because i liked the colors and i thought it looked cute i was about to exchange it for store credit because i thought i had no use for it but i m glad i didn t the bumper fits almost perfectly and feels thicker and safer to use i love the feel of the fabrics used for the whole set it is definitely worth the money 
4 0 New Mom Being an inexperiennced new mom I had no idea that Porta Crib meant a speciality sized crib and not standard size 52 X 27 I just figured it was some kind of name brand among all the others No where on the detailed page did it describe the measurements so I assumed standard I registered for this and was so excited until I tried to fit it on and it was too small So basically I just wanted to warn new moms or moms who didn t know this will not fit standard cribs However the bumper is ever cuter in person then on the photos a good thing but the crib sheet is very thin cheap bad thing 
4 0 Great pressure mount gate for top of stairs My husband and I purchased this gate to reduce damage to our walls and have a sturdy top of stairs gate as we have a steep staircase with several stairs The gate is very sturdy and overall is easy to install The only tricky thing about the installation is knowing how to properly lift and open the gate after tightening the screws The gate does close on its own without having to lift the gate and handle as the instructions mention but after looking at the packaging at how the gate is supposed to look after it is installed and how to lift the door we had to tighten the screws further into the cups on the wall to achieve the proper closure Would recommend this gate to those with small children as it is very sturdy but if there are elderly persons in the household they may need assistance in opening the gate 
4 0 Fantastic gate The only reason that I did not give the gate a rating of 5 stars was due to price I installed the gate in one of my bedroom door openings It is nice and sturdy and it does close on its own That was the key selling point to me Not everyone remembers to close the gate behind themselves and that defeats the purpose of a gate in the first place I do not want it to ever stand open on its own I love the gate I just wish that it was a little cheaper so I could install in into more of my door frames 
4 0 SB TODDLER BED My child loved this bed when he first saw it He loves to sleep in it It wasn t that easy to put together though needs 2 people to do this Pretty sturdy as my 2yo likes to jump and stand on his bed 
4 0 Nice and sturdy but not as easy as it may seem This is a sturdy bed and my two year old loves it FInding a store that actually carries it in stock may be a challenge However it is somewhat difficult to line up the screw nut retainers with the metal frame holes Be patient and assemble it properly This is a nice bed that makes good economical sense overall 
5 0 Good buy great bed My son loves his SpongeBob bed It was the least expensive toddler bed definitely the one my toddler wanted the most and it is sturdy with bright cheery colors Yes you do have to put the decals on and assemble it yourself Most of it I did on my own although when it came to assembling the slats with the frame I needed my mom s help and then it came together quickly 
4 0 My 26 month old son has never complained My son has had this bed for about 4 5 months He sleeps on it at night and during the day noon nap He stands on he bed now his 14mo sister is in on the act and the bed is sturdy none of the problems mentioned by the parents who bought the dora the explorer version 60 br 62 60 br 62 One thing that stops it from getting 5 stars is that it was a pain to put it together correctly and i suspect those who complain about the sturdiness have not put it together like it should be 
5 0 The Best First Toy Our son adores this toy It is easy to grasp and put in his mouth A must have for every baby 
5 0 winkle This is a great chew toy for babies soft and pliable It is flexible and can be grasped easily I gave it as a gift to two six month olds and they happily began chewing on it immediately Do not sterilize this product in a microwave sterilization bag though it does melt and warp 
4 0 Comfy but very wide Great for walks but not narrow spaces This is made really well and protects baby well and also seems very comfortable It is also easy to carry all our stuff especially when out all day It is great for walking because it steers really well and is very smooth But shopping in stores it is difficult to maneuver down narrow aisles because it is wide I picked this over the metrolite because the other seemed too wobbly It is a bit heavy to lift in the car but I am strong so this isn t a major issue but my Mom could barely lift it into the car My daughter has also slept in the stroller fully reclined which is awesome for doing yard work in the summer We have even taken this to the beach and loaded everything into the bottom and over the handles there is so much storage space below Baby is also well protected from the sun under the awesome canopy But I have switched to a lightweight narrow stroller for taking my 21 month old daughter out on longer trips since she doesn t always want to sit in it the entire time 
4 0 Way too big I really wish I had considered the Metrolite graco system because registering for this one It is way too big to use on a daily basis I love it for places like the zoo or park but it is way to wide and heavy for daily mall grocery store errands in general All in all I think graco has the best features on strollers definitly the best basket and parent trays but I think I will try to sell this stroller and get the Metrolite so I would use it more 
5 0 Best Toilet Potty Ring out there We have several toilets so I bought other potty seats intially so I didn t have to carry up and down stairs The handles are a must for the user to get on and for the cleaner to take the seat out without touching icky stuff The boy cup in this one is not removable by the user On one other model I had the cup didn t last a day This ring is by far the most stable As for the reviews about it being unstable I wonder if the foam supports were put on In addition your child is supposed to be supervised in the bathroom Good grief They shouldn t be leaning over for anything hand them the book And chafing How long is the kid sitting there Overall and excellent seat I ended up replacing all the potty seats in the house with this model 
5 0 Satisified Our 2 year old daughter was on the small side when she started potty training so sitting on the big potty was a little scary for her The handles on the side and the little brace on the back helped her feel more stable I would recommend it for small toddlers who might fell a little insecure sitting on the adult size toilet at first It does look nice too so we don t mind having it sitting in our bathroom 
5 0 Plain and Simple Potty Training I got this for my 15 month old daughter who within the last month seems to have become very aware of her bodily functions She has constantly been taking her diaper off so I figured it was worth a try even though she seems a little young So far so good She sat right up on the toilet with this seat and went pee pee within 3 minutes She was very excited to throw her used Kandoo in the toilet and flush I clapped and said Yea This seat is great because it is easily removable has handles for little ones with busy hands and a splash guard for when this little one gets a little to much momentum behind her pee pee I think this is a much better and sanitary option than one of those potty training units Why try and separate a little kid from that later on when they can start off right on the toilet And why possibly put yourself through the hassle of cleaning those things GROSS 
5 0 Exactly what I wanted No hidden surprises and even a couple of bonuses It s cute fits well and my twin boys LOVE the handles A nice bonus is that is comes with adhesive cushions so there s no chance of scratching Another thing I really like is that the splash guard is nice and secure We have Blues Clues potty ring and the splash guard is always sliding to one side or the other or simple falling off and it does not have handles for them to hold onto We much prefer this one 
4 0 Pooh Potty Trainer Ring My son hasn t really taken a full interest in the whole potty thing yet but we like the trainer ring The only thing keeping me from rating it 5 stars is the obvious He s a boy and if he doesn t lift up enough to get off of the seat ouchie Need I say more Other than that he enjoys sitting on it and likes that it is well cushioned 
5 0 The only blanket you will need Our son was not a great sleeper When he was born my husband mom and I all took turns walking around with him all day and all night Then we got the book The Happiest Baby on the Block and tried to swaddle him This would work for a few minutes but since he was a nine pounder it did not stay wrapped Then we got the Miracle Blanket It was great We got stretches 4 hours of sleep at a time We are so glad we discovered this blanket and made sure it was the first thing that we located when we found out we were having another baby 
4 0 Quality not as nice We ordered these for my daughter 2 years ago when she was born and they were made of a nice thick cotton The one I just received was made of a thin cotton fabric and not nearly as nice They are really overpriced too in my opinion But they are still the best swaddling blankets out there 
5 0 True to it s name This blanket was given the perfect name It truly is a miracle blanket After sleepness nights I remembered that I received this blanket for a shower gift and figured it was time to give it a try From the first night our baby slept longer He is three months old now and we still use the miracle blanket and enjoy him sleeping longer at night This is a great gift especially for new parents 
5 0 Love It I bought this when I was pregnat with my second baby I love it It keeps him securely wrapped all night My only complaint is that it is not designed for larger babies My son was 10 at birth and he fit in it perfectly Now at 2mo he is 15 5 and over 25in and the blanket is getting a little small for him We still use it every night he just sticks out of the top a little more and I tuck in the tail at his back instead of in front 
5 0 A Miracle Indeed We received the miracle blanket as a gift when our daughter was 4 weeks old After trying the swaddle me to keep her asleep for longer periods and having no success we were delighted that the miracle blanket worked so well Within 10 days she was sleeping through the night I strongly recommend this product 
5 0 Definitely A Miracle My son used this miracle blanket at night until he was about 5 months old He felt safe snug and secure He slept through the night at 6 weeks When fussy or gassy we wrapped him in this blanket and he calmed down almost immediately It was definitely a miracle 
5 0 changing pad covers I looked at several stores in our area and couldn t find these covers for my new grandson Thank you for saving the da 
5 0 Great to bleach I love these cover s They are great to bleach and soft for the baby I also love the price for the amount you get 
5 0 Love these contatiners I ve been using these to store milk for 6 months now and I LOVE them I use the 8 oz size They stack together so they don t take up too much room in my bag in the morning I work 12 hour shifts 3 days a week so need to take several every day And they sit upright so they don t leak in my cooler or in the refrigerator at work and avoids the gross out factor with co workers that the bags can have I recently bought the adaptors to pump directly into them and love them even more Also my husband has to handle the milk when I am at work and these are way easier for him than the bags so he wastes less milk to spilling etc My only comment is that you do have to be careful not to overfill them as breast milk expands when it freezes and can pop off the lid or crack the container But this would be a concern with ANY storage container bags included Hate the way breast milk storage bags leak when they are thawing out and no matter how flat you try to freeze them they never stack up well so you end up with an avalanche of bags falling out of the freezer I love that these containers are sturdy plastic that can stack up in the freezer and they don t require special handling to thaw to avoid contaiminating the milk As to buying the bases and lids separately the containers are not meant to be used more than three times before they are discarded while the lids hold up much longer so I m glad I can only buy what I need at a time so no wasted money or extra supplies to store As to cost other similar containers cost 3 4 each so 15 for 10 lids and bases seems very reasonable 
4 0 Great for Part time moms I bought this system when I returned to work 5 months ago I only work out of the home for 10 hours a week This system has been great for me I have not have any problems with leaking Just try to avoid overfilling the containers As for the covers I found having one of those grippy things helps to open it For someone working out of the home 40 hours a week this would take up too much room in the freezer But if you are a Part time worker or a SAHM wanting to have some on hand to get out of the house then this is great 
4 0 Cute I love this entire set I gave this 4 stars because the plastic hanger broke when my dog was rough housing around it My husband made me a solid oak hanger to go in it and now it s better than before 
5 0 This keeps everything together I liked this for the bedroom It kept everything together and was so handy to have 
5 0 Great product I consider this product a must have as far as convenience goes in changing diapers We have two children in diapers and two Diaper Depots 
5 0 Works Great I bought this product to put on our pack and play in the living room and it works perfectly I have our wipes container on top diapers under on the one side I have diaper rash cream a comb and some other things and on the other side we have our remote controls and our phone It works great 
5 0 Great This is great to keep necessities close at hand Also I don t understand people saying that the wipes warmer does not fit The Prince Lionheart Ultimate wipes warmer fits securely It has two slots on the bottom that slide on to the diaper depot It even says on the box that it is made to fit Maybe it has been changed since others reviews it fits perfectly and works great 
4 0 Second picture is another model I wanted this product not only for convienience but also because I own the Wipes Warmer This particular Diaper Depot is the over the edge model and does NOT accomodate the warmer The second picture is of the dresser top version of the depot which does have a space for the warmer I have yet to find it on this site but have found it on others 
5 0 The only way to store baby items I am so impressed with how the Diaper Depot This is a functional and easy way to store all my baby s changing table items It has enough room for all the things I need and it is sturdy I was really concerned with the cloth storage units because I was worried they would be too flimsy No worries with this one I am very happy 
4 0 Good but could be better As I write this this car seat is not available at Amazon but I wanted to give it a review in case they get it in stock again I bought this for my son who out grew his infant carseat when he was 5 months old I wasn t ready to switch him to his big boy carseat yet because I like the fact that I can take him out of the car without waking him up This seat is great because it goes up to 30lbs and 32 iches but the seat itself is HEAVY Also as many reviewers have said the fabric is not breathable and my son sweats like crazy in it The canopy is nice and big but it falls down the back when not in use and can be a nuisance I ended up taking it off after 2 months All in all we love the seat it just needs different fabric and something to stop the canopy from falling down the back 
4 0 Second Child Infant Seat We purchased this carseat for our second child it is a little lager than our old one but much easier to use It is light weight and the 5 point harness is very easy We also love it because we will be able to use it up to 30 lbs most infant seats only go up to 20 or 22 lbs 
5 0 great carseat from mom in CT When I was expecting my first child a daughter I had decided that I was going to buy the Graco SnugRide infant carseat When I was at my local Babies R Us store I saw the SafeSeat and loved the fact that it has a weight limit of 30 lbs and 32 inches for the height It s bigger and a little heavier then the SnugRide but I know my daughter will be safer rear facing beyond her first birthday Another good thing about this carseat is that after she grows out of it I won t have to buy a convertible carseat because she can go right into the booster seat I already have for her that has a weight range from 20 to 100 lbs I love this carseat and it s well worth the extra 50 The only thing I didn t like was the fabric it felt stiff and that s why I bought the carseat and stroller in a different pattern I installed this carseat a week before I had her with no problem I highly recommend this carseat 
5 0 Love it but it s got a few easily solved issues I bought my 7month old daughter the nicest model of the infant safe seat it s the central park pattern about a month ago Before I dared buy any kind of car seat for my daughter again I made sure that I read over every parent review I could find So I thank those who have reviewed this before me they were a big help I found a few complaints that I had about about this carseat myself after testing it out in the stores I ll post a few possible solutions that I ve found Complaint 1 It s too big to fit on top of shopping carts I don t like it but apparrently you re not even supposed to put carseat carriers on shopping carts It throws off the balance of the cart and can cause the cart to tip over super easy from what I ve heard I think Graco actually makes them so that they don t fit for that reason Complaint 2 The metallic or nylon like fabric is uncomfortable for baby My daughter hated the metallic and nylon fabric when I tried her into them in the store so we bought a pattern that didn t have it Central Park You can check gracobaby com to see other patterns that don t have it Thats where we found ours Complaint 3 The waist of the belts are at an angle leaving marks on the babys thighs My daughter got marks the first time she wore a sunsuit in it but now I just pull the dress part down between her skin and the belts The angle though is so that the waist belts will sit at the pelvis or as close as possible on a newborn which is the safest and the ideal place for them to sit on the baby Complant 4 Its too big to fit most cars I thought for sure it wouldn t fit in our car especially because our Snug Ride barely squeezed in the backseat But oddly enough this thing fits better into our old beat up 1992 Chevy Lumina the sedan not the minivan than the snug ride did And if you ve ever seen those old cars you d know that when the front seat s are pushed all the way back there s pretty much no room for ANY kind of rear facing carseat With the Infant Safe Seat installed PROPERLY my husband can still put the front seats all the way back And this thing still fits into cars better than ANY convertible carseat Before deciding on the infant safe seat I had tried the Graco Evenflo Britax and Eddie Bauer convertible seats into the car Complaint 5 It s heavy and bulky It is bulky but how else could it accomadate the higher weight and height limit As for being heavy Graco says it only weighs 5 pounds more than the old 20lb 26 Snug Ride In Babies R Us I tried holding our old snug ride 26 20lbs and the infant safe seat in both hands to compare the weight and even switched hands but couldn t tell a difference I also tried my daughter in it and carried her around the store I think because of the size it makes it easier to carry the bigger heavier babies because my 18lb 27 daughter is a lot more difficult to carry in her now out grown snug ride And I like that even once I no longer carry her around in it I ll still have the convenience of a travel system beyond the first year if my daughter s sleeping That s something that no other carrier or convertible carseat can offer Complaint 6 It doesn t fit in the over turned wooden highchairs I made it a point to try the carrier in restauraunt high chairs when i got it I have tried it at 4 different restauraunts and have not had any more trouble than i did with the snug ride So far from what I ve seen they ve fit perfectly Complaint 7 The stroller that matches the carseat is quite large Most of the patterns only offer a Quattro Tour stroller to match it however the 3 nicest patterns models Samba G Collection and Central Park also offer a matching MetroLite stroller and the Fusion patter also offers a matching Mosaic stroller however the Pierson pattern ONLY offers a matching Mosaic stroller The Quattro Tour stroller is a FULL SIZE stroller so it is heavier bulkier and has more nifty features than the MetroLite and Mosaic stollers So keep that in mind when choosing a stroller Complaint 8 It s too big for newborns The 3 nicest patterns models of the infant safe seats come with infant head body support though it isn t the greatest and if it doesn t work for your baby then you can just buy the Kiddopottomus Snuzzler infant head body support It s actually reversible and made out of that super soft velboa material on one side and the other is soft woven fabric I had to buy one for my daughter when she was born because she was only 6lbs 12 5oz She was so small even her snug ride looked like it swallowed her up when I buckled her into it I ve actually seen other reviews recommending the Snuzzler for the newborns who re going in an infant safe seat Complaint 9 The head support that the carrier comes with doesn t work You even have to buy separate double head supports for the snug rides even the ones that come with a single one unless you buy one of the nicest snug ride models that comes with double head supports The head support that comes with most Infant Safe Seats is made more for older napping babies I recommend the Especially for Baby Double head supports if you don t get the Snuzzler because they re made of 100 jersey knit cotton the back of the head supports are slightly padded they re deeper than any other head supports I ve seen so they hold babys head better and you can get them in quite a few different colors to match your car seat 
5 0 Great Car Seat BUT Too Large for our small SUV I gave the seat itself 5 stars I guess our car gets 3 stars The seat is wonderful easy to install good LATCH fit foot on it to level the seat out nice lining Unfortunately we are going to have to return it and get another seat for our soon due newborn It s too long head to foot to fit comfortably in our car We don t have center LATCH points so it has to go behind a seat The car seat is so long that once it is installed and at an appropriate level for a newborn the seat in front of it has to be almost completely upright and pushed forward more than is comfortable for a 5 7 person For reference we have a 2003 Subaru Forester Before you buy this seat see if you can find a friend that has one check it out in your car to make sure it fits I didn t expect it to be a problem it wasn t with our first child s seat that was smaller So the benefit of this carseat rear facing to 30 lbs could be it s downfall for you if you don t have a large vehicle 
5 0 worth the price We looked at tons of baby seats when our son outgrew his infant seat I wanted something that would still fit as he got bigger It has the added bonus of being airline certified so if we ever need to fly somewhere I know that he will be buckled up safely My husband says that it s a dream to install and we can switch it easily to grandpa s car I also like the peace of mind knowing that it has a high safety rating It was very expensive but I believe that it s worth it and it is good up to 100lbs so I plan to use it for several years 
4 0 Nice looking child uncomfortable My 3 year old 38 inches tall 30 lbs needed a new car seat since his younger brother was in need of the other convertables we have an Alpha Omega Elite and an Evenflo Triumph V I did oooodles of research and this Boulevard seat looks very comfortable and I liked the height weight limit Only my son hates it The issue is with the crotch buckle It s not that it s anymore further back than others it s just that it s too short There needs to be an extra two inches of strap beneath it like practically every other carseat on the market He grabs at his crotch he doesn t wear diapers and says ouch when I buckle it and or refuses to get in the seat without a struggle The little pad thing they have attached doesn t appear to do all that much I did try this rear facing to see if my 8 month old 29 inches 20 lbs had any issue with comfort and he didn t appear too It seemed fine for him The latch straps which shouldn t be twisted to attach have to be twisted in order to attach to the seat in my minivan there s only one way it fits I m not impressed with that and will probably use the belt if we keep this carseat Also something that bugs me is the buckles that snap into the crotch buckle only one of them actually snaps in the other doesn t give that it s buckled snap like its partner no matter what I do After all the Britax hype I ve read I really expected a little better I like the lever adjustment on the Alpha Omega Elite s headreast versus the knob on this one While this carseat looks cushy and nice and I m sure safety wise it s top of the line I think we re going to sell it and just get another Compass booster seat like I bought for our husband s car my son LOVES that seat We ve never had trouble getting my son to ride in a carseat until I bought this one and I can t wrestle a 3 year old several times a day into a car seat If you re buying this for an older child you might want to have them try it out first to see if they find it comfortable 
4 0 Great carseat This is our second Boulevard model carseat and we love both of them My only complaint is it s hard to get it centered level in the back seat when it is rear facing I have a 04 camry and my husband a 06 corolla The tether wants to pull it to one side or the other We also had to pull out the back support pillow in order to get the latches to click without cutting off the circulation in our daughter s legs But the cover is very luxurious more so than you can see from the picture I was holding out for the Shannon cover but Britax kept pushing the release date back and I needed to get a seat quickly as my daughter was outgrowing her infant seat I was very very happy when I saw how pretty the cover is Other than the asthetics of the seat it seems very solid and safe and I am very comfortable knowing that it is keeping my daughter safe and secure when we are driving 
5 0 Excellent seat worth the price I did a TON of research before buying this seat and we LOVED it so much we bought another It is by far the easiest to use I ve used A LOT of car seats and has the best features I really like that you don t have to take the seat out to adjust the harness height The fact that this seat can be used forward facing up to 65lbs and 49 is what sold me on it the most I wish this seat had been around for my first child who was off the charts for height we had to put him in a booster seat at age 2 because he was too tall for any car seat we could find The total side impact protection is another BIG selling point no other seat has that it is easy to install rear and forward facing I have used it in an explorer escape and tahoe with no problems People have said it is bulky but it is not really any larger then other seats just taller Compare them side to side at the store and you will see The seat is also very comfortable on long trips 8hrs with no complaints Another thing I really like about this seat is that the straps don t get twisted We had a Alpha Omega and the straps were forever twisted and were such a pain We have been using this seat for a year with no complaints what so ever There are so many wonderful things about this seat I could go on all day I had the seat inspected and the person told me that Britax IS THE BEST far exceeding US safety standards It is well worth the price for the peace of mind you will have We also have the Britax Parkway booster seat with the total side impact protection and love it as well PS I have read from others that the seat cover is not machine washable I washed it on delicate in cold water and it did no damage looks as good as new 
5 0 Love this product I have a toddler and we got this after he grew out of the infant car seat We absolutely love it I have not found one problem with it 
5 0 Love it I did lots of research about which convertable car seat to buy My daughter was 6 months old when we switched from her infant carrier she is a big girl about 19 lbs 6 mos and she fits wonderfully in this seat She looks SO comfortable and hasn t fussed once since we have put her in it she used to fuss quite often in the carrier This seat has plenty of room to grow and makes me feel safe with her riding in it this price is on the high side but how could you compromise the safety of the most wonderful thing you have I must abmit that the seat is quite bulky and probably wouldn t fit great in a small car but I think it is perfect for our 4Runner I have seen friends with other seats and I must admit that there is a definite difference in quality Britax spared nothing I wouldn t think of putting my daughter in anything else after owning this seat 
5 0 awesome This product has been a life saver I don t know what I would do without it I highly recommend it to anyone that has children 
5 0 Playard Tent Review This item is GREAT A bit of frustration at first putting the poles together but then again it is just like a tent and I get frustrated with those The item works GREAT at keeping the cat out of the playpen and actually holds the weight which I was kind of leary about Have not used the cabana portion yet but will hopefully do that this summer Overall I am extremely happy with the product and it s durability 
4 0 Portable Playard Tent Review I bought this tent to keep the cat out of the portable playard It does the job very well I only gave it 4 stars because the clips that attach the tent to the playard don t fit very well on the side when I have the bassinet part of the playard inside The bassinet has clips of it s own that go on the side and the tent s clips have to fit over the bassinet s clips Sometimes the tent s clips slide off One of them actually broke I think that it will work much better once I m no longer using the bassinet part of the playard 
5 0 LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT If you have cats or a climber THIS IS FOR YOU I have both This is my 3rd tent I still have 2 and the original on my sons pac n play It had been on my daughters so it s lasted almost 4 years now and is still in like new execept for the odd grape juice stain and I just bought another to have at my sisters My soon to be 2 year old is a huge climber He can get out of anything We have to zip him up to keep him contained My sisters is NOT kidproof so I got this for our last trip to visit It worked great As far as the complaint NONE FROM ME It is not that hard to get together but I could see how some might have dificulties with it It is easier to keep up vs taking it down but it s not that hard If you have cats or a climber get this tent there is also a crib tent 
4 0 Works well for us We have a 2 yr old climbing daughter and when we vacation this saves us We use a crib tent on her home crib and when we traveled without this playard tent getting her to stay in the playard for sleep was a nightmare Upon discovering the existence of the playard tent I promptly ordered it rush delivery so we could use it on our next trip It worked like a charm We had a little difficulty attaching it to the playard the first time but every time thereafter has been pretty easy It doesn t feel particularly durable but it does the trick keeping her in the playard Our daughter stays in the playard and we get some sleep when we re away from home Without it I m afraid we d spend every vacation exhausted Highly recommended 
5 0 Good Medela product bad service by seller The tubing works perfect as you would expect from Medela However I received it from the seller in a zip lock bag literally No factory seal no mention of Medela name anywhere This came with a flyer advising me that if I open and use the product it being single user only it s not refundable However there was no way for me to be sure that noone used it And it basically came already open 
5 0 No Leaks I ve tried many sippy cups but these are the best They don t drip when tipped over on the floor The hard top is a little tricky to drink from at first but my daughter got the hang of it after only a few tries Now this is the only brand of sippy cup that we buy 
5 0 We love it I absolutely love this mirror It definitely captures her attention when she starts fussing The lights aren t as visible during daylight hours but that s to be expected We just took a trip and it was hugely helpful and I love the size of the mirror I can see her very well and she can see herself too I had purchased a regular mirror SafeFit which serves it s purpose but for a few extra dollars this one works for her and me You won t be dissapointed I also love that the music stays on 
5 0 I really like this mirror I first bought the SafeFit mirror and was not pleased with it I bought this mirror because of the remote I have a Ford Freestyle with a headrest in the middle so it fit perfectly and does not block my view I bought a mirror so she would have something other than a carseat to look at while I m driving not so that I could look at her even though I can see her from my rearview mirror I have used it from the passenger seat to see her and to relocate a pacifier What I like about it is that once you turn it on it stays on I don t have to turn it on every five minutes like some toys It also has adjustable noise levels and lights and or music but you obviously can t do that from the front seat so I leave it on the same setting I have had no problem with turning it on with the remote I have it clipped to my sun visor and it works from there but the angle is right in my car I guess The only complaint I would have is that the lights are hard to see in the daytime but she seems entertained by what she sees in the mirror and the music and at night watches the lights It s a little more expensive but worth the money in my opinion 
4 0 Good Product I had no problem installing this mirror and it works great for me to keep an eye on my baby when driving The light show and music are nice but the music is too low even at the highest setting which makes ita problem when it get noisy on the road other than that its a good product and it attaches safely to the head rest 
5 0 I love this Bed Rail It was a breeze to put together It almost covers the whole side of the bed it s very sturdy and it looks nice too Warning to those using the rail for a boy it has lavender corners on the top I don t know if anyone would care about that but just an FYI 
5 0 I love it This is perfect for going to resturants I won t eat food off of the dirty tables I definately don t want my baby to It suctions to the table and makes a nice clean surface to put food It s great The pictures on the mat does make it harder to clean The yellow one has the least amount of detail so I prefer it 
5 0 waitresses love us No household with a baby should be without this when you eat out It saves me the worry of the baby eating from the restaurant table that is never really clean enough for the baby to eat from It also keeps the restaurant floor free of cheerios hotdogs and macaroni and cheese 
4 0 Great but not for us My son would just pull these off the table I did better with the plastic ones that stick 
5 0 Could be the best eleven dollars I have ever spent I was unsure about spending so much money on a placemat for eating out But I must say after using it a few times it is FANTASTIC I can pull it out of the diaper bag and stick it right to the table There is a place to catch all the food that falls and clean up is a cinch It rolls up and folds into itself for easy storage A MUST HAVE FOR ANY FAMILY THAT EATS OUT 
4 0 Question about item I can t really rate this item since I haven t purchased it yet Just wondering if any reviewer could tell me the measurements of this wall border since I can t find it listed on the site Is it 15 feet per roll or does it come in a double roll THANKS 
5 0 Too cute Hello Kitty rug This rug is exactly as pictured and is so cute Perfect for our baby s room Well made and durable 
5 0 We purchased the entire Hello Kitty ensemble from Lambs Ivy Our daughter is too young to even notice but everyone in our family is envious I just hope she will appreciate it when she get s older Note There are other items on eBay to match like fan blades and a wall clock 
5 0 So cute and functional I just love this lite bundle me I didn t want to spend the 50 or 60 dollars on the regular bundle me so I decided to give this one a shot and I totally love it When my four month old is dressed warm it is perfect to just cover her up against the wind On those colder days I just stick in one of the many fleese blankets she got at her shower and turns into the perfect bundle me The only thing that I would say about it is that my four month old is almost touching the bottom of it now when in the jogger No problem I just ordered the toddler one I just wish i had gotten this when she was first born This is definitly a must have 
5 0 bundle me lite nice product but the one I received is not embroidered as shown here It is just a very pale pink with grey lining But it is a nice lightweight carseat cover for fall and washes nicely 
5 0 just the best butt paste out there Our 3 weeks old son had a really bad diaper rash we tried a different product called balmex but it was so greasy and it didn t seem to work very well We then tried the butt paste and within a week his butt color went from red to white It looked like what a normal baby butt would look like It has no smell and it is not greasy It is usually gone by the next time you change the diaper I totally recommend using this product 
5 0 Appealing name effective formulation This is a twist on the old zinc oxide diaper rash formula with herbal Peru Balsam and petrolatum The formula was invented by a pharmacist and his Butt Paste was so popular it was reknown in Louisiana Then Walmart started selling it and the rest is history Nice for babies and helpful to folks with rashes from swimsuits or ailments not to be named here but which cause some rawness in the butticular region 
5 0 If only they had this 6 years ago I have used this on my youngest child who is just turning one It works like a charm Before I found Butt Paste my fav was Balmex now i will never use Balmex again I cannot believe the speed in which Butt Paste clears the diaper rash My little guy gets it so bad that he has sores on his poor little sensitive bum It clears that up within a day I LOVE IT I just wish that I had it for my other two children Buy some you won t be sorry 
5 0 The BEST diaper cream Boudreaux s Butt Paste is the very best diaper cream I have found Not only did it clear up my daughter s diaper rash within ONE diaper change but it kept her rash free for days I m very impressed The only thing that would make this diaper cream better would be a more pleasant smell but I m thankful there s no artificial scents on my baby s butt 
5 0 The best for diaper rash My son is only a month old and had diaper rash from his constantly wet diaper 1 2 We tried everything from vaseline to desitin and A D and nothing worked Finally someone told us to use Butt Paste and the rash went away in less than two days The rash hasn t come back either For a newborn this is the best stuff 
5 0 Boudreaux s is the Best I found this product 5 years ago at a local pharmacy I am so happy that BRU carries it now I have twins due in 7 weeks The price at BRU is much better than the pharmacy price My son used to get bad rashes and this product would usually clear up a rash within a day or two I introduced it to my pediatrician and this is now what he recommends It s simple Boudreaux can t be beat 
5 0 Stick the baby in place with Butt Paste Yep if your baby has a tendency to make rash movements then this paste will cure the problem He she will become irrational For lots of squirmy babies they make this paste comes in a tub 
5 0 LOVE THIS CREAM My daughter had a combination yeasty irritant diaper rash appear a little over a 4 months ago The doctor prescribed several creams and the rash would disappear only to reappear within a day I was losing my mind I wound up making a special cream that my doctor had given me the recipe for Unfortunately it didn t work and the battle of the diaper rash continued on I tried all sorts of other creams Weleda Burt Bees J J herbal salves and this all ended when I bought Boudreaux s Butt Paste I put on one application and the rash was reduced to a slight pink area near the rectum After the next application Tada GONE It has been 2 5 months ago and my daughter has not had a problem with diaper rash since I have reccomended Boudreaux Butt Paste to all of my friends battling with diaper rash problems with their kids They are all converted Love the cream As for the comment about not knowing the percentage of zinc oxide it s right on the tube and in the information provided on the product page above The cream contains 16 Some children may have a reaction to the Peruvian Balsam None of the babies that I know who are using this cream have It s in the same family as vanilla and cinnamon and contains essential oils similar to those in citrus fruit peel I suspect that if you are sensitive to these oils your child may be too Just like any product use your best judgment 
5 0 Great on Vacation While on vacation in Florida we were at one of the Disney resorts and all transportation was provided and the Stroller folded up very easy for riding on the buses 
4 0 jeep stroller Easy to use comfortable stroller but I would say it is better suited for infants young babies and small toddlers not pre school age and up because the seat is lower to the ground and very small 
5 0 jeeper creeper I m a jeep person and now my grandaughter can be too The big wheels cup holder and lets dont forget the bikini top after all it is a jeep 
4 0 Canopy Too Small I absolutely love this stroller because of its size and weight It is very light and has just enough pockets to hold a few diapers and wipes along with a few toys on the other side The cup holder on top is a nice addition too It is very easy to manage and fits perfectly in my wife s trunk taking up very little space My only real complaint is the canopy It is undersized and flimsy The only way it blocks the sun is if it is directly overhead at noon Otherwise the canopy is pretty much useless because the sun is always in our little girls eyes All in all I d recommend this due to enough features and easy of use to overcome the canopy issue 
5 0 Comfy and compact I got this stroller for my friend s baby girl and she loves it She says it s comfortable for her 4 month old and it folds up easily and compactly 
5 0 Jeep All Weather stroller I just received the stroller Assembly took 15 20 min Tried it right away with my 3 month old baby she felt asleep 5 min after I put her in the stroller at the reclined position The ride is smooth and soft it s comfortable for me and for my baby girl The rolling pad will be really useful in the summer we leave in Arizona The canopy isn t large but it works you can position it even in front of the baby so it ll protect her from the wind from the waist up of course We love it and I highly recommend it It s perfect for that price 
5 0 Love this Stroller This stroller was mentioned in Baby Talk magazine and that s why I looked into it as a replacement for my current umbrella stroller It folds up just as compact as a regular umbrella stroller yet it offers so much more The handle bars are cushioned and set higher up and out so your feet don t run into the wheels like other umbrella strollers The seat reclines just enough that baby can snooze comfortably My 11 month old daughter climbed right into it and fell asleep during our walk and slept for a while after The cargo bags are great for holding keys cell phone and snacks so you don t have to concern yourself with a diaper bag on quick trips Even though the canopy isn t that large it works well You can position it so the sun stays out of baby s eyes The wheels actually have suspension When I would roll my old umbrella stroller down the sidewalk and I would hit a bump my baby would just about get whiplash But in the Kolcraft we roll over the streets imperfections very smoothly Plus we love the color 
4 0 Great But not the same as pictured I ordered it based on the picture the one that came is a little differnt But it works great 
5 0 Loved it A must have You may be able to go without the ottoman if you are in a money crunch I fed my son with this exclusively in my rocker for at least the first 8 months The ottoman was too high for me and I am 5 6 
5 0 great alternative Of course I had to have a rocking glider for my nursery However when we were shopping for one the rocking ottomans all seemed really awkward Trying to rock with my feet up and on another rocker didn t make sense to me Also we were on a budget and another couple hundred bucks for a footstool seemed like alot This stool is the PERFECT alternative It puts your feet and legs in the perfect position for rocking and nursing My baby is 6 months old now I m still nursing and use this everyday What a great value and dramatic savings over the ottoman The only thing is I wanted white so had to search medela com because only natural was offered here at the time Hopefully that has changed 
5 0 Handy little stool and not just for nursing The Medela Nursing stool has been a lifesaver It comes in handy when trying to prop baby at the right angle Which also means this is not just a handy item for nursing but also for bottlefeeding too I wish I had invested in this item with my first child would have saved me from some aches and pains I was lucky to get this item on clearance at another baby retail store for 9 90 Great bargain and money is well spent on a terrific and useful stool 
5 0 Great space saver no need for ottoman I purchased this nursing stool to use with the glider rocker we have in our baby s room The room is small so the ottoman that would have matched the glider was not practical This nursing stool is great It is just the right height and is sturdy and not bulky 
5 0 Great During Pregnancy Too Though I intended to use this only during nursing I m glad to have it during pregnancy WONDERFUL I have had pains in my hips feet and I have found this item useful in alleviating my pain I can certainly recommend you purchase this stool early and use it during pregnancy too It doesn t take up too much space so you can easily put it away or dismantle if needed Simple and helpful Great product 
5 0 Breast Feeding Must Have I have to say I am a mother of 3 my youngest is 10 weeks old I wish I would of had this when I had my other two and had it for all three of my C Sections at the hospital I have been using it now for almost a week and it definately makes a diffrence Although when you look at it it doesnt look like much Well there isnt much to it but the design is what makes it so wonderful I am only 5ft 1in in height and I have to say it pretty much accomodates everyone if you have longer legs you just set the stool further out from what you are sitting on If you have shorter legs like me you bring it closer to what you are sitting on It does make you more comfortable while nursing after nursing 2 other kids and now nursing my 3rd child I can tell the diffrence It doesnt really matter how big you are on top either or if they are droopy Which is something a great deal of women experience when they have breastfed including me Sorry about the description of that but just want to give the most accurate comment I can telling about benefits of using this with normal problems Overall I would definately recommend it to anyone who breastfeeds I will definately be using it after I am done even 
5 0 Would recommend to anyone with newborn Purchased this item for use with my glider and love it It eases the pressure on your hips and knees because you re not stretching on tippy toes to rock I would definetly recommend this to anyone who has a newborn and will be spending A LOT of time nursing or feeding The quality is good very durable I have a three year old that has given it quite a few durability tests 
5 0 Saved my lower back and knees Icouldn t have nrsed without it Even my mother in law stated wow this really works as she was rocking her granddaughter to sleep a bit of a pain when you are vacuuming one more thing to move but otherwise a great idea 
5 0 Favorite Bib throw the others out This is the BEST bib I have found I have three of them and rotate I can either hand wash or throw them in the dishwasher and then loop them over the back of the high chair for storage I like the bib so much that I will roll it up and put it in my diaper bag for meals on the go the trough catches way more than those paper disposable bibs Now I would still use a soft cotton bib on an infant who is just having bottles or nursing but once they sit up in the high chair this one is the best 
5 0 Best Bib Ever Before my daughter was born I bought all sorts of cute cotton bibs like I love my mom etc Soon after she started solids I quicly learnt that these got soiled easily and it was tough to keep them clean Then on a trip to Sweden my husband brought the Baby Bjorn ones home and wow my life became a little easier I would just toss them in the dishwasher at the end of the day If I was in a rush I would just rinse them off under tap water THe catch all scoop at the bottom made less messy meal times It helped a great deal when my daughter wanted to drink water by herself and any spillovers did not land on the floor but in the bib This was certainly money well spent 
5 0 Great innovation This is the one and only bib I use almost 4 5 times a day and it s so easy to clean and use The soft material contours the baby s body perfectly and catches every drop and drip my baby throws I love this bib and so does my baby 
5 0 Best Bib Ever Got this bib for my 11 month old who is self feeding It is great for catching the food he drops no more cleaning the high chair after every meal It is soft enough to be comfortable and rinses easily for the next meal I no longer have a pile of cloth bibs to wash Yipee You can also get this bib at Babyage com for 9 95 plus free shipping on your entire order Get 2 one for home one for dining out 
5 0 Worth the buy I wasn t sure when I ordered this if it would work well for me but I really love it I has two ways to attach it which makes it even easier to use Really worth the money 
5 0 Best Cup Holder This price and product are wonderful It attches to my stroller and jogger with easy and holds a water bottle securely No more holding the water bottle as you walk jog in the other small cup holders I need to buy another one for my sons snacks 
5 0 Keeps things cold and organized It is really easy to change from stoller to stroller Holds e can and bottles baby bottles and water bottles perfectly Lots of pockets for my keys phone sunglasses and misc Stays upright and will not tip down 
5 0 Great finishing touch to the Zanzibar Line I absolutely love the little pillows that were made to complement the Zanzibar set They are really cute and made from the same material and pattern ad the Zanzibar Quilt I would say that they are a must have for anyone who has pruchased the Zanzibar bedding 
5 0 I LOVE IT I just recieved this today and I got it set up and put my 8 week old baby in it and she loves it I like how there are different levels at which she can sit at right now I have it to were she is laying down and that is one thing I like most about it I don t have to worry about her tipping to the side and falling out and she isn t all scrunched up either she is nice and flat The different melodies and sounds are kinda cool too but I just got it for the vibration and the differnet levels of sitting The BEST bouncy seat I have ever used Would highly recommend to anyone 
4 0 Great seat at a great price We narrowed down our choices to this one and the baby papasan chair We ended up choosing the JOY bouncer because it was 15 cheaper I m happy with the decision The chair is sturdy and comfortable It uses C batteries but uses them very gently so you don t have replace them often 
5 0 The Best for a New Baby I don t know what I would have done without this chair It is SO great especially when your baby is young My little one didn t like all of the fancy chairs with lights and such right away She would cry or fidget in them I think because they were overstimulating But I could always put her in this chair It is soft and looks comfortable she always seems peaceful sitting in it It can lay flat or be inclined slightly so baby can see things I also like the little head rest to keep her head from flopping all over the place a lot of the other chairs aren t as new baby friendly It also offers vibration and music which is nice Now that she is a bit older she likes the animals on the bar and talks to them She still loves to sleep in it and it is a nice comfy place for her to sit especially when I need a bit of a break I would recommend this to any new mom it is a great chair for your newborn 
5 0 Fantastic gate at a low price I bought two Evenflo Simple Effort gates for my kitchen and hall entryways to occasionally restrict my new 9 mo old dog from certain parts of the house Having a door on the gate has provided ease without having to climb over the gate and fear of falling It was simple to set up and being a pressure gate allows me to easily move it if I want to What a dream come true well worth the money And for fun the remote control door opener is in my living room to automatically open the gate to let the dog out of the kitchen pretty nifty 
4 0 They re good bottles but DO NOT BOIL THEM We searched the entire country for bottles that aren t made of polycarbonate PC plastic which contains bisphenol A a compound known to be estrogenic The only bottles in the US besides glass which isn t an option for us that aren t made of PC were these which are made of polypropylene PP They are good bottles and the nipples silicone work well for our son age 3 mos The only problem and the reason I gave it four stars is that the lid where you insert the nipple can warp if you boil it for sterilization and then there can be major leakage around where the nipple should seal This is a function of its being PP instead of the tougher PC plastic So soap and water on the lids You can boil the silicone nipples 
5 0 This works well We put this on our daughter s 2nd floor window in order to prevent her from climbing out and falling It works fabulously All you do is stick it to the window We tried another window stop that we bought at babiesrus and to this day we cannot figure out how to make it work 
5 0 As cute as can be This is just too cute for words We ve gotten so many compliments on how cute our nursery is 
4 0 baby aviator pillow Item was shipped quickly Quality was good Color was a bit diffent than appeared in picture but still ok Overall I was satisfied
